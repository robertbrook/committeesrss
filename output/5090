defaultOxo
default-bio bags have been created to address the problem of plastic waste which gets into the open environment and cannot realistically be collected.  Just imagine the hundreds of thousands of tons of plastic waste which have been swept into the sea by the recent hurricane in the Philippines.
defaultSome western countries do not seem to care about this, because they think that they can collect all the plastic waste for recycling, but in UK we can still see plastic waste in our hedgerows and on our beaches every day. In January 2014 there were massive floods 
defaultin the UK 
defaultwhich will have swept huge amounts of plastic waste down the rivers and out to sea to join the great ocean garbage patches, where they will subsist for decades, slowly fragmenting into pieces of plastic.
defaultIf all the plastic had been made with defaultoxodefault-bio technology, there would be no ocean garbage patches.defaultA conventional bag will not start to break up after six months as suggested by Mr. Baxter.  The case against plastic bags in the UK and elsewhere is that they lie or float around for decades – some campaigners say hundreds of years.
defaultIt seems that the UK Government now understands this, and that is why they are considering different treatment in their proposed law for biodegradable bags than for conventional bags.
defaultThe Minister understands that despite the reduction that the 5p charge is expected to cause there will still be a lot of bags in circulation.  He said to the Committee on 18th December that the government want to create a situation “so that where bags ARE used they are better by being biodegradable rather than simply single-use plastic bags.”
defaultA Life Cycle Analysis conducted by 
defaultIntertek
default for the UK Environment Agency in 2011
default showed that plastic shopping bags have better environmental credentials than paper, cotton or bio-based plastic.  A further LCA by 
defaultIntertek
default in 201
default showed that 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic has the best environmental credentials of all the materials studied. 
defaultWith regard to biodegradability, there are very many scientific studies reported in peer-reviewed journals, and we have provided a Bibliography.  The Committee was referred to the most recent – from the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.  A peer-reviewed report of the work was published in Vol. 96 of the journal of Polymer Degradation &amp; Stability (2011) at pages 919-928. Given that these results were obtained by a wholly inde
defaultpendent Government-
defaultaccredited Laboratory of the highest reputation, it was surprising that Prof. Thompson suggested that they had somehow “cooked” the test material to produce an artificial result.
default&#xa0;
defaultProf. Thompson admits that he is a biologist, not a polymer scientist, and he has clearly misunderstood the processes by which laboratory tests are carried out on 
defaultpolymer materials. They are prescribed by the British, American and International standards organisations, who would clearly not permit any laboratory practice which would produce an artificial result. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Swedish tests were performed using commercially sourced samples, 
defaultand 
defaultit is worth quoting from the conclusions.  “After two years in the soil mineralization experiment, 91% biodegradability was achieved without reaching a plateau phase” This result has two important implications. The most important one is that it is possible to create polyethylene based materials that will almost completely biodegrade in soil within two years. It also indicates that the risk of plastic fragments remaining in soil indefinitely is negligible.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn answer to Mr. Goldsmith’s point, the bag would of course be visible during whatever useful life the 
defaultUK 
defaultgovernment specified, but it would degrade and disappear leaving no harmful residues much more quickly than a conventional bag.  An 
defaultoxo
default bag has to pass the same EN13432 eco-toxicity tests as a bio-based bag.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is sometimes alleged by campaigners that fragments of plastic might contaminate food and the environment.  However, everything will fragment into the environment as it degrades, for example paper, textiles, conventional plastics, and bio-based plastics.  Do they want to ban them all, even if they are not toxic?
default&#xa0;
defaultAN IDEAL 
defaultGOVERNMENT 
defaultPOLICY
default&#xa0;
defaultAN IDEAL BAG 
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IDEAL bag would therefore have recycled content and 
defaultoxo
default additive.  Recycled content alone would not work, because the bag would not biodegrade if it gets into the open environment.
defaultThe IDEAL bag would probably be made abroad, as existing bags are, unless UK bag manufacturers can become competitive.
default&#xa0;
defaultCOMPOSTABILITY is a red herring in relation to plastic carrier bags for the following reasons:
defaultRECYCLING
defaultWe wish to support the recycling industry by our proposal that a bag should not qualify for the lower charge unless it is 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable AND contains 
default40% 
defaultrecyclate
default. 
defaultThe Committee has received a lot of evidence from people who have expertise in recycling, but are not experts in recycling 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics.  The witnesses who gave evidence:
default&#xa0;
defaultWe were aware of their views so an expert opinion was sought as to whether there was any foundation for them.  The Committee has received the expert evidence in the form of the 
defaultRoediger
default report of 2012, which said:
default“
defaultWe are therefore able to confirm that plastic products made with defaultoxodefault-biodegradable technology may be recycled without any significant detriment to the newly formed recycled product.defaultThe report was reviewed and revalidated as follows in December 2013 after studying the Austrian report prepared for 
defaultEuPC
default in November 2013.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe scientific evidence before the Committee is therefore that 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics can be recycled with ordinary plastics without any need for an expensive process of separation.
defaultBoth the 
defaultRoediger
default Report and the Austrian report make it clear that Mr. Newman is wrong when he suggests that traditional polyethylene can be recycled with compostable plastics, up to 10% of the volume of that polyethylene, without making any damage to polyethylene recycling.  The recyclers who gave evidence agree that he is wrong. Mr. Baxter said “if starch-based products get into our recycling machines they will stop. LDPE recycles at 200°C; starch is at 150°C. 
defaultMr. Baxter said “generally speaking you will only put film back into film.”   
defaultRoediger
default said “If the new product to be made from 
defaultrecyclate
default which contains a pro-
defaultdegradant
default formulation is intended for short-life uses such as garbage-sacks, bin-liners, shopping bags, bread wrappers etc. the effect of any pro-
defaultdegradant
default formulation is unlikely to manifest itself
default before the end of the intended service-life.  Biodegradability for such items is in any event desirable, because a proportion of them will find their way into the land or sea environments, where they could otherwise subsist for decades after being discarded.
default”
defaultMs. Baker said that “Many of the applications that reprocessed plastic goes into are long-life. They may be pipe tree guards, plank wood—you name it. Some of these products are meant to last for 30 years.  
defaultRoediger
default laboratories had considered Ms. Baker’s point, and they said:  
default“
defaultThick cross-section products for extrusion and injection mouldingdefaultIt is our opinion that up to 25% d2w-containing 
defaultrecyclate
default can be incorporated into extrusions or mouldings that have a thickness &gt;1 mm without having any detrimental effect on outdoor exposure.  The main reason for this is that the amount of active pro-
defaultdegradant
default is so small in concentration that the degradation mechanism would be at the same rate as
default defaultany recycled polyethylene without d2w.  In other words it is suitable to be used for items such as buckets, road cones, garden furniture, or any other thicker-walled article. 
defaultThey also reported that “
defaultSince polymers lose stabilisation each time they are reprocessed, it is good practice when making long-life products to add new stabilisers, whether the feedstock contains 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic or not. If suitably formulated, the stabilisers will also neutralise any pro-oxidant which may be present.
default”
defaultThe defaultRoedigerdefault report continued re Building Filmsdefault….default“If the new product to be made is a plastic film intended for long-term durability - such as a building film for damp-proofing or waterproofing, the presence of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable additive is irrelevant if the film is buried with no access to oxygen.  This is because the process of 
defaultoxo
default-degradation cannot proceed in the absence of oxygen.
defaultFurther, the specification in some countries for these films requires the use of a virgin polyolefin, and 
defaultrecyclate
default is not therefore used. For other building films the specification will usually require stabilisers. There will of course be no pro-
defaultdegradant
default formulation in 
defaultrecyclate
default made from conventional in-house scrap or scrap whose provenance is known. 
defaultIn the case of lower-grade building films, where no guarantee is given, these are often made from 
defaultrecyclate
default whose origin is not known, and the manufacturer should always add stabilisers, whether the feedstock contains a pro-
defaultdegradant
default formulation or not.”

default&#xa0;
defaultShopper bags are HDPE/chalk and printed 
default&#xa0;
default- highly unlikely to be used for DPM - only for new shopper bags or refuse sacks.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWith regard to bottles, the high-value recycling business is in bottles made from PET.  Carrier bags are not made from PET and there is no 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable additive for PET bottles.  
defaultWhen the facts and the evidence are examined, there is no justification for claims that the UK recycling industry will be damaged.  Indeed they will be supported by our proposal that t
defaulthe IDEAL bag would have both recycled content and 
defaultoxo
default additive.
default For several years Tesco supplied their customers with 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable bags, and all the bags collected for recycling were actually recycled in the UK without any problems.  That is a fact.
defaultOne of our members has undertaken to the government that if existing recyclers do not wish to take the 
defaultoxo
default-bio bags than they will take them for recycling.
default  However, 
defaultEuroPackaging
default, one of the largest plastic recyclers/manufacturers is quite happy to work with 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic – see TENDER below.
defaultEven if the recyclers who gave evidence were correct, it would be a simple matter, as Dr. Whitehead said, for the government to specify a particular colour for 
defaultoxo
default-bio bags, so that separation could be done.  The 
defaultoxo
default-bio waste plastic could be recycled, but there would be no purpose in separating the bio-based waste, as it cannot be made into compost (see above). As Ms. Baker said “you either keep the starch and throw away all the plastic, or you keep the plastic and throw away the starch. It is not economically viable and it is not practical.”
defaultOIL
default&#xa0;
defaultOil is extracted to make petrol, diesel and other fuels, and an inevitable by-product (naphtha) is used to make plastic.  The same amount of oil would therefore be extracted even if plastics did not exist, and it makes sense to use this by-product.
default&#xa0;
defaultTENDER
default&#xa0;
defaultDEFRA issued a tender in December 2013 for a publicly-funded Project on Biodegradable Plastic Carrier Bags.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe successful 
defaulttenderers
default were 
defaultAquapak
default Polymers and 
defaultAxion
default Consulting.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough these companies seem to have expertise in recycling, the tender was for a project on biodegradable plastic carrier bags, and they appear to have no expertise with biodegradable polymers.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIndeed, 
defaultAxion’s
default evidence to the Environment Select Committee is AGAINST an exemption for biodegradable bags.
default&#xa0;
defaultA Consortium consisting of 
defaultEuropackaging
default and Symphony Environmental and Nottingham University submitted a tender.
default&#xa0;
defaultEuro Packaging have an extensive expertise in blown film extrusion, with an annual capacity of circa 100,000 tonnes, and currently supply carriers into the UK’s major grocery retailers. They have experience of working with biodegrada
defaultble technologies.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThey have on-
defaultsite recycling capabilities, and a vast know-how of the implementation of recycled materials into flexible film products. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThey said in the tender " Through a partnership with Symphony Environmental Technologies, Euro Packaging intend to utilise the d2w additive as an environmentally responsible
default&#xa0;
defaultsolution for vest carrier manufacture. ...  
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable products have successfully overcome the commercial obstacle often associated
default&#xa0;
defaultwith added value films due to their additive based application, and their compatibility with
default&#xa0;
defaultpolyethylene has enabled carrier bag manufacture with uncompromised mechanical performance ... 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt has been demonstrated by independent LCA (
defaultIntertek
default Report May 2012 A Life Cycle Assessment of 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable, Compostable and Conventional Bags) that a high-density polyethylene carrier bag
default&#xa0;
defaultincorporating 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology is the most environmentally efficient method of
default&#xa0;
defaultmanufacture of a carrier bag.  The addition of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable
default&#xa0;
defaulttechnology enhances the overall environmental impact. .. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the end of its useful life the bag can be
default&#xa0;
defaultcollected and recycled along with conventional plastic packaging waste. However, if the bag escapes
default&#xa0;
defaultthis path and becomes litter- the 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology will allow a rapid and harmless 
defaultbioassimilation
default&#xa0;
defaultof the waste material.....”
default&#xa0;
defaultEuroPackaging
default continued 
default“In a landfill scenario the 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable bag will continue to degrade whilst oxygen is available. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOnce the anaerobic zone is reached the bag will cease degrading and become a carbon sink- preventing  the uncontrolled emission of methane (a greenhouse gas 23 times more harmful than CO2). ....
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable carrier bag does not interfere with the conventional recycling stream the
default&#xa0;
defaultcostly exercise of detection and separation is not required...
default&#xa0;
defaultSymphony’s d2w additive is an already proven technology, and critically, the technology

default&#xa0;
default“With existing UK manufacturing sites already established,
default&#xa0;
defaultEuro Packaging are perfectly positioned to develop a UK based dedicated flexible film extrusion and
default&#xa0;
defaultconversion facility in conjunction with this proposal....As the bio-based 
default&#xa0;
defaultmaterials are 3 times more costly than conventional and/or

defaultrecycled, 
defaultthey 
defaulthave a much poorer LCA score and cannot offer the same efficient functionality as modern

defaultwell developed plastic polymers- thei
defaultr use is highly unsatisfactory.”
default&#xa0;
defaultEuroPackaging’s

default&#xa0;
defaulttransport strategy enable them to distribute up to 1,300 pallets of products every day to customers in

defaultover 20 different countries. They also employ more than 1,000 professionals worldwide, 
defaultand 
defaultgenerate 
default&#xa0;
defaultrevenues exceeding £150 million. “
default&#xa0;
defaultThe combined expertise of 
defaultEuropackaging
default, Symphony and Nottingham University is exactly what is required for this project.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe OPA would like to know who DEFRA appointed as assessors for this tender.
default&#xa0;
default We would be concerned if they included some of the people well known to be prejudiced against 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics to whom DEFRA so
default&#xa0;
defaultoften
default&#xa0;
defaultturn for advice.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe may have to ask the courts to rule on this matter if a contract is awarded to 
defaultAquapak
default and 
defaultAxion
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultINTERNATIONAL
defaultThe government of the UAE realised that they would never be able to prevent some of the plastic waste getting into the environment on land or sea. So they carefully considered the effectiveness and safety of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology before passing legislation which makes it mandatory to use the technology.  They rejected the bio-based alternative as it did not address the litter problem and had many other disadvantages.
default&#xa0;
defaultNot just carrier bags, but all disposable plastic goods and packaging
default&#xa0;
defaultNine other countries have followed their example – the largest being Pakistan. These have a combined population of 195 millions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBritish factories and retailers cannot now export to those countries unless their disposable plastic products and packaging are made with 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology.
default&#xa0;
defaultITALY
defaultOPA members in Italy have provided the following comments on the evidence heard by the Committee on 8
defaultth
default January:
default&#xa0;
default“The idea that the law is valid and enforced is just wishful thinking.  The Italian companies concerned are pushing hard to have just the compostable bags allowed, but apparently the Italian Government is sick of being challenged by the EU Commission. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMr. Newman is right when he says that the plastic carrier bag market has dramatically dropped. He does not say however that the market for the black plastic garbage sacks has correspondingly increased, because Italians used to use the standard plastic carrier bag to collect the non-organic waste and clearly we can’t do that with the small brittle “compostable” bags.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Sardinia project: the Government owned and amply subsidized the company that is doing this huge investment in Sardinia.  The point is that nobody knows for sure if it is going to deliver, people from Sardinia included.  Italy is familiar with mumbo-jumbo giant projects that miserably fail (while in the process wasting a lot public money!)
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd finally the ridiculous statement that they have created thousands of jobs in Italy.  Actually the threat of legislation forced some of our existing plastic companies to close and moved a lot of business towards Asia.  This disastrous outcome is now very clear to our government who are now much more cautious to follow advice from the bio-based industry, because losing more jobs will be a real tragedy.”
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the view of the OPA, the Italian legislation is an attempt to give a special benefit to the bio-based plastics companies, and in particular a large Italian company whose plastic is made to comply with EN13432. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe European Commission sent on 24/10/2012 a formal notice to the Italian Republic in the framework of infringement procedure 2011/4030. The Commission considers that Italy is in breach not only Article 16 of Directive 94/62/EC and Article 8 of Directive 98/34/EC, but also Article 18 of Directive 94/62/EC.
default The EU Commission 
default(DG Environment) confirmed to the OPA on 11
defaultth
default December 2013 that 
defaultthe infringement procedure against Italy is still pending.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK and German Governments sent a Detailed Opinion to the EU Commission objecting to the proposed measure. The UK said
default that the Italian decree requires certain carrier bags to be biodegradable and meet a certain standard of biodegradability, effectively banning bags of other materials from the market.  As 
defaultsuch, the proposed legislation appears to be contrary to Article 18 of the Packaging Directive 94/62/EC, which provides that Member States shall not impede the placing on the market (in) their territory of packaging which satisfies the provisions of this Directive.  The Essential Requirements set in the Directive ensure that packaging meeting the requirements may be placed on the market in any member state.  Accordingly, plastic carrier bags which comply with the requirements for placing on the market as set out in Articles 9 and 11 and Annex II of the Packaging Directive may not be prohibited from being placed on the Italian market.
default              
defaultThe UK continued “As a consequence of this prohibition, Italian retailers would be required to purchase biodegradable plastic bags, with the domestic manufacturers more likely to benefit from increased sales of such bags than those in other Member States.  The prohibition would lead to cross-European retail chains having to produce specific bags for this market, losing economies of scale or being unable to supply this market.  Moreover the Italian agricultural industry would potentially benefit from the decree, as there would be increased demand for the plant-derived ingredients of the biodegradable bags.  This has the effect of discriminating in favour of domestic industry contrary to the EU Treaty. Furthermore, even if Art 18 of the Packaging Directive were amended, as proposed by the Commission in November 2013, the prohibition would still violate Articles 34 and 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.”
default              
default“The UK would also point out that the rationale provided in relation to the draft decree does not justify the imposition of the restrictions. Plastic packaging is already regulated under the Packaging Directive and accordingly the environment is protected to the extent required.”
default              
defaultGermany has objected on similar grounds.  They said “Measures such as the Italian Ruling must be suitable and necessary, as well as appropriate for attaining the objective pursued; they must not constitute a hidden barrier to trade nor result in random discrimination, and must meet the criteria of proportionality.”
default&#xa0;
defaultPlastic tested according to EN 13432 is designed to be taken to an industrial composting factory, of which there are very few, and to biodegrade in the special conditions found in the industrial composting process. Even if industrial composting facilities were available, most composters will not accept mixed waste plastics such as shopping bags because they do not want to separate compostable from non-compostable plastic.
defaultFurther and most important, it is misleading to describe this type of plastic as “compostable.” 
default When something is described as compostable an ordinary consumer would think that it can be converted into compost, but EN13432 requires it to convert into CO
default2 
defaultgas within 180 days. You cannot therefore make compost from it – only CO
default2
default gas.  This process contributes to climate change but does nothing for the soil.
