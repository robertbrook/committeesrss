"Written evidence submitted by Mrs Beryl Burton (FSS008)&#xa0;\n1) I am a member of\n \nthe public.\n \nMy knowledge of\n \nForensic Science provision is derived from what\n \nI have heard and read.\n&#xa0;\n2) I am concerned that Forensic Science is now wholly in the private sector.\n \nThis means that\n \ncompanies will have to make a profit otherwise they will close down.\n \nDue to being in a market\n \nenvironment,\n \ndecisions on tests required may be curtailed due to cost rather than whether or not a\n \nfurther test would provide more accuracy. In an interview on B.B.C. Radio 4, a member of\n \nthe\n \nForensic Science Service gave an example of her advice being over-ruled by a member of the\n \npolice. She felt that the police were taking cost into account.\n \nOf\n \ncourse, the police could say that the\n \nForensic Science Service wanted to do another test to make more money,\n \nan uncomfortable and\n \nunsatisfactory position for both.\n&#xa0;\nI am uneasy about the police being both test result provider and prosecuto\nr. I\n would be happier if\n \nindependent providers were doing the testing.\n&#xa0;\n3) If companies fail in the private sector,\n \nhow will provision of forensic science services continue?\n \nWill they have to be done in other countries which could result in a lack of transparency and control\n \nover standards.\n&#xa0;\n4) I understand that very few police forces are accredited at present.\n \nThis situation must be rectified\n \nas soon as possible and their standards monitored.\n \nThe police are losing ground in the public's\n \nestimation and miscarriages of\n \njustice will exacerbate that situation.\n&#xa0;\n5) The Forensic Science Service,\n \nsupported by the Govern\nment,\n has gone. I\nt may well have been top\n \nheavy and needed some streamlining and changes of\n \npractice such as working hours.\n \nHowever, it\n \nwas full of knowledge,\n \nexperience and expertise,\n \nand provided a safe,\n \nstable,\n \nimpartial and secure base\n \nfor the provision of material to put before the courts.\n&#xa0;\n6) The U.K. sees itself as a leading developed country and I see justice for the people as important\n \nas \neducation and a Health Service. I\n am not convinced that either the police or the private sector will\n \nbe able to provide it.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2013\n"
