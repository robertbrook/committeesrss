[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Society of Biology (RaD0008)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Society of Biology
[normal] welcomes the Committee’s attention to 
[normal]research and 
[normal]development
[normal] fund
[normal]ing for science and technology; a core sector that
[normal] underpins the UK’s economic stability through n
[normal]ovel products and job creation, and is pleased to have sight of the detailed analysis in the National Audit Office memorandum on this topic. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NAO
[normal] memorandum confirms
[normal] the value of R&amp;D carried out by UK business, where the life science
[normal]s play a major role and
[normal] biotechnolo
[normal]gy and pharmaceutical companies are 
[normal]the dominating sectors. 
[normal]The UK business R
[normal]&amp;
[normal]D spend, for which tax incentives are so import
[normal]ant, is bolstered by our particular strengths in 
[normal]life sciences, 
[normal]software, 
[normal]and 
[normal]advanced engineering research 
[normal]that
[normal] attract 
[normal]substantial
[normal] Foreign Direct Investment
[normal]. The UK’s talent and attractive research environment is strengthened 
[normal]by 
[normal]BIS
[normal]’s commitment
[normal] to improve the interface betwee
[normal]n Higher Education Institutions 
[normal]and businesses, and supportive statements by 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment that 
[normal]'investment in science is an investment in our future
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At both the 2010 and 2013 spending reviews
[normal], Government 
[normal]recognised the sustained excellence of the science sector with a 
[normal]flat
[normal] cash 
[normal]settlement for the resource budget. Although we welcomed the ring fence, 
[normal]we note that 
[normal]if the Government want
[normal]s a growth economy, it must support a sector that employs more than 
[normal]5.4m 
[normal]UK workers
[normal] and provides 
[normal]an impressive return on investment.
[normal] A
[normal]bove inflation growth in the science budget is 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]needed if the sciences are to deliver their full potential for improving the economy and wellbeing. It is essential that the virtual cuts
[normal] in the science budget are reversed if the research community is to deliver the full benefit the country needs.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK is currently the number one in Europe in terms of Foreign Direct Investment, but maintaining our i
[normal]nternational competitively is crucial, 
[normal]particularly
[normal] as the global economy changes 
[normal]and
[normal] BRIC 
[normal]nations advance. 
[normal] 
[normal]The NAO memorandum clearly shows that the UK is falling behind on
[normal] 
[normal]R&amp;D intensity at just 1.9%, way off the 3% target for 
[normal]the European Commission by 
[normal]2020.  
[normal]The UK’s failure to 
[normal]aim for
[normal] this target is concerning and contradictory to Government rhetoric on the importance of the UK science sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government Departments have a key role in funding research outside of public labs, and should be seen as an i
[normal]ntegral part of the UK’s research ecosystem.  This area of funding has been severely hit by recent cuts, creating concern about training, skills development and policy- relevant research across the sciences. These budgets should also be taken into consider
[normal]ation when investigating the resilience of the UK science sector. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Public Sector Research Establishments[bold] [bold](PSREs)[bold]Certain PRSEs carry out a range of vital services across the life sciences, and provide essential expertise for increasingly complex and 
[normal]relevant policy issues including human health, the agriculture sector and sustainable food provision, the green economy and national safety:
[normal]Future Inquiries[bold]There are several lines of inquiry that the Select Committee may like to consider which would be beneficial to the UK 
[normal]science R
[normal]&amp;
[normal]D sector. The Society of Biology suggests the following:
[normal] 
[normal]Recently Government has increased capital funding though specific infrastructure announcements such as  the £50m for a National Graphene Institute, inv
[normal]estment in scientifi
[normal]c facilities, including The Francis Crick Institute and Pharmavision,  and £150 million of capital investment in 2015-16 to fund health research infrastructure in the areas of dementia, genomics and imaging. Funding is also promised for the ‘Great Eight’ t
[normal]echnologies for which analysis has suggested Government should be promoting with further capital investment and technology support
[normal]. R&amp;D funding is welcome where it is needed and of most use, but does this shift toward directed funding conflict with the es
[normal]tablished Haldane Principle? The Chancellor stated in his 2013 Spending Review announcement: 
[normal]‘
[normal]Our philosophy is simple: trust people to make their own decisions and they will usually make better ones’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]What are the processes for deciding the allocation of 
[normal]capital funding? How should this best integrate with the Research Council’s remit and activities?
[normal]The pharmaceutical 
[normal]s
[normal]ector is a key driver for innovation in the UK, however o
[normal]ver recent years pharmaceutical R&amp;D within the UK has 
[normal]undergone a significant transformation. An ecosystem of collaborative research partners is emerging which encompasses small and large pharma, SMEs, academia, health charities and the NHS, with each contributing complementary skills and expertise. Job losse
[normal]s at UK sites for GSK, AstraZeneca and Pfizer in recent years 
[normal]cannot be ignored. What is the future for UK Pharma, and how can the Government ensure its continued success?
[normal]The BIS R&amp;D Scoreboards were 
[normal]discontinued in 2012 because of budgetary concerns. These scoreboards allowed for transparent, impartial and up to date evaluation of the level of R&amp;D activity in the UK, tracking of historical data trends and benchmarking of UK R&amp;D activity against other 
[normal]nations. Given global fiscal uncertainty, we argue that this type of analysis firms up policy decision making, and 
[normal]could help to inform and encourage 
[normal] investment in 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK by highlighting our strengths and allowing for closer inspection of where policies a
[normal]re, or are not working. How has the discontinuation affected the ability for Government and others to track policy and investment efficacy? Has this type of analysis been picked up elsewhere, and if so, 
[normal]to what budgetary costs?

[normal]The Society of Biology is a core mem
[normal]ber of the 
[normal]Drug Discovery Pathways Group
[normal], an informal partnership that seeks to address these issues by 
[normal]establishing a networked community of skilled researchers to help revitalise the UK pharmaceutical sector. The group
[normal] [bold]focusses on three main areas;
[normal] [bold]industry-academia
[normal] [bold]partnerships
[normal], [bold]knowledge
[normal] [bold]and
[normal] [bold]skills, with around
[normal] [bold]20 learned societies and professional bodies involved in specific activities and work streams.
