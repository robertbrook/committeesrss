[[[ Parish Council – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;

[[[Call for Evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill]]]&#xa0;This Parish Council has only recently become aware of the potential opportunity to reduce damage to the environment, improve the safety and enjoyment of walkers and horse-riders in the countryside and close loopholes in Rights of Way legislation by adding a small provision to this Bill.&#xa0;The Parish Council would like to support proposals being made by others to add provisions to the Bill to: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Parish Council believes that many other communities would support these proposals – but they are not currently widely known.&#xa0;Buriton Parish lies on the borders of Hampshire and West Sussex, inside the new South Downs National Park.&#xa0;In West Sussex, the category of BOATs was widely dispensed with many years ago.  But in Hampshire, including the parish of Buriton, this classification still exists – and off-road 4x4 vehicles now travel for many, many miles to use the BOATs in this and neighbouring parishes inside the National Park.&#xa0;These vehicles cause damage to ancient, sunken lanes, harming the cultural heritage and the environment of the area – and they make walking and horse-riding unattractive on some rights of way which should be vital links in the local network of paths.  &#xa0;The community’s comprehensive Parish Plan survey (which had a very high response rate of over half the households in the parish) identified concerns with BOATs as being amongst the highest concerns in the whole of the survey.  On the issue of safety on Rights of Way used by off-road vehicles, only 16% of respondents were not worried about this matter.  On the issue of damage to Rights of Way used by off-road vehicles only 13% were not worried.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The use by 4x4 vehicles is a huge deterrent to walkers and horse-riders.  The pathways are sunken into the landscape with steep sides on both sides and so, in many places, there is nowhere for people to get out of the way of vehicles.  The fear of meeting a convoy of vehicles slithering down the slope towards them discourages people from going out into the countryside.&#xa0;As well as danger (and perceived danger) to other path users, there is damage to the paths and to the environment.  The routes are badly rutted which can make walking very difficult at times and presents huge risks for horses – often rendering use of these routes by horses out of the question.  In places the surface has been eroded to the bedrock and so drainage is a problem.  &#xa0;Some occasional repairs to the deeply rutted surface have been made over the years but 4x4 vehicles just create all the damage again.  This is simply of waste of money.&#xa0;And the availability of these BOATs is thought to have been one of the attractions which may have enticed off-roaders to trespass onto nearby farmland in October 2010 – leading to the death of one of the people involved and a lengthy court trial.  Farmers often complain about unauthorised access like this – but the culprits are able to say that they have accidentally strayed from nearby BOATs.  Farmers are inevitably worried about thefts of stores and machinery.  &#xa0;This is a very real and growing problem.  Over the last few months there has been increased activity reported on routes in the parish involving noisy recreational use. Of particular note is at least one incident where one of the 4x4’s had a loudspeaker fitted so that the driver was able to ‘shout with excitement’ as his vehicle hit a bump or slipped and he was also heard encouraging his fellow drivers. The community feels strongly about this sort of noisy activity which is spoiling the quiet enjoyment of the South Downs National Park for others.&#xa0;Although these tracks are in private ownership, farm vehicles rarely use them – in fact, a few years ago, one of the main landowners in the parish chose to construct a parallel track inside their adjacent field because a BOAT had been made so impassable by recreational 4x4 vehicles.  &#xa0;The Parish Council has reported problems about BOATs in the parish for many years – with correspondence going back to 1987.  But the County Highways Authority has rarely taken any action other than to occasionally repair some of the damage done by off-road 4x4 vehicles.&#xa0;The Parish Council would like to see clauses in the Deregulation Bill to help communities address problems like those summarised above.&#xa0;We suspect that these proposals would have no real effect on bureaucracy or red tape – and they would sit squarely with the ‘Localism’ agenda.&#xa0;Not only would these proposals help to protect the cultural and natural environment and improve conditions for residents and visitors – but they would also remove the waste of public money which is spent each year on repairing (and then re-repairing) BOATs.&#xa0;We hope that this submission is helpful to you.&#xa0;Yours faithfully,&#xa0;&#xa0;Mrs Maggie Johnston&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
