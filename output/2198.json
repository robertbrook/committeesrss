"&#xa0;\nThe Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety \n(\nPACTS\n)\n \nis a registered charity and an Associate Parliamentary Group. Its charitable objective is “To protect human life through the promotion of transport safety for the public benefit”. Its aim is to advise and inform members of the House of Commons and of the H\nouse of Lords on air, rail and road safety issues. It brings together safety professionals and legislators to identify research-based solutions to transport safety problems having regard to cost, effectiveness, achievability and acceptability. \nPACTS belie\nves the issue of safety at level crossings to be important and \ntopical and \nwelcomes th\ne Committee’s \ninquiry\n. \nWith some \n7,500 to 8,000 \nlevel crossings\n in Great Britain, \nlevel crossings\n represent the largest single risk of catastrophic train \naccident\n on Brit\nain's rail network. In addition, \ndespite a generally good rail safety record, \nthere are around \nnine\n \npeople\n killed in\n level crossing accidents each year\n,\n mainly\n pedestrians and vehicle users\n. \nThe inquiry is also is important because s\nafety at level crossin\ngs is a complex matter and requires coordinated action from Network Rail, \nRSSB, \nORR, TOCs, the highway authorities, the local police, British Transport Police and other agencies. The law governing level crossings is \nseen as \noutdated and the Law Commission \nis considering reform.\n Scrutiny by the Committee may help to ensure that al\nl\n parties contribute and in a timely fashion. \nThis submission follows the questions listed in the Committee’s inquiry terms of reference\n \nAccident data suggest that\n,\n \nby international standards \nsafety\n,\n risk at level crossings is \nrelatively \nwell controlled in the UK. The R\nail \nS\nafety and \nS\ntandards \nB\noard (RSSB)\n reports\n that there were four pedest\nrian fatalities and five road vehicle occupant fatalities on \nGreat \nBritain’s mainline railway in 2012/13. There were ten collisions between trains and road vehicles, rather fewer than the 10-year average of 13.\n The European Railway Agency reports\n5\n that the\n UK has the \nlowest\n fatality risk at level crossings in the EU (19 deaths per billion train kilometres). The worst performing country in the EU had a fatality risk more than 28 times higher.\n The UK has a slightly lower density of level crossings than the EU\n average (41 crossing per 100 kilometres\n of track, compared to the EU average of 50)\n \nTable 1 presents aggregated data on level crossing fatalities and all road fatalities in the European Union.\n Level crossing fatalities account for \njust over\n 1% of all r\noad user fatalities in the EU. \nYearFatalities by type2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\nLevel crossing fatalities\n504\n380\n405\n359\n294\nAll other road fatalities\n42\n,\n000\n38\n,\n550\n34\n,\n400\n30\n,\n500\n30\n,\n200\nPercentage of level crossing fatalities \n1.2\n0.9\n1.2\n1.2\n1.0\nTable 1: Level crossing accident fatalities compared to all other types of road accidents in the EUIn Great Britain in 2012, level crossing fatalities accounted for around 0.5% of the 1,754 road accident fatalities. \nIn\n recent years, \nparticularly since 200\n7, \nroad accident fatalities have fallen sharply \nin\n Great Britain. This raises expectation\ns\n about \nimprovements in safety \nfor other modes.\nThe Office of Rail Regulation reports\n that Network Rail is on-target to meet its 25% re\nduction in level crossing risk \nbetween \n2009\n \nand 20\n14, as measured by its own model. Our understanding is that this has been achieved by a programme involving both level crossing closures and improved risk mitigation measures. ORR noted, however, that some of Network Rail’s level \ncrossing risk assessments were poor and did not identify the best risk controls.\nThough the contribution made by level crossings to overall pedestrian, cyclist\n, horse-rider \nand \nmotor\n vehicle user safety risk is very small, it is striking that media/public \ninterest in level crossing accidents is sometimes very much greater than in equivalent incidents not involving the railways.\nLevel crossings also present a risk to the safety of rail passengers and on-board rail staff, as the incident at Ufton Nervet in 20\n04 demonstrated\n: the train driver and\n five rail passengers died\n. \nDespite this, rail travel is around 500 times safer than cycling or walking, and 30 times safer than using a car, when measured in terms of fatalities per \nmillion \nkilometre\ns \ntravelled.\n It is \nimportant to consider relative safety levels across the transport modes and the overall cost-effectiveness of measures when deciding on safety investment\ns\n. \nIn PACTS’ view, \nthere is no room for complacency about safety \nat level crossings\n. New \nequipment\n, improved management techniques and \ninvestment make higher safety standards possible. And expectations of greater safety on the part of the public demand further improvements. The challenge for the railway is to deliver these \nat a\nn\n \nacceptable \nprice\n,\n both \nin terms of the capital costs involved and (often) reduced railway efficiency and convenience for road users. \n&#xa0;\nRep\nlacing level crossings with \nroad \nbridges/underpasses has economic benefits for both local communities and the railway, but the predominant benefit is on the non-railway side. \nUninterrupt\ned road-traffic flows and reduced delays are the principal benefits on\n the “road” side. Reduced maintenance \nand staff \ncosts and (marginally) increased railway capacity (by eliminating train-speed restrictions necessitated by level crossings) are the principal benefits to the railways. One of the challenges we face in improvi\nng level crossing safety is ensuring that those who benefit make an appropriate contribution to the costs of improvements. \nThe option of simply eliminating level crossings – particularly where there are already convenient alternative routes over/under the\n railway – is frequently cost-effective but can be controversial. An example was reported recently:\nThe Aristotle Lane footpath level crossing in Oxford has been the subject of a determined resistance to the closure of the level crossing on safety grounds.\n Despite an alternative route via a nearby over-bridge, closure of the crossing was not secured through the public inquiry into the upgrading of the Oxford-Bicester railway. Now, because Network Rail and Chiltern Railways (the principal beneficiary of the \nupgrade) continue to maintain that closure is necessary on safety grounds, one of those opposed to closure has submitted a planning application for an additional track across Aristotle Lane level crossing. This is to force the planners to face up to his po\nint of view that planning permission is required for the works proposed by Chiltern Railways and Network Rail.(Source: LXInfo.org 2 September 2013)\nDespite \nsuch\n challenges, Network Rail is reported\n to have closed 700 level crossings since 2009, with 11\n7 c\nrossings closed in 2012/13. \nPACTS believes that the established rights and reasonable needs of the public and business should be properly considered when closure of a level crossing is contemplated. Closure should not be seen \nas an easy option. On the whole, however, the procedures currently seem to make closure a difficult \nand protracted option and local authorities which \nwould\n \ntend\n to err on the side of safety with respect to roads, \nmay oppose closure of level crossings. \nLev\nel crossings vary in type and the risks associated with each location may also vary. As such, a variety of methods will be required to improve safety across the network. \nAnnex 1 details the various types of level crossing in use.\n \nSafety risk can be reduce\nd by “upgrading” the crossing type from, for example, an automatic open crossing to an automatic half-barrier crossing.\n \nBut “upgrading” is not necessarily cost-effective. \nIt\n can be expensive, and the expense disproportionate to the risk reduction achieved.\n Reducing the costs associated with upgrading by, for example, greater standardisation \nand improved project management, \nwould be helpful.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch suggests that at some locations there may be comparatively inexpensive measures\n which could improve level crossing safety. Its 2012 Annual Report\n \nidentified a range of local factors that might influence (i.e. have the potential to improve) the behaviour of crossing users. These include:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nlocal obstructions to the sighting of trains;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nenvironmental conditions such as traffic noise and visibility at night;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ngates left open at user-worked crossings;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nanxiety to cross the line to catch a train (station crossings);\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nvisibility of road traffic signals (e.g. impact of glare from sunlight); and\n•\n \n              \nthe audibility of train horns.\n&#xa0;\nKnowing the specific local conditions, circumstances and user\n behaviour\n can be important. In this respect the appointment by Network Rail of dedicated level crossing managers is a welcome development. \n&#xa0;\nNetwork Rail \ncontrols \na very large budget\n – almost £30bn for CP5\n. \nHowever, it\n is under considerable pressure from the Government, ORR and others to deliver the requirements of Rail\nway\n Investment \nPlan\n while also improving efficiency. \nSome \n£6\n7m \nhas \nbeen allocated \nsome for level \ncrossing\n safety.\n Within the context of the CP5 settleme\nnt, given the number of fatalities each year and the potential for catastrophic failure, PACTS feels this level of investment in level crossing safety is about right. \nThe mainline railway uses sophisticated models to understand the risks it manages and to\n prioritise risk reduction. \nWe would urge the Government to bear in mind the relative levels of risk across the modes in determining policy and investment levels. \nBecause most accidents at level crossings result from user behaviour (such as misjudgements, errors and wilful misuse) rather than technical or engineering failures, it is not self-evident that major expenditure on technical improvements will significantly\n reduce risk. \nGetting a better understandi\nng of the reasons for user \nbehaviour is essential. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch’s (RAIB’s) continuing investigations into level crossing accidents provide a good basis for action. RAIB’s Chief Inspector \nhas observed\n that the RAIB has “\nmade repeated recommendations concerning realistic and rigorous assessment of the risks at individual crossings; understanding the local and human factors that may influence the risk to the users, and the implementation of \nimprovements identified during risk assessments and inspections. Not all our recommendations require a long lead time or significant resource. I urge both Network Rail and RSSB, who are carrying out related research on crossings, to review the resources co\nmmitted to this work and wherever possible ensure that the individual elements of their programmes that will address these risks are completed at the very earliest opportunity.”\nThe \nRSSB\n has a significant research programme, funded by the Department for Tr\nansport, into these issues.\n \nResearch published in 2011 investigated the signs, signals, markings and other road design elements that best convey the information road users need when approaching public road level crossings. \nThe second phase of this research\n will be published in May 2014. \nCurrent research projects \ninclude one addressing the signage provided at private level crossings and another addressing the causes of pedestrian accidents at level crossings and potential solutions\n.\n \nWe believe it important \nthat this research is expedited and translated into practical action as soon as practicable.\nNetwork Rail is reported to be on course to deliver a 25% reduction level crossi\nng risk between 2009 and 2014.\n \nWe understand that the company is committed \nto achieving further risk reduction\ns\n \nafter 2014.\n \nIt is apparent that \nNetwork Rail\n has increased its management focus on this issue and has allocated increased resources accordingly\n. \nWith so many level crossings and the inherent risks asso\nciat\ned\n with\n many of them, the test will be whether Network Rail can sustain its focus and \neffective management. \nLevel crossing risk is not only a matter for Network Rail and the communities near le\nvel crossings on the national network. There are level crossings on heritage and light railways that require a similarly robust approach to risk management.\n&#xa0;\nWe have already drawn attention, in our response to question 1, to what the ORR’s annual health and safety report says about Network Rail’s management of level crossing risk. T\nhe report includes few details of the means by which the Regulator reached its views, and it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about either the extent or effectiveness of its regulatory actions.\nThe ORR’s policy in respect of level crossings is se\nt out in its Railway Safety Publication 7\n. The policy says that \nORR seeks to influence duty holders and others to reduce risk at Britain’s level crossings through means ranging from advice to formal enforcement action. ORR checks that preventive and \nprotective measures are implemented. The ORR says that risk control should, where practicable, be achieved through eliminating level crossings in favour of bridges, underpasses or diversions. Where elimination is not possible, ORR aims to ensure that duty \nholders reduce risk so far as is reasonably practicable\n. \nThe ORR acknowledges its role in providing clear advice and enforcing relevant legislation – including that which relates to level crossings. The ORR exercises the powers of the Secretary of State \nfor Transport in making level crossing orders under the Level Crossings Act 1983. \nThe ORR takes the view that it is neither effective nor efficient for rail companies \nalone \nto be responsible for managing safety at level crossings. \nIt\n say\ns\n that decisions a\nbout level crossings should involve rail companies, traffic authorities and other relevant organisations as early on as possible. Relevant authorities should recognise the wider benefits that safety improvements at level crossings (for example, replacing t\nhem with bridges) can bring about, particularly for road users. If wider benefits can be achieved, the appropriate funding bodies should agree on how the costs of making safety improvements will be met. \nThe ORR is also committed to helping people understa\nnd the importance of the safe use of level crossings. The guidance ‘Using Level Crossings Safely’ is available on ORR’s website. \nWe are unaware of any \nspecific \nrecent statement of Government policy in respect of level crossing\n safety. It is not mentioned,\n for example, in the March 2013 Command Paper “Reforming our Railways”. W\ne note that the Government’s high-level output specification (HLOS) for 2014-19 allocates £67m for level crossing improvements and closures\n.\n \nThough little in the context of overall Go\nvernment expenditure on railways, we believe it significant that \nlevel crossings have been singled out for investment.\nThis issue has been investigated jointly by the Law Commission and the S\ncottish Law Commission. \nThey published a\n consultation paper, containin\ng proposals for law reform, \nin July 2010.\nThe provisional proposals put forward in the consultation paper represented the Commissions’ initial view about how the law should be reformed\n.\n \nThe two\n Commission\ns\n then approved the instruction of Parliamentary Counsel to prepare a draft Bill and Regulations under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, to give effect to their proposals.\nAccording to the Law Commission’s website, Parliamentary\n Counsel have drafted a Bill and Regulations, and the Commissions are in the final stages of drafting a report which contains detailed recommendations, together with explanatory notes for the Bill and Regulations, an analysis of the consultation responses \nreceived and an economic impact assessment.\nOur expectation is that the Law Commissions’ report will recommend sweeping away\n and/or updating\n much, if not all, of the existing legislation governing level crossings. We hope that the revised legislative approach will encourage greater collaboration between rail and road authorities in managing level crossing risk. We are, though, concerned at the\n time that has elapsed since the Law Commissions’ consultation exercise, and trust that their final report will emerge very soon.\nNetwork Rail has done much to publicise the risks \nassociated with level crossings.\n \nIn addition to television advertisements, they have provided educational resources for use in both primary and secondary schools, and are currently running a campaign aimed at young people.\n \nWe understand that analysis of N\network Rail’s television campaigns showed that they were successful in increasing public awareness of the issue.\n \nAssessing the effectiveness of such campaigns\n is much harder.\n \nWe know of no clear evidence on the extent to which increased public awareness of\n a safety issue results in changed behaviour or improved safety.\n \nWe suggest that the Network Rail work with the road safety professionals in DfT, including the THINK! team, in local authorities, the emergency services and elsewhere, who have experience of\n road user safety campaigns. Many of the messages and techniques relevant to level crossing safety will be applicable to road safety. These other authorities must share the responsibility for level crossing safety, even if the expenditure comes from Networ\nk Rail. \nThe mechanisms by which Network Rail, and other railway operators, become aware of land-use changes in the vicinity of level crossings need to be robust. Planning authorities need to recognise circumstances where new developments might increase pe\ndestrian, cycle or road vehicle use of level crossings, and take steps to alert the railway companies involved. \n&#xa0;\nAnnex 1\nLevel crossings take many forms depending on whether they are on a public or private road, or for vehicle\n, horse\n and/\nor pedestrian use.
