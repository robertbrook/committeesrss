"&#xa0;\nAFS0103&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Marylebone Boys SchoolExecutive SummaryOur experience in the pre-opening phase, so far, has been that the process for establishing a free school allows a parent-led proposal, without a sponsor or teaching expertise, to attract the necessary support and expertise. \nThe heads of two highly regard\ned existing schools and their staff generously provided free advice and some at-cost services because they wanted children beyond their own establishments to get the benefit of their demonstrable experience and knowledge. Successful schools are likely to w\nant to see their best practice spread more widely and guiding a free school achieves this. The London Diocesan Board for Schools also provided advice and at-cost services, without asking for faith entrance criteria or intruding upon our policies or approac\nh. Our local authority was helpful in integrating our admissions process closely with their own. The New Schools Network demonstrated how much has already been learnt and converted into guidance which greatly helps proposers.Â  \n We found the Department eas\ny to work \nwith in\n the circumstances, though the timetable for setting up the school is demanding. The fact that the EFA takes all responsibility for negotiating sites, though necessary, can make it hard to reassure parents that a site will be found. We wou\nld recommend a form of assurance for proposer groups to be able to give out to parents, without jeopardising site negotiations. \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
