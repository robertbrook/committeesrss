[normal]PET INDUSTRY FEDERATION [bold]RESPONSE TO [bold]THE [bold]ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE INQUIRY [bold]IN[bold]TO [bold]KEEPING [bold]PRIMATES AS PETS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation is the new name for the Pet Care Trade Association. As a Federation it now combines five specialist trade associations under one umbrella group. Federation members are pet industry specialists and 
[normal]include groomers, pet boarders, pet retailers and manufacturers. We are the only organisation to represent all the different sectors of the pet industry
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation’s 
[normal]combined 
[normal]member
[normal]ship numbers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]around 1500 businesses, mostly small, medium
[normal]-sized enterprises ranging from pet retailers, dog groomers, kennels &amp; catteries, manufacturers, wholesalers and professional services, which included colleges, publishers, dog walkers and pet sitters.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]provides a quality assura
[normal]nce of businesses in the pet care sector: all members agree to adhere to our charters, representing best practice for the different sectors of the pet trade on joining the relevant association.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Pet Industry Federation is dedicated to promoting animal welfare within the pet industry and encouraging responsible pet ownership.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Indus
[normal]try
[normal] F
[normal]ederation recognises that p
[normal]rimates are intelligent animals that 
[normal]require specialist care in order to be properly cared for in captivity.  They are almost always social creatures (with a few species exceptions) and should not be kept alone.  Their particular husbandry demands and the need for significant amounts of menta
[normal]l and physical stimulation in captivity means the P
[normal]et Industry Federation is
[normal] not in favour of these animals being kept alone under normal circumstances and does not support the keeping of primates 
[normal]in a 
[normal]home environment
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation does 
[normal]ho
[normal]wever 
[normal]support the private ownership of primates housed in appropriate conditions with quality husbandry and behavioural enrichment regimes.   
[normal]Eg. 
[normal]Where animals are kept in large indoor/outdoor enclosures as mated pairs or groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Current Guidelines and L[bold]egislation [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation thinks that the 
[normal]DEFRA 
[normal]P
[normal]rimate 
[normal]C
[normal]ode of 
[normal]P
[normal]ractice, the
[normal] A
[normal]nimal 
[normal]W
[normal]elfare 
[normal]A
[normal]ct and D
[normal]angerous 
[normal]W
[normal]ild 
[normal]A
[normal]nimal Act
[normal] combined 
[normal]are more than sufficient to assure the welfare of animals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However it may be worth considering that for 
[normal]such a ‘demanding’ animal type it may be that licencing (outside of DWA)or a system of registering with the Local Authority  may be a potential option.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If licensing is an option then consideration must be paid to those carrying out the inspection process 
[normal]and that inspectors must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the 
[normal]species in quest
[normal]ion and that local authorities 
[normal]should have sufficient resources for adequate  enforcement
[normal],
[normal] as we understand that 
[normal] compliance
[normal] under the DWA 
[normal] is
[normal] low 
[normal]1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation believes the Government needs to remain aware of existing legislation and the practicalities of enforcement.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Implementing a Ban[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Animal Welfare 
[normal]Act
[normal] place
[normal]d
[normal] a duty of care on all animal owners.  
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation 
[normal]believe
[normal]s
[normal] this is legislative protection for many different types of animal, and that specific exclusions on the ownership of 
[normal]P
[normal]rimates would be disproportionate and 
[normal]unreasonable
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There
[normal] would need to be an extremely strong argume
[normal]nt on public safety or welfare grounds for 
[normal]the Pet Industry Federation
[normal] to take the position of supporting a 
[normal]total 
[normal]ban.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion the Pet Industry Federation understands 
[normal]that
[normal] Primates require specific care to satisfy their needs in captivity. This however is not inherently different from requirement levels set out for other animals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pet Industry Federation 
[normal] would not support an outright ban on the keeping of
[normal] P
[normal]rimates in c
[normal]aptivity where their welfare needs can be met but would 
[normal]support 
[normal] restrictions on keeping Primates as pets , where 
[normal]a pet 
[normal] is defined as an individual animal or animals kept with
[normal]in a
[normal]  household
[normal] situation
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On animal welfare grounds
[normal],
[normal] the Pet Ethics Group st
[normal]rongly advises its Pet Industry Federation members against selling any companion or pet primate to members of the general public and largely endorse the RSPCA
[normal]’s statement on keeping primates as pets
[normal].
