defaultThe Pet Industry Federation is the new name for the Pet Care Trade Association. As a Federation it now combines five specialist trade associations under one umbrella group. Federation members are pet industry specialists and 
defaultinclude groomers, pet boarders, pet retailers and manufacturers. We are the only organisation to represent all the different sectors of the pet industry
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Pet Industry Federation’s 
defaultcombined 
defaultmember
defaultship numbers
default&#xa0;
defaultaround 1500 businesses, mostly small, medium
default-sized enterprises ranging from pet retailers, dog groomers, kennels &amp; catteries, manufacturers, wholesalers and professional services, which included colleges, publishers, dog walkers and pet sitters.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Pet Industry Federation
default&#xa0;
defaultprovides a quality assura
defaultnce of businesses in the pet care sector: all members agree to adhere to our charters, representing best practice for the different sectors of the pet trade on joining the relevant association.
default&#xa0;defaultThe Pet Industry Federation is dedicated to promoting animal welfare within the pet industry and encouraging responsible pet ownership.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Pet Indus
defaulttry
default F
defaultederation recognises that p
defaultrimates are intelligent animals that 
defaultrequire specialist care in order to be properly cared for in captivity.  They are almost always social creatures (with a few species exceptions) and should not be kept alone.  Their particular husbandry demands and the need for significant amounts of menta
defaultl and physical stimulation in captivity means the P
defaultet Industry Federation is
default not in favour of these animals being kept alone under normal circumstances and does not support the keeping of primates 
defaultin a 
defaulthome environment
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Pet Industry Federation does 
defaultho
defaultwever 
defaultsupport the private ownership of primates housed in appropriate conditions with quality husbandry and behavioural enrichment regimes.   
defaultEg. 
defaultWhere animals are kept in large indoor/outdoor enclosures as mated pairs or groups.

default&#xa0;
defaultHowever it may be worth considering that for 
defaultsuch a ‘demanding’ animal type it may be that licencing (outside of DWA)or a system of registering with the Local Authority  may be a potential option.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf licensing is an option then consideration must be paid to those carrying out the inspection process 
defaultand that inspectors must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the 
defaultspecies in quest
defaultion and that local authorities 
defaultshould have sufficient resources for adequate  enforcement
default,
default as we understand that 
default compliance

default is

default&#xa0;
defaultThe Pet Industry Federation believes the Government needs to remain aware of existing legislation and the practicalities of enforcement.

default place
defaultd
default a duty of care on all animal owners.  
defaultThe Pet Industry Federation 
defaultbelieve
defaults
default this is legislative protection for many different types of animal, and that specific exclusions on the ownership of 
defaultP
defaultrimates would be disproportionate and 
defaultunreasonable
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere
default would need to be an extremely strong argume
defaultnt on public safety or welfare grounds for 
defaultthe Pet Industry Federation
default to take the position of supporting a 
defaulttotal 
defaultban.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
defaultIn conclusion the Pet Industry Federation understands 
defaultthat
default Primates require specific care to satisfy their needs in captivity. This however is not inherently different from requirement levels set out for other animals.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Pet Industry Federation 
default would not support an outright ban on the keeping of
default P
defaultrimates in c
defaultaptivity where their welfare needs can be met but would 
defaultsupport 
default restrictions on keeping Primates as pets , where 
defaulta pet 
default is defined as an individual animal or animals kept with
defaultin a
default  household
default situation
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultOn animal welfare grounds
default,
default the Pet Ethics Group st
defaultrongly advises its Pet Industry Federation members against selling any companion or pet primate to members of the general public and largely endorse the RSPCA
default’s statement on keeping primates as pets
default.
