defaultWritten evidence from Eddie Gerrard (TIC 076)
defaultThe purpose of this short report is to bring to the attention of the Transport Committee the real difficulties that are being experienced in the Broadwindsor
default group of parishes, the possible solutions and the consequences if there are no solutions taken up.
defaultMy name is Eddie Gerrard, This year I stood in the County Council Elections, in the Beaminster area. In doing so I visited over 1,300 homes, gaining a great
default deal of information and many ideas. My specific comments relate to Drimpton and Greenham, with further general comments about the Beaminster area, in West Dorset.  It consists of a collection of villages, hamlets, and farms, lying on the borders of Somers
defaultet and Devon, roughly bounded by the rivers Synderford and Axe. Its landscape is one which all would recognise as quintessentially traditional England.  A patchwork of hedgerows, fields, lanes, villages and farms, deep valleys and rounded hills, with a dis
defaulttant view of the sea from its highest places.  The parish is within close reach of the historic market towns of Beaminster, Bridport, and Crewkerne.  In 2012, the time the Parish Plan was produced there were just over 1,300 residents.  At the time of writi
defaultng the report there were about 30 children below the age of 4 and 30 men and women over the age of 90 years. The Broadwindsor Parishes are made up of Broadwindsor which includes Drimpton, and Burstock which includes blackdown and Seaborough. 
defaultOne of the ma
defaultjor issues that people raised on the doorsteps was public transport or to be more precise the lack of it.
defaultWhat we have at presentdefaultBuses     No 47  Bridport – Yeovil.
default               No 40 Broadwindsor – Bridport
default               No 42 Drimpton – Bridport
default    
default           No. 204 Thorncombe – Yeovil
defaultTrain service  Exeter - London
defaultThe No. 47.default    There are four buses a day, finishing service at 15.45.  The route includes Broadwindsor. It does not include Drimpton and Greenham. The distance is just 2 miles from Broa
defaultdwindor to Drimpton.
defaultThe No. 40.default    There are 12 buses a day, finishing at 18.08. The route does not include Drimpton or Greenham. 
defaultThe No 42.default    Drimpton – Bridport There are two buses on Wednesday and 2 buses on Saturday. 
defaultThe No 204.default   This bus runs eac
defaulth day departing Drimpton about 10.30  and returning approx. 15.00.
defaultThe train servicedefault from Crewkerne is scheduled on an hourly basis.
defaultThe buses that serve the area are provided by Damory and Stage coach. The train which 
defaultruns from Exeter to London is also pr
defaultovided by Stage coach.  
defaultI have been campaigning now for more than 6 months to get back the 
defaultNo. 99    Chard – Merriottdefault calling at Drimpton and Greenham.  This bus was prevented from coming into Greenham and Drimpton but still exists as a bus service servin
defaultg Chard and Merriott. There are 12 buses a day the last service runs at 19.40 
defaultInformation from the Parish Plan states that:
defaultJust over 40% of households in the Broadwindsor Parishes have at least one person who would like to use public transport. One of th
defaulte big issues in my campaign was to get the bus reinstated for Greenham and Drimpton residents. (1)  
defaultCommunications to try and get the 99 bus service to return to Greenham and Drimpton. defaultLetter dated 2
defaultnd
default January 2013
defaultMr Williams set out his reasons why the
default No. 99 bus service was withdrawn. He states “The Chard to Yeovil route does not carry enough passengers to be self- sustaining.”  He goes on to say that Somerset County Council, “decided not to divert the service into Drimpton because Drimpton is within D
defaultorset, and therefore the responsibility of Dorset County Council to cover.” (2)
defaultThe implications of this letter suggest the following:
defaultA. The bus company have decided it is not economic to run the service through Greenham and Drimpton. One lady told me tha
defaultt a bus driver that works for the company told her that it was not getting enough people using it. 
defaultB. The Somerset County Council do not feel obliged to offer a service which goes into Dorset.
defaultPoint A does not make sense.  The bus stops short of the villa
defaultge and travels along the road that links Lyme Regis with Crewkerne. There are 3 farms and 4 houses along the two mile stretch. If the bus was to come into Drimpton it would still travel 2 miles before linking up with Clapton as it does now. The difference 
defaultis some 200 dwellings.  There are a substantial minority of citizens in Drimpton and Greenham who are over the age of 70 years. Many of them need to visit their doctor in Crewkerne. To do so, if they do not drive a car, they have to pay a taxi company to t
defaultake them at a cost. 
defaultLetter dated 28
defaultth
default March 2013
defaultIn response to my letter, accompanied by a photograph of a number of residents who relied on the service, Mr Williams made two points. (4)
defaultA. Overcome the political difficulty of Somerset Tax payers fundin
defaultg a service for Dorset residents”.
defaultB. Persuade Somerset and Dorset County Councils to provide funds …..”
defaultThe implications
defaultI sought to use the freedom of information act to ascertain if indeed Dorset had ever paid for the service to enter the Dorset area. The answer was no. 
defaultI have been in constant communication with an officer working for the Somerset County Council. More det
defaultails to follow. 
defaultEmail dated 4
defaultth
default April 2013
defaultI wrote to a Mrs Nicholson at Somerset County Council explaining how difficult it was to get the bus company and the two councils to get together to discuss putting the service back on in Drimpton. She passed my 
defaultcomments onto the Transport Department. (5)
defaultEmail undated
defaultMr J Perrett responded from the Transport Department. He commented with the following statements: “The reason the service was unable to serve Drimpton is due to the increased size of the vehicles on
default service 99….” Mr Perrett also stated,” Dorset Council has never provided any funding for the 90 or current 99 bus service. (6)
defaultThe implications
defaultI went onto Google Earth and got a photo-shot of the corner that the bus has to negotiate. I sent it to Mr Perr
defaultett inviting him to come to Drimpton. I pointed out that there is sufficient space for the bus to turn comfortably. In fact in the Parish Plan there is a photograph of the very bus that is not able to get around the corner. The bus is just leaving Drimpton
default. This was taken before the bus was axed. This does seem to be a sticking point between the two councils. However when I spoke with elected councillors I was told that there is an official line and an unofficial line. It was even suggested at one time Dors
defaultet County Council believed Drimpton to be in Somerset and therefore not the responsibility of the Dorset County Council.
defaultEamail undated
defaultA final email from Mr Perrett made it clear that the council were looking for two things to happen.
defaultHe states “If the cu
defaultrrent 99 vehicles could be operated through Drimpton (presumably enabled by some highway works?)”  He also said, “provided this diversion could be accommodated within the timetable as we would want to maintain an hourly daytime service then we would be hap
defaultpy to reconsider.” (7)
defaultAt this point I realized I was being given the run-around. No one person was ever going to say you cannot have the service back again. However they were intent on throwing up one problem after the other. 
defaultThe first statement in regar
defaultds to the need for highway works could be resolved by a Council representative attending Drimpton to confirm my findings as shown on the Google Earth photo-shot. The second point goes back to what I keep on saying. If the bus was to return to the village i
defaultt would be travelling exactly the same number of miles as it does now, without entering the village. (2 miles)
defaultThe train
defaultThis is a hearsay account provided by one of the persons working at Crewkerne
default station. It was stated that stage-coach have told the staff that if they do not have at least requests for 12 tickets a day they will lose their jobs.  The building will be closed and all passengers will not be able to make use of the waiting room nor wil
defaultl they be able to raise any questions as to why, when or how the trains are functioning. The company are encouraging the staff to get as many people as possible to either use the ticket machine at the door or go on line. They are doing so without letting t
defaulthe general public know what the ultimate plan is. 
defaultThe service is every hour from Exeter to London. 
defaultShort term solutionsdefault1.  Extend the services of the Nos. 40, 42 and 47 to take in Drimpton.  It is a very practical solution as the distance from Broadwinddefaultsor to Drimpton is just 2 miles.default (8)
defaultNo. 40 instead of starting and finishing at Broadwindsor. It could start at Drimpton. This would add some three or four minutes to the journey time.
defaultNo. 42  A daily service could be provided
defaultNo. 47. The bus could be dir
defaultected to come to Drimpton.  This would involve the bus being redirected to go through Little Windsor and on to Mosterton where it goes at present. This would add some ten minutes onto the bus journey. 
defaultNo. 99. Bring the service back into Greenham and Drimp
defaultton.
defaultThe residents of the area were very forthcoming in their thoughts about what should be done. (9)
defaultLong term proposaldefaultA plan which brings a bus from Yeovil to all the various villages, arriving in Bridport. It would take a circular route so that it coul
defaultd take in as many of the villages as is practicable. The bus would be planned to run every hour. It would be linked to Yeovil, Crewkerne and Axminster Rail stations. (10)
defaultThe consequences of not implementing the short and long term plan. defaultWhen visiting peo
defaultple in the villages of Drimpton, Greenham and Stoke Abbott, I was informed as to why it is that people are looking to sell their properties. 
defaultThe suggestions given are:
default1. No shopping facilities
default2. No public transport
default3. Cost of purchasing houses
defaultOne of the villages has more than 50% of the homes either classed as second homes or to-let. When houses are sold in Drimpton and the surrounding villages they are often bought by those who believe it is rather nice to have a second home in the Dorset Coun
defaulttry-side near to the sea. They can come during the holiday season, leaving the properties empty for most of the year. Those properties that are rented often have people who work in the area and return home at week-ends.
defaultThe Government needs to have a plan 
defaultto stop the rural villages from dying. Public Transport is the lifeline. People in Drimpton either go to Crewkerne or to Bridport to shop. Crewkerne is 3.5 miles away and Bridport is 10 miles away. Broadwindsor has managed to open a very small venture sell
defaulting basic foods in the last couple of months.

default 
defaultI just wanted to send a footnote to the short report that I sent about Drimpton
default in Dorset.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultSince the report has been written the buses that did run in Drimpton have been reduced to one bus only and that goes from Drimpton to 
defaultBridport on a Wednesday only. The Purchase of advance rail tickets from the station office have been increased by 11% to encourage people to use the internet. I imagine the same rule still applies, that is if the station office sells less than 12 tickets a
default day it will be closed.
