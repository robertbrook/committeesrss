[[[Written evidence submitted by Anthony Nolan (BTO0013)]]]&#xa0;2.1. Anthony Nolan is a pioneering charity. Our primary purpose is to save the lives of people with blood cancer who need a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). We recruit to and manage a register of potential haematopoietic stem cell donors, operate an umbilical cord blood donation programme and conduct research into HSCTs.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2. Anthony Nolan is the largest UK supplier of cells for allogeneic HSCT. Clinicians that have identified patients in need of allogeneic HSCTs contact Anthony Nolan. We then search the aligned registry of both our own and NHS Blood and Transplant’s registered donors and umbilical cord blood banks, and international registries and umbilical cord blood banks, in order to find a matching donor or cord from which we can provide HSCs for transplant. Overseas-based registries are also able to search the Anthony Nolan register, and we export stem cells for transplant in other countries should their registries find a suitable match from the Anthony Nolan register. &#xa0;2.3. Anthony Nolan is licensed by the Human Tissue Authority and regulated by the Care Quality Commission in the UK. We are also accredited by the UK Clinical Pathology Association, the World Marrow Donor Association and the European Federation for Immunogenetics. Our Umbilical Cord Blood Bank is FACTNetCord accredited. 3.1. Once a donor is selected for a patient who needs a life-saving transplant, Anthony Nolan will make arrangements for donation to take place. For 90% of adult unrelated donors, we collect stem cells from peripheral blood using apheresis. The remaining 10% donate from bone marrow, in procedure conducted under general anaesthetic. The donated cells are then sent to the relevant transplant centre and transfused to the patient. &#xa0;3.2. Umbilical cord blood is collected after a mother has delivered the placenta, and the cord blood unit is stored in a cryo-bank. If an umbilical cord blood unit is chosen as the stem cell source for a patient, the unit is simply shipped to the transplant centre and transfused to the patient. &#xa0;3.3. Should a donor be infected with vCJD, an allogeneic HSCT could result in the disease being transferred to the recipient patient. &#xa0;&#xa0;4.1. We refer the Committee to the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs’ (SABTO) guidance on measures to reduce the potential risk of vCJD infection from blood. Providers of blood products adhere to these practices to reduce vCJD risk. SABTO has worked with all relevant UK authorities to ensure policy and guidance in this area is evidence-based. Stem cells, however, are a blood derivative product. No further processing after they have been extracted from peripheral blood can take place to further reduce the risk of vCJD transmission.  &#xa0;4.2. The Anthony Nolan Register does not accept potential donors who have ever been diagnosed with CJD, or vCJD. This measure is intended to mitigate the risk of transferal of vCJD within HSCT. Applicant donors who are also consistently turned down are those with a strong family history of vCJD or who have received pituitary-derived products or a dural/scleral graft in the past. In the absence of a screening process for vCJD, these measures function to mitigate risk of vCJD infection from stem cell transplant. &#xa0;4.3 However, we understand that this inquiry is interested in the safety of UK-donated blood, organs and tissues in light of evidence submitted to the Committee that vCJD may be more prevalent in the population than diagnosis statistics would indicate. We understand the evidence submitted to suggest this is the case due to the possibility that people may be genetic ‘carriers’ of vCJD, and that vCJD has a significantly long gestation period that those infected may not present symptoms within their natural life.  &#xa0;4.4. Given that the stem cells Anthony Nolan supplies to the NHS are used exclusively for HSCT, we will limit our substantive response to this area. &#xa0;4.5. The issue of use of UK-donated stem cells in HSCT must be considered in terms of the benefit to patients of the treatment.&#xa0;4.6. While a potentially curative treatment, HSCT currently has a mortality rate of around 50%, and many of those surviving the treatment experience significant long term effects that impact upon their quality of life. It is a procedure which is only performed on patients who would otherwise die as a result of their blood cancer or haematological disorder. &#xa0;4.7. In the case of vCJD, the risk of transmitting the disease via HSCT, and in turn the patient then presenting with symptoms, remains relatively low, given mitigation measures. Therefore, in balance, the current evidence of risk of transmission of vCJD from a donor who has not been diagnosed with or have a family history of the disease does not outweigh the benefit of HSCT for a patient with a rapidly progressive, otherwise terminal, blood cancer or blood disorder.&#xa0;4.8. For example, in the USA, while the Food and Drug Administration upholds a vCJD-related prohibition on imported blood products from the UK, clinicians in many cases still use UK-donated stem cells for transplant for patients with blood cancers and other blood disorders. USA-based clinicians make this decision on the basis of a risk analysis. In the case where no other matching donor is available, or the UK donor provides the best possible genetic match (and therefore chance of survival), it is deemed appropriate to use a UK donor. This is because the alternative is that the patient does not receive treatment and does not survive their disease. 5.1. We would welcome any advances in relation to the development of a viable screening process for vCJD and should such facility become available we envisage it would be used for screening stem cell donors.  &#xa0;5.2. However, until such a screening facility exists, we do not believe there needs to be any amendment to the UK’s current position on the risk assessment of HSCT in relation to vCJD, given the benefits of that treatment for patients. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1. Any regulation or policy in relation to the safety of blood, organs and tissues must take account of the benefit of the treatment for patients in comparison to the risk level. It is therefore imperative that the safety of blood, organs and tissues is considered in the context of the treatment they provide and the prognosis for the disease treated. In the case of HSCT, any failure of policy to do this could lead to a reduction in the availability of a life-saving treatment. It may also create significant and unnecessary damage to the UK’s reputation as both a world leader in HSCT, and as a leading supplier of stem cells for transplant across the world. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268288/vCJD_risk_reduction_measures_summary_Dec_2013_v1.1.pdf
