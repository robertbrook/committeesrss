[[[Summary ]]]1. Our memorandum responds to the third of the questions on which the Committee invited views from outside observers: What more needs to be done? In doing so, it takes as a starting point the ‘clear vision of the future’ in Chapter 8 of the Committee’s report on Select committee effectiveness, resources and powers of 8 November 2012 (Second Report of Session 2012–13, HC 697), which stated : Our aim is that committees should be respected, listened to and feared by departments and ministers for the quality of their investigations, the rigour of their questioning, the depth of their analysis, and the value of their reports…Their ability to do their job will not be limited by constraints on access to information or the witnesses they wish to hear from, and they will be able to draw on expert advice and research. (Para 136)2. We believe that these objectives also need to take into account the government’s commitment to ‘open policy making’, as stated in its Civil Service Reform Plan (June 2012), which advocates a greater contribution to policy development from sources of expertise outside Whitehall departments.3. Select committees increasingly need to identify, question and analyse these external sources of expertise as an integral part of their scrutiny of ministerial and official performance. 4. Select committees should see it as their own responsibility to pursue this more thorough ’evidence trail’ (somewhat like an audit trail for financial accountability). Committee members and their advisers need to enhance their knowledge and skills in order to evaluate and comment wisely on the ‘evidence trail’. &#xa0;

[[[About the authors]]]5. Dr Ruth Levitt and William Solesbury study the uses and effectiveness of the policy expertise that ministers and departments seek from sources outside Whitehall for policy development. Their earlier work includes research on the contribution of outsiders brought into government departments as direct appointees to the Senior Civil Service, as non-executive board members and as members of policy units. In 2012 their research on policy tsars revealed the growth in the scale and scope of such public appointments over the last four administrations. Their new research, Advising Ministers, will evaluate the effectiveness and impact of an even broader range of ways in which expert advice is brought to bear on policy.

[[[Open policy making]]]6. The government’s Civil Service Reform Plan (June 2012) favoured what it termed ‘open policymaking’ and promoted greater outsourcing of policy advice as a step towards that:Whitehall has a virtual monopoly on policy development, which means that policy is often drawn up on the basis of too narrow a range of inputs and is not subject to external challenge prior to announcement….the need to maintain a safe space for policy advice should not be used to prevent the maximum possible openness to new thinking or in the gathering of evidence and insight from external experts.The Prime Minister, appearing before the House of Commons Liaison Committee on 3 July 2012, expressed this from a ministerial perspective:We should also recognise that the civil service does not have a monopoly on policy wisdom, so we have what we call policy contestability. On some occasions, we should go outside the civil service and say, ‘Here’s a particular challenge’ – for example setting up the green investment bank – ‘Can you help us O think-tank or O academic body, in developing this policy?’&#xa0;

[[[Sources of external expertise]]]6. In advocating the opening up of policy making, the government has given no comprehensive statement of what it considers to be the appropriate sources of outside expertise. Of course some sources have already long been in use, such as advisory committees, researchers, respondents to consultations. Others are relative newcomers, such as think tanks or policy tsars. Yet others, once much more frequently used, have fallen out of favour, notably Royal Commissions. 7. Some external sources are commissioned on the initiative of ministers or departments to provide evidence or advice; others provide one or both on their own initiative in the hope that they will be heard. This is reflected in the following list of sources of external expertise:&#xa0;A. Minister or department initiates&#xa0;B. External source initiatesWith ‘open policy making’ the evidential basis of policy that a select committee might wish to explore may well be drawn from more than one of these sources.&#xa0;8. The utility of all these sources should be evaluated in terms of:and, not least important, &#xa0;

[[[Select committee practice]]]9. Select committees have sometimes recognised external contributions to policy development in their area. Recently, for example:10. These exemplify a common tendency to examine such contributions to policy in isolation, possibly prompted by newsworthy developments.   But  external sources of evidence and advice increasingly deserve attention in the more strategic, forward looking scrutiny of department performance that the earlier Liaison Committee’s Second Report recommended (in Chapter 4). This could either be in committee inquiries on a policy or in their reviews of departmental Annual Reports. 11. Select committees should see it as their own responsibility to pursue this more thorough ’evidence trail’ (somewhat like an audit trail for financial accountability). Of course the term ‘evidence trail’ should not be taken as suggesting a simple, linear relationship between evidence and policy. It is well established that evidence and policy interact and influence each other in both directions and over time.12. Committee members and their advisers need to develop their skills to adopt a more ‘forensic’ approach in order to identify and question the evidential basis of departments’ policies and policy intentions, from whatever source. Committees’ research funding may perhaps be used to this end.&#xa0;15 November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence-informed policy: what difference do outsiders in Whitehall make?
