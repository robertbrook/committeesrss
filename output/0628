[normal]Written evidence submitted b[bold]y David Holland MIET [bold](CLC015)[bold]    [bold]The questions that the Committee has posed reflect this ill-founded train of thought.
[normal]“[The] United Kingdom welcomes this initiative as an important step towards international consensus.   The United Kingdom government has long expressed its concern about the increase in greenhouse gases. We are committed to action based on sound scientific evidence but the UK believes some action is already justified.  ..  ”

[normal]“We had some apocalyptic prophecies concerning the planet Earth, due to the global warming.  ..  ..  But, before we cry “Wolf, wolf”, we should have some scientific basis for the cry. Carbon dioxide increased considerably during the last thirty years but our comparison of 1920-50 normals with those of 1950-80 show some cooling and increase of precipitation, which is not in accordance with the global predictions for sub-tropical regions.”
[normal]“the need for strong, interactive peer review, as part of the working group process”.
[normal] 
[normal]“all parts of the assessment process need to be completely open and transparent. IPCC documents including early drafts and review comments have been freely and widely available - adding much to the credibility of the process and its conclusions.”
[normal]Whatever we do is very transparent.   Every stage of the drafting of our report is peer reviewed, and whatever comments we get from the peer review process are posted on the website of the IPCC, and the reasons why we accept or reject those comments are clearly specified.   Where we accept a comment we say, "Yes. Accepted."   Where we don't, we have to adduce very clear reasons why the authors don't agree with the comment.   So it's a very transparent process. 
[normal]“Regarding the Hockey Stick of IPCC 2001 evidence now indicates, in my view, that an IPCC Lead Author working with a small cohort of scientists, misrepresented the temperature record of the past 1000 years by (a) promoting his own result as the best estimate, (b) neglecting studies that contradicted his, and (c) amputating another’s result so as to eliminate conflicting data and limit any serious attempt to expose the real uncertainties of these data.”
