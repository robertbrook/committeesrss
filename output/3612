[normal]I disagree w
[normal]ith the idea of some actresses acting and dressing like men and some 
[normal]actors dressing
[normal] and acting like women 
[normal]ON CHILDREN PROGRAMES
[normal] such us CBeebies
[normal]. This 
[normal]swapping gender 
[normal]confuses children. I strongly believe that 
[normal]children should
[normal] be encouraged to have 
[normal]a 
[normal]very clear
[normal] knowledge on
[normal] the difference between men and woman.
[normal]I am ta
[normal]l
[normal]king about 
[normal]Aunt P
[normal]olly on the programme 
[normal]S
[normal]omething
[normal] Special and Gail
[normal] Force and Sue Keeper
[normal] on Gigglebiz 
[normal]In the same way,
[normal] Sid who keep
[normal]s
[normal] dressing and acting like a wo
[normal]men and Rebecca who keep dressing and acting like men on the programme Lets Play.
[normal]I donâ€™t understand the necessity on this. Therefore, I 
[normal]share this view with other mums who agree with me. 
[normal]Please, stop 
[normal]such performances.
