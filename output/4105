[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from the London Cycling Campaign (CYS0071)[bold]              [bold]The London Cycling Campaign welcomes the opportunity to contribute to th
[normal]e Transport Select Committee’s follow up
[normal] inquiry into cycling. We share the committee’s concern at the tragic death of 6 people in 
[normal]just two weeks on London roads.
[normal] The continued growth of cycling in London and the UK must be accompanied, and assisted by, a reduction of road danger to cycle users 
[normal]and pedestrians
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]. 
[normal]London Cycling Campaign[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he London Cycling Campaign is a charity 
[normal]with more than 4
[normal]0,000 supporters of who
[normal]m
[normal] 
[normal]12,000 
[normal]are full 
[normal]members. We 
[normal]speak up on behalf of
[normal] everyone who cycles, or want
[normal]s
[normal] to cycle, in Greater London. Our aim is for London to be a world
[normal] 
[normal]class cycling city. Founded in 1978, our organisation campaigns for every street in the city to be cycle
[normal] 
[normal]friendly so
[normal] that
[normal] millions more Londoners
[normal], whatever the
[normal]ir
[normal] age or ability,
[normal] can enjoy the benefits of cycling, helping to creat
[normal]e a cleaner, healthier and 
[normal]less 
[normal]congested capital.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LCC, and its 33 local groups, regularly respond to planning consultations, inquiries into cycling and 
[normal]provide
[normal] informed input to 
[normal]policy making at both the local 
[normal]and London-wide-levels. Our input and lobbying work led to the comprehe
[normal]nsive revision of London’s cycling programmes now encapsulated in the Mayor’s Vision for Cycling in London. While the LCC would like to
[normal] see
[normal] a significant acceleration in the pace of implementation of the Mayor’s Vision
[normal], we recognise it
[normal] as a 
[normal]major step
[normal] towards improving cycling conditions in the capital.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.[bold] [bold]reducing road danger[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal] 
[normal]Cycle journeys in London have increased by 176% on main roads in the past decade
[normal],
[normal] and cycle commuting by Hackney residents now accounts for more than 15% of journeys
[normal] –
[normal] doubling
[normal] in a decade.  
[normal]Yet even the capital, where cycle journeys 
[normal]now exceed 57
[normal]0,000 per day, 
[normal]still has a low o
[normal]verall share of cycling at a little more than 
[normal]2% of all journeys, well below cities like 
[normal]Berlin (
[normal]15
[normal]%) or Amsterdam (36%). 
[normal]The overall figure for
[normal] the UK
[normal] is
[normal] 2% - significantly below the potential rate. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 
[normal]The key factor in deterring more people from cycling in the UK is road danger and perceived road danger. Recent surveys, both in London
[normal] 
[normal]and the UK, consistently show that a quarter, or more, o
[normal]f the population would like to cycle or cycle more often. 
[normal]S
[normal]urveys carried out for LCC and British Cycling show that the number one factor deterring people from cycling is fear of road danger. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]As the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] funded programme of Cycling Demonstration towns
[normal] has shown
[normal],
[normal] cycling offers an exceptionally cost effective investment in the transport sector. 
[normal]The Cycling Demonstration Towns showed a cost/benefit ratio of £2- £3.5 for every pound spent and this is described as a conservative 
[normal]estimate
[normal]. 
[normal]A cost
[normal]/
[normal]benefit s
[normal]tudy in Copenhagen (a city with high cycling levels) found that the total socio
[normal]-
[normal]economic cost of cycling (including travel time, health factors, pollution and congestion) 
[normal]was 0.60 DK
[normal] (Danish Krone
[normal]) per
[normal] kilometre compared to 3.74 DK per kilometre for cars
[normal]. 
[normal] Cyclist fatality rates in Holland and Denmark compared to distance travelled are half those in the UK. 
[normal]1.4 
[normal]The NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) report on walking cycling, published in December 2012, makes clear that the health cost
[normal]s
[normal] of an inactive population are enormous and comparable to those of smoking.
[normal] 
[normal]1.5 
[normal]LCC led the Love London Go Dutch campaign in 2012 that secured 42,000 signatures asking the future Mayor to make our roads 
[normal]‘
[normal]as safe and inviting for cycling 
[normal]and walking as th
[normal]ose in Holland
[normal].’
[normal] The elected Mayor made a commitment to realise this pledge and his response has 
[normal]been his
[normal] Vision for 
[normal]Cycling
[normal] 
[normal]which commits to both significantly improved infrastructure and safer lorries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. POLITICAL LEADERSHIP[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1[bold] [bold]In common with the Tr[bold]ansport Committee[bold] LCC believes that [bold]political will, within Government and within Local Authorities, is the single most important fundamental and overarching factor that will deliver improved conditions for cycling in the UK, and[bold] [bold]unlock the huge latent [bold]demand there is for cycling as an everyday means of transport[bold]. That political will needs to be reflected in a clear national cycling strategy, backed by adequate resources and funding, which lead to its implementation at local level throughout the country.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]LCC 
[normal]shares the view expressed by the Transport Committee, in its 2012 recommendations on cycling
[normal], that
[normal] local authorities must work together 
[normal]with central Government 
[normal]to achieve improved cycling conditions and therefore we are seeking to secure the sup
[normal]port of all local council candidates in the 2014 local elections for cycle-friendly measures in 
[normal]London 
[normal]wards.
[normal] Our recommendations to candidates. 
[normal] These 
[normal]will follow six themes
[normal] all related to reducing road danger and removing barriers to cycling. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 [bold]Space for Cycling 2014 : [bold]key themes[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 
[normal]A key element of the process 
[normal]of switching people from 
[normal]short 
[normal]car trips (half 
[normal]of which
[normal] are 
[normal]less than
[normal] 5
[normal] miles 
[normal]in the 
[normal]UK)
[normal] to walking and cycling 
[normal]is the re
[normal]versal of the policy followed in the 60’s of re-designing cities to enable high-speed motoring. 
[normal]I
[normal]f we are to 
[normal]achieve the levels of cycling across all demographi
[normal]c groups that are 
[normal]seen in the Netherlands
[normal] then motor traffic must be deprioritised in favour of cycling
[normal] and walking
[normal] most notably for urban, local journeys
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 
[normal]This is, at heart, a political rather than a technical matter. To fulfil the 
[normal]Government’s and Local 
[normal]Authorities’ declared
[normal] commitment to sustainable transport
[normal], and the numerous environmental, economic and health benefits that follow
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]cycling 
[normal](and walking) 
[normal]must be given 
[normal]priority in both time and 
[normal]space over motor traffic
[normal] in the UK’s u
[normal]rban spaces
[normal],
[normal] as 
[normal]it is in the Netherlands and Denmark.
[normal] In this context the Government must re-emphasise 
[normal]that the Traffic Management Act must be used to 
[normal]prioritise 
[normal]the movement of 
[normal]people
[normal], wherever possible by 
[normal]cycling and walking
[normal], 
[normal]ahead of 
[normal]the movement of 
[normal]motor vehicles
[normal].  
[normal]A lesson learned in London is that pre-occupation with 
[normal]maintaining or increasing
[normal] road capacity for cars can lead highway authorities to overlook, or discard, traffic schemes that can reduce road danger to vulnerable road users and serve to
[normal] encourage walking and cycling. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3[bold].  [bold]Safety Concerns[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]Safety concerns are a primary deterrent to cycle use. The factors identified by London r
[normal]oad users include: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 [bold]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold].  Cycling Infrastructure[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]A
[normal]ll urban road infrastructure impacts on the safety of cyclists. The main issues restraining more cycling in London and identified by Londoners 
[normal] are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2[bold] [bold]Cycle Networks[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]It is evident from successful cycling countries that cycle routes need to build into a network to give people the confidence that they will reach their destination along cycle-friendly roads without encountering major barriers.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]As the Dutch Design M
[normal]anual for Bic
[normal]ycle Traffic (CROW) makes clear
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]cycle networks 
[normal]must offer
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal] 
[normal]UK cycle networks, whether in London or
[normal] elsewhere, invariably fall down 
[normal]on some or all of these principles
[normal].
[normal] The Mayor of London has announced that a network of ‘
[normal]Quietways
[normal]” across London and “Grid” of cycle-friendly streets in central London will build into a network. The quality of such
[normal] 
[normal]a network
[normal] must meet continental standards to give people the confidence to 
[normal]cycle. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]6[bold] [bold]Main road network[bold] cycle provision[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The level of provision for safe cycling on 
[normal]UK main
[normal] roads
[normal] remains inadequate.
[normal] London’s 
[normal]Mayor initiate
[normal]d
[normal] a review of major junctions
[normal], 
[normal]following previous
[normal] deaths,
[normal] in recognition of the problems across the capital
[normal]. 
[normal]Cycling infrastructure 
[normal]on main roads 
[normal]is either non-existent or seriously inconveniences cycle journeys
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n some cases
[normal],
[normal] new infrastructure increases risk for cyclists as at recent work on 
[normal]Henley’s
[normal] Corner 
[normal](
[normal]A406
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] This problem is certainly not exclusive t
[normal]o London and must be addressed right across the 
[normal]country. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7[bold] [bold]One Way Road System Removal[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]O
[normal]ne way road 
[normal]systems (
[normal]or 
[normal]gyratories
[normal]) remain one of the biggest barriers to 
[normal]both safety and 
[normal]increased cycle use
[normal].  Progress on removing the 
[normal]gyratories
[normal] that blight large parts 
[normal]of 
[normal]UK cities 
[normal]has been very slow.  A major programme of one way road system removal 
[normal]and the introduction of 
[normal]high grade provision for cycle users and walkers is overdue
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.8[bold] [bold]Filtered Permeability Measures [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Such schemes allow people on foot or on bikes access through locations where through motor traffic is blocked 
[normal](often by low cost bollards or a no entry sign) 
[normal]for amenity or traffic management reasons. The 
[normal]impetus for such s
[normal]chemes often come
[normal]s
[normal] from residents seeking to eliminate rat running. Permeability schemes such as those in De Beauvoir 
[normal]Town,
[normal] Hackney 
[normal]and Claremont
[normal] 
[normal]Square,
[normal] Islington, attract thousands of cyclists per day (
[normal]up to 1500 per hour - 
[normal]high even by Dutch standards
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]The virtual absence of moving motor vehicles means that collisions are unlikely. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.9[bold] [bold]Speed Reduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In combination with measures such as filtered permeability, speed reduction can create pleasant cycling routes that attract more riders
[normal] as well as reducing collisions
[normal]. 
[normal]Following r
[normal]ecent changes
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]DfT
[normal] guidance allow
[normal]s
[normal] 20mph limits on main roads such as the 
[normal]TfL
[normal] network
[normal], under certain specified conditions
[normal].
[normal]4.10[bold] [bold]Cycle Superhighways[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The cycle superhighways 
[normal]In London 
[normal]have pro
[normal]vided very visible way marking 
[normal]but they have introduced only a limited number of safety improvements, as acknowledged by 
[normal]the
[normal] Mayor’s commitment to re-design them with far greater use of mode separation notably at junctions where most collisions occur. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Cy
[normal]cle superhighway 2 in East London is a sad case where six cyclists have 
[normal]died in 3 years
[normal]. LCC advised against implementation of this
[normal] highway as originally proposed and welcome
[normal]s
[normal] the Mayoral commitment to re-design it 
[normal]with protected cycle lanes and 
[normal]treated junctions.  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.11[bold] [bold]Greenways[bold]C
[normal]ycle paths through Hyde Park and Green Park in central London are highly popular. 
[normal]Well designed
[normal] Greenway routes and links 
[normal]can make 
[normal]a significant impact on improving conditions for both walkers and cyclists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.12[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]. [bold]Children &amp; Cycle Training[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1 
[normal]Cycling, which enables children to stay active
[normal] and healthy
[normal], 
[normal]needs to be 
[normal]incorporated
[normal] in
[normal]to
[normal] the educational system
[normal],
[normal] as it is in the Netherlands
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 
[normal]Incorporating an element of cycle training into the driving test would enable drivers to understand the on-road strategies of cycle users and help reduce the incidence of collisions.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.3 [bold]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6[bold].[bold]  I[bold]mproving Street Design &amp; Management[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 
[normal]Dutch planners and engineers consider cycle and pedestrian traffic from the outset of any design process.  It is clear that this does not happen in much of the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]Consideration of 
[normal]‘people’ capacity rather than just motor vehicle capacity would lead to more people friendly planning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 
[normal]Not all the transport modelling software used by 
[normal]TfL
[normal] and other Highway Authorities allows cycle flows as inputs or outputs. 
[normal]TfL’s
[normal] guidance suggests 
[normal]that junction capacity modelling is unreliable where cycle flows make up 20% 
[normal](no longer uncommon in London) 
[normal]of the traffic flow
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3 
[normal]Safety audits must properly consider cycle users. 
[normal]We note
[normal], for example
[normal], that
[normal] 
[normal]TfL
[normal] guidelines for safety audits of road sc
[normal]hemes do not require auditors to have any detailed knowledge of cycling provision or London Cycle Design Standards
[normal].

[normal]9.1 
[normal]Cycle 
[normal]use in
[normal] the UK has increased in those towns and cities where funding
[normal] has been 
[normal]provided –
[normal] London and the 
[normal]Demonstration Cycle Towns 
[normal]are the obvious examples.

[normal]9.2 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Rod 
[normal]Eddington
[normal] report on Transport specifically 
[normal]highl
[normal]ighted that investment in cycl
[normal]ing offered 
[normal]particular 
[normal]value for money
[normal]: 
[normal]“Improving the attractiveness of walking and cycling, e.g. by creating 
[normal]or upgrading routes, can provide strong returns with wider BCRs (benefit cost ratios) sometimes over 10.”
[normal] 
[normal]Eddington’s
[normal] conclusion was that 
[normal]“some
[normal] of the best projects are small-scale, such as walking and 
[normal]cycling 
[normal].”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3 
[normal]We note that a 
[normal]DfT
[normal] estimate of the a
[normal]nnual costs of traffic delays, accidents
[normal],
[normal] poor air quality
[normal],
[normal] physical inactivity, greenhouse gas emissions and noise resulting from motor traffic in urban areas was put at £38 - £48 billion pounds
[normal].

[normal]10[bold]. HGV DANGER[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1 
[normal]In London 9 out of 14 
[normal]cycling fatalities
[normal] in 2013 
[normal]were
[normal] the result
[normal] of collisions with 
[normal]lorries
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.2 
[normal]LCC has been in the forefront of the campaign to reduce danger from heavy goods vehicles
[normal],
[normal] most recently with the Safer Lorries for Safer Cycling campaign targeting all London 
[normal]boroughs
[normal],
[normal] and the design of an urban lorry that significantly increases a driver’s direct vision. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.3 LCC
