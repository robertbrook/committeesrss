[[[Written evidence from Mrs Christine Talbot (LTC 28)]]]&#xa0;I am a State Registered Nurse and Lymphoedema Practitioner, specialising in the care and practice of lymphoedema management in the Dorset area for seven years.&#xa0;I see a wide range of patients with both primary and secondary lymphoedemas, lipoedemas and combined pathologies. Secondary lymphoedemas are as a result of surgery, trauma or chronic illnesses &#xa0;In the main patients pay privately for their treatment; until recently a few had Primary Care Trust funding, funding which has now been withdrawn, regardless of necessity. As yet no funded care package has been implemented in its place by the individual General Practitioner surgeries, District Nurses claim they cannot offer such specialised treatment, neither would they have the time to do so, thus as a traditional ‘Nightingale’ nurse, I am treating clinically dependent lymphoedema patients for free. &#xa0;Equally patients on social benefits or very limited incomes and other specific financial short falls, are seen on a reduced rate, treatment is paramount to their well being, without which they could incur all manner of complications, infection, chronic pain and associated disabilities. Ironically, without my clinical lymphoedema skills, these patients would come under the NHS financial umbrella and receive costly inappropriate care and medication for their condition.&#xa0;In general the NHS has neither the training, the interest, nor sufficient knowledge of lymphoedema and its multifaceted complexities, nor any realistic understanding of ongoing, lifelong dependency on healthcare. A few NHS or charity associated Lymphoedema Clinics offer a limited service of six monthly limb measurementsappointments and supplying of hosiery.&#xa0;I would advocate,&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I look forward with interest to the outcome of the House of Commons Inquiry into long term conditions and care requirements. So too, as to whether there will be future opportunity and funding for education and enlightenment with regards to a most debilitating, clinically complex and socially and psychologically demanding and depressing condition for those afflicted.May 2013
