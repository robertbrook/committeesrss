"BRC28\nWRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY NIGEL HARMAN0.0\n&#xa0; \nINTRODUCTION\nThis written evidence is given in response to an invitation to comment on Part P schemes. \nIt is given in 3 sections, \nSUMMARY OF \nRECOMMENDATIONS, OBSERVATIONS and \nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.0\n&#xa0; \nSU\nMMARY OF \nRECOMMENDATIONS\n&#xa0;\n2\n.0\n \nOBSERVATIONS\nI have noted your terms of reference and will address each one in turn \nbelow:-\n2.1.0\n              \nthe extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;\n2.1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe “Gas Safe” and previous schemes have been around for many years and are still not universally known by the public. I am sure the public are aware of the need for safety in connection with gas appliances but checking to see if they are “Gas Safe” regist\nered is \nstill \nnot a priority for them.\n2.1.2\n              \nCalling a scheme a “Competent Persons Scheme” and expecting the public to become aware of it, when a lot of electrician’s are not even sure what it means, is just not going to work.\n A single “Electric Safe” register has a \nmuch higher chance of successful public recognition.\n2.1.3\n              \nThe phrase “certain domestic electrical works” is a big part of the \nproblem. \nSuccessive versions of Part P hav\ne been \ntoo complicated\n in their attempts to de\nfine their scope. M\nany electrician’s would have difficulty defining what type of electrical work is or is not notifiable and, it is a fact of life that the more complicated you make something\n the less likely it is to be \nunderstood and \nadhered to. Less \nis o\nften \nmore and, I believe the entire Part P document could (should) be replaced by the following single sentence:-\nAll (domestic?) electrical installation work, other than “like for like” replacement of  components where basic electrical safety has been confirmed, must  be notified to the local authority.”2.1.4 \n              \nThe Committee \nhas rightly \ncriticized the witnesses for duplication of schemes but \nit is \nworth noting that the above sentence, added to the already respecte\nd (by electrician’s) BS7671 Requirements for Electrical Installation, would render Part P superfluous.\n It often seems the case that new policies and procedures are introduced without considering that relatively minor changes to existing documents may provi\nde a much simpler\n, cheaper and, more importantly, \neffective solution.\n2.1.5\n              \nWhilst it is accepted that certain a\nreas of electrical work present\n a higher risk than \nothers, a fundamental error, such as reverse\nd\n polarity at a socket outlet, has\n the \ncapacity \nto cause injury wherever it is installed, not just so-called “special locations.”\n2.2.0              the extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to   meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills; 2.2\n.1\n              \nBroadly speaking, electrical installation work is currently being carried out by two “classes” of p\nerson, electricians and non-e\nlectricians.\n2.2\n.2\n              \nE\nlectricians are very well-qualified, self-motivated and, to a large extent self-monitored individuals who are trained to a high standard (some would say too high for domestic work only), who are required to achieve NVQ Level III \nbefore they are fully recog\nniz\ned by the main \nvoluntary \nregistration bodies.\n2.2.3\n              \nNon-electricians, such as kitchen fitters, plumbers and heating engineers are a problem. Most will admit to you that the reason they became plumbers or whatever, rather than electricians, was because o\nf the very fact that they “don’t really understand electricity.” \n2.2.4\n              \nElectrical work is problematic because, particularly for domestic work, the actual skill level required to run and terminate a cable is relatively low, particularly for someone with as\nsociated skills, like a plumber. However, it demands a much higher level of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that any additions or alterations are car\nried out safely, and properly tested and commissioned. \n2.2.5\n              \nI do not believe that a 5 day defi\nned scope Part P course will give a person the required competence level to issue them with a Part P registration card which just further legitimizes their position as modifiers of electrical circuits.\n2.2.6\n              \nIn short, I believe that the gap between these t\nwo levels of accreditation is far too wide. This is partly due to the electrical industry’s insistence on every electrician gaining a full level III qualification, leaving the wa\ny open for \n“Part P”\n domestic installers who are allowed to alter circuits one at a time but not all at once! This is very reminiscent of the “trigger’s broom”\n \nsketch in On\nly Fools and H\norses!\n2.2.7\n              \nIn my opinion, there is an urgent need for 3 type\ns\n of person authoriz\ned to ca\nrry out electrical work as follows:-\na.\n full\n NVQ LIII q\nualif\ni\ned and registered\n Industrial, Commercial and Domestic\n \n   \nElectrician.\nb.  \nAn NVQ LII qualified and registered Domestic Electrician\n2.3.0              the extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations;2.3.1\n              \nIt is the policy\n of most of the Registration and trade bodies to carry out annual assessments of their registered or member enterprises. This usually involves the inspection of one or two installations that have been completed by the enterprise. It is my belief that, in m\nost cases, this level of monitoring is adequate and it is difficult to suggest other means by which this may be \neffectively carried out.\n \n2.4.0              the adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons;2.4.1\n              \nLessons should be learnt\n here from the “Gas Safe” scheme, whereby it was the enterprise that needed to be registered with no requirement for the individual to demonstrate competence. Experience has shown that, for a large number of companies, on-site assessment or monitoring of e\nmployees is just not practical due to commercial pressures and lack of trained assessors. This is still a fundamental flaw with NVQ qualifications and the reason large numbers of “electricians” possess only a technical certificate and not an NVQ, preventin\ng them from registering with bodies such as the JIB.\n2.4.2\n              \nI believe that a compulsory system of registration via a single body with training and certification provided by competitive suppliers allied to truly “standardized” standards would \nachieve a level\n of confidence in the competence of persons carrying out electrical work.\n2\n.4\n.3\n              \nSuccessive governments seem to have been reluctant to implement this for the electrical industry\n but 5 year assessment of individuals need not be any \nmore onerous than annual a\nssessment of enterprises.\n2.5.0              the effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work; 2.5.1\n              \nIt was abundantly clear from the video of the meeting \nthat entrusting a registration scheme to competing bodies is not the way forward. Each body \nrelies on being slightly different from its competitors in order to secure an advantage over the other. This is not the right atmosphere in which to develop common \nstandards, particularly where safety is concerned.\n2.5.2\n              \nI have watched with interest over many years how bodies which claim to be maintaining standards are actually responsible for distorting them or at least “muddying the waters.” Electrical test certifi\ncates are a case in point. BS7671 provides model forms for certification of ele\nctrical installations but, most bodies \nand trade association\ns have\n produced their own version of the form. This is very confusing when encouraging people to “conform to the stan\ndards” when the very bodies responsible for policing them encourage the use of non-standard documents.\n2\n.\n5.3\n              \nThe chairman was right, the only way to cut through the vested interests and enforce standardization is to impose a statutory registration body.\n2.6.0               the adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes. 2.6.\n1\n              \nI am \nunaware of the procedures DCLG have\n implemented to \nsupervise \nthes\ne \nschemes and am therefore unable to comment.\n \n2.6.2\n              \nHowever, I do get the feeling that, in all walks of life, those who strive to get things right are being made to jump through more and more hoops to prove they are doing it right in the first place. A little more supervision and prosecution of the “offende\nrs” is what’s actually required – but this is difficult. \n3.0\n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nMy name is Nigel Harman and the opinions expressed above are entirely personal.\nI have worked in the electrical industry since 1975 as an electrical engineer, college lecturer, \ntrainer and assessor of individuals and inspector of installations\n in electrical installation and renewable technologies.\nI am submitting this report because I believe that the electrical industry and it’s\n customers are not being well served by the plethora of qualifications and “schemes” which are simply confusing everybody and having no real impact on unauthorised or sub-standard work.\n25 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
