[normal]W[bold]ritten evidence from Angela [bold]Woosey[bold] (HCP0006)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]PERSONAL EVIDENCE OF ANGELA WOOSEY BASED UPON RECENT INTERACTION WITH THE HCPC FTP EXPERIENCE AND FURTHER RESEARCH
[normal]Summary 
[normal]The HCPC FTP claim ‘to safeguard the health and wellbeing of persons using or needing the services of registrants’ and they do this by ensuring restorative and rehabilitative justice along with openness, fairness and transparency to all those who have cause to interact with the processes and proceedings.    I have recently interacted with the HCPC’s FTP proceedings and as a member of the public I had concerns surrounding the HCPC’s FTP systems, processes, procedures, 
[normal]organisational
[normal] 
[normal]behaviours
[normal] and culture.  I raised these concerns in the form of a corporate complaint with the HCPC.  This escalated through lower to senior management and finally rested with the FTP Director.  All HCPC members of staff who came into contact with my concerns responded in the same disengaged manner of re-iterating organizational procedures and processes. No real answers to my actual questions were received.  The FTP Director’s response was that she was unable to comment on issues that should be should be raised through the High 
[normal]Courts
[normal]!
[normal]The Secretary of State for Health recently published the report entitled “the hard truths – the journey to putting patients first”.  Included in this report is a section on scrutiny and good questions : “Good organizations should respond thoughtfully, not defensively, and in order to do this an open and transparent culture needs to exist within that organization, creating a climate where critical enquiry, challenge and discussion are used to improve the way the organization works.  
[normal]A mature organization is one that welcomes scrutiny and uses it as the basis for improvements[bold] 
[normal]by following up good questions with action and then with further questions to check that change has really happened.  
[normal]The [bold]behaviour[bold] of senior figures[bold] in the organization will make all the difference in this, their genuine engagement with staff and a focus on improvement and achieving high standards will send important signals through the organization.
[normal]As an organization whose primary function is to scrutinize the practices and 
[normal]behaviours
[normal] of others in pursuit of public protection, it would seem from my recent interaction with the HCPC that they do not respond at all well to good questions about their own organizational practices and 
[normal]behaviours
[normal]. This evidence submission is my opportunity to convey the disappointment felt at being let down by the manner in which the HCPC conduct their FTP business and respond to good questions from a member of the public about their 
[normal]organisation’s
[normal] practices and 
[normal]behaviours
[normal], by ‘hitting the target but missing the whole point’ of what good 
[normal]quality[bold] public protection should look like!  The HCPC have a real need to recognize that acting with integrity, openness, transparency and accountability is also applicable to their own organizational practices and standards of 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] and should be consistent and aligned with the standards that are set down for their registrants.
[normal]Allowing these ‘official’ counter-cultural messages to remain and persist will destroy any belief that this organization actually means what it says.  From my interaction with the systems of regulation, I have concluded a total lack of respect and trust in the HCPC’s FTP systems and look upon their protection of the public with total cynicism and complete failure. 
[normal]I hope that the HCPC will respond openly and thoughtfully to this document and that it will provide an opportunity for change and improvement to the systems of health care regulation in pursuit of excellence in patient care and safety.

[normal]  HCPC KEY INFORMATION 
[normal]Ensuring processes are aligned with principles of restorative and rehabilitative justice remains core to the HCPC’s FTP proceedings.  Along with ensuring 
[normal]openness, fairness and transparency in our FTP proceedings[bold], this will remain central to our approach and work in 2013/14.
[normal]We continuously look at ways that we can improve and develop our processes and in 2013/14 this will include looking at ways that we can improve the experience that individuals have with the FTP process.  This is to ensure 
[normal]fairness and justice[bold] to all those that have cause to interact with it.
[normal]Standard 1:  The investigation of the complaint is 
[normal]impartial and fair.[bold]Standard 4:  The 
[normal]governance[bold] arrangements regarding complaint handling are 
[normal]robust.[bold]Standard 6: Investigations are carried out 
[normal]in accordance with local procedures, national guidance and within legal frameworks.[bold]Standard 8: The 
[normal]judgement
[normal] reached by the decision maker is 
[normal]transparent[bold], based on the 
[normal]evidence available.[bold]Standard 9: The complaint documentation is 
[normal]accurate and complete and the level of detail appropriate[bold] to the nature and seriousness of the complaint.
[normal]Standard 11:  Learning lessons from complaints that occur through the organization.
[normal]Guiding Principles: protecting the public, 
[normal]transparency[bold], 
[normal]communication[bold] and responsiveness, 
[normal]providing a high quality service[bold], value for money, working collaboratively.
[normal]Strategic Objectives: 
[normal]Good governance, efficient business processes, fair, open and impartial.[bold]Vision:  
[normal]To be recognized internationally as a model of good practice in public protection.[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]TAKING ACTION WHEN A REGISTRANT’S FTP FALLS BELOW STANDARDS
[normal]Meeting the HCPC’s Burden of Proof – Evidence Given Based on Personal Interaction
[normal]The HCPC lay claim to 
[normal]robust governance arrangements, [bold]overall[bold] effective casework systems and efficient business processes[bold]. 
[normal]Allegations 
[normal]Allegations were revised seven months 
[normal]AFTER
[normal] ICP agreement and 
[normal]AFTER ALL
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]evidence had been gathered from both sides.  These amended allegations were accepted by a CCC on the day of a hearing. This process was considered to be ‘fair’ to better reflect the HCPC’s burden of proof.  The HCPC considers a CCC to have an 
[normal]inherent power[bold] to undertake this process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Out of 223 final FTP hearings between 1
[normal]st
[normal] November 2012 and 30
[normal]th
[normal] June 2013 
[normal]103 FTP cases had amendments made to their allegations[bold].
[normal]Civil Rules of Evidence – HCPC’s Reliance on Hearsay Evidence
[normal]The HCPC’s burden of proof relied purely upon tenuous witness ‘hearsay’ evidence which was ‘peppered’ with inconsistencies that did not match with documentary evidence.  The HCPC withheld and did not disclose evidence from senior NHS management that identified an inappropriate workplace culture to be in existence and provided no cogent reasons for the failure to call such a critical witness.

[normal]Documentary Evidence Handling
[normal]The HCPC omitted from the investigation process and failed to disclose to the proceedings critical, exculpatory documentary evidence in the form of 
[normal]Patient Care Records[bold],  claiming the disclosure of this evidence to be ‘desirable’ but not ‘essential’ to fulfill their burden of proof.  A 
[normal]dishonest[bold] written statement made by the HCPC exists that states this evidence is no longer available when it is in fact in their possession.

[normal]We identified “

[normal]concerns about the HCPC’s decision making[bold] and six cases where we 
[normal]considered there were potential implications[bold] for public protection and/or

[normal]Inadequate record keeping[bold] 
[normal] “Of the 100 cases audited, we identified 31 cases in which we had 
[normal]concerns around risk assessments and [bold]compliance with the HCPC’s operational guidance[bold].[bold] 
[normal]More specifically, we found 27 cases (including cases closed by HCPC staff and following an ICP decision) where risk assessments had not been completed at all required stages in the process.
[normal]Conducting a robust risk assessment on receipt of a new complaint and updating that risk assessment in light of new information is an important part of public protection within a risk-based regulatory approach. 
[normal]Unless the regulator has conducted a proper evaluation of risk, it is difficult to make sound [bold]judgements[bold] [bold]about whether any regulatory action is necessary,”
[normal]We recommend that the HCPC reviews our findings in these cases and considers whether improvements can be made to its processes and procedures to [bold]minimise[bold] the risk of any of the issues highlighted above reoccurring in the future.[bold]In response to this external audit, the HCPC published:
[normal]“Overall[bold] the PSA found that “the HCPC continues to operate effective systems and processes in all areas of its 
[normal]initial
[normal] stages of the FTP process”.

[normal]225 final hearings came before a conduct and competence committee. 14 registrants had conditions of practice imposed, 40 had a caution imposed, 44 were struck off and 61 were suspended.
[normal]292 registrants made a self-referral of disclosure to the HCPC.

[normal]NHS staff are not to blame, in the vast majority of cases it is the systems, procedures, conditions, environment and constraints that they face that lead to patient safety problems.  [bold]Well intentioned people who make errors or are involved in systems that have failed around them need to be supported, not punished.[bold]  [bold]Genuine errors are not misconduct and do not warrant punishment[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]The work of the Public Inquiry into the failing in care at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust will be of importance to us on many levels, and we are looking at our 
[normal]own culture as well as at our regulatory functions[bold] to see what changes we might make to ensure that we are also putting patients and service users first in all we do.
