defaultRecommendations concerning reports are pertinent. In line with the recommendation that Committees aim to publish brief and accessible reports, JCSI and SCSI have continued their practice of publishing short and succinct weekly reports in a style appropriate to their main target audience, parliamentarians and legislative drafters. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Liaison Committee also recommended better follow-up by Committees of their reports and for Committees to draw attention to inadequate Government responses. The JCSI published a Special Report in May 2013, entitled 
defaultExcluding the Inert from Secondary Legislation
default,
default as a means of reinforcing and drawing further attention to a recommendation made in a number of weekly reports about an unwelcome development in drafting practice. It has used the Special Report as a tool to engage Government Departments in further discussions about this practice.

defaultb. how 
defaultthe Committees have
default approached the revised core tasks approved by the House in January 
defaultTask 5 (t
defaulto assist the House in its consideration of bills and statutory instruments, 
defaultincluding draft orders under the Public Bodies Act) and Task 9 (to produce timely reports to inform debate in the House, including Westminster Hall, or debating committees, and to examine petitions tabled) are relevant to the JCSI and SCSI. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committees’ approach to these tasks is as prescribed in Standing Order 151. During 2012-13, the JCSI and SCSI considered 1,068 statutory instruments and drew the House’s special attention to 77 of them. 
defaultCommittee staff have ensured that relevant business papers in both Houses clearly identify which instruments have and have not been considered. There is an additional impetus for the Committees to undertake prompt consideration because the Lords Standing Order 72 states that no resolution of that House can be taken until the JCSI has reported.
default&#xa0;
defaultc. any obstacles encountered 
defaultThe Committees have not encountered any obstacles to adopting the limited aspects of the Liaison Committee’s report applicable to them. More generally, the Committees have experienced, and continue to experience, difficulties in achieving a quorum, owing to the fact that several Commons Members have expressed a wish to come off the Committee but replacements have not been found. It is hoped that the recent change in policy by the Committee of Selection will assist in resolving this matter. 
default&#xa0;
defaultd. any examples of innovation or good practice for others to consider
defaultThe very specific nature of the Committees’ work unfortunately makes it difficult to offer examples of practice which would be useful to other Committees.
