I didn’t know that the council would be able to help me with it or that the \njobcentre would be involved too. Childcare, rent and travel for the first month was a big worry so it was a great that I could go to the council and get it all sorted under one roof. “\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuote from c\nlaimant a\nbout their experience: \n&#xa0;\n“I was under a lot of stress when th\ne cap came in. Even though I did the research it felt like the walls were closing in… I really appreciate what you’ve done. Helpful, informative and understanding; you have been in contact with me for months so you understand on a different level what is r\neally happening with me. It has been really helpful.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
