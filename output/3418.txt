[[[– Written evidence]]]&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CBI welcomes the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill. The CBI is the UK’s leading business organisation, speaking for some 240,000 businesses that together employ around a third of the private sector workforce.&#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is a broad Bill which cuts across a number of policy areas and will affect certain sectors very specifically. Our evidence will address a number of the clauses which are most relevant to the business community as a whole. &#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Over the past year there has been some positive news on the UK economy and for this nascent recovery to strengthen, so the UK achieves long-term, sustainable economic growth, public policy must be focused on creating the right conditions for growth, by supporting the private sector to drive the recovery. This Bill should help support the government’s growth agenda by combining repeal and reform. Business supports the overall intent behind the Bill: that the regulatory process should be one of amending, improving and scrapping of legislation where necessary. In addition the Bill is a vehicle for significant and very positive reform, by setting in place the framework for a more flexible, effective apprenticeship system. Turning to the specific clauses:&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clause 2: Removal of employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations]]]In an employment law framework based on individual rights, as in the UK, an independent arbitration system has a vital role to play. Employment tribunals rightly shape business behaviours through their rulings, however they are not best qualified to make company specific recommendations. For this reason the CBI called for the removal of employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations in our response to the Government Equalities Office consultation on the removal of enforcement measures from the Equality Act 2010. We support the inclusion of this measure in the Bill. For recommendations to be meaningful, the individual making them needs to have considerable understanding of the company, something which tribunals cannot gain through arbitrating a hearing. Indeed, badly crafted recommendations have the potential to be harmful, either through prescribing the wrong action or through legitimising wider behaviours not covered in the tribunals’ proposals. &#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clause 3: English apprenticeships: simplification                                                                                ]]]To meet the UK’s future skills needs our education and skills system must be able to raise people to higher skills levels, address the shortages which employers identify and be tailored to best equip people for work. To achieve this, the CBI supports a new, simplified framework for apprenticeships which is focused on training outcomes for businesses. The proposals put forward by Doug Richard in his review, which are reflected in the Bill, were supported by the CBI. Stripping back on the detailed prescription on content in the previous Act and allowing employers, and their representatives, to make representations on the standards for apprenticeships, are positive steps towards creating a more flexible system which will better meet the needs of both employers and apprentices. Similarly, providing further clarity about the employment status of apprentices will help all firms, but in particularly businesses navigating the system for first time and smaller firms. &#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; These reforms rightly address problems within the existing apprenticeships framework. Given the devolved nature of education and skills policy, business understands that these reforms will only take effect within England and recognises them as a welcome step forward. At this stage business is comfortable about the level of detail within the Bill, so long as the on-going piloting and consultation process is completed, and changes are properly phased which can be dealt with as the secondary legislation adds further substance. Similarly, given the powers that the Bill allows to the Secretary of State business would seek clarity that any changes would be made in a timely and considered fashion. &#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clauses 9, 10, 11 : Companies and insolvency ]]]The effectiveness of the audit market is being comprehensively addressed through two concurrent processes: an EU audit market reform package consisting of a Directive and a Regulation; and a Competition Commission review into the UK audit market which recently reported its final conclusions. The CBI encourages the government to ensure that proposed changes in this Bill are made in light of developments in both sets of on-going reforms. Both initiatives are expected to conclude in 2014 and issues of auditor appointment and rotation are among the many aspects of the audit market being dealt with in these reviews.&#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clause 22: Removal of restrictions on provision of passenger rail services]]]The franchise system has delivered huge investment in our rail network and better outcomes for passengers. This clause, which will allow for decentralising of rail franchises and give local authorities similar powers on to franchising to that of the GLA, is in line with the findings of the Brown Review on franchising. The experience of Transport For London shows that the devolution of franchises can, and has the potential to, deliver positive outcomes for relevant authorities.  We need a rail network fit for the 21st century and that is why the CBI welcomes devolution as a positive change to the franchise system.&#xa0;9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clause 31: Abolition of office of Chief Executive of Skills Funding ]]]The apprenticeship funding is system is complex and poorly understood by employers – one of our key policy priorities in this area is a simplified system. The abolition of this role is a practical measure which will help achieve a simpler relationship between the Skills Funding Agency and BIS – an aim which CBI fully supports.

[[[&#xa0;]]]10.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clause 32: Further and higher education sectors: reduction of burdens ]]]Reforms which allow further education colleges to be more flexible and responsive to employer needs should deliver better outcomes for the individuals studying, as well as the businesses seeking highly skilled, well-equipped employees. Alongside this flexibility, business needs assurance that further education staff are capable of providing high quality teaching and training. This will be provided by the new Education and Training Foundation which has been established to give colleges greater support and guidance on developing their staff. This reform will extend to further education colleges the trust instilled in universities to appoint staff, without detailed requirements set out in statute.&#xa0;11.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clause 33: Schools: reduction of burdens]]]Reducing the burden on schools – and delegating and devolving powers to governing bodies and to headteachers – is absolutely the right approach and one that business supports.&#xa0; And the measures set out at Clause 33 and in Schedule 14 are a part of this.&#xa0; It will be important, however, that government ensures that the right safeguards are in place to ensure that schools are properly supported in the new educational landscape.&#xa0; This must include championing the importance of good governance and effective governing bodies and promoting the continuous professional development of school leaders.&#xa0;12.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Clause 58: Exercise of regulatory functions: economic growth]]]Business believes that regulation has an important role within the economy: providing a framework for markets to work, setting standards and providing protections to individuals and consumers. Regulation, enforcement and regulators’ engagement with industry impacts business behaviour and therefore wider economic conditions. It is for these reasons business welcomed the proposal that non-economic regulators have a duty to regard the impact of their actions on economic growth. &#xa0;13.&#xa0;&#xa0; A regulator’s primary duty of protection is not incompatible with the aim of supporting economic growth and it is important to state that giving regulators a complementary economic duty should not undermine their primary duty. Rather it would ensure that regulators strike a balance between these two with the aim of preventing sub-optimal regulatory decisions or practices that hamper economic growth. For some regulators this is already taken into account in their existing practices, in other cases this should provide an impetus for regulators to view themselves as within – not outside of – the UK economy. Therefore, the CBI supports a principles-based, statutory duty for non-economic regulators being introduced in this Bill. &#xa0;14.&#xa0;&#xa0; In order for a new duty to be effective its objective must be clear. In the present drafting there appears to be two objectives of the duty:  having regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth and, underpinning that, exercising regulatory functions in a proportionate manner. The latter is a principle of good regulation which all regulators should adhere to – which does, indirectly, aid the better functioning of the economy – while an explicit ‘growth duty’ should ensure that a regulators’ behaviour supports the sustainable, long-term growth of the UK economy. &#xa0;15.&#xa0;&#xa0; Enshrining both of these duties in legislation would be a welcome step. But while they are interconnected – good regulatory practice underpins economic growth – it would be clearer if they were separated and the application of both duties targeted accordingly. For example, a better regulation duty promoting proportionality could be applied to all regulators, while a duty to support UK economic growth could be targeted towards regulators where this would be most meaningful and have the greatest economic impact. &#xa0;16.&#xa0;&#xa0; The CBI’s submission to the Better Regulation Delivery Office consultation on the duty to have regard to growth highlighted the blurring of these two concepts in the original proposal and recommended a clearer wording and targeting for the ‘growth duty’ element. The growth duty needs to provide regulators with the legal certainty to underpin their actions and the flexibility to apply it according to their specific regulatory duties. It could therefore help if the wording of a growth duty could, for example, require regulators ‘to support and encourage the sustainable development of the United Kingdom economy in general’. &#xa0;17.&#xa0;&#xa0; To be meaningful businesses believe that an explicit growth duty should be applied where it can provide the greatest support to private-sector growth. CBI members therefore believe that some differentiation between regulators would be helpful in applying the growth duty. The purpose of differentiation is simply to recognise that the regulatory functions of the non-economic regulators vary significantly and that, as a result, their application of a growth duty and its impact will differ. &#xa0;18.&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the variation amongst the non-economic regulators, the CBI has proposed that the applicability of a growth duty could be targeted on the individual regulator, according to the regulator’s proximity to market and economic impact. The purpose of such an approach is to ensure that a growth duty is carefully defined, targeted and supported by guidance for the regulators who can deploy it effectively. Otherwise the growth duty would be undermined. For example, where businesses do not see it as relevant or meaningful for those who regulate them or if it created extra regulatory burden without having any tangible economic impact, the concept of a growth duty would be weakened. &#xa0;19.&#xa0;&#xa0; Regulators, whose decisions and practices can impact on competitive behaviour in a sector or the economy as a whole, wider economic stability or on the attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest are those for whom a growth duty is the most relevant. These bodies operate very close to the market and their economic impact is very clear: the growth duty is therefore an important and meaningful concept for them. The Pensions Regulator (tPR) and the Groceries Code Adjudicator exemplify some of those bodies that have a very direct impact on the economy. &#xa0;20.&#xa0;&#xa0; For regulators who may be balancing preservation, individual or environmental protection, planning, or sustainability issues, business believe a growth duty should apply and would welcome recognition and understanding that decisions have taken account of what will support and encourage the sustainable development of the UK economy. However, because these bodies operate at a slight distance from the market – their economic impact is more indirect – it is worth recognising that the impact of a growth duty will differ for this type of organisations. This could be reflected in the wording of the duty or simply in the supporting guidance and communication. &#xa0;21.&#xa0;&#xa0; CBI members feel that there will be certain regulators for whom a growth duty is unlikely to be relevant or helpful. While recognising that all regulators, through their policies, regulations and enforcement behaviours have some degree of influence on the UK economy, there is a point at which the regulator’s behaviour is so far removed from the market and wider UK economy that a growth duty would lack meaning. Bodies such as Ofqual, the Office for Fair Access and the Care Quality Commission would fall into this category. &#xa0;22.&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, there will need to be clear communication to regulators and the regulated entities about new duties. Currently, there is some ambiguity amongst businesses and policymakers about the impact and application of the growth duty. The scrutiny of the Bill in this pre-legislative phase and during the parliamentary process will help to clarify this, as will supporting guidance in due course.

[[[To underpin a truly demand-led system, businesses and ministers need to devise a much simpler funding system that will empower employers to bring in high-quality provision that is relevant and directly addresses the needs of their business]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Businesses should be trusted to set the expected standards that underpin the apprenticeship programme]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;There is an urgent need to refocus the system so that it responds effectively to the demands of business. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Exhibit 1: Employers are invested in apprenticeships that deliver substantial new skills]]]“As a company, serving an industry that relies on having a skilled, competent and qualified workforce to deliver its business objectives, a successful apprenticeship scheme has been and continues to be a key focus of our strategy. [Company name] takes its investment in its people very seriously with the engineering academy being just one part of our learning and development offering, with our leadership academy forming the other part”.  

[[[HR Director, Engineering Firm]]]&#xa0;“People are an absolute priority for [company name] and fundamental to our success. Central to our vision and aspirations is our policy of providing career opportunities that allow all employees to develop to their full potential. [Company name] invests over £30million annually in training our employees as they must be expertly skilled to fulfil the high expectations of our customers. For their hard work and achievements our employees deserve to be recognised beyond our company.”

[[[Businesses have the appetite for greater involvement in the apprenticeships system, but we need structures at the national and local level to harness employer involvement]]]&#xa0;

[[[Exhibit 2: The UKCES Employer Ownership of Skills Pilots]]]

[[[Nissan]]]The north east based car manufacturer is set to need 2,000 new staff to meet production demands over the next two years, a huge challenge given regional skills shortages and a need to boost skills levels in a supply chain that provides around 80% of its components. Their winning EOP bid will see Nissan develop four new training programmes to boost skills at all levels of the organisation from existing workers to new recruits and across their supply chain.&#xa0;

[[[Siemens ]]]The successful bid of CBI member Siemens will see them work with organisations including sector skills council Semta to extend its re-employment and apprenticeship programmes to its key suppliers – a great example of how innovative skills provision can support a sector&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Improving trust and confidence requires high standards of inspection and rigorous assessment, but the government should avoid proxies for quality unless driven by demand from businesses]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
