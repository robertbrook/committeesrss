[normal]Submission from Core Cities Group (FD08)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Core Cities are a unique and united voice to promote the role of our cities in driving economic growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We represent the City Authorities at the centre of England’s eight largest economies outside London: Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester,
[normal] Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Core Cities Group develop evidence-based policies that support the critical role of these important cities in delivering the country’s full economic potential, creating more jobs and improving people’s lives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Our cit
[normal]ies already contribute more than a quarter of England’s wealth, yet by international standards they are underperforming, largely due to the heavily centralised state system within which they operate in England.  With devolution to Scotland, and further dec
[normal]entralisation now on the table for Wales, this constitutional imbalance is further heightened, which has real economic consequences for the whole of the UK.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Core Cities together with their surrounding urban areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Core Cities are a vital delivery partner for Government and its agencies and are best placed to improve the UK’s economic fortunes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They already deliver an enormous amount for the country, but with the right freedoms and flexibilities in place, 
[normal]they could do a lot more.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By 2030 – within the timeframe for delivering HS2 - the Core Cities urban areas could put 1.16 million more jobs and £222 billion into the economy.  That is equivalent to the entire economy of Denmark and equal to almost £14,000 
[normal]for every person living in a Core City urban area – £52,500 for an average family.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Core Cities have built on this experience by setting out how specific policy changes could significantly improve economic growth and support public sector reform, enablin
[normal]g Core Cities to outperform the national economy and to become financially self-sustaining by 2030. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These are set out in a Growth Prospectus, “Competitive Cities, Prosperous People: A Core Cities Prospectus for Growth” which was launched at our summit on
[normal] 21
[normal]st
[normal] November 2013. The prospectus can be found at our website at 
[normal]http://www.corecities.com/what-we-do/publications/core-citi
[normal]es-growth-prospectus-competitive-cities-prosperous-people
[normal] 
[normal]and forms the background to our submission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These proposals build on recent national policy shifts like the City Deals, bespoke packages for decentralisation of powers and resources from central
[normal] to local government to drive growth, which have been welcomed by all the Core Cities. Core Cities want to build on the success of this process, seeking to go further, provide more jobs and growth, and improve lives by reforming the public sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Core Cities 
[normal]welcome this Inquiry and the opportunity it provides to set out our response to the Committee’s questions.  We 
[normal]recognise that, with no end to the financial constraints in sight, the current situation
[normal], particularly for large ur
[normal]ban authorities which have been disproportionately affected by budget cuts,
[normal] is not sustainable. Across all areas of provision, public services 
[normal]are stretched to the limit
[normal] under the weight of rising demand, dwindling resources and the increasingly complex ne
[normal]eds of the most vulnerable
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The scale of the financial crisis since 2008 means we need a new path for the national economy based on doing more to get jobs and growth across all our major cities
[normal]. To do this, cities need to be 
[normal]freed from 
[normal]central 
[normal]Governme
[normal]nt 
[normal]restraints.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Past political leaders of English cities had greater direct responsibility, and were much more able to work with industrialists to support growth, while bringing in reforms designed to improve people’s lives. 
[normal]There is a strong relationship between the ability of cities to drive growth, the levels of local financial control and the freedom to make policies match the needs of places, and with the right changes, 
[normal]England can once again be home to a new economic rev
[normal]olution by giving our city leaders the tools to create the environment in which businesses can thrive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The amount of money cities control directly in England is very small compared to other countries and national policies don’t cater for the strengths or 
[normal]needs of different places. Often, they take a blanket approach, treating everywhere the same. There is a lot of evidence that national agencies struggle to join up with local agencies in England, resulting in duplication and inefficiency.
[normal]  
[normal]It also means th
[normal]at cities and the people who live there don’t decide what’s best for them, which ignores distinct local needs, wastes public money and gets poor results.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In England, cities only directly control about 5% of all the taxes raised from local people and busin
[normal]esses, with 95% going straight to the Government (although recent change means some business rates are now retained locally, instead of grants to fund services). 
[normal] 
[normal]According to the OECD, compared to English figures the level of taxes controlled at the local
[normal] or regional level is about 10 times greater in Canada, 7.5 in the US, 7 in Sweden, almost 6 in Germany, and over 5 times greater across the OECD on average. This means English cities have nothing like the level of local financial control enjoyed by cities
[normal] abroad and are not competing on a level playing field.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]Moreover, Core Cities are also the channel and catalyst for wider sub-regional growth which 
[normal]is demonstrated through many and continuous economic analyses from both led by the cities themselves (e.g. the Manchester Independent Economic Review) and from other independent sources (e.g. on-going economic forecasts for Core Cities by Oxford Economics)
[normal].  Governance arrangemenmts that support this wider role are in place and developing across all the Core Cities through Combined Authorities (one in operation, others in development) and other partnership structures, including close working relationships o
[normal]n strategic policy with LEPs.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]W
[normal]e welcome the continued waves of devolution to Scotland and Wales but there is an imbalance which needs to be addressed to ensure that English cities are freed up to be able to deliver on their ambitious plans for jobs
[normal] and growth, for the benefit of the country. One of the routes to support this would be to introduce more radical reform to the central-local relationship. The Political and Constitutional Reform Committee has put forward the case for ‘codification’, to en
[normal]shrine the independence of local government and in particular to ensure greater financial
[normal] 
[normal]autonomy than currently exists, which the Core Cities support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the strongest cases that can be made for devolution is the ability of those closest to the 
[normal]point of delivery to avoid gaps in service delivery and conversely to reduce any duplication
[normal] between national and local delivery agencies
[normal]. This is particularly clear in areas such as training and employment provision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly, business support 
[normal]will be
[normal] strengthened where provision is devolved to the local level
[normal], aligning it more closely with local need, delivering bespoke as well as nationally consistent services
[normal]. This can help to rebalance economies, not just geographically but also sectorally, with th
[normal]ose best placed to understand local business need (in the context of the demands of the wider economy) being able to tailor support programmes to meet this need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As b
[normal]usiness and business support is central to the economic success of the Core 
[normal]Cities, we
[normal] we
[normal]lcome 
[normal]the 
[normal]measures set out in the Heseltine Review which support devolution of business support services
[normal]. W
[normal]e would welcome 
[normal]many of the
[normal] recommendations relating to 
[normal]supporting local business in terms of Localism and the role of Whitehal
[normal]l and the priv
[normal]ate sect
[normal]or in driving growth, In particular, we would support the recommen
[normal]d
[normal]ations set out under the heading of “Government and growth – catalyst, enabler, partner”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Building on these recommendations, 
[normal]Core Cities have developed a series of proposals that will help
[normal] grow businesses and support
[normal] 
[normal]innovation through be
[normal]tter support for local business centred around a 
[normal] single ‘Business Growth Hub’ in each Core City area
[normal],
[normal] but coordinated between
[normal] 
[normal]all Core Cities, to provide:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We note that similar recommendations will form part of the Wave 2 City Deals with all cities agreeing a City Deal benefitting from a Growth Hub in their area
[normal].  However, with
[normal]out
[normal] the extension of this principle to 
[normal]the Core Cities, the biggest economic hubs outside London will remain without an essential business support focus that will exist in areas with important, but smaller, economies.
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 [bold]How devolved areas would be defined geographically and set up?[bold]Core Cities have made consistent, evidence-based arguments for a more spatially aware approach to policy making at both the local and national levels, based on meaningful geographies.   The primary geographic lens for this is generally considered to be the
[normal] local labour market area, which is essentially the same as the functioning economic, travel to work and 
[normal]wider 
[normal]housing market geography.  We do not however think that these should be defined at the national level, through a ‘one size fits all’ approach.
[normal]De
[normal]volved areas should therefore be defined initially by asking local partners what geography would be most meaningful for fiscal devolution.  Such a request could set out certain principles that Government expects to be met, both in terms of geography and go
[normal]vernance.  For example, an area would need to demonstrate how it would operate 
[normal]fiscal reforms 
[normal]across a functioning labour market geography.  This makes sense in terms of the fiscal base, as typically the majority of money will be earned and spent within a 
[normal]functioning economic area.
[normal]Therefore devolved areas should be set up through nationally set standards and principles which are locally negotiated and defined.
[normal]3.2 [bold]How public services, including employment, skills and welfare, should be organised to complem[bold]ent devolution[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Core Cities have developed policies on how we think skills and employment systems (including all education, learning, welfare to work, job match and job search services) could work differently, coming together within a single framework
[normal] that ali
[normal]gns national and local funds, spending them more efficiently and improving outcomes, 
[normal]get
[normal]ting
[normal] more people into jobs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This model would complement greater fiscal devolution, because
[normal] t
[normal]he 
[normal]supply of skills within a 
[normal]local labour market
[normal] needs to reflect 
[normal]more closely the demands of that labour market and its employers
[normal], and the largely nationally controlled delivery model 
[normal]is currently failing
[normal] to meet the specific needs of cities, businesses and individuals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This results in an over-supply of skills in some 
[normal]areas and an under supply in others with, for example, 17% of job vacancies nationally remaining unfilled due to skills-gaps.  Although the current model might be viewed as highly localist in one respect – that is, that the learner chooses their course – w
[normal]ithout much better signposting and a stronger relationship between supply (learning providers) and demand (businesses), learners cannot make informed choices and many are effectively excluded from employment in areas they might otherwise have chosen to aim
[normal] for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Core Cities devolved model
[normal] also 
[normal]recognises
[normal] that 
[normal]welfare dependency undermines economic capa
[normal]city.  T
[normal]he 
[normal]current 
[normal]welfare to work and employment support system
[normal]s
[normal], which aim to help the unemployed
[normal] 
[normal]and excluded move towards employment a
[normal]nd economic 
[normal]independence
[normal],
[normal] are
[normal] not 
[normal]delivering the
[normal] 
[normal]results that Core Cities and their residents need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In view of the above, we have 
[normal]propose
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]5-
[normal]year ‘Skills and Labour Market Agreements’
[normal] where 
[normal]Core Cities will 
[normal]work 
[normal]in partnership LEPs, 
[normal]local business and the full range 
[normal]of local providers to build a common commissioning framework, removing duplication, increasing skills and employment, and reducing dependency on public services. SLMAs s
[normal]hould be built on the following:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](i) 
[normal]A single plan and inve
[normal]stment framework for skills
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A locally commissioned Work Programme
[normal]Core Cities should commission the Work Programme
[normal] post-2016, and embed it into a 
[normal]wider system of employability support, with the 
[normal]option for a single performance 
[normal]framework across all of the Core Cities, moving people fro
[normal]m welfare to work.
[normal]  Where cities have more control of welfare to work programmes, results have improved significantly.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, where the Youth Contract has been delivered by national providers, on average 27% of young people have found training or 
[normal]employment
[normal]; t
[normal]he Newcastle-Gateshead council’s scheme increased this to 47%, and the Leeds-Bradford scheme to 57%.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Public sector reform: a whole-s
[normal]ystem
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]place-based 
[normal]approach
[normal]Core Cities aim is to
[normal] align skills and employment provision to other services, inc
[normal]luding
[normal] 
[normal]education, care and health, wrapping services a
[normal]round individuals and families, dealing 
[normal]with household poverty, improving outcomes and re
[normal]ducing spending over the longer 
[normal]term. We are not simply proposing to shift responsibili
[normal]ty for the existing system
[normal], but 
[normal]to wholly improve and integrate skills and employment delivery on the ground.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]More widely, we would propose that 
[normal]a
[normal] ‘Place Based Settlement’ should be made with each Core City (
[normal]based on Community Budget-style models, 
[normal]effectively a single
[normal] 
[normal]way of 
[normal]budgeting across
[normal] public services), allowing issues like ‘troubled families’
[normal], 
[normal]health and social care, welfare, unemployment, crime, to 
[normal]be dealt with in a
[normal]n
[normal] holistic and 
[normal]joined up way, breaking down the silos of national departments and their agencies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This 
[normal]relies on a significant reform of the public sector, as set out above, 
[normal]including
[normal] integrating services for health and social care at the local level, across meaningful geographies.  
[normal]As an example, modelling demonstrates that by taking an integrated approach
[normal] to health and social care for the frail and elderly, delivery costs could be reduced by 15%.  That would be equivalent to Newcastle saving £44 million and £29.5 million on its health and social care expenditure respectively.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As far as possible, p
[normal]ublic mo
[normal]ney spent across a city for a specific 
[normal]set of 
[normal]purpose
[normal]s should take a ‘whole system’ approach to budgeting, 
[normal]and 
[normal]be 
[normal]spent ac
[normal]cording to single investment plans, agreed between cities, local and national agencies 
[normal]and the Government
[normal],
[normal] but based on local needs.
[normal]  
[normal]A
[normal]s an example, a
[normal]t the moment there are 36 separate funds just for housing, and in other
[normal] areas it is equally
[normal] complex.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A new approach to procurement
[normal]Core Cities
[normal] and Government could explore how
[normal] public procurement 
[normal]for major projects, for example construction
[normal] and regeneration, might be aligned within a place 
[normal]to maximise
[normal] 
[normal]training and employment d
[normal]ividends, e.g. apprenticeships.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 [bold]How devolved areas should be governed, including the role of business in decision making; how devolved areas would be held to [bold]account?[bold]Robust and effective area-based governance mechanisms have and are being adopted across the Core Cities wider urban areas.  Greater Manchester has instituted a Combined Authority, with several cities set to do the same in the near future.  Other c
[normal]ities have negotiated robust local partnerships, and relationships with LEPs are quickly and positively developing.
[normal]Core Cities see the future of local leadership as an almost indivisible partnership between civic and business leadership, coming together 
[normal]w
[normal]ith the third sector 
[normal]to create - and become custodians of - a shared vision for a place, its economy and its people.  Our view is that, once this has happened, the role of national Government is to get behind that vision and support it.
[normal]Nevertheless, Gover
[normal]nment will want to ensure a high level of accountability in regard of fiscal devolution.  Although the role of business leadership is key, and is demonstrably part of the decision making process across Core Cities, accountability for fiscal devolution must
[normal] ultimately also be linked to democratic institutions, namely local (or combined) authorities.
[normal]Fiscal devolution will strengthen local democracy, making local government even more accountable to local people, and giving electorates a greater stake in makin
[normal]g sure they have their say.  Currently, no matter whom the electorate vote for locally, most of what they receive by way of services is decided upon nationally.  Fiscal 
[normal]devolution increases local choice and strengthens overall accountability for how 
[normal]taxes 
[normal]raised from people in a place are spent in that place.
[normal]National principles creating a consistent set of standards 
[normal]should guide this process, rather than a strictly prescribed single governance model that is then implemented top down.
[normal]  This should not inclu
[normal]de a nationally-set framework for referendums where increases in taxes are to be considered, which should be a matter for local decision for those taxes in local control.
[normal]3.4 [bold]The strength of the evidence that devolution would lead to economic growth, local[bold] improvement and better local governance, including examples of what areas could do with their new powers such as use them to invest in infrastructure and local services[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Core Cities acknowledge 
[normal]that there has been 
[normal]positive change in national policy. I
[normal]n particular the City Deals process has been welcomed by all the cities and is already delivering growth, jobs and training into each of our urban areas. 
[normal] Although many schemes will take a decade or more to complete, the City Deals already provide substant
[normal]ial evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a greater focus on cities and on devolution within the thinking of Government and the Opposition, who all supported the Core Cities Amendment to the Localism Act which has paved the way for further devolution. The Heseltine Review, 
[normal]Lord Adonis’ Growth Review and other
[normal] initiative
[normal]s all point in the same direction. 
[normal]This perhaps reflects a recognition that the centralised economic system we have has run its course.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the “
[normal]The 
[normal]State of the 
[normal]English Cities
[normal]” (Office of the Deputy Prime Min
[normal]ister, 2006), the lead author Professor 
[normal]Michael Parkinson sets out compelling evidence that
[normal] many 
[normal]second tier 
[normal]English cities are not performing as well as their
[normal] 
[normal]competitors in Europe and beyond. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] 
[normal]norm
[normal] in continental Europe 
[normal]– and indeed in developed 
[normal]countries throughout the world - is for a much more
[normal] decentralise
[normal]d model of financial control and decision-making
[normal]. The evidence 
[normal]strongly 
[normal]suggests that where cities 
[normal]have
[normal] more freedom and resources they have responded by being more
[normal] 
[normal]proactive, e
[normal]ntrepreneurial 
[normal]and successful. German cities are amongst t
[normal]he most successful
[normal] 
[normal]in Europe, 
[normal]and it is no
[normal] coincidence that Germany is also one of the most decentralised 
[normal]state system
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in Europe. The renaissance of Barcelona in part stems from the move towards
[normal] decentr
[normal]alisation 
[normal]and the lessening of the grip of the capital city, Madrid. In
[normal] 
[normal]addition, some European governments have been moving towards more long
[normal] 
[normal]term
[normal] 
[normal]contractual relationships between national and local government to
[normal] 
[normal]deliver improved urban economic performance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The d
[normal]ifficulty with providing evidence for making the shift to decentralisation from a centralised position is that most of the international examples we have are historic, that is, countries that have always had more devolved models.  One exception is Japan, a
[normal]nd a paper on the Japanese experience of decentralisation 
[normal]can be found at our website at 
[normal]http://www.corecities.com/what-we-do/publications/growth-second-tier-cities-urban-policy-lessons-japan
[normal]The view of the Japan Local Government Centre, based in London, is that fiscal decentralisation in Japan, over an explicit 
[normal]national 
[normal]policy programme l
[normal]asting more than a decade, has clearly led to much more effective and efficient spending on social cohesion programm
[normal]es, and 
[normal]has helped to drive local economic growth, although the same period has been one of the most challenging for Japan due to regional a
[normal]nd global economic forces.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]International comparisons also demonstrate how out of step with other developed nations England is in terms of decentralisation. 
[normal]According to the OECD, the level of taxes controlled at the local or regional level is about 10 tim
[normal]es greater in Canada, 7.5 in the US, 7 in Sweden, almost 6 in Germany, and over 5 times greater across the OECD on average. 
[normal] 
[normal]New Zealand is 
[normal]probably the only developed country which has a more 
[normal]centralised state system than England, a country which has a po
[normal]pulation roughly the same as the Leeds City Region.
[normal]  Even cities in China have a greater degree of financial freedom and flexibility.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome continued waves of devolution to Scotland and Wales but there is 
[normal]now a significant con
[normal]s
[normal]titutional
[normal] imbalance which needs to be addressed to ensure that English cities are freed up to be able to deliver on their ambitious plans for jobs and growth, for the benefit of the country. One of the routes to support this would be to introduce more radical refor
[normal]m to the central-local relationship. The Political and Constitutional Reform Committee has put forward the case for ‘codification’, 
[normal]a legally binding agreement
[normal] between local and national government setting
[normal] out roles and responsibilities 
[normal]to enshrine the ind
[normal]ependence of local government and in particular to ensure greater financial autonomy than currently exists, which the Core Cities support. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Core Cities’ view is that Government should also c
[normal]hange Parliamentary Standing Orders so ministers can’t constan
[normal]tly question the decisions of local politicians without good reason.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other 
[normal]evidence that devolution strengthens economic performance a
[normal]nd local improvement is set out in the
[normal] paper “
[normal]Second Tier Cities in Europe: In An Age of Austerity Why Invest Beyond the 
[normal]Capitals?” (ESPON &amp; European Institute of Urban Affairs,
[normal] 
[normal]Liverpool John Moores University, 2012),
[normal] where
[normal] the authors present evidence from a thorough two-year study across Europe
[normal] that 
[normal]deconcentration of investment and decentralisation of decision
[normal] 
[normal]making
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] resources 
[normal]lead
[normal]s
[normal] to more high performing second tier cities
[normal], and that overconcentration in one city is ultimately bad for national economies
[normal]. Institutional and
[normal] 
[normal]financial decentralisation from national to regional and local levels of government will reduce
[normal] 
[normal]the costs of overconcentration on the capital and maximise the contribution of second tier
[normal] 
[normal]cities to national co
[normal]mpetitiveness and welfare
[normal].
[normal]  This wa
[normal]s a very sophisticated 
[normal]study and makes a compelling evidence-based case.
[normal]  
[normal]It shows that
[normal] 
[normal]encouraging high 
[normal]performance in a range of citi
[normal]es, including but not exclusive to 
[normal]the capital city
[normal],
[normal] produces
[normal] 
[normal]national benefits. If the gap between second-tier cities and capitals is very la
[normal]rge, this will
[normal] limit national
[normal] 
[normal]performance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK
[normal] economy 
[normal]is
[normal] spatially
[normal] 
[normal]and structu
[normal]rally unbalanced
[normal], which has been recognised by Government and the Opposition.  The challenge for national policy is 
[normal]to build upon
[normal] 
[normal]the strengths of London as a successful global city 
[normal]while not neglecting the rest of the urban system, 
[normal]maximising
[normal] the contribu
[normal]tion of Core Cities. The relationship between London and the
[normal] 
[normal]Core Cities should not be seen as zero-s
[normal]um but as win-win. The prize
[normal] is to grow the overall national urban
[normal] 
[normal]economic out
[normal]put
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In view of this evidence Core Cities have set out a number of proposal
[normal]s in our Growth Prospectus with the aims of cities delivering an additional 1.16 million jobs and £222 billion into the economy by 2030.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The following examples highlight some of the areas that could bene
[normal]fit from this devolved approach
[normal], and further evidenc
[normal]e in each area is provided in our Prospectus for Growth which is appended to this submission
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A number of studies
[normal] indicate t
[normal]hat taking an integrated approach to health and social care for the frail and elderly could save up to 15% on delivery costs. This is equivalent to Newcastle saving £44 million and £29.5 million per year on its health and social care expenditure respective
[normal]ly
[normal]. Based on the Troubled Families Community Budgets pilots, Core Cities could potentially avoid costs of between £62 million and £75 million per annum for every 1000 troubled families successfully worked with
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.5 [bold]The impact on areas not included in an[bold]y new devolution arrangements, including those on cities’ borders and those affected by resulting changes to national fiscal equalisation and distribution arrangements?[bold]The London Finance Commission’s findings have stated that the effec
[normal]t on the local 
[normal]government finance system should be neutral at the starting point.  The amount that cities receive through fiscal devolution would be off-set in corresponding reductions in direct funding (i.e. grant), which would need to be agreed through detailed negotia
[normal]tion.  This would leave the total available for other authority areas unaffected.
[normal]Our own forecasts and modelling suggest that, following devolution, cities would improve growth and employment, and reduce dependency on public services.  This would have a p
[normal]ositive net effect on the 
[normal]national 
[normal]public balance sheet through a reduced call on welfare, health and other funded services, and corresponding increases in income tax, National Insurance and corporation tax.  This would effectively lead to more ‘in the sys
[normal]tem’.
[normal]Governance arrangements across functioning economic areas where Core City partner authorities are included in plans for devolution (dealt with above) would effectively deal with any issues resulting from the changes across that geography.  Many of th
[normal]e Core Cities proposals are designed to ope
[normal]rate at these wider geographies, although this should be a matter for local choice.
[normal]The economic benefits of growth are likely to be felt beyond the travel to work areas around Core Cities. However, this is not an
[normal] argument just for a passive ‘trickle down’ approach to achieving wider sub-national economic benefits, and Government should encourage surrounding towns and rural areas and their LEPs to work with Core Cities actively on their long term economic strategie
[normal]s to ensure maximum regional benefit.  
[normal]There is significant evidence to back up this assertion, for example in ‘City Links: Integration and Isolation’ (Centre for Cities 2008), Paul Hildreth asserts that: 
[normal]“
[normal]A synergistic relationship, such as that which exi
[normal]sts between London and
[normal] 
[normal]Reading, allows the smaller city direct access to the markets, skills and
[normal] 
[normal]specialisations of its larger neighbour, in turn giving it the opportunity to
[normal] 
[normal]develop its own specialised 
[normal]growth momentum.”
[normal] 
[normal]Fiscal devolution in fact incentive
[normal]s this kind of collaborative working, beginning to solve the issue of how LEPs can operate together across wider geographies.
[normal]The issue of ‘displacement’, moving economic activity from one area to another, will be raised during the debate on fiscal devolution.  Core Cities have long debated this issue in regard to Tax Increment Financing, which we do not rehearse here, but on whi
[normal]ch we are happy to supply further information.  National policy should however recognise that the 
[normal]real 
[normal]displacement we are seeking to stop is that of business from the UK to other countries, and the displacement we are seeking to achieve is in the opposite
[normal] direction.  Our real competitors are abroad, not at home, and if a business is ready to relocate for whatever reason, we should make sure it is within our own economy.  
[normal]3.6 [bold]Whether reform of the existing system (for example re-banding council tax, revalu[bold]ing business rates, Community Budgets, Government grants, formulas and taxes such as Stamp Duty) would be a precursor to, or run along with, large-scale institutional change?[bold] [bold]Cities would prefer a situation where change is instituted at scale, both reform
[normal]ing the current system and institutions, through a constitutional shift which reflects Government commitments to ‘radical devolution’ (e.g. in ‘Unlocking Growth in Cities’ Cabinet Office 2011).  
[normal]That does not however mean we should wait until all issues a
[normal]re resolved in theory before anything happens in practice, which is simply a recipe for prevarication, and for delay which cities, their economies and services cannot risk.
[normal]We should therefore have a clear and shared timetable for devolution 
[normal], which we wou
[normal]ld strongly recommend and be willing to work on with Government.  Some changes, for example the devolution of property taxes, should be possible to begin without large scale institutional change.  Other shifts, for example Community Budgets and Place Based
[normal] Settlements, will 
[normal]themselves 
[normal]lead to 
[normal]evolutionary 
[normal]institutional change through a different regime of 
[normal]shared 
[normal]targets, tasking and incentives.  
[normal]Other changes, e.g. more radical integration of health and social care, will be dependent on institutional change.  
[normal]Throughout the devolution debate and any future programme it will be important to focus on the outcomes we are trying to achieve in order t
[normal]o avoid becoming bogged down in trying to resolve all the institutional and governance issues we think might be important, before making any change.  Focusing on the outcome and beginning with pragmatic solutions, forerunner schemes and pilots is the only 
[normal]way that change can reasonably evolve, and will create a virtuous circle of implementation, learning and improvement.
[normal]Building on previous initiatives such as City Deals, Government should recognise that there is no 
[normal]“one size fits all” approach 
[normal]to local de
[normal]volution. Some areas may w
[normal]ish
[normal] to move further and faster than others
[normal], taking on more responsibility within compressed timescales, 
[normal] 
[normal]where risk is balanced with reward, allowing cities to share properly in the dividends of success e.g. by accessing uplifts i
[normal]n taxation, or sharing in savings which they can then reinvest.  
[normal] 
[normal]3.7 [bold]What changes should be made to devolved authorities borrowing powers?[bold]Currently local authorities have access to borrowing through the Prudential Code.  No limits should be set on local
[normal] authority borrowing through this robust process.  Local authorities should also be able to borrow against future revenue streams using this process, particularly in order to invest in infrastructure, growth and jobs.  Although there has now been some rela
[normal]xation of limits within Autumn Statement 2013, the cap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing is an example of an unnecessary threshold which restricts growth and construction, and sets limits on local self-determination.
[normal]3.8 [bold]The scope for areas to introduce[bold] new taxes and funding methods such as bonds and crowd-sourcing, fees and charges?[bold]New financing mechanisms would instantly be enabled by the devolution of property taxes leading to increased investment in infrastructure, bringing growth and jobs and contr
[normal]ibuting to the national economy.  For example, further Tax Increment Financing schemes would be made possible by devolution of property taxes, enabling cities to hypothecate finance over longer periods than is currently the case (other than in the three Ci
[normal]ty Deal TIF schemes in Newcastle, Sheffield and Nottingham).  This would assist in national programmes like HS2, providing investment tools for new station sites and related regeneration.
[normal]We are not aware of specific restrictions on the use of bonds as met
[normal]hods of borrowing for cities.  The reason they are rarely used is partly because of the necessary scale to make them really viable, and partly because of the additional cost of repayments, compared for example to the Public Works Loan Board.  The LGA is in
[normal]vestigating the creation of a municipal bonds vehicle which may progress this.  However, the main restriction on innovative methods of on or off balance sheet borrowing is quite simply the ability of cities to pay it back.  Currently cities lack the revenu
[normal]e streams to do this, and fiscal devolution will enable this to happen.
[normal]Government should not however be concerned about large increases in borrowing.  The use of the Prudential Code is a robust process, and the numbers of viable schemes on which cities wo
[normal]uld feel able to use mechanisms like TIF is relatively small in the context of national borrowing and spending.  Even with the full suite of property taxes being devolved to cities, we are still only talking about 12% of the total tax base of a city being 
[normal]locally retained.
[normal]Within the context of robust local governance and accountability, and the support of business leadership for strategic plans, we see no reason why ‘devolved areas’ and their democratic institutions should not enjoy the maximum freedom pos
[normal]sible to deploy their resources in support of local growth and jobs, to raise reasonable fees and charges in support of this and to explore alternative funding streams such as crowd-sourcing and philanthropy.
[normal]Although Core Cities, along with London Governm
[normal]ent, have initially called for devolution of property taxes, there are a range of other taxes which should be also explored within a locally devolved context.  New taxes like tourism tax, popular in North America, should be explored, where a levy on e.g. h
[normal]otel rooms is reinvested to support the visitor economy.  
[normal]Although Core Cities recognise there is some genuine complexity around a localised element of other national taxes, this approach is successful in many other countries.  We would therefore also lik
[normal]e to see a fuller exploration of how other national taxes might incorporate a localised component, e.g. for VAT or its replacement with a local sales tax, and a localised element of income tax.
[normal]3.9  [bold]The extent to which high-performing areas would be expect[bold]ed to redistribute their proceeds of growth via the Treasury?[bold]The current local government finance system operates a top up and tariff scheme that might evolve to deal with this issue, and although focused currently on business rates, has essentially creat
[normal]ed a framework through which any fiscal reform might operate.  However it should be recognised that the vast majority of the proceeds of growth - the 88% of taxation still not in local control - would in fact still return directly to Treasury, who would al
[normal]so share directly in some of the reductions in the need for high-dependency public services, achieved through devolved models.
[normal]3.10  [bold]What taxes might be devolved—for example council tax, stamp duty and business [bold]rates[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Increased inves
[normal]tment in growth relies 
[normal]on a stro
[normal]nger relationship between risk and reward for cities, allowing them to share in the dividends of growth.  Fiscal reform will achieve this, but also needs to be linked to a wider reform of the public sector in order to have maximum impact.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Core 
[normal]Cities have the capacity to
[normal] 
[normal]transform public
[normal] services and reduce the cost to
[normal] the state in the UK’s most populous
[normal] 
[normal]urban centres. To do this 
[normal]we need reform through certainty by
[normal] aligning public budgets across places with longer
[normal] 
[normal]term budget agreements
[normal] aligned to length of parliaments as well as i
[normal]mplement
[normal]ing place-
[normal]based budgets
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Cities could also
[normal] 
[normal]invest
[normal] and reinvest in growth at scale by
[normal] retaining a greater share in the
[normal] 
[normal]proceeds of growth and reform
[normal]. In particular, the following flexibilities could mak
[normal]e significant difference ahead of more comprehensive decentralisation:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tax Incremen
[normal]t Financing (TIF) – Core Cities
[normal] should determine which projec
[normal]ts to proceed with, within the Prudential B
[normal]orrowing code. The potential for locally led TIFs would be complemented by related devolved powers referred to above. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Property Taxes
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] full suite of property taxes (Council Tax, Business Rates, Stamp Duty Land T
[normal]ax, annual 
[normal]tax on enveloped dwellings a
[normal]nd Capital Gains Property Development T
[normal]ax) should be devolved to 
[normal]the Core Cities
[normal] giving
[normal] them 
[normal]responsibility for setting the tax rates and authority over all matters including revaluation, banding and discounts 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Council Tax - 
[normal]Council T
[normal]ax should be 
[normal]develope
[normal]d as a fully localised tax
[normal] 
[normal]with the Core Cities
[normal] given the power
[normal] to hold periodic revaluations (undertaken by the Valuation Office, according to national practice), to determine the number of bands, to set the ratio of tax from band to band and to set the tax rate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Business Rates - 
[normal]All
[normal] Business R
[normal]ates should be devolv
[normal]ed to 
[normal]the Core Cities with
[normal] appropriate governance, including the responsibility for the timing of revaluations. 
[normal]The cities
[normal] should be free to determine such issues as discounts and tax breaks, and should have the freedom to u
[normal]se business rates to undertake r
[normal]elevant interventions such as Enterprise Zones
[normal] and their proposed ‘Brownfield Development Zones.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Smaller Taxes – Core Cities should be given the powers to introduce smaller taxes agreed at local level e.g. hotel room tax, and 
[normal]Government should 
[normal]explore ot
[normal]her taxes having a local element such as VAT and income tax.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Community Budgets and City Deals - 
[normal]Central government should extend the remit and scale of C
[normal]ommunity Budget Pilots through 
[normal]devolution
[normal] from existing Whitehall 
[normal]budgets 
[normal]leading to comprehensive Pla
[normal]ce Based 
[normal]Settlements
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]It should be noted that recommendations regarding devolution of local taxation form part of a package of measures aimed at securing financial self-suffici
[normal]ency for the Core Cities which in turn benefits local communities.
[normal] It is import
[normal]ant to bear this in mind when considering the implications of tax revaluations wh
[normal]ich
[normal], taking an approach which does not end up having the perverse and anti-localist outcome of
[normal] reduc
[normal]ing
[normal] Local Authority income and
[normal] thereby
[normal] increas
[normal]ing
[normal] dependency on central Gov
[normal]ernment funding. As such, local taxation must be taken in the round 
[normal]with cities able to devise comprehensive strategies designed
[normal] to address local priorities in line with the overarching aim of financial self-sufficiency.
