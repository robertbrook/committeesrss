defaultSubmission from Core Cities Group (FD08)default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCore Cities are a unique and united voice to promote the role of our cities in driving economic growth.
default&#xa0;
default We represent the City Authorities at the centre of England’s eight largest economies outside London: Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester,
default Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCore Cities Group develop evidence-based policies that support the critical role of these important cities in delivering the country’s full economic potential, creating more jobs and improving people’s lives.
default&#xa0;
default Our cit
defaulties already contribute more than a quarter of England’s wealth, yet by international standards they are underperforming, largely due to the heavily centralised state system within which they operate in England.  With devolution to Scotland, and further dec
defaultentralisation now on the table for Wales, this constitutional imbalance is further heightened, which has real economic consequences for the whole of the UK.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Core Cities together with their surrounding urban areas:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCore Cities are a vital delivery partner for Government and its agencies and are best placed to improve the UK’s economic fortunes.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey already deliver an enormous amount for the country, but with the right freedoms and flexibilities in place, 
defaultthey could do a lot more.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy 2030 – within the timeframe for delivering HS2 - the Core Cities urban areas could put 1.16 million more jobs and £222 billion into the economy.  That is equivalent to the entire economy of Denmark and equal to almost £14,000 
defaultfor every person living in a Core City urban area – £52,500 for an average family.  
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCore Cities have built on this experience by setting out how specific policy changes could significantly improve economic growth and support public sector reform, enablin
defaultg Core Cities to outperform the national economy and to become financially self-sustaining by 2030. 
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese are set out in a Growth Prospectus, “Competitive Cities, Prosperous People: A Core Cities Prospectus for Growth” which was launched at our summit on
default 21
defaultst
default November 2013. The prospectus can be found at our website at 
defaulthttp://www.corecities.com/what-we-do/publications/core-citi
defaultes-growth-prospectus-competitive-cities-prosperous-people
default 
defaultand forms the background to our submission.
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese proposals build on recent national policy shifts like the City Deals, bespoke packages for decentralisation of powers and resources from central
default to local government to drive growth, which have been welcomed by all the Core Cities. Core Cities want to build on the success of this process, seeking to go further, provide more jobs and growth, and improve lives by reforming the public sector.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Core Cities 
defaultwelcome this Inquiry and the opportunity it provides to set out our response to the Committee’s questions.  We 
defaultrecognise that, with no end to the financial constraints in sight, the current situation
default, particularly for large ur
defaultban authorities which have been disproportionately affected by budget cuts,
default is not sustainable. Across all areas of provision, public services 
defaultare stretched to the limit
default under the weight of rising demand, dwindling resources and the increasingly complex ne
defaulteds of the most vulnerable
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe scale of the financial crisis since 2008 means we need a new path for the national economy based on doing more to get jobs and growth across all our major cities
default. To do this, cities need to be 
defaultfreed from 
defaultcentral 
defaultGovernme
defaultnt 
defaultrestraints.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPast political leaders of English cities had greater direct responsibility, and were much more able to work with industrialists to support growth, while bringing in reforms designed to improve people’s lives. 
defaultThere is a strong relationship between the ability of cities to drive growth, the levels of local financial control and the freedom to make policies match the needs of places, and with the right changes, 
defaultEngland can once again be home to a new economic rev
defaultolution by giving our city leaders the tools to create the environment in which businesses can thrive.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe amount of money cities control directly in England is very small compared to other countries and national policies don’t cater for the strengths or 
defaultneeds of different places. Often, they take a blanket approach, treating everywhere the same. There is a lot of evidence that national agencies struggle to join up with local agencies in England, resulting in duplication and inefficiency.
default  
defaultIt also means th
defaultat cities and the people who live there don’t decide what’s best for them, which ignores distinct local needs, wastes public money and gets poor results.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn England, cities only directly control about 5% of all the taxes raised from local people and busin
defaultesses, with 95% going straight to the Government (although recent change means some business rates are now retained locally, instead of grants to fund services). 
default 
defaultAccording to the OECD, compared to English figures the level of taxes controlled at the local
default or regional level is about 10 times greater in Canada, 7.5 in the US, 7 in Sweden, almost 6 in Germany, and over 5 times greater across the OECD on average. This means English cities have nothing like the level of local financial control enjoyed by cities
default abroad and are not competing on a level playing field.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultMoreover, Core Cities are also the channel and catalyst for wider sub-regional growth which 
defaultis demonstrated through many and continuous economic analyses from both led by the cities themselves (e.g. the Manchester Independent Economic Review) and from other independent sources (e.g. on-going economic forecasts for Core Cities by Oxford Economics)
default.  Governance arrangemenmts that support this wider role are in place and developing across all the Core Cities through Combined Authorities (one in operation, others in development) and other partnership structures, including close working relationships o
defaultn strategic policy with LEPs.  
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default              
defaultW
defaulte welcome the continued waves of devolution to Scotland and Wales but there is an imbalance which needs to be addressed to ensure that English cities are freed up to be able to deliver on their ambitious plans for jobs
default and growth, for the benefit of the country. One of the routes to support this would be to introduce more radical reform to the central-local relationship. The Political and Constitutional Reform Committee has put forward the case for ‘codification’, to en
defaultshrine the independence of local government and in particular to ensure greater financial
default 
defaultautonomy than currently exists, which the Core Cities support.
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the strongest cases that can be made for devolution is the ability of those closest to the 
defaultpoint of delivery to avoid gaps in service delivery and conversely to reduce any duplication
default between national and local delivery agencies
default. This is particularly clear in areas such as training and employment provision.
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultSimilarly, business support 
defaultwill be
default strengthened where provision is devolved to the local level
default, aligning it more closely with local need, delivering bespoke as well as nationally consistent services
default. This can help to rebalance economies, not just geographically but also sectorally, with th
defaultose best placed to understand local business need (in the context of the demands of the wider economy) being able to tailor support programmes to meet this need.
default&#xa0;

defaultAs b
defaultusiness and business support is central to the economic success of the Core 
defaultCities, we
default we
defaultlcome 
defaultthe 
defaultmeasures set out in the Heseltine Review which support devolution of business support services
default. W
defaulte would welcome 
defaultmany of the
default recommendations relating to 
defaultsupporting local business in terms of Localism and the role of Whitehal
defaultl and the priv
defaultate sect
defaultor in driving growth, In particular, we would support the recommen
defaultd
defaultations set out under the heading of “Government and growth – catalyst, enabler, partner”
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuilding on these recommendations, 
defaultCore Cities have developed a series of proposals that will help
default grow businesses and support
default 
defaultinnovation through be
defaulttter support for local business centred around a 
default single ‘Business Growth Hub’ in each Core City area
default,
default but coordinated between
default 
defaultall Core Cities, to provide:

default2.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe note that similar recommendations will form part of the Wave 2 City Deals with all cities agreeing a City Deal benefitting from a Growth Hub in their area
default.  However, with
defaultout
default the extension of this principle to 
defaultthe Core Cities, the biggest economic hubs outside London will remain without an essential business support focus that will exist in areas with important, but smaller, economies.
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.1 defaultHow devolved areas would be defined geographically and set up?defaultCore Cities have made consistent, evidence-based arguments for a more spatially aware approach to policy making at both the local and national levels, based on meaningful geographies.   The primary geographic lens for this is generally considered to be the
default local labour market area, which is essentially the same as the functioning economic, travel to work and 
defaultwider 
defaulthousing market geography.  We do not however think that these should be defined at the national level, through a ‘one size fits all’ approach.
defaultDe
defaultvolved areas should therefore be defined initially by asking local partners what geography would be most meaningful for fiscal devolution.  Such a request could set out certain principles that Government expects to be met, both in terms of geography and go
defaultvernance.  For example, an area would need to demonstrate how it would operate 
defaultfiscal reforms 
defaultacross a functioning labour market geography.  This makes sense in terms of the fiscal base, as typically the majority of money will be earned and spent within a 
defaultfunctioning economic area.
defaultTherefore devolved areas should be set up through nationally set standards and principles which are locally negotiated and defined.
default3.2 defaultHow public services, including employment, skills and welfare, should be organised to complemdefaultent devolutiondefault?default&#xa0;defaultThe Core Cities have developed policies on how we think skills and employment systems (including all education, learning, welfare to work, job match and job search services) could work differently, coming together within a single framework
default that ali
defaultgns national and local funds, spending them more efficiently and improving outcomes, 
defaultget
defaultting
default more people into jobs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis model would complement greater fiscal devolution, because
default t
defaulthe 
defaultsupply of skills within a 
defaultlocal labour market
default needs to reflect 
defaultmore closely the demands of that labour market and its employers
default, and the largely nationally controlled delivery model 
defaultis currently failing
default to meet the specific needs of cities, businesses and individuals.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis results in an over-supply of skills in some 
defaultareas and an under supply in others with, for example, 17% of job vacancies nationally remaining unfilled due to skills-gaps.  Although the current model might be viewed as highly localist in one respect – that is, that the learner chooses their course – w
defaultithout much better signposting and a stronger relationship between supply (learning providers) and demand (businesses), learners cannot make informed choices and many are effectively excluded from employment in areas they might otherwise have chosen to aim
default for.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Core Cities devolved model
default also 
defaultrecognises
default that 
defaultwelfare dependency undermines economic capa
defaultcity.  T
defaulthe 
defaultcurrent 
defaultwelfare to work and employment support system

default, which aim to help the unemployed
default 
defaultand excluded move towards employment a
defaultnd economic 
defaultindependence
default,
default are
default not 
defaultdelivering the
default 
defaultresults that Core Cities and their residents need.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn view of the above, we have 
defaultpropose
defaultd
default 
default5-
defaultyear ‘Skills and Labour Market Agreements’
default where 
defaultCore Cities will 
defaultwork 
defaultin partnership LEPs, 
defaultlocal business and the full range 
defaultof local providers to build a common commissioning framework, removing duplication, increasing skills and employment, and reducing dependency on public services. SLMAs s
defaulthould be built on the following:
default&#xa0;
default(i) 
defaultA single plan and inve
defaultstment framework for skills
default&#xa0;defaultA locally commissioned Work Programme
defaultCore Cities should commission the Work Programme
default post-2016, and embed it into a 
defaultwider system of employability support, with the 
defaultoption for a single performance 
defaultframework across all of the Core Cities, moving people fro
defaultm welfare to work.
default  Where cities have more control of welfare to work programmes, results have improved significantly.
default 
defaultFor example, where the Youth Contract has been delivered by national providers, on average 27% of young people have found training or 
defaultemployment
default; t
defaulthe Newcastle-Gateshead council’s scheme increased this to 47%, and the Leeds-Bradford scheme to 57%.
default&#xa0;defaultPublic sector reform: a whole-s
defaultystem
default,
default 
defaultplace-based 
defaultapproach
defaultCore Cities aim is to
default align skills and employment provision to other services, inc
defaultluding
default 
defaulteducation, care and health, wrapping services a
defaultround individuals and families, dealing 
defaultwith household poverty, improving outcomes and re
defaultducing spending over the longer 
defaultterm. We are not simply proposing to shift responsibili
defaultty for the existing system
default, but 
defaultto wholly improve and integrate skills and employment delivery on the ground.
default&#xa0;
defaultMore widely, we would propose that 
defaulta
default ‘Place Based Settlement’ should be made with each Core City (
defaultbased on Community Budget-style models, 
defaulteffectively a single
default 
defaultway of 
defaultbudgeting across
default public services), allowing issues like ‘troubled families’
default, 
defaulthealth and social care, welfare, unemployment, crime, to 
defaultbe dealt with in a
defaultn
default holistic and 
defaultjoined up way, breaking down the silos of national departments and their agencies.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis 
defaultrelies on a significant reform of the public sector, as set out above, 
defaultincluding
default integrating services for health and social care at the local level, across meaningful geographies.  
defaultAs an example, modelling demonstrates that by taking an integrated approach
default to health and social care for the frail and elderly, delivery costs could be reduced by 15%.  That would be equivalent to Newcastle saving £44 million and £29.5 million on its health and social care expenditure respectively.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs far as possible, p
defaultublic mo
defaultney spent across a city for a specific 
defaultset of 
defaultpurpose
defaults should take a ‘whole system’ approach to budgeting, 
defaultand 
defaultbe 
defaultspent ac
defaultcording to single investment plans, agreed between cities, local and national agencies 
defaultand the Government
default,
default but based on local needs.
default  
defaultA
defaults an example, a
defaultt the moment there are 36 separate funds just for housing, and in other
default areas it is equally
default complex.
default&#xa0;
defaultA new approach to procurement
defaultCore Cities
default and Government could explore how
default public procurement 
defaultfor major projects, for example construction
default and regeneration, might be aligned within a place 
defaultto maximise
default 
defaulttraining and employment d
defaultividends, e.g. apprenticeships.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 defaultHow devolved areas should be governed, including the role of business in decision making; how devolved areas would be held to defaultaccount?defaultRobust and effective area-based governance mechanisms have and are being adopted across the Core Cities wider urban areas.  Greater Manchester has instituted a Combined Authority, with several cities set to do the same in the near future.  Other c
defaultities have negotiated robust local partnerships, and relationships with LEPs are quickly and positively developing.
defaultCore Cities see the future of local leadership as an almost indivisible partnership between civic and business leadership, coming together 
defaultw
defaultith the third sector 
defaultto create - and become custodians of - a shared vision for a place, its economy and its people.  Our view is that, once this has happened, the role of national Government is to get behind that vision and support it.
defaultNevertheless, Gover
defaultnment will want to ensure a high level of accountability in regard of fiscal devolution.  Although the role of business leadership is key, and is demonstrably part of the decision making process across Core Cities, accountability for fiscal devolution must
default ultimately also be linked to democratic institutions, namely local (or combined) authorities.
defaultFiscal devolution will strengthen local democracy, making local government even more accountable to local people, and giving electorates a greater stake in makin
defaultg sure they have their say.  Currently, no matter whom the electorate vote for locally, most of what they receive by way of services is decided upon nationally.  Fiscal 
defaultdevolution increases local choice and strengthens overall accountability for how 
defaulttaxes 
defaultraised from people in a place are spent in that place.
defaultNational principles creating a consistent set of standards 
defaultshould guide this process, rather than a strictly prescribed single governance model that is then implemented top down.
default  This should not inclu
defaultde a nationally-set framework for referendums where increases in taxes are to be considered, which should be a matter for local decision for those taxes in local control.
default3.4 defaultThe strength of the evidence that devolution would lead to economic growth, localdefault improvement and better local governance, including examples of what areas could do with their new powers such as use them to invest in infrastructure and local servicesdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Core Cities acknowledge 
defaultthat there has been 
defaultpositive change in national policy. I
defaultn particular the City Deals process has been welcomed by all the cities and is already delivering growth, jobs and training into each of our urban areas. 
default Although many schemes will take a decade or more to complete, the City Deals already provide substant
defaultial evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a greater focus on cities and on devolution within the thinking of Government and the Opposition, who all supported the Core Cities Amendment to the Localism Act which has paved the way for further devolution. The Heseltine Review, 
defaultLord Adonis’ Growth Review and other
default initiative
defaults all point in the same direction. 
defaultThis perhaps reflects a recognition that the centralised economic system we have has run its course.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the “
defaultThe 
defaultState of the 
defaultEnglish Cities
default” (Office of the Deputy Prime Min
defaultister, 2006), the lead author Professor 
defaultMichael Parkinson sets out compelling evidence that
default many 
defaultsecond tier 
defaultEnglish cities are not performing as well as their
default 
defaultcompetitors in Europe and beyond. 
defaultT
defaulthe
default 
defaultnorm
default in continental Europe 
default– and indeed in developed 
defaultcountries throughout the world - is for a much more
default decentralise
defaultd model of financial control and decision-making
default. The evidence 
defaultstrongly 
defaultsuggests that where cities 
defaulthave
default more freedom and resources they have responded by being more
default 
defaultproactive, e
defaultntrepreneurial 
defaultand successful. German cities are amongst t
defaulthe most successful
default 
defaultin Europe, 
defaultand it is no
default coincidence that Germany is also one of the most decentralised 
defaultstate system
defaults
default 
defaultin Europe. The renaissance of Barcelona in part stems from the move towards
default decentr
defaultalisation 
defaultand the lessening of the grip of the capital city, Madrid. In
default 
defaultaddition, some European governments have been moving towards more long
default 
defaultterm
default 
defaultcontractual relationships between national and local government to
default 
defaultdeliver improved urban economic performance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe d
defaultifficulty with providing evidence for making the shift to decentralisation from a centralised position is that most of the international examples we have are historic, that is, countries that have always had more devolved models.  One exception is Japan, a
defaultnd a paper on the Japanese experience of decentralisation 
defaultcan be found at our website at 
defaulthttp://www.corecities.com/what-we-do/publications/growth-second-tier-cities-urban-policy-lessons-japan
defaultThe view of the Japan Local Government Centre, based in London, is that fiscal decentralisation in Japan, over an explicit 
defaultnational 
defaultpolicy programme l
defaultasting more than a decade, has clearly led to much more effective and efficient spending on social cohesion programm
defaultes, and 
defaulthas helped to drive local economic growth, although the same period has been one of the most challenging for Japan due to regional a
defaultnd global economic forces.
default&#xa0;
defaultInternational comparisons also demonstrate how out of step with other developed nations England is in terms of decentralisation. 
defaultAccording to the OECD, the level of taxes controlled at the local or regional level is about 10 tim
defaultes greater in Canada, 7.5 in the US, 7 in Sweden, almost 6 in Germany, and over 5 times greater across the OECD on average. 
default 
defaultNew Zealand is 
defaultprobably the only developed country which has a more 
defaultcentralised state system than England, a country which has a po
defaultpulation roughly the same as the Leeds City Region.
default  Even cities in China have a greater degree of financial freedom and flexibility.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome continued waves of devolution to Scotland and Wales but there is 
defaultnow a significant con
defaults
defaulttitutional
default imbalance which needs to be addressed to ensure that English cities are freed up to be able to deliver on their ambitious plans for jobs and growth, for the benefit of the country. One of the routes to support this would be to introduce more radical refor
defaultm to the central-local relationship. The Political and Constitutional Reform Committee has put forward the case for ‘codification’, 
defaulta legally binding agreement
default between local and national government setting
default out roles and responsibilities 
defaultto enshrine the ind
defaultependence of local government and in particular to ensure greater financial autonomy than currently exists, which the Core Cities support. 
default 
defaultThe Core Cities’ view is that Government should also c
defaulthange Parliamentary Standing Orders so ministers can’t constan
defaulttly question the decisions of local politicians without good reason.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther 
defaultevidence that devolution strengthens economic performance a
defaultnd local improvement is set out in the
default paper “
defaultSecond Tier Cities in Europe: In An Age of Austerity Why Invest Beyond the 
defaultCapitals?” (ESPON &amp; European Institute of Urban Affairs,
default 
defaultLiverpool John Moores University, 2012),
default where
default the authors present evidence from a thorough two-year study across Europe
default that 
defaultdeconcentration of investment and decentralisation of decision
default 
defaultmaking
default 
defaultand
default resources 
defaultlead
defaults
default to more high performing second tier cities
default, and that overconcentration in one city is ultimately bad for national economies
default. Institutional and
default 
defaultfinancial decentralisation from national to regional and local levels of government will reduce
default 
defaultthe costs of overconcentration on the capital and maximise the contribution of second tier
default 
defaultcities to national co
defaultmpetitiveness and welfare
default.
default  This wa
defaults a very sophisticated 
defaultstudy and makes a compelling evidence-based case.
default  
defaultIt shows that
default 
defaultencouraging high 
defaultperformance in a range of citi
defaultes, including but not exclusive to 
defaultthe capital city
default,
default produces
default 
defaultnational benefits. If the gap between second-tier cities and capitals is very la
defaultrge, this will
default limit national
default 
defaultperformance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK
default economy 
defaultis
default spatially
default 
defaultand structu
defaultrally unbalanced
default, which has been recognised by Government and the Opposition.  The challenge for national policy is 
defaultto build upon
default 
defaultthe strengths of London as a successful global city 
defaultwhile not neglecting the rest of the urban system, 
defaultmaximising
default the contribu
defaulttion of Core Cities. The relationship between London and the
default 
defaultCore Cities should not be seen as zero-s
defaultum but as win-win. The prize
default is to grow the overall national urban
default 
defaulteconomic out
defaultput
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn view of this evidence Core Cities have set out a number of proposal
defaults in our Growth Prospectus with the aims of cities delivering an additional 1.16 million jobs and £222 billion into the economy by 2030.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe following examples highlight some of the areas that could bene
defaultfit from this devolved approach
default, and further evidenc
defaulte in each area is provided in our Prospectus for Growth which is appended to this submission
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA number of studies
default indicate t
defaulthat taking an integrated approach to health and social care for the frail and elderly could save up to 15% on delivery costs. This is equivalent to Newcastle saving £44 million and £29.5 million per year on its health and social care expenditure respective
defaultly
default. Based on the Troubled Families Community Budgets pilots, Core Cities could potentially avoid costs of between £62 million and £75 million per annum for every 1000 troubled families successfully worked with
default.
default&#xa0;default3.5 defaultThe impact on areas not included in andefaulty new devolution arrangements, including those on cities’ borders and those affected by resulting changes to national fiscal equalisation and distribution arrangements?defaultThe London Finance Commission’s findings have stated that the effec
defaultt on the local 
defaultgovernment finance system should be neutral at the starting point.  The amount that cities receive through fiscal devolution would be off-set in corresponding reductions in direct funding (i.e. grant), which would need to be agreed through detailed negotia
defaulttion.  This would leave the total available for other authority areas unaffected.
defaultOur own forecasts and modelling suggest that, following devolution, cities would improve growth and employment, and reduce dependency on public services.  This would have a p
defaultositive net effect on the 
defaultnational 
defaultpublic balance sheet through a reduced call on welfare, health and other funded services, and corresponding increases in income tax, National Insurance and corporation tax.  This would effectively lead to more ‘in the sys
defaulttem’.
defaultGovernance arrangements across functioning economic areas where Core City partner authorities are included in plans for devolution (dealt with above) would effectively deal with any issues resulting from the changes across that geography.  Many of th
defaulte Core Cities proposals are designed to ope
defaultrate at these wider geographies, although this should be a matter for local choice.
defaultThe economic benefits of growth are likely to be felt beyond the travel to work areas around Core Cities. However, this is not an
default argument just for a passive ‘trickle down’ approach to achieving wider sub-national economic benefits, and Government should encourage surrounding towns and rural areas and their LEPs to work with Core Cities actively on their long term economic strategie
defaults to ensure maximum regional benefit.  
defaultThere is significant evidence to back up this assertion, for example in ‘City Links: Integration and Isolation’ (Centre for Cities 2008), Paul Hildreth asserts that: 
default“
defaultA synergistic relationship, such as that which exi
defaultsts between London and
default 
defaultReading, allows the smaller city direct access to the markets, skills and
default 
defaultspecialisations of its larger neighbour, in turn giving it the opportunity to
default 
defaultdevelop its own specialised 
defaultgrowth momentum.”
default 
defaultFiscal devolution in fact incentive
defaults this kind of collaborative working, beginning to solve the issue of how LEPs can operate together across wider geographies.
defaultThe issue of ‘displacement’, moving economic activity from one area to another, will be raised during the debate on fiscal devolution.  Core Cities have long debated this issue in regard to Tax Increment Financing, which we do not rehearse here, but on whi
defaultch we are happy to supply further information.  National policy should however recognise that the 
defaultreal 
defaultdisplacement we are seeking to stop is that of business from the UK to other countries, and the displacement we are seeking to achieve is in the opposite
default direction.  Our real competitors are abroad, not at home, and if a business is ready to relocate for whatever reason, we should make sure it is within our own economy.  
default3.6 defaultWhether reform of the existing system (for example re-banding council tax, revaludefaulting business rates, Community Budgets, Government grants, formulas and taxes such as Stamp Duty) would be a precursor to, or run along with, large-scale institutional change?default defaultCities would prefer a situation where change is instituted at scale, both reform
defaulting the current system and institutions, through a constitutional shift which reflects Government commitments to ‘radical devolution’ (e.g. in ‘Unlocking Growth in Cities’ Cabinet Office 2011).  
defaultThat does not however mean we should wait until all issues a
defaultre resolved in theory before anything happens in practice, which is simply a recipe for prevarication, and for delay which cities, their economies and services cannot risk.
defaultWe should therefore have a clear and shared timetable for devolution 
default, which we wou
defaultld strongly recommend and be willing to work on with Government.  Some changes, for example the devolution of property taxes, should be possible to begin without large scale institutional change.  Other shifts, for example Community Budgets and Place Based
default Settlements, will 
defaultthemselves 
defaultlead to 
defaultevolutionary 
defaultinstitutional change through a different regime of

defaultThroughout the devolution debate and any future programme it will be important to focus on the outcomes we are trying to achieve in order t

default3.7 defaultWhat changes should be made to devolved authorities borrowing powers?defaultCurrently local authorities have access to borrowing through the Prudential Code.  No limits should be set on local
default authority borrowing through this robust process.  Local authorities should also be able to borrow against future revenue streams using this process, particularly in order to invest in infrastructure, growth and jobs.  Although there has now been some rela
defaultxation of limits within Autumn Statement 2013, the cap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing is an example of an unnecessary threshold which restricts growth and construction, and sets limits on local self-determination.
default3.8 defaultThe scope for areas to introducedefault new taxes and funding methods such as bonds and crowd-sourcing, fees and charges?defaultNew financing mechanisms would instantly be enabled by the devolution of property taxes leading to increased investment in infrastructure, bringing growth and jobs and contr
defaultibuting to the national economy.  For example, further Tax Increment Financing schemes would be made possible by devolution of property taxes, enabling cities to hypothecate finance over longer periods than is currently the case (other than in the three Ci
defaultty Deal TIF schemes in Newcastle, Sheffield and Nottingham).  This would assist in national programmes like HS2, providing investment tools for new station sites and related regeneration.
defaultWe are not aware of specific restrictions on the use of bonds as met
defaulthods of borrowing for cities.  The reason they are rarely used is partly because of the necessary scale to make them really viable, and partly because of the additional cost of repayments, compared for example to the Public Works Loan Board.  The LGA is in
defaultvestigating the creation of a municipal bonds vehicle which may progress this.  However, the main restriction on innovative methods of on or off balance sheet borrowing is quite simply the ability of cities to pay it back.  Currently cities lack the revenu
defaulte streams to do this, and fiscal devolution will enable this to happen.
defaultGovernment should not however be concerned about large increases in borrowing.  The use of the Prudential Code is a robust process, and the numbers of viable schemes on which cities wo
defaultuld feel able to use mechanisms like TIF is relatively small in the context of national borrowing and spending.  Even with the full suite of property taxes being devolved to cities, we are still only talking about 12% of the total tax base of a city being 
defaultlocally retained.
defaultWithin the context of robust local governance and accountability, and the support of business leadership for strategic plans, we see no reason why ‘devolved areas’ and their democratic institutions should not enjoy the maximum freedom pos
defaultsible to deploy their resources in support of local growth and jobs, to raise reasonable fees and charges in support of this and to explore alternative funding streams such as crowd-sourcing and philanthropy.
defaultAlthough Core Cities, along with London Governm
defaultent, have initially called for devolution of property taxes, there are a range of other taxes which should be also explored within a locally devolved context.  New taxes like tourism tax, popular in North America, should be explored, where a levy on e.g. h
defaultotel rooms is reinvested to support the visitor economy.  
defaultAlthough Core Cities recognise there is some genuine complexity around a localised element of other national taxes, this approach is successful in many other countries.  We would therefore also lik
defaulte to see a fuller exploration of how other national taxes might incorporate a localised component, e.g. for VAT or its replacement with a local sales tax, and a localised element of income tax.
default3.9  defaultThe extent to which high-performing areas would be expectdefaulted to redistribute their proceeds of growth via the Treasury?defaultThe current local government finance system operates a top up and tariff scheme that might evolve to deal with this issue, and although focused currently on business rates, has essentially creat
defaulted a framework through which any fiscal reform might operate.  However it should be recognised that the vast majority of the proceeds of growth - the 88% of taxation still not in local control - would in fact still return directly to Treasury, who would al
defaultso share directly in some of the reductions in the need for high-dependency public services, achieved through devolved models.

defaultIncreased inves
defaulttment in growth relies 
defaulton a stro
