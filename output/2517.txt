[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) is the premier national landlords association operating in England and Wales. We have some 14,500 subscribers representing a membership of around 17,000. Our members own or control over 250,000 units of accommodation. Primarily our members are landlords in their own right but a number are managing and letting agents, some of whom are also landlords. Our members operate in all sub-sectors of the Private Rented Sector (PRS). Properties are rented out to families, working people, young professionals, the elderly, students and benefit customers.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In summary, our concerns about the new arrangements relating to Universal Credit are as follows:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We look at some of the issues further below.&#xa0;2.2. In the longer term:&#xa0;a. There needs to be wider, longer term view of the place of housing benefits;&#xa0;b. It is vital to retain the involvement of private landlords in housing provision to benefit claimants, particularly the low paid in work;&#xa0;c. Breaking the link between benefit rates and market rents is a key concern;&#xa0;d. Housing conditions will deteriorate if benefit levels do not reflect market rents; and,&#xa0;e. Increasing housing supply is vital. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The introduction of Universal Credit, particularly around housing costs is of particular concern to our members as a significant number let their properties to tenants in receipt of benefits. Some operate by choice in this subsector of the market or because circumstances dictate this. Others become involved because their tenants suffer a change of circumstances, particularly unemployment, which means that they have to claim welfare benefits. This latter group are involuntary landlords of benefit customers.&#xa0;3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Concerns are not just about Universal Credit. The welfare changes which are now in place threaten the provision of housing in the private rented sector to the less well off.  These will be carried through into Universal Credit.  This Inquiry provides the opportunity to take a longer term view. Paying down the deficit is important but as the economy improves longer term decisions are needed about ways in which the private rented sector will play its increasingly important role in housing the less well off.&#xa0;3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our concerns around Universal Credit fall under five key themes:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.4.               We acknowledge that the government has listened to stakeholders like ourselves; there are further issues to be addressed as outlined above. The RLA agree that the objective of helping tenants manage their financial affairs is a laudable one.  However, this comes at considerable risk.  &#xa0;

[[[andlords and Local Authorities]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Last year the RLA and the Scottish Association of Landlords (SAL) conducted a survey of members to assess attitudes towards Universal Credit. Between 22nd October and 5th November 2012, 1,023 landlords from across the UK took part in the survey.  Results showed that 65.2 per cent of respondents do not support the Government’s plans for universal credit.&#xa0;4.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would urge the Government to be open in their communication with private landlords regarding Universal Credit to offer reassurance to attempt to change this negative perception.  With the demand for social housing at an all-time high, benefit customers are increasingly being encouraged to look to the Private rented sector for an alternative to council or housing association accommodation.&#xa0;4.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The needs, worries and views of Landlords must be considered by DWP if the housing costs part of Universal Credit is to be successful. If landlords decide that they will not support the welfare changes the less well-off tenants will suffer due to a lack of housing options available to them. This will simply put more pressure on an already over stretched housing supply.&#xa0;4.1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Landlords must feel supported through this transition of budgeting responsibility being given to the tenant and must feel able to access the help and support that they may need if things don’t work out. At the moment Universal Credit is a major worry for Landlords - the Government cannot ignore this fact and they must provide a resource that can accommodate for challenges and queries.&#xa0;4.1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We feel that Landlords should be able to see how a claim is progressing. The current proposals offer no provision for landlords to check that a claim has been made and there is no notification system so that landlords know that a claim for housing costs is actually being paid, which could lead to further apprehension in the sector.&#xa0;

[[[4.2.    ]]]

[[[Lack of clarity around the ]]]

[[[‘guidance’ that]]]

[[[ will replace regulation]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.2.1. The RLA will obviously strive to support its members through this period of transition but the RLA, and other landlord trade associations, can only do this with clear guidelines.  This will present a challenge as the existing system of regulations begins to disappear.  Decisions as to how payment will be made will be based individually on a case-by-case basis according to guidance.  If Landlords cannot access information about progress of claims then they will not be willing to take claimants on as tenants in the first place.&#xa0;4.2.2. We feel that too much depends on how efficiently DWP administers the new system. Landlords may have to wait longer for payment with increased risk of default. The greater interval between payments, however, poses risks. It is not at all clear how advance payments will work.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.2.3. Another concern for the RLA and its members is the huge risk that comes with having a new scheme heavily dependent on as yet untried computer systems.  Given that the intention is for the Universal Credit system to be digital when possible this is understandably leaving us wondering how this will all work out in practice.&#xa0;4.2.4. We feel that until these uncertainties are addressed by government and tangible guidance is offered around housing costs and payment of rent within Universal Credit, landlords will continue to be wary of the welfare changes. &#xa0;

[[[4.3. ]]]

[[[Lack of protection]]]

[[[ for l]]]

[[[andlord’s interests and financial stability]]]&#xa0;4.3.1. We feel that there is a common misconception that Landlords in the private rented sector are profiteering from housing benefit. This is not the case. According to DCLG's most recent Landlord Survey from 2010, 79 per cent of all landlords earned less than a quarter of their income from letting properties in the private rented sector with 21 per cent of all landlords earning no income at all. We therefore feel it unfair that under the new proposals there are no means of redress for landlords if things go wrong or no rights of appeal as potentially landlords could be left worse off than under the current system.  We feel that the need for security of income on the landlord’s part is still an issue on which private landlords at large require reassurance.&#xa0;4.3.2. Importantly, for the PRS the Government is pursuing a policy of using Universal Credit to improve financial responsibility and financial management skills on the part of claimants.  Whilst we feel that this is a worthwhile exercise in all other parts of a claimant’s life, a home is the one thing that needs to be stable for the individual to prosper.  Simulating a monthly salary to benefits claimants is a risky strategy when a significant number will have been used to weekly rent payments.  Currently, payment of different benefits at different times of the month also helps these tenants to budget.  The long wait between payments and inexperience of money management with benefit claimants could have serious implications on both the landlord and the tenant.&#xa0;4.3.3. It is not fair to expect that a private landlord will be able to absorb the cost and risk of mounting rent arrears compared with a large social landlord as many simply do not operate on that scale or have resources as back up when things go wrong. Most importantly, they do not have any public subsidy for providing housing for those tenants who would normally rent with a social landlord. &#xa0;4.3.4. We appreciate that the intention is that those who cannot manage their own financial affairs or are unlikely to pay rent should be identified as being vulnerable at the outset and arrangements will then be made which can include direct payment to the landlord.  The system of vulnerability should be assessed according to the tenant’s interest of keeping a roof over their head and the landlord’s interest to receive the money, as well as the public interest of making sure that the benefit is used for its intended purpose. We do question how robust these mechanics currently are.&#xa0;

[[[4.4.    ]]]

[[[The greater risk of incr]]]

[[[easing rent a]]]

[[[rrears and homelessness overall]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4.1. The introduction of the Local Housing Allowance and the resulting switch to paying benefit to the tenant instead of direct to the landlord has already had profound implications and landlords have reported increasing problems with arrears.  This can only get worse when Universal Credit is rolled out nationally and we would urge the government to listen to the concerns of our members. We remain strongly of the view that the tenant should be offered the choice to receive their housing cots directly or for them to be paid directly to the landlord.&#xa0;

[[[4.5. ]]]

[[[   ]]]

[[[Monthly payments]]]&#xa0;4.5.1. We have concerns for tenants who could face budgetary challenges as all of their benefit payments are combined into one monthly sum. The long wait between payments and inexperience of money management could have serious implications on both the landlord and the tenant.   This could lead to the tenant not allocating and saving enough money to pay the rent and getting into debt and rent arrears.  It is essential therefore that the local service framework which is intended to provide budgetary support for claimants is designed with the private sector in mind not just the social sector.&#xa0;

[[[4.6. ]]]

[[[   ]]]

[[[Emphasis on the social sector]]]&#xa0;4.6.1. We also feel that there is a lot of emphasis on ensuring that the social sector is prepared for the changes that will come with Universal Credit and how they will support their vulnerable tenants. This sector has the support local authorities to ensure that they are delivering the programme as a partnership.  The private rented sector must be incorporated into these local delivery partnerships effectively to prevent landlords from feeling disengaged.  Private landlords are very much a part of the local provision of housing for the most vulnerable at a time when demand for social housing is high and supply low. To lose their support in the long term would have detrimental consequences on vulnerable tenants.  A consistent approach across all authorities is needed – not a postcode lottery.&#xa0;

[[[5.       ]]]

[[[Recommendations]]]

[[[ around Universal Credit]]]&#xa0;5.1.    We would like to recommend the following to the Inquiry:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[6.       ]]]

[[[The longer term effects of Welfare Reforms ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.    We feel that the welfare changes provide an opportunity to take a wider view on housing supply and ways to ensure that landlords in the private rented sector remain willing to continue to provide housing to benefit claimants who are out of work or in work but on a low income.&#xa0;6.2.    In terms of the amount of housing costs payable we recognise that the transfer of LHA into Universal Credit is relatively seamless with no changes being made to how the rates are calculated. However, we are concerned that by no longer linking local housing allowance rates to market rents there are two key wider implications: &#xa0;a. Those private landlords who only rent their properties to benefit claimants because of demand for low rent housing in their areas will not feel there is any incentive to continue to invest if the rates do not rise with market rates. This will then add to the already shortage of affordable rental accommodation in the private rented sector.&#xa0;b. Housing conditions will be compromised if landlords are not able to increase rent in line with other market rents and in a climate where the cost of living is rising. This will affect the way landlords maintain and repair their properties if they do not have the money to spend on their properties.&#xa0;6.3.    We feel that the longer term willingness of private landlords to continue to rent to benefit claimants will be compromised as rents move away from market rents. We perceive the fixed one per cent maximum rise in rates for 2013/14 and 2014/15 as well as the Government’s previous policy of linking rises in rates to the Consumer Prices Index to be a major threat so far as sufficient provision of accommodation to claimants is concerned.  In many areas landlords are able to switch to non-benefit claimants; this is something that we have repeatedly warned of and we can back this up by our recent survey findings. &#xa0;6.4.    This must be looked at in the wider context of housing supply. This is particularly true in London and other hotspots.  The Government contends that it is, in effect, a large purchaser who can use reductions in rates to influence the market. We question this assertion, but, even if it is correct, it will not work in those areas where the landlord is able to let to a non-benefit claimant.  A far better way is to improve supply which will then let the market restrain rents. &#xa0;6.5.     A key function of housing benefit must be support those working on low wages. As Beveridge pointed out, it is essential that rates of housing benefit reflect local rental market conditions.  If you are on low wages and you do not get this extra support what is the point in working at all?&#xa0;

[[[7.       ]]]

[[[Conclusion ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1.    Both the welfare reforms and the introduction of Universal Credit come with considerable risks. There is likely to be be a much higher level of arrears, an unwillingness of landlords to house benefit claimants (at a time when there is huge pressure on social housing), increased unwillingness by banks to lend for this kind of property (or increased interest rates to reflect the risk), much higher levels of evictions and much greater homelessness.&#xa0;7.2.    We recognise that this is an evolving system. What we do ask is that the Committee and the Government do not forget the risk that private landlords will be taking once Universal Credit is rolled out more widely and offer a workable system which encourages these landlords to participate in this important subsector of the housing market.&#xa0;7.3.    More widely, the government needs to recognise the long term necessity of providing less well-off tenants with sufficient support for their housing costs in light of increasing pressures on incomes. Supply side reforms are vital.

[[[Appendix I: RLA case study]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A member of the RLA recently appealed to his Local Authority after he was owed a considerable amount of money from his tenants in rent arrears.  The landlord has over 50 tenants&#xa0;and works with several landlords and associations. Since November 2012 he has personally lost over £3,500 in rent owed to him, from tenants claiming housing benefit: &#xa0;

[[[Tenant ]]]

[[[‘]]]

[[[A]]]

[[[’]]]A&#xa0;mother of three children, the tenant constantly falls into arrears with her rent. The landlord has taken a loss on the arrears as&#xa0;it is extremely difficult to get the rent arrears back from the tenant.  At one stage, the tenant was assisted by her mother in opening a bank account for the rent to be paid into. Unfortunately, this did not resolve the situation and the temptation of having large amounts of housing benefit provided to her directly was too great and she lapsed into arrears once again, and reluctantly the landlord is now having to consider evicting her.&#xa0;

[[[Tenant ]]]

[[[‘]]]

[[[B]]]

[[[’]]]

[[[ ]]]This tenant was previously penniless and homeless.  The landlord accepted him as a tenant with his mother acting as a guarantor and controlling his rent payments and other household bills. Within a year the tenant requested the Local Authority to pay his housing benefit directly to him. His mother repeatedly asked the Local Authority not to allow this, but her requests were rejected. The landlord has now not been paid any rent since November 2012 and has instigated the eviction process. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Tenant ]]]

[[[‘]]]

[[[C]]]

[[[’]]]

[[[ ]]]This tenant fell into arrears as a consequence of having rent paid directly into his bank account. In addition, as recovering alcoholic, the temptation of the rent money being paid into his bank account proved too great and he subsequently suffered a relapse and is now drinking heavily once more.
