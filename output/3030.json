"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Hywel Thomas (ESG 29)&#xa0;Last year, t\nhe UK Governm\nent's Chief Scientific Adviser \nasked the Royal \nSociety and the Royal Academy of Engineering to carry out an independent review of the scientific and engineering evidence relating to the technical aspects of the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing to inform government policymaking about shale gas\n extraction in the UK\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe terms of reference of this review were:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA Working Group was\n set up to oversee this project. \nThe Working Group met on six occasions when it was briefed by other experts. Consultations with other experts and \nstakeholders were held between meetings. Submissions were received from a number of ind\nividuals and learned societies\n. \nI am writing to you as a member of \nthe\n Working Group, although I am writing in \na\n personal capacity and not necessary on behalf of the two\n academies. \n&#xa0;\nOur key finding was that the \nhealth, safety and environmental risks associated with hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract shale gas can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are \nimplemented and enforced t\nhrough regulation. \nHydraulic fracturing is an established technology that has been used in the oil and gas industries for many decades. \nThe UK has 60 years’\n experience of regulating onshore and offshore oil and gas industries.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe were keen to stress that\n s\nhale gas extraction in the UK is presently at a very small scale, involving only exploratory activities. Uncertainties can be addressed through robust monitoring systems and research activities identified in this report. \nThere is greater uncertainty abou\nt the scale\n of production activities should a future shale gas industry develop \nnationwide\n.\n \nTherefore, our other key finding was that a\nttention must be paid\nto \nthe way in which risks scale up\n. \nCo-ordination of the numerous bodies with regulatory responsibi\nlities \nfor shale gas extraction \nmust be maintained. Regulatory capacity may need to be increased.\n&#xa0;\nConcerns have been raised about the risk of fractures propagating from shale formations to reach overlying aquifers. The available evidence indicates that th\nis risk is very low provided that shale gas extraction takes place at depths of many hundreds of metres or several kilometres. Geological mechanisms constrain the distances that fractures may propagate vertically. Even if communication with overlying aquif\ners were possible, suitable pressure conditions would still be necessary for contaminants to flow\n through fractures\n. More likely causes of possible environmental contamination include faulty wells, and leaks and spills associated with surface operations. N\neither cause is unique to shale \ngas. Both\n \nare \ncommon to all oil and gas wells and extractive activities.\n&#xa0;\nEnsuring well integrity must remain the highest priority\n to prevent contamination. \nThe probability of well failure is low for a single well if it is designed, constructed and \nabandoned\n according to best practice. The UK’s well examination scheme was set up so that the design of offshore wells could be reviewed by independent, specialist \nexperts. This scheme must be \napplied appropriately\n for onshore activities. Effects of unforeseen leaks or spills can be mitigated by proper site construction and impermeable lining. Disclosure of the constituents of \nfracturing fluid is already mandatory in\n the UK. Ensuring, where possible, that chemical additives are non-hazardous would help to mitigate the impact of any leak or spill.  \n&#xa0;\nConcerns have also been raised about seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing. Natural seismicity in the UK is low by \nworld standards. On average, the UK experiences seismicity of magnitude 5 M\nL\n (\nfelt by everyone nearby\n) every twenty years, and of magnitude 4M\nL\n \n(felt by many people) \nevery three to four years.\n \nThe UK has lived with seismicity induced by coal mining activit\nies or the settlement of abandoned mines for a long time. British Geological Survey records indicate that coal mining-related seismicity is generally of smaller magnitude than natural seismicity and no larger than 4 M\nL\n. Seismicity induced by hydraulic frac\nturing is likely to be of \neven \nsmaller magnitude. There is an emerging consensus that the magnitude of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing would be no greater than 3 M\nL\n (f\nelt by few \npeople and \nresulting\n in \nnegligible, if any, surface impacts).\n Recen\nt seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing in the UK was of magnitude 2.3 M\nL\n and 1.5 M\nL \n(unlikely to be\n felt by anyone)\n. The risk of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing can be reduced by traffic light monitoring systems that use real-time seismic \nmonitoring so that operators can respond promptly. \n&#xa0;\nMonitoring should be carried out before, during and after shale gas operations to inform risk assessments. Methane and other contaminants in groundwater should be monitored, as well as potential leakages\n of methane and other gases into the atmosphere. The geology of sites should be characterised and faults identified. Monitoring data should be \nsubmitted to\n the UK’s regulators to manage potential hazards, inform local planning processes and address wider c\noncerns. Monitoring of any potential leaks of methane would provide data to assess the carbon footprint of shale gas extraction. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nUK’s goal based approach to \nregulation is to be commended\n, requiring o\nperators to identify and assess risks in a way that\n fosters innovation and continuous improvement in risk management\n.\n \nThe UK’s \nhealth and safety regulators and environmental regulators\n should work together to \ndevelop\n guidelines specific \nto\n shale gas extraction to help \noperators carry out goal based risk \nassessments according\n to the principle of \nreducing risks to As Low As Reasonably \nPracticable (ALARP). \nRisk assessments should be \nsubmitted to the regulators for scrutiny and then \nenforced through monitoring activities and inspections. It is mandatory for o\nperators to report \nwell failures, as well as other accidents and incidents\n to the UK’s regulators. \nMechanisms should be put in place so that reports can also be shared between operators to improve risk assessments and promote best practices across the indu\nstry\n.\n&#xa0;\nAn Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) should be mandatory for all shale gas operations. Risks should be assessed across the entire lifecycle of shale gas extraction, \nincluding risks associated with the disposal of \nwastes\n and \nabandonment of wells\n. \nSeismic risks should also feature as part of the ERA.\n&#xa0;\nWater requirements can be managed through integrated operational practices, such as recycling and reusing wastewaters where possible. Options for disposing of wastes should be planned from the outset. \nShould \nany onshore disposal wells\n be necessary in the UK, their \nconstruction, regulation and \nsiting\n would\n \nneed\n further consideration.\n&#xa0;\nThe report did\n \nnot attempt\n to determine whether \nshale gas extraction\n should go ahead\n in the UK\n. This remains the \nresponsibility of the Government. This report analysed the environmental, health and safety\n \nrisks \nassociated with shale gas extraction \nto inform decision making. \nNeither risks associated with the subsequent use of shale gas nor c\nlimate\n risks \nwere\n analysed.\n \nDecision making would benefit from research into the \nclimate risks associated with \nboth \nthe extraction\n and use of shale gas. Further benefit would also be derived from research into the public acceptability of \nall\n \nthese \nrisks in the context of the UK’s en\nergy, climate and economic policies.\n&#xa0;\nIn December 2012, the Secretary of State for Energy informed the House of Commons that the temporary suspension on shale gas activities in the UK would be lifted. In the same speech, he added that he ‘\nhad the \nbenefit o\nf the comprehensive and authoritative review of the risks of \nfracking\n by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering \n...\n. I can announce that the Government accepts all the recommendations of the ac\nademies’ report addressed to it’.\n  The Secretary o\nf State \n‘\nplaced in the Libraries of both Houses and placed on my Department’s website a full synopsis of the questions raised and of the Government’s responses to them as well as a response on all of the recommendation\ns of the academies’ study group’. The \ntwo academies have been liaising with government, industry and regulatory officials to discuss how the recommendations are to be implemented.\n \n&#xa0;\nAppendix 1\n              \nR\necommendations\n&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo detect groundwater contamination:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo ensure well integrity:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo mitigate induced seismicity:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo detect potential leakages of gas:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWater should be managed in an integrated way:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo ma\nnage environmental risks:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBest practice \nfor risk management\n should be implemented:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK’s regulators should determine their requirements to regulate a shale gas industry should it develop nationwide in the future.
