[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]U[bold]NRWA[bold]'s Educational Activity in the [bold]Middle East[bold]1. 
[normal]UNRWA – the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinian refugees in the Middle East – was established in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 by the UN General Assembly resolution 302 (IV) of December 8, 
[normal]1948, in
[normal] order to carry out relie
[normal]f and works programs for the Palestinian war refugees. The agency began operations on May 1, 
[normal]1950. In
[normal] the absence of a solution to the refugee problem, the Assembly has repeatedly renewed UNRWA's mandate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]Over half of UNRWA's general budget is dedicate
[normal]d to education (381,055 million USD out of a total budget of 673,789 million USD in 2012, which makes 56.55%).
[normal] The agency also offers health, relief and social services. UNRWA provides free-of-charge basic education to children of Palestinian refugees in the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, the Israel-controlled East Jer
[normal]usalem, and in 
[normal]Jordan
[normal], 
[normal]Syria
[normal] and 
[normal]Lebanon
[normal]. In the school year of 2011/2012 it ran a total of 703 schools caring for 491,641 students. 245 of these 
[normal]schools were in the Gaza Strip and 99 were in the 
[normal]West Bank
[normal], with 225,098 and 51,695 students respectively.
[normal] T
[normal]wo of UNRWA's West Bank schools are actually located in the greater 
[normal]Jerusalem
[normal] area which was annexed to 
[normal]Israel
[normal] in 1967.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]Basic education means both elementary and intermediate (also called "preparatory") schools, that is, grades 1-9 or 10, depending on 
[normal]the specific school system in each country.
[normal] Only in 
[normal]Lebanon
[normal] does the Agency operate some nine high schools as well, since Palestinian students of these grades find it difficult to study in local public or private schools.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]UNRWA maintains close cooperat
[normal]ion with government educational authorities in its various areas of operation. Students at UNRWA schools study the same curriculum and use the same books authorized by the host governments (except for 
[normal]East Jerusalem
[normal] where the PA curriculum and books have b
[normal]een adopted for use instead of the Israeli ones). Beside the schoolbooks issued by the respective national authorities with no involvement on UNRWA's part, the Agency has published several textbooks of its own which teach issues such as tolerance and human
[normal] rights in its schools, as it testifies: "One of our key programmes promotes human rights and non-violent communication skills, conflict resolution and tolerance."
[normal] 
[normal]However, these additional books do not usually touch sensitive issues related to the confli
[normal]ct such as the attitude to the "other" or the possibility of solving the conflict peacefully.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]The use of books provided by the host governments in UNRWA's school is problematic because these books sometimes contain material that contradicts UNRWA's pro
[normal]fessed mission. Being a UN agency, UNRWA is committed to the ideal of peace and is bound by the UN's goal of solving the Middle Eastern conflict peacefully. In line with this commitment, UNRWA should also refrain from propagating hate indoctrination toward
[normal]s any group, including ethnic and religious ones. Moreover, as a UN body, UNRWA is obliged to treat all member states equally, 
[normal]and never promote against any of them attitudes of non-recognition, prejudice and stereotyped portrayal, not to mention demonizat
[normal]ion. However, the books studied in
[normal] UNRWA's schools often advocate an armed struggle against 
[normal]Israel
[normal] which is denied 
[normal]legitimacy as a sovereign state and severely demonized. 
[normal]This is the case as well with the Palestinian curriculum
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fundamentals of PA Educati[bold]on regarding the [bold]Jewish/Israeli "Other"[bold]6. 
[normal]Examination of 
[normal]some 150 textbooks of various subjects 
[normal]issued by the Palestinian Authority and 
[normal]taught in grades 1-10 at UNRWA's schools 
[normal]in the 
[normal]West Bank
[normal] and the Gaza Strip has revealed 
[normal]three main fundamental
[normal] lines
[normal] 
[normal]as far as the 
[normal]attitude to
[normal] the rival "other" within the conflict is concerned:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]First: denial of legitimacy
[normal]According to the PA schoolbooks, there are no Jewish rights whatsoever in 
[normal]Palestine
[normal] – only "greedy ambitions"
[normal] [
[normal]Atmaa'
[normal]]
[normal].
[normal] There are no Jewish holy places there either – the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's 
[normal]Tomb in Bethlehem are all 
[normal]presented as
[normal] Muslim holy places usurped by Jews.
[normal] Jewish
[normal] 
[normal]cities – including Tel Aviv – are not shown 
[normal]on the map, except for one
[normal] or two
[normal] case
[normal]s
[normal]. Israel's 5.5 million Jews are not counted among the country's legitimate inhabitants while Israeli Arabs and Diaspora Palestinians are, which may present in a nutshell the essence of the perceived "Right of Return" 
[normal]– to be discussed later on: the 5.5 million Jewish illegitimate inhabitants of Palestine would leave and the 4.5 million Palestinians of the Diaspora will return and settle in their pl
[normal]ace:

[normal]. 
[normal]Second: demonization
[normal]Israel
[normal] is not presented as an ordinary sovereign state, but 
[normal]rather as an occupying entity existing at the expense of the Palestinian people's right to self determination in its own homeland. In addition, 
[normal]Israel
[normal] is a source of many evils directed against the Palestinians and other Arabs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]uring my ten-year research 
[normal]of PA schoolbooks I have gathered over thirty accusations against Israel in various fields
[normal], beginning with its very establishment, through its attributed usurpation, aggression, oppression, destructive conduct, desecration of holy places, etc. and ending w
[normal]ith its perceived responsibility for drug abuse phenomena and in-family violence in Palestinian society
[normal]. 
[normal]To make things worse, n
[normal]o objective information about either 
[normal]Israel
[normal] or the Jews
[normal],
[normal] that would balance their negative image in the books
[normal],
[normal] is given to the s
[normal]tudents.

[normal]:

[normal]. 
[normal]Third: advocacy of violent liberation struggle rather than peace with the adversary
[normal]A delegitimized and demonized adversary is not a real partner for peace. Accordingly, no peaceful solution to the conflict is advocated in the PA books used in UN
[normal]RWA's schools. Instead, a violent struggle of liberation against its occupation (both before and after 1967) is promoted. This struggle, which is never said to be restricted to the areas of the 
[normal]West Bank
[normal] and the Gaza Strip
[normal] alone
[normal], is made more compelling by
[normal] the use of the traditional Islamic concepts of 
[normal]Jihad
[normal] and martyrdom [
[normal]Shahadah
[normal]] within its framework. Examples:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]. 
[normal]"Good morning, O my homeland…
[normal]A morning of glory and red liberty, watered by the martyrs' blood…

[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal]The above-presented examples clearly show that
[normal] UNRWA's educational role among the Palestinians is problematic as far as peace education is concerned. One specific issue in this general context that deserves special attention is the so-called "Right of Return".
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The "Right of Return" Issue[bold] 
[normal]2
[normal]2
[normal]. 
[normal]The essence of the Middle East conflict is the century-long struggle between Jews and Palestinian Arabs over one piece of land stretching between the 
[normal]Mediterranean
[normal] and the River Jordan, which both parties regard as their historical homeland. The United Nat
[normal]ions Organization's attempt in 1947 to solve the conflict by way of partition was rejected by the Arab side which 
[normal]started
[normal] a war against the Jews in December that year. The war between the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs, to wh
[normal]om
[normal] five Arab armies joined in M
[normal]ay 1948, lasted sixteen months and ended in an Arab defeat. Both Jews and Palestinians lost in the war one percent of their respective populations. One of the results of that war was a mass exodus of Palestinians from areas taken over by the Jews, which la
[normal]ter became part of the nascent State of Israel. During subsequent years, a parallel number of Jews came to 
[normal]Israel
[normal] from the neighboring Arab countries
[normal], having mostly fled due to their deteriorating safety conditions there
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]The Palestinian and Arab narr
[normal]ative of the Middle East conflict emphasizes what is termed "the Right of Return" which is interpreted as the personal right of every Palestinian, who left his or her home in Palestine in 1948 or afterwards, to return to it and to reclaim his or her proper
[normal]ty in full. This perceived right also applies to the refugee's descendants with no limit of number, time or place of birth.
[normal] Thus, the total number of such claimers has grown during the period that has passed since 1948 from few hundred thousands to severa
[normal]l millions. Although said to have been legally based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and on Resolution No. 194 adopted by the UN General Assembly on Dec. 11, 1948,
[normal] it is clear that such a claimed right has no legal precedence in history and, 
[normal]indeed, has not been applied in other cases of wartime refugees throughout the twentieth century, which witnessed a record number of such refugees.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]Apart from its unique character in international terms, the "Right of Return" also raises serious polit
[normal]ical and human problems, since its full application would mean the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state and thus deny the Jewish nation its right to self determination which has been legally recognized by virtue of the UN partition resoluti
[normal]on. Indeed, throughout the years that succeeded the establishment of 
[normal]Israel
[normal], the "Right of Return" issue was often mentioned in Arab forums within the wider context of the discussion of 
[normal]Israel
[normal]'s liquidation. In Israeli eyes, therefore, the continued persis
[normal]tence on the "Right of Return" by any Arab party betrays that party's desire to wipe 
[normal]Israel
[normal] off the map. Any impartial observer must admit that such fears are solidly grounded in light of the vast human mass involved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]5
[normal]. 
[normal]If peace in the region is meant t
[normal]o be concluded between the Jewish State and its Arab neighbors – and it is so meant internationally – 
[normal]then
[normal] 
[normal]the "Right of Return" issue 
[normal]should 
[normal]not stand in the way to peace as it does today. That
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]especially 
[normal]important 
[normal]in school, in particular 
[normal]– 
[normal]schools th
[normal]at are run by an international
[normal] body such as UNRWA, which is bound by UN resolutions regarding peace in the region and is expressly committed to the ideal of peace.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Teaching "The Right of Return" I: The Ideological Foundations[bold]2
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]The "Right of Return" is
[normal] based ideologically on the argument that Palestine belongs to the Palestinian Arabs alone and that it became the focus of Jewish Zionist greedy ambitions (
[normal]atma'
[normal]) in the nineteenth century with a view to expelling or exterminating the indigenous population
[normal]. Those ambitions were supported by British imperialism in the twentieth century and culminated at the UN Partition Resolution of 1947. Then war broke out in which the Arab side was defeated and Zionist terrorist organizations expelled a whole nation from 
[normal]its homeland and established the State of Israel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]Quotations
[normal]"The Zionist colonialist greedy ambitions in 
[normal]Palestine
[normal] started in 1882…
[normal]The coming of the Jewish throngs to Palestine continued until 1948 and their goal was taking over the Palestinian land
[normal]s and then taking the original inhabitants' place after their expulsion or extermination…The Zionist greedy ambitions increased with the support of British Imperialism, as the British foreign minister Lord Balfour issued his declaration on November 2, 1917
[normal] which called for giving the Jews a national home in Palestine…

[normal]Palestine
[normal] between the Arabs and the Jews. Accordingly, the British Mandate over

[normal]Under such circumstances it would be only
[normal] natural – this line of argumentation continues – that those refugees, 
[normal]as well as their descendants, will be entitled to return to their usurped homeland by all means any time. In fact, the textbooks used in UNRWA's schools never discuss any other possible solution to the Palestinian refugee problem.

[normal]. 
[normal]The "Right of Return" is part and parcel of the discussion of the co
[normal]nflict. It appears in 
[normal]stories, such as the one in w
[normal]hich a grandfather is showing his grandson the ownership deeds of the land they owned in the Coastal Plain and "the keys to our house which we were forced to leave by the [Israeli 1948] occupation", and the grandson promises to keep it.

[normal]cially 
[normal]interesting in this context is the use of poems in order to strengthen among the students the sense that the return is inevitable. The poems add an emotional dimension to the issue and reveal one of its characteristics that is not usually evident in

[normal]Conclusion[bold]38
[normal]. 
[normal]The manifestations of the "Right of Return" in the PA textbooks taught in UNRWA schools are not nostalgic literary pieces. Rather, as presented to the students and shown here,
[normal] the "Right of Return" plays a prominent role in the Palestinian political vision of a continued struggle against a delegitimized and demonized 
[normal]Israel
[normal] until its eventual destruction. The educational services provided by UNRWA to Palestinian students in the
[normal] 
[normal]West Bank
[normal], the Gaza Strip and the neighboring countries thus help to propagate this non-peaceful line, in absolute contradiction to the Agency's declared mission. The huge accumulated number of UNRWA's indoctrinated graduates throughout six decades of ope
[normal]ration is the Agency's contribution to the perpetuation of the conflict. It is true that UNRWA has always maintained a policy of non-involvement in local curricula taught in its schools. But it is now high time that this policy be changed. An international
[normal] organization of this caliber committed to the ideal of peace and relying in its funding on democratic countries mostly, should have a say in this matter, especially in view of its relatively large share in Palestinian educational activity. UNRWA should no
[normal]t continue its policy of absolute submission to the political, ideological and propagandist lines of the host governments in its areas of operation whenever these lines contradict UNRWA's principles and mission. There are things that UNRWA must not teach
[normal]. 
[normal]It is therefore mandatory that action be taken by all parties concerned, especially those ones that contribute to the Agency's budget, to make it change this course of action.
