defaultUdefaultNRWAdefault's Educational Activity in the defaultMiddle Eastdefault1. 
defaultUNRWA – the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinian refugees in the Middle East – was established in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 by the UN General Assembly resolution 302 (IV) of December 8, 
default1948, in
default order to carry out relie
defaultf and works programs for the Palestinian war refugees. The agency began operations on May 1, 
default1950. In
default the absence of a solution to the refugee problem, the Assembly has repeatedly renewed UNRWA's mandate.
default&#xa0;
default2. 
defaultOver half of UNRWA's general budget is dedicate
defaultd to education (381,055 million USD out of a total budget of 673,789 million USD in 2012, which makes 56.55%).
default The agency also offers health, relief and social services. UNRWA provides free-of-charge basic education to children of Palestinian refugees in the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, the Israel-controlled East Jer
defaultusalem, and in 
defaultJordan
default, 
defaultSyria
default and 
defaultLebanon
default. In the school year of 2011/2012 it ran a total of 703 schools caring for 491,641 students. 245 of these 
defaultschools were in the Gaza Strip and 99 were in the 
defaultWest Bank
default, with 225,098 and 51,695 students respectively.
default T
defaultwo of UNRWA's West Bank schools are actually located in the greater 
defaultJerusalem
default area which was annexed to 
defaultIsrael
default in 1967.
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultBasic education means both elementary and intermediate (also called "preparatory") schools, that is, grades 1-9 or 10, depending on 
defaultthe specific school system in each country.
default Only in 
defaultLebanon
default does the Agency operate some nine high schools as well, since Palestinian students of these grades find it difficult to study in local public or private schools.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultUNRWA maintains close cooperat
defaultion with government educational authorities in its various areas of operation. Students at UNRWA schools study the same curriculum and use the same books authorized by the host governments (except for 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default where the PA curriculum and books have b
defaulteen adopted for use instead of the Israeli ones). Beside the schoolbooks issued by the respective national authorities with no involvement on UNRWA's part, the Agency has published several textbooks of its own which teach issues such as tolerance and human
default rights in its schools, as it testifies: "One of our key programmes promotes human rights and non-violent communication skills, conflict resolution and tolerance."
default 
defaultHowever, these additional books do not usually touch sensitive issues related to the confli
defaultct such as the attitude to the "other" or the possibility of solving the conflict peacefully.
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultThe use of books provided by the host governments in UNRWA's school is problematic because these books sometimes contain material that contradicts UNRWA's pro
defaultfessed mission. Being a UN agency, UNRWA is committed to the ideal of peace and is bound by the UN's goal of solving the Middle Eastern conflict peacefully. In line with this commitment, UNRWA should also refrain from propagating hate indoctrination toward
defaults any group, including ethnic and religious ones. Moreover, as a UN body, UNRWA is obliged to treat all member states equally, 
defaultand never promote against any of them attitudes of non-recognition, prejudice and stereotyped portrayal, not to mention demonizat
defaultion. However, the books studied in
default UNRWA's schools often advocate an armed struggle against 
defaultIsrael
default which is denied 
defaultlegitimacy as a sovereign state and severely demonized. 
defaultThis is the case as well with the Palestinian curriculum
default.

defaultthree main fundamental
default lines
default 
defaultas far as the 
defaultattitude to
default the rival "other" within the conflict is concerned:
default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultFirst: denial of legitimacy
defaultAccording to the PA schoolbooks, there are no Jewish rights whatsoever in 
defaultPalestine
default – only "greedy ambitions"
default [
defaultAtmaa'
default]
default.
default There are no Jewish holy places there either – the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's 
defaultTomb in Bethlehem are all 
defaultpresented as
default Muslim holy places usurped by Jews.
default Jewish
default 
defaultcities – including Tel Aviv – are not shown 
defaulton the map, except for one
default or two
default case
defaults
default. Israel's 5.5 million Jews are not counted among the country's legitimate inhabitants while Israeli Arabs and Diaspora Palestinians are, which may present in a nutshell the essence of the perceived "Right of Return" 
default– to be discussed later on: the 5.5 million Jewish illegitimate inhabitants of Palestine would leave and the 4.5 million Palestinians of the Diaspora will return and settle in their pl

defaultThird: advocacy of violent liberation struggle rather than peace with the adversary
defaultA delegitimized and demonized adversary is not a real partner for peace. Accordingly, no peaceful solution to the conflict is advocated in the PA books used in UN
defaultRWA's schools. Instead, a violent struggle of liberation against its occupation (both before and after 1967) is promoted. This struggle, which is never said to be restricted to the areas of the 
defaultWest Bank
default and the Gaza Strip
default alone
default, is made more compelling by
default the use of the traditional Islamic concepts of 
defaultJihad
default and martyrdom [
defaultShahadah
default] within its framework. Examples:
default&#xa0;
default18
default. 
default"Good morning, O my homeland…
defaultA morning of glory and red liberty, watered by the martyrs' blood…

default default&#xa0;
default2
default1
default. 
defaultThe above-presented examples clearly show that
default UNRWA's educational role among the Palestinians is problematic as far as peace education is concerned. One specific issue in this general context that deserves special attention is the so-called "Right of Return".
default&#xa0;defaultThe "Right of Return" Issuedefault 
default2
default2
default. 
defaultThe essence of the Middle East conflict is the century-long struggle between Jews and Palestinian Arabs over one piece of land stretching between the 
defaultMediterranean
default and the River Jordan, which both parties regard as their historical homeland. The United Nat
defaultions Organization's attempt in 1947 to solve the conflict by way of partition was rejected by the Arab side which 
defaultstarted
default a war against the Jews in December that year. The war between the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs, to wh
defaultom
default five Arab armies joined in M
defaultay 1948, lasted sixteen months and ended in an Arab defeat. Both Jews and Palestinians lost in the war one percent of their respective populations. One of the results of that war was a mass exodus of Palestinians from areas taken over by the Jews, which la
defaultter became part of the nascent State of Israel. During subsequent years, a parallel number of Jews came to 
defaultIsrael
default from the neighboring Arab countries
default, having mostly fled due to their deteriorating safety conditions there
default.
default&#xa0;
default2
default3
default. 
defaultThe Palestinian and Arab narr
defaultative of the Middle East conflict emphasizes what is termed "the Right of Return" which is interpreted as the personal right of every Palestinian, who left his or her home in Palestine in 1948 or afterwards, to return to it and to reclaim his or her proper
defaultty in full. This perceived right also applies to the refugee's descendants with no limit of number, time or place of birth.
default Thus, the total number of such claimers has grown during the period that has passed since 1948 from few hundred thousands to severa
defaultl millions. Although said to have been legally based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and on Resolution No. 194 adopted by the UN General Assembly on Dec. 11, 1948,
default it is clear that such a claimed right has no legal precedence in history and, 
defaultindeed, has not been applied in other cases of wartime refugees throughout the twentieth century, which witnessed a record number of such refugees.
default&#xa0;
default2
default4
default. 
defaultApart from its unique character in international terms, the "Right of Return" also raises serious polit
defaultical and human problems, since its full application would mean the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state and thus deny the Jewish nation its right to self determination which has been legally recognized by virtue of the UN partition resoluti
defaulton. Indeed, throughout the years that succeeded the establishment of 
defaultIsrael
default, the "Right of Return" issue was often mentioned in Arab forums within the wider context of the discussion of 
defaultIsrael
default's liquidation. In Israeli eyes, therefore, the continued persis
defaulttence on the "Right of Return" by any Arab party betrays that party's desire to wipe 
defaultIsrael
default off the map. Any impartial observer must admit that such fears are solidly grounded in light of the vast human mass involved.
default&#xa0;
default2
default5
default. 
defaultIf peace in the region is meant t
defaulto be concluded between the Jewish State and its Arab neighbors – and it is so meant internationally – 
defaultthen
default 
defaultthe "Right of Return" issue 
defaultshould 
defaultnot stand in the way to peace as it does today. That

defaultespecially 
defaultimportant 
defaultin school, in particular 
default– 
defaultschools th
defaultat are run by an international
default body such as UNRWA, which is bound by UN resolutions regarding peace in the region and is expressly committed to the ideal of peace.
default&#xa0;
defaultTeaching "The Right of Return" I: The Ideological Foundationsdefault2
default6
default. 
defaultThe "Right of Return" is
default based ideologically on the argument that Palestine belongs to the Palestinian Arabs alone and that it became the focus of Jewish Zionist greedy ambitions (
defaultatma'
default) in the nineteenth century with a view to expelling or exterminating the indigenous population
default. Those ambitions were supported by British imperialism in the twentieth century and culminated at the UN Partition Resolution of 1947. Then war broke out in which the Arab side was defeated and Zionist terrorist organizations expelled a whole nation from 
defaultits homeland and established the State of Israel.
default&#xa0;
default2
default7
default. 
defaultQuotations
default"The Zionist colonialist greedy ambitions in 
defaultPalestine
default started in 1882…
defaultThe coming of the Jewish throngs to Palestine continued until 1948 and their goal was taking over the Palestinian land

default which called for giving the Jews a national home in Palestine…

default"In the year 1947 the United Nations Organization adopted a resolution partitioning

default. 
defaultUnder such circumstances it would be only
default natural – this line of argumentation continues – that those refugees, 
defaultas well as their descendants, will be entitled to return to their usurped homeland by all means any time. In fact, the textbooks used in UNRWA's schools never discuss any other possible solution to the Palestinian refugee problem.

default&#xa0;defaultTeaching "The Right of Return" II: Practicedefault3
default2
default. 
defaultThe "Right of Return" is part and parcel of the discussion of the co
defaultnflict. It appears in 
defaultstories, such as the one in w
defaulthich a grandfather is showing his grandson the ownership deeds of the land they owned in the Coastal Plain and "the keys to our house which we were forced to leave by the [Israeli 1948] occupation", and the grandson promises to keep it.
default Besides, there are
default language exercises using this theme such as the following one:

default. 
default"Activity 2: Let us feel in the empty space with the appropriate noun…

default&#xa0;
default3
default4
default. 
defaultEspe
defaultcially 
defaultinteresting in this context is the use of poems in order to strengthen among the students the sense that the return is inevitable. The poems add an emotional dimension to the issue and reveal one of its characteristics that is not usually evident in
default other forms of discussion of the "Right of Return".

default. 
defaultThe "Right of Return", by definition, is a right, not a privilege. As such, it does not depend on

defaultConclusiondefault38
default. 
defaultThe manifestations of the "Right of Return" in the PA textbooks taught in UNRWA schools are not nostalgic literary pieces. Rather, as presented to the students and shown here,
default the "Right of Return" plays a prominent role in the Palestinian political vision of a continued struggle against a delegitimized and demonized 
defaultIsrael
default until its eventual destruction. The educational services provided by UNRWA to Palestinian students in the
default 
defaultWest Bank
default, the Gaza Strip and the neighboring countries thus help to propagate this non-peaceful line, in absolute contradiction to the Agency's declared mission. The huge accumulated number of UNRWA's indoctrinated graduates throughout six decades of ope
defaultration is the Agency's contribution to the perpetuation of the conflict. It is true that UNRWA has always maintained a policy of non-involvement in local curricula taught in its schools. But it is now high time that this policy be changed. An international
default organization of this caliber committed to the ideal of peace and relying in its funding on democratic countries mostly, should have a say in this matter, especially in view of its relatively large share in Palestinian educational activity. UNRWA should no
defaultt continue its policy of absolute submission to the political, ideological and propagandist lines of the host governments in its areas of operation whenever these lines contradict UNRWA's principles and mission. There are things that UNRWA must not teach
default. 
defaultIt is therefore mandatory that action be taken by all parties concerned, especially those ones that contribute to the Agency's budget, to make it change this course of action.
