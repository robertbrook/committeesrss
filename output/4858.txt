[[[Follow up action]]]&#xa0;I believe there were two undertakings for follow-up action from Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick. These were in relation to the Counter-Terrorist Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) and the Certificate in Knowledge of Policing (CKP). I attach a brief note on both, which I hope will address the Committee’s interest. Please let me know if you require anything further.&#xa0;

[[[The Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU)]]]&#xa0;The Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) is part of the Counter Terrorism Command and holds the national remit for assessing terrorist and violent extremist material on the internet. The unit is proactive in its approach to terrorist content but also receives referrals through a public online reporting tool that allows members of the public to report their concerns anonymously. It is also be responsible for alerting forces, Counter Terrorism Units and Counter Terrorism Intelligence Units to online terrorist offences that may fall within their jurisdiction. Its aim is to make the internet a more hostile environment for terrorists and violent extremists by making operating conditions more difficult for them. As the vast majority of terrorist content is hosted overseas this includes working with industry and foreign law enforcement agencies to prevent the internet being misused to promote violence. Since the unit was formed in February 2010 over 5,700 individual pieces of online terrorist content have been removed from the internet and almost 1,000 other links have been filtered from the UK public estate which prevents them from being accessed on computers in locations such as libraries, universities and other publicly funded institutions.&#xa0;

[[[Certificate in Knowledge of Policing ]]]&#xa0;The eligibility requirements to become a new police constable in the police service have changed. As of April 2013 candidates applying to the MPS are required to have completed a Certificate in Knowledge of Policing (CKP) before starting as a constable. The CKP is a self-funded qualification developed by the College of Policing, in partnership with Skills for Justice and all Home Office funded Police Forces, and is broadly equivalent to an A-Level. It covers the wide range of policing and legislative knowledge that constables need to perform their role effectively. It will provide an ideal foundation for a career in policing, ensuring that new police constables have the knowledge, and understanding as well as the dedication to keep Londoners safe, prior to their in service training. &#xa0;A CKP will cost approximately between £800-£1,000 to fund and 6 weeks (full-time) to complete. The course is also accessible at weekends and evenings. Further and Higher Education providers as well as independent providers will obtain a licence from the College of Policing to deliver the CKP course. The MPS is currently looking at various financial support packages for candidates, including for example, Bursaries.  &#xa0;The MPS has agreed a range of positive action options as permitted under the Equality Act to help support candidate’s individual needs when applying to join as a police constable, enabling us to attract and recruit a more representative workforce of the communities we serve. These include access to coaching by established officers, additional training prior to candidates attending assessment centres and changes to the recruitment processes whereby external BME candidates will be able to take their Day 1 assessment prior to obtaining CKP. &#xa0;When a candidate’s application passes initial checks, they will be invited to attend a formal, day-long assessment referred to as ‘Day 1’. The day comprises of: &#xa0;A competency-based structured interviewA numerical ability testA verbal ability testTwo written exercisesFour interactive exercises&#xa0;These activities allow the MPS to observe and assess whether the candidate has the right skills and qualities required to be a police constable. &#xa0;We know from the 2011 census that London is more diverse than ever and that our workforce does not reflect that diversity as we would like it to. We believe that to police a diverse city like London successfully and with the consent, support and engagement of the communities we serve, we need a workforce that more closely reflects London at all levels. &#xa0;Improvements have been made to the diversity of our workforce with nearly 10.4% (3,170) of our police officers now from a BME background. However, in order to increase that number, we need to adapt our approach so we see a change in the makeup of our workforce now, not in the distant future. To achieve this we want to use options permitted under the Equalities Act to help target and attract candidates from BME backgrounds into a successful career in the MPS. &#xa0;The MPS has rigorous selection standards to ensure we recruit officers who are the best fit for the demands of policing our capital now and in the future. These high standards the MPS prides itself on will remain, with the additional requirement of the CKP, as we move into our latest recruitment drive. We will work closely with both course providers and the College to monitor both uptake and access to funding streams. If certain communities are adversely affected, this intelligence will help shape future recruitment campaigns.&#xa0;Cressida Dick, Assistant Commissioner, Metropolitan PoliceJune 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
