defaultWe are a group of Italian organisations looking to provide the Committee with information on the effect of a ban on single use-plastic bags in Italy (with exemptions for dual-use compostable bags).
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe measure has had a number of benefits for the re-industrialisation of the European and Italian chemical sector, as well as benefits to organic recycling and agricultural industries and the Italian Environment.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe policy measure has helped the support emergence of a

default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of compostable bags has increased the level and quality of organic recycling – which has been beneficial to both the farming and 
defaultbiowaste
default industries. It has also reduced the costs of disposal (landfill and incineration) for local Government.
default&#xa0;

defaultOur submission intends to explain to the committee the impact of a ban on single-use plastic bags in Italy and highlight how the UK can learn from Italy’s experiences. 
defaultThe organisations are as follows:

defaultThe Italian Composting Association unites public and private companies, local authorities and others involved in the production of compost, as well as organizations which do not make compost but have an interest in the composting process (producers of machinery and equipment, producers of fertilisers, research bodies etc.).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2011, Italy became the first country in the EU to introduce a law prohibiting the distribution of single use plastic bags. Since being passed in March 2012, the law has seen a r
defaulteduc
defaulttion in the
default 
defaultconsumption of plastic bags, and the associated 
defaultenvironm
defaulten
defaulttal impact
defaults. And, led by 
defaultindustrial and societal symbiosis
default, the 
defaultdevelopment of 
defaulta circula
defaultr economy
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA circular economy is one that which requires that energy come from renewable resources and that biological materials, such as food waste, are returned to the organic and economic cycles.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe law was aimed at reducing the environmental contamination caused by traditional plastic bags. With this in mind, and to help support the Italian 
defaultbioplastics
default industry, an exemption was allowed for compostable bags.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince its introduction, the new law has helped reduce the consumption of carrier bags by 33% (from 145kton 2010 to 97kton in 2012). In 2011, Italian producers of films and biodegradable compostable bags i
defaultncreased their workforce 
defaultand through investment in research and new machinery a further 500 jobs were created (according to Plastic Consult).
defaultThis level of investment would not have been made possible without the policy certainty created by the new law.
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne un
defaultintended 
defaultconsequence of the law was the exploitation of legislative loopholes – namely the lack of a clear requirement to comply with the European Norm for compostable plastics (EN13432:200
default0
default). 
defaultAs such there has been a proliferation of plastic bags claiming to be biodegradable; these products gained their biodegradable status because of weak certification processes and a system of self-declarations. 
defaultThis loophole was closed in 2013 with the introduction of a new law and fiscal penalties, but this serves to prove the need for any exemptions to be specific with penalties for breaches.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultItaly’s tourism industry is dependent on a clean marine environment. Single use plastic bags make up the majority 
defaultof pollution in the marine environment. As such, action had to be taken by the Italian Government. 
defaultDegradable bags offer a potential solution to the problem of build up of plastic waste in the sea. The paragraphs below explain in more detail.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith more than 8,000 km of coastline, Italy is badly 
defaultaffected
default by plastic litter in the marine environment – particularly as any deterioration in the environment impacts tourism - a fundamental economic resource for the country. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn March 2011, the Environmental Protection Agencies of Tuscany and Emilia Romagna carried out an environmental survey which revealed that 73% of human-origin waste found on the seabed is made up of plastic bags of various sizes. Further monitoring has revealed that 95% of the large-scale refuse floating in the Tyrrhenian Sea is made up of plastic, 41% of this being made up of plastic bags and fragments.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConventional plastics are strongly resistant to biodegradation, and tend to build up in the marine environment if not properly disposed of. Moreover many studies show that, in the long term, plastic bags are transformed in small fragments of dimension and concentration similar to plankton with the risk of entering in the food chain. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe European Standard, EN13432:200
default0
default, used to determine biodegradation of packaging items was established to verify biodegradation for composting 
defaultpurposes. 
defaultIn 2012, an Italian study investigated biodegradation in different marine habitats and the tests indicated that the EN13432:200
default0
default compostable films biodegraded to a substantial extent (88% in 236 days) in conditions replicating the sea bed and had completely disappeared on the shoreline tests. These results mirrored those of Plymouth University who found that compostable bags fully degraded (disappeared completely) in 24 weeks in Queens Anne Battery Marina unlike the conventional or pro-oxidant (
defaultoxo
default-degradable) polythene which showed almost no change (max 2%) in 40 weeks.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStudies as to how the measure has affected waste going into the marine environment are ongoing.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Italian chemicals industry – due 
defaultin part 
defaultto high feedstock costs has been in long term decline. The emergence of a 
defaultbioplastics
default industry – underpinned by a legal system which supports the development of 
defaultbioplastics
default has played a role in reversing this decline, and reduced the fossil fuel dependence of the industry. See below for detail.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFrom the 1930s until the 1990s, Italy was one of the world’s leading research and manufacturing hubs for plastics. 
defaultIn addition, up 
defaultuntil 2012
default, Italy was (
defaultper capita
default)
default Europe’s largest consumer of flexible plastic packaging and in particular carrier bags.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the combination of overexpansion, increased competition from cheaper imports and a lack of enforced regulation over 
defaulttime
default meant that Italy’s global position in the traditional chemical market declined significantly. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDuring the 
defaulte
defaultconomic crisis of 2009, the fragility of the industry was further exposed and multinational chemical companies across the country were forced to close their older facilities. The industrial crisis was compounded further by the relative cost of naphtha (€761 / tonne in Italy v €93 / tonne in the Middle East) meaning the traditional plastics industry was increasingly concentrated outside of Italy and Europe and into Asia
default...
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConsequently, Italy went from being a leader in manufacturing and exports to being a net importer (7% of internal production against 19% imports). A situation not dissimilar to that of the UK.
default&#xa0;
default5.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRising oil costs and
default a
default desire to commercially apply green chemistry 
defaultsaw the emergence of companies like Novamont and 
defaultColdiretti
default – who sought to use locally sourced 
defaultbioproducts
default (such as thistles, corn and sunflowers) to produce new types of plastic.
default&#xa0;
default5.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe developme
defaultnt of a new industry using innovative
default biotechnology to produce biodegradable and 
defaultbiobased
default plastics in Italy is continuing to thrive. A prime example of this is the Joint Venture between ENI-
defaultVersalis
default and Novamont in Porto Torres in Sardinia. The Porto Torres petrochemical facility is one of Italy’s most important industrial chemical facilities but due to the decline in the overall industry it has in recent years been in crisis. The new joint venture – 
defaultMatrica
default - will see investments of €500M to convert part of the facility into the world’s first third generation 
defaultbiorefinery
default to produce new materials from locally sourced agricultural resources such as the non-food crop, cardoon grown on marginal and previously contaminated land. The investment will see seven new industrial facilities to produce not just 
defaultbioplastics
default but 
defaultbiolubricants
default, 
defaultbiofillers
default and additives. It is estimated 
defaultMatrica
default alone with create a work force of 690 jobs.
default&#xa0;
default5.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBeyond 
defaultMatrica
default, investments are seeing the redevelopment of other disused industrial facilities including a fermentation plant in 
defaultAdria
default / Veneto to produce renewable-sourced chemical intermediates used in 
defaultbioplastics
default. There is also a “magnet” effect, non-Italian companies such as 
defaultCereplast
default (USA), 
defaultRoquette
default (Fr) and DSM (NL) have decided to invest in 
defaultbioplastics
default and biochemical intermediates.
default&#xa0;
default5.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are currently watching the evolution of policy in the UK, if the Government signals that it is supportive of compostable plastics and regulates accordingly we may consider investment in the UK
default – as we would prefer to manufacture the bags locally if demand is great enough – which would create new jobs. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe plastic bag law has supported Italy’s drive to reduce food and garden waste going to landfill. In addition, it has lead to
default an
default improved quality of material being composted or digested. This has substantial benefits for the agricultural sector.
default 
defaultThe following paragraphs 
defaultoutline these benefits in more detail.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 1992, landfill costs in northern Italy, and in particular
default Lombardy, were as low as £8 / tonne. T
defaulthere were no legislative requirements for any form of diversion.  
defaultHowever, the sudden closure of 
defaultMilan’s largest landfill 
defaultled to a dramatic spike in the costs of landfill
default – with costs rising to £80 / tonne
default within the year 
defaultand some 
defaultwaste 
defaulteven 
defaultbe
defaulting
default transported to Switzerland for incineration
default. By 2005, the price for landfill has risen to 
defaultnearly £120 / 
defaulttonne
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the same time, 
defaultdespite some government assistance, 
defaultagriculture in Italy has been in decline. I
defaultn recent years the high costs, particularly associated with labour, fuel and fertilisers have led to a drop in the number of farms. Between 1982 and 2010, over 3
default million
default 
defaulthectares 
defaultof arable land have been
default lost.
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs 
defaultthe cost of treating food waste 
defaultthrough composting 
defaultis less than half 
defaultthe cost of 
defaultlandfill
default the composting industry has seen significant investment
default. Most 
defaultrecent figure
defaults show that over 
defaultfour and a half 
defaultmillion tonnes of 
defaultbiowaste
default (food and garden waste)
default are 
defaultnow 
defaultbeing 
defaultorganically recycled through anaerobic digestion and / or composting 
default a year 
defaultin Italy
default. This industry now h
defaultas an annual turnover of €400M. For comparison, the total municipal 
defaultbiowaste
default sent for organic recycling in England in 2012 was
default roughly five 
defaultmillion 
defaulttonnes 
defaultand the industry has an estimated annual turnover of £200M and employs over 1,000 full time staff.
default&#xa0;
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 1992 the most common tools for collecting food waste in Italy are a small cont
defaultainer (7 – 10l
default) and compostable liners for use in the kitchen and a larger outdoor container (25l) which is emptied twice a week. Following a visit by WRAP to Novamont and northern Italy in 2006, this system of collecting food waste has become increasingly common in the UK with over ten million households receiving a food waste collection where compostable liners are accepted.
default&#xa0;
default6.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimply collecting materials is half the battle – t
defaulthe importance of quality 
defaultof 
defaultfeedstock
default for efficient organic recycling cannot be over stated. 
defaultThe presence of components that are not completely degradable in a composting feedstock poses a significant risk to the environment. 
defaultIn order to meet the defined quality standards for composted materials the organic recycling industry has to extract the non-biodegradable fraction. Despite the best efforts of local authority collection services, the quantity of non-biodegradable contaminants in 
defaultfeedstock
default presented for organic recycling in Italy and the UK is a serious concern. 
default&#xa0;
default6.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver the past decade, substantial data has been collected which supports the need to implement separate collection of bio-waste (including kitchen, agriculture and green waste) to recover valuable resources for soil enhancement while decreasing GHG emissions. Separate collection of municipal as well as commercial bio-waste as the steering principle in bio-waste recycling via composting or anaerobic digestion would constitute the highest level of environmental benefit as well as economic viability. 
default&#xa0;
default6.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn Italy, the CIC have calculated that at least 53,000 T of non-compostable plastics have to be removed and sent for disposal each year at a cost of €10-12M. In England, according to the median data of the WRAP ASORI survey for 2012, the quantity of non-compostable plastic is in the region of 64,000T costing the industry at least £15M / year (based on data from the REA).  To put this in context, the latest RECOUP survey shows that less than 7,000T of household plastic film was collected for recycling in 2012. 
default&#xa0;
default6.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA study released by CIC has found that impurities in biodegradable waste streams have decreased by 8% and as a result compost is less contaminated by plastic waste. 
defaultThis has happened because the public recognise compostable carrier bags as an equivalent to a caddy liner bag for collection organic waste. Compostable carrier bags now represent a strategic tool to implement high performing organic waste collection schemes and are strongly supported by the CIC and by the Italian Association of the Local Authorities (ANCI)
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTrials carried out in conjunction with the Co-operative Supermarket chain in the UK have shown that compostable bags have reduced the volume of waste going to landfill and quality of 
defaultfood waste
default collected by councils.
default&#xa0;
default6.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCompostable flexible films have also been shown to be compatible with the current collection and treatment stream of conventional plastic packaging up to 10%. These are the conclusions of the study carried on by 
defaultConai
default (Italian Consortium for Packaging Recycling).  Although the reality is the compostable bags are used mainly for organic recycling of food waste and not sent for recycling with traditional plastics.
default&#xa0;
default6.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is estimated that the policy has so far saved Italy €5.1m in landfill costs.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent surveys show that most Italians (94%) believe that the law is an important milestone for the environment, while 88% recognise that biodegradable compostable plastics are an important innovation capable of triggering multiple positive effects (i.e. green attitudes, new green jobs, etc.) (ISPO data)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDirective 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste defines organic recycling as “the aerobic (composting) or anaerobic (
defaultbiomethanization
default) treatment, under controlled conditions and using micro-organisms, of the biodegradable parts of packaging waste, which produces stabilized organic residues or methane”.  
default&#xa0;
default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver the past decade, substantial data were collected supporting the need to implement separate collection of bio-waste (including kitchen, agriculture and green waste) to recover valuable resources for soil enhancement while decreasing GHG emissions. Separate collection of municipal as well as commercial bio-waste as the steering principle in bio-waste recycling via composting or anaerobic digestion would constitute the highest level of environmental benefit as well as economic viability.
default&#xa0;default8.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the introduction of the Italian law, the EU has moved to introduce measures to restrict the consumption of single use plastic bags across the EU. On November 27, the 
defaultEuropean Parliament Environment Committee voted on a number of amendments to the European Strategy on Plastic Waste in the Environment including:
default&#xa0;default8.3.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultt
defaulthat the most dangerous plastics, those that by scientific evidence are shown to be the most disruptive to human health and the environment (such as micro- and 
defaultoxo
default‐biodegradable plastics) and those which contain heavy metals and other substances that can also make recycling processes more difficult, should be phased out of the market or banned outright, as soon as possible before 2020
default.
default&#xa0;default8.3.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultsingle-use, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable and non-compostable plastic bags should be radically reduced and where possible phased out
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default9.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe effectiveness of measures to reduce the use of single-use carrier bags can be 
defaultincreased with exemptions for compostable bags.
default&#xa0;
default9.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnlike single-use bags these compostable bags have significantly lower environmental impact – and can completely biodegrade quickly in most natural environments. They have no further impact on wildlife or the food chain.
default&#xa0;
default9.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe compostable bio-plastics industry is a research driven sector, and an alternative to the traditional European petrochemical industry which is struggling to compete with high fuel costs outside Europe.
default&#xa0;
default9.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCompostable bags can play a significant role in the reducing the volume of food waste going to landfill – and improve the quality of 
defaultcompostable materials passed onto the agricultural sector. By providing them through supermarkets it can reduce the costs to councils of providing compostable bin liners.
default&#xa0;
default9.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;
