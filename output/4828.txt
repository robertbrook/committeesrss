[[[Introduction]]]We are pleased to make a submission to the Committee’s inquiry into the many and interrelated issues relevant to any proposals to increase fiscal devolution to English cities and city regions. We note the Chair of the Committee acknowledges (commenting on the launch of the inquiry) that fiscal devolution will create impacts which are not necessarily easy to predict ahead of any roll out of fiscal change and, we imagine, such knock on effects for good or otherwise will not become apparent until time has passed. In summary:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[all for evidence on the concept]]]In terms of our business we seek to develop our activity and associated economic contribution in many parts of the UK (see map on p.2) and many of the locations where we operate face economic and social problems above the national average. We are concerned at the continuing trend for English regions, not uniformly of course, to underperform London and there is a need for better understanding of why this is happening and how the regions can be made to perform better. Cities where the bulk of the population live and city regions deserve focussed support to stimulate their ability to drive recovery and we look to any new devolution of fiscal powers to take account of the existing efforts of the private sector in such areas.An area well worth exploring and of interest to us as a business investing in so many city centres and regions of England.  Enhancing local responsibility and fiscal freedoms must be accompanied by genuine accountability and transparency so that others investing locally and regionally can continue to plan with the best knowledge and certainty. If fiscal devolution empowers better local leadership and longer-term financial strategies and investment then private sector investors like intu will broadly welcome that outcome. Alongside ‘leadership’ and closely related we see this as a key issue. How would existing structures change/come together?  And other bodies beyond the current tiers of local government; LEPs, Parish Council's and Neighbourhood Forums, how would they be made/encouraged to act in concert as required/dictated by new arrangements? In terms of this question and some others the success or otherwise of the LEP model may be instructive. Any new models of fiscal devolution seeking to act as much needed spurs to local action should also encourage closer engagement and partnership with the private sector in consideration of the best and most sustainable economic outcomes.  The law of unintended consequences should be assessed especially in respect of any new structures which might be brought to life by fiscal devolution.A key point and likely to be the cause of uncertainty/lack of action in terms of private sector investment unless such impacts are investigated in detail ahead of the roll out of any changes designed to promote fiscal devolution.&#xa0;These are substantial, complicated and inter-related issues and should be considered ahead of any large-scale constitutional change.  The operation of Business Rates, a subject referenced in the recent Autumn Statement, should, in particular, be subject to review and, in our view, reform before extending fiscal devolution in any way.

[[[Intu’s response to CLG Committee call for evidence on the details]]]Consideration of fiscal devolution should not preclude early and detailed consideration of the nature and operation of any taxes, grants and formulas in current operation. In the case of Business Rates we and many others have called upon the government to review the operation of the tax and consider reform.  We submitted our views on Business Rates to a recent Inquiry by the BIS Committee and our key concerns are given below.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of indirect relevance to private sector investors like intu. We do, however, seek to engage with local authorities about strategic and infrastructure issues including public realm, transport and highways. Changes to the borrowing powers of public bodies could affect consideration of these matters and influence our investment and planning decisions. A return, if that was the outcome, to more proactive and strategic consideration of infrastructure improvements by local authorities would be welcomed by businesses like ours which invest in the creation of local and regional destinations and generate economic activity and employment as a result.6 January 20146&#xa0; Figures from British Retail Consortium Figures from Association of Convenience Stores
