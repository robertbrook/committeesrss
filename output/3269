defaultWritten evidence from London Borough of Lambeth
defaultLambeth is one of a growing number of councils that ar
defaulte becoming cooperative
default councils. That means putting people who use our services or live in our communities in control of the decisions that affect their lives. At its core it is about citizens, councillors and council staff working together to determine local outcomes and how best to deliver those. 
defaultLambeth
default has developed its own ambitious public service reform programme to become a cooperative council. 
defaultEmpowering and 
defaultworking with citizens (coproduction
default) is
default central to our 
defaultapproach
default and
default it
default is
default changing the way we think about the rol
defaulte of local government in public service provision
default. 
default 
defaultIn 
defaultthe context
default of reducing public sector spending we are 
defaultworking with
default citizens to meet their needs
default. In Lambeth we are seeking to build on the assets in our communities and to give power and control back to them, so that they can find ways of helping themselves and others
default to
default lead the lives they want to lead.

defaultAs 
defaultpart of the government’s mutual pathfinder scheme they also help other social enterprise projects follow in their path; sharing their journey and helping others learn from their mistakes and successes.

defaultImproving and democratisingdefaultCooperative Libraries
defaultFaced with the same challenges to library provision as the rest of the country we engaged with a wide range of people around each of our nine libraries. We provided detailed financial and service information and worked with the community develop wh
defaultat a successful library service
default would look
default like. A plan and budget has been set for each library 
defaultthat has been coproduced with 
defaultthe community. This has resulted in Lambeth retaining all of its existing libraries whilst also reducing the necessary costs. Communities have taken on greater responsibility for libraries, and are tailoring the services offered by the libraries to meet the needs of that particular community.

defaultc. 
default              
defaultW
defaulte believe that the real value of our cooperative approach lies in 
defaultbringing greater resources to bear on the challenges we face. 
default Local government revenues are a small, and diminishing, proportion of the total resources available in our borough. 
defaultThere is also a wealth of resources in our communities
default, among the people who live and work here, 
defaultwho we can work with, enable
default,
default and support to achieve our shared outcomes.
default 
default In Lambeth we believe that providing 
defaultreactive
default services 
defaultto
default people is neither sustainable nor effective.  
defaultWe focus on the strengths of citizens to achieve good outcomes: c
defaultoproduction and an asset-based approach enables the council to grow the existing assets and strengths within our communities
default, 
defaultenabling communities to meet their own needs.

defaultThe Young Lambeth Coop (YLC)
defaultThe YLC is a completely independent, community owned organisation that exemplifies the council’s ambition to transfer control and decision-making to local communities. 
defaultOver
default 
default800 community hours have already been committed to the YLC’s development and 1100 adults and 650 young people expressed interest in being involved in its development.  
default&#xa0;
defaultYLC members will be responsible for a £6m budget deciding what play and youth services are provided across the borough. 
defaultIt is programmed to deliver the council 24% cashable savings and be 23% cheaper than the current commissioning model
default. 
defaultFurthermore it aims to commission an additional £3.8 million worth of services for young people over 5-years
default of age
default, a significant proportion of which would not otherwise have been brought into the borough.

defaultGreen Community Champions (GCC)
default             
defaultT
defaulthe Council made an open call to citizens to ask them if they would like to be green community champions and asked them to define what they wanted to do, supported by a single officer. There are now 500 champions working with over 60 groups and 5,000 residents on local environmental issues – from food growing to community energy projects. It has led to more innovation and community ownership than if the 
defaultc
defaultouncil had

default is a council facilitated hack-day type event 
defaultwhere
default volunteers work together over single weekends to address particular challenges within the borough.  Volunteers come from a range of backgrounds including graphic designers, artists, project managers and community organisers.  Projects they have worked on include designing a brand new website and branding for the Young Lambeth Coop, accelerating the approach to digital inclusion across the borough, re-launching Vauxhall City Farm and marketing affordable pay-day loan products from the London Mutual Credit Union.  The council facilitates these events through coordinating project briefs and providing a location and 
defaultwifi
default.  However, the output is very much down to those who take part in the weekends.  This approach has enabled the council to harness the creativity of communities and helped create a more permissive council culture where creative changes 
defaultdesigned by the community are put into practice.

defaultFreshview
default is a community-led opportunity for residents to make a difference to their local area whether through brightening up a green space, giving a disused space a facelift or any other activity that improves the local environment.  The council provides nominal support such as plants and paint, expertise where needed
default,
default and support in accessing additional volunteers.  In addition to sprucing up an area Community

defaultEvidencing what worksdefault and learning from early projects. defaultBrixton Energy
defaultBrixton Energy is a not-for-profit co-operative based in Lambeth creating cooperatively owned renewable energy projects whose financial revenues stay within the local community. It is the first social-housing based renewable energy company in the country with a vision to create a greener future for Brixton.  In doing so it is generating energy, increasing Brixton’s energy 
defaultresilience and security, raising awareness about energy efficiency
default,
default tackling fuel poverty
default,
default and providing training and employment for local people.  It was established in cooperation with the council.  Since then five further roofs on the estate have been fitted with panels.
defaultConclusion defaultThese are challenging times; 
defaultthere is less funding and an increased d
defaultemand for some public services.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere are risks but there are opp
defaultortunities too. The Lambeth approach is transformational bu
defaultt we have achieved this through
default a solid evidence base of support (through our Cooperative Council Commission)
default; 
default citizen engagement
default;
default and early prototyping to develop our thinking and draw learning around issues of risk, organisational structure, accountability, behaviour change and capacity building. We have found that in order for the approach to work, the council must help mitigate risk
default,
default but more importantly by building new relationships and putting the citizen in control we are saving money. Ultimately 
defaultwe believe that we will 
defaultsee a collaborative community
default in Lambeth
default where the council acts as a platform for
default that
default collaboration, providing the right spaces and infrastructure to make 
defaultit
default happen. By empowering local people in this way we can give them back the power to change their lives and help those around them, fostering stronger more resilient communities.
