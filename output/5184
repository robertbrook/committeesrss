defaultBased on personal experience and evidence gathered through information provided by GMP and independent surveys of traf

default&#xa0;
defaulti.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is evidence of a deep rooted and institutionalised "anti-cycle" attitude within GMP (and other police forces).

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current policing tactics stated as being pro-safety are based on a
default principle of victim blaming and make little or no attempt to combat dangerous practices by motor vehicle users.
defaultiii.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolicing action to date has largely been based on poor background statistics and invalid suppositions which the police actions inherently reinf
defaultorce due to the poorly designed nature of the police action.
defaultiv.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrent policing tactics serve to alienate cyclists and do little if anything to contribute to an enhanced safety environment for vulnerable road users, ultimately counteracting positive efforts 
defaultby local authorities and others
default to promote and encourage cycling
default.
defaultv.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe knowledge of law relating to cycling and the asymmetrical relationship between cycles and motor vehicles is very poor within the police.
defaultvi.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTraining and a change in police tactics driven fo
defaultr the highest levels is necessary to engage cyclists, improve safety for all vulnerable road users.
defaultvii.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf policing tactics remain as they are, they form a significant barrier to increasing cycling as a mode of transport.

defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester ha
defaults a number of commercial centres located in the various metropolitan boroughs arranged radially around the main business hub within the City Centre. A significant number of business commuters move to and from the City Centre by bicycle, particularly from t
defaulthe a South and West with those commuting routes joining the main A34 "Oxford Rd" into the centre. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultCycle flow along the A34 is further increased during term times by the high student population which includes cycle users in a greater proporti
defaulton than the general population. The high student numbers travelling from the South and West towards the main University campuses (located just South of the City Centre) also leads to a very high number of busses along the A34 route.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe countryside to the
default South and West of Manchester (where it meets Cheshire) is a major hot spot for sporting cyclists as well as families cycling for leisure. As the home of British Cycling, Manchester has a number of very positive, pro cycling factors. Residents of the city 
defaultare proud of its cycling facilities and the international success and notoriety this has brought. The city was fortunate to turn this positive legacy into a forward looking plan winning significant funding from Central Government for the VeloCity initiativ
defaulte which intends to 
defaultachieve a 300% increase in 
defaultcycling across Greater Manchester by 20
default25
default. Cycling in Manchester has increased in recent years and is set to continue to increase in the future.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs a cyclist who habitually obeys traffic laws and seeks to act 
defaultin a manner which is considerate and safe, Mr 
defaultLay
default was concerned that some cyclists and drivers appear to routinely act dangerously and that there is an apparent belief amongst many drivers that cyclists are a law breaking nuisance that the police fail to a
defaultct against and a corresponding belief amongst cyclists that drivers are dangerous law breakers out to kill cyclists that the police fail to act against.  With this in mind Mr 
defaultLay
default and others undertook a study of traffic behaviour at a number of junctions al
defaultong a primary cycle commuting route that links the borough of Trafford to the City Centre. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe study by Mr 
defaultLay
default included junctions that featured in the GMP operation Grimaldi exercise providing useful data for consideration alongside that policing effort.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst conducting the study, Mr 
defaultLay
default was also able to witness policing tactics by GMP and consider the conclusions drawn by operation Grimaldi, many of which are not substantiated by the observations made during the study.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA Study Of Cycle And Motor Vehidefaultcle Behaviour At Road Junctions Controlled By Traffic Lights or The Red Light Jumping (RLJ) Studydefault&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe study monitored 3 different locations leading to and along the A34 corridor in Manchester. During the study, the following was observed at each change of
default the traffic lights during peak traffic periods.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAncillary observations.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe study 
defaultrecorded over 
default400 
defaultdata points. The number of motor vehicles and cycles was not specifically tracked as the objective of the study was to observe the behaviour of those at the front of a traffic queue when the lights change; those with the opportunity to ju
defaultmp the lights.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe study was able to establish that the "jumping" of lights on amber and red is an opportunistic offence determined by the perception of personal injury risk and the perceived chance of being caught. It was possible to observe that in 
defaultgeneral:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt was clearly observed 
default(fig 1) 
defaultthat when presented with the opportunity to jump a light
default (ie being at the front of a traffic queue) many drivers will jump a light. At peak times at junctions which have no monitoring by cameras and have good visibility for drivers, it was observed that up to 90% of 
defaultthe time, 
defaultdrivers would commit an offence and
default either pass through a signal on amber when they could and should have stopped or pass through a red light. The corresponding figure for cyclists was less than half that observed for drivers.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFig 1:default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultAll of the junctions observed in the RLJ Study feat
defaulture a cycle lane leading to the junction and an ASL. Cyclists are therefore able to pass down a queue of traffic and at almost every light change cyclists have the opportunity to be at the front of the queue and make a decision to jump the lights or not. F
defaultor drivers, only one or two vehicles are in a position to make a decision to jump the lights or not as the rest if the traffic is held back by the queue.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere was a clear trend observed that if one driver jumped a light on amber, the following driver was
default highly likely to jump the subsequent red light by "tailgating" the vehicle in front. This effect was not observed with cycles, and instead cyclists appear to make a personal choice.
default It was not unusual that in the cases when a cyclist did commit an offence
default that they might pass by other cyclists who had stopped. 
defaultThis reflects the principle that cyclists actions are governed by personal risk of injury, whilst the drivers take the view that a driver ahead of them is unlikely to jump a light if there is a likel
defaultihood of being caught.
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultBy a significant margin the primary motor vehicle observed to jump a light was taxis (both private hire and taxi cabs), followed by busses and then private vehicles and trades vans. 
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultAt almost every light change during rush hour, v
defaultehicles blocked at least one ASL on a junction.
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring the study GMP vehicles were witnessed jumping amber lights and blocking ASLs.
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA number of drivers jumping lights or blocking ASLs were noted to be using mobile phones.
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver 
default400
default motor vehicles were observed committing an offence during the study. On no occasion was any police action witnessed to have been taken against any of the drivers despite there being occasions where GMP officers were in a position to witness the offence.
default&#xa0;
default2.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere was no discernible demographic pattern amongst those cyclists who jumped lights. Lycra clad middle aged men, young men with beards, teenagers, young ladies, elderly women, 
defaultold men, white European, Afro-Caribbean or Asian cyclists were all equally lik
defaultely to be one of the people who jumped lights. 
default&#xa0;
default2.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere was a slight trend towards young women seeking to "get ahead" of the lights by setting off once they could see the perpendicular traffic had stopped. This may be due to publicity surrounding the worryi
defaultngly disproportionate number of female cyclists killed or injured and the suggestion that this may be due to a typically slower starting speed by some cyclists.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThroughout the study, the overwhelming majority of cyclists were observed to fully comply with traffic signals. The overwhelming majority of cyclists were clearly aware of their surroundings and took preventative action to avoid collisions wi
defaultth drivers that were acting in a hazardous manner. The majority of cyclists wore helmets, had lights on their cycles when necessary and many had added high-visibility clothing or features to their attire. No cyclists were seen using a phone whilst cycling 
defaultand very few wore headphones.
default&#xa0;
default3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRLJ Study Conclusions and Comparison with GMP Findingsdefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultContrary to the subjective and poorly sampled opinions reached by GMP during operation Grimaldi:
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is absolutely no evidence of a "culture of cyclists treating red 
defaultlights as a give way"
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCyclists are well aware of the laws of the road
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCyclists are generally aware of the hazards around them and constantly make hazard assessments and adjust their position on the road accordingly
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultVery few cyclists ride on the pavement, 
defaultand no cyclists were observed to ride solely on the pavement
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCyclists wear a wide range of clothing with many having some hi-visibility feature in their attire
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe RLJ Study did corroborate the finding from operation Grimaldi that some cyclists seek to "g
defaultet ahead" of the traffic and cross the stop line for this purpose only. This was observed in female cyclists more than male, but the division by sex was not fully recorded.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnfortunately the operation Grimaldi did not draw any data from law abiding cyclis
defaultts, the GMP drew conclusions only from the set of individuals that they had stopped. This sadly reinforced the view that the police already have of cyclists being law breakers. This would be akin to conducting a crime survey in a prison and assuming that t
defaulthe results apply across the surrounding area.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is certainly true that many cyclists feel that the operation Grimaldi was heavy handed, anti-cyclist and asymmetrically failed to focus on the main causes of injury to cyclists (violations by motor vehicles
default).
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a strong sense that the police are willing to expend time and effort to apprehend victims of road traffic accidents by using minor offences to entrap them and force education upon them, but that the police are unwilling to apply any action aga
defaultinst motorists committing similar minor offences that have potentially major consequences for vulnerable road users such as:
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBlocking ASLs
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBeing distracted by a mobile device wilts driving
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFailing to have full control of a vehicle due to driving whilst sm
defaultoking, drinking / eating, reading or personal grooming
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJumping amber traffic signals
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBlocking cycle paths
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCutting in front of cyclists in a dangerous manner
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultCyclists do believe that other road users should look out for them, but there is no evidence that 
defaultthey correspondingly believe that this relieves them of a duty of personal care. In fact, evidence from the RLJ study is almost wholly to the contrary.  In general cyclists do believe that the responsibility of care should asymmetrically be placed on motor
defaultists as they have the ability to kill and maim a cyclist, whilst in practice the responsibility of care is actually exercised by cyclists because there is little or no enforcement of dangerous driving practices and that if cyclists did not take care, then 
defaultmany more "near misses" would be KSI statistics.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultSadly there is little or no evidence of any positive safety effect from operation Grimaldi and other similar police operations. There has been no reported reduction in KSIs and sadly the only cyclist death 
defaultrecorded in Greater Manchester occurred after the commencement of operation Grimaldi.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultGrimaldi and similar operations have dr
defaultiven a rift between cyclists and the police. The reported outcomes of such operations have focused on victim blaming and served to reinforce myths and prejudice against cyclists which are contrary to prior studies of cycling behaviour in the UK and oversea
defaults. The efforts put into publicity of the penalty notices issued to cyclists only serves to counteract the positive efforts by local authorities to promote cycling and in some instances where GMP have sought to extend operation Grimaldi they have been asked
default to modify the 
defaultoperation to make it less anti-cycling or politely asked not to bring the operation into some boroughs.
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere was an inherent premise within operation Grimaldi that cyclists acting in a dangerous manner was the cause of accident or injury. 
defaultHowever, in establishing Grimaldi the GMP did not first ascertain that cyclists were at fault. Instead it seems that as cyclists are easier to stop, less numerous and generally a compliant group of individuals, a decision was taken to focus on cyclist beha
defaultviour rather than driver behaviour. Any non cyclist offences recorded were incidental to the operation, not a targeted element.
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt was also noted that when ticketing cyclists for offences, an education course was offered in lieu of a fine. However, driver
defaults were simply fined for offences they committed. This implies that GMP do not feel that drivers need any further education in road safety which could be argued to be manifestly untrue given that the drivers were stopped for offences that represented unsafe
default actions. 
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt was concluded by GMP that few cyclists are trained in safety, which is not 
defaultsupported by other evidence such as that from British Cycling
default. The majority of cyclists who commute by cycle are also drivers who have received at least the same road
default safety training as other drivers. If drivers who cycle require further education, then it is equally if not more true that drivers who do not cycle require further instruction in road safety for vulnerable users.
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a fundament lack of understandin
defaultg by GMP of the asymmetrical nature of risk and traffic offences and how this impacts on the safety of vulnerable users on roads when interacting with motor vehicles. Offences by drivers which are typically viewed as minor or inconsequential such as the bl
defaultocking of cycle routes, illegal parking, jumping amber traffic lights and blocking ASLs have major implications for the safety of cyclists. Conversely, cycling offences viewed as "minor" such as inadequate lights or a failure to adopt advisory measures suc
defaulth as helmets or to not use headphones are not shown to have a correspondingly major impact on risk to cyclists. All the hi-viz and lights in the world won't help a cyclist if drivers are distracted from watching the road or the driver does not look properl
defaulty. 
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA failure of the police to adequately enforce amber lights at junctions and the abuse of ASLs by drivers are perhaps amongst the most prevalent driving practices that are in fact offences unenforced by the police. A driver should slow and prepare to s
defaulttop as they approach a traffic light so that they can stop if the light goes to amber and so that they do not block an ASL With the exception of a minutia of cases, a driver who jumps an amber light or blocks an ASL was, by definition driving too fast or w
defaultithout paying due attention to the road conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default3.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is difficult to catch drivers who jump amber lights or who block ASLs, it is however simple to stop cyclists without lights or who jumped lights. This practical reality lies behind the tactics of ope
defaultration Grimaldi and similar operations by other forces. This is lazy policing and a poor expenditure of public money.
default&#xa0;
default3.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy failing to properly address the main hazards to cyclists and instead blaming cyclists, the victims in nearly all cycle / motor vehicle
default accidents, is poor use of public money and does not contribute to a safer environment. This approach also reinforces the false impression in the eyes of some drivers that cyclists are inherently at fault and leads to a negative and even a hostile attitude
default towards cyclists.
default&#xa0;
default3.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is perhaps significant that the only death of a cyclist on the Greater Manchester roads, that of Jaye Bloomfield occurred during the operation Grimaldi. A solitary and grim reminder that cyclists can be victims no matter how they dre
defaultss and no matter how safe their bike if drivers act in a dangerous manner.
default&#xa0;
default4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConclusionsdefault &amp; Recommendationsdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is hard to distinguish individual anti-cycle programmes by GMP from a deep rooted, institutionalised anti-cycling philosophy in the police. On the
default bias that high profile operations such as Grimaldi originate at senior level within the police or are overseen by high ranking officers without questioning the validity or fairness of the action can only suggest an anti-cycling policy embedded deep enough
default that it is no longer possible for the police to recognise their own failings. If this is not corrected, it will hamper growth in cycling and lead to injury and death on our roads.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe police should play a key role in changing poor habits of drivers and i
defaultn creating a positive attitude to cycling. This is possible and in the short term, the police have one of the most significant contributions to make to increasing the numbers of journeys by cycles. However, currently they are failing in this role.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe fol
defaultlowing recommendations are considered necessary to overcome the failings identified above:
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe police need to be trained to understand the asymmetrical relationship between cycles and motor vehicles and to understand that motoring offences routinely ignor
defaulted by the police are a significant risk to cyclists.
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe police need to respond better to complaints of poor driving. At the moment, the standards of evidence expected are such that evidence from cyclists is routinely ignored and bad drivers are not 
defaultpunished or even questioned.
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA root and branch review of police attitudes to cycling is required and an action plan put in place to match the efforts being made 
defaultby national government, local government and others 
defaultto promote cycling at national and local l
defaultevel as a mode of transport.
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoad safety training within the driving test should include a period spent 
defaultspecifically considering the needs of 
defaultvulnerable road user
defaults, (both first hand and indirectly) 
defaultand cycle 
defaultawareness 
defaulttraining should feature within the dr
defaultiving test.
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll road users issued a FPN for a minor road traffic offence should have to attend a safety course which highlights the risk 
defaultthey can pose 
defaultto vulnerable road users. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe police should adopt a strong policy of addressing all driving offences t
defaulthat put vulnerable road users at risk, no matter how minor individual officers or the wider force policy considers such offences.
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore efforts should be made to understand why some cyclists jump lights
default. Where cyclists are seen to jump lights but there is no evidence of this creating a hazard to vehicles or pedestrians then greater consideration should be given to experimental, simple infrastructure changes such as allowing cycles to cross on a 4 way ped
defaultestrian green and allowing cycles to filter left on red. Alternatively, a high number of cyclists crossing the stop line to get ahead of traffic should be taken as an indication of a need to amend the infrastructure 
defaultas a protective measure, to reduce the r
defaultisk to cyclists. This may include larger ASL spaces, advanced "go" lights for cycles and similar measures.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst there is much focus on cycle infrastructure and grand plans for the future, if the police continue to 
defaultfail to use their powers within the law
default as it currently stands and continue to 
defaultfail to reprimand drivers for the types of traffic offenses that create a hazard to cyclists and other vulnerable users, then the police will instead continue to reinforce an anti-cycling, pro-driver climate.
