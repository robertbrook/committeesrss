[normal]Written submission from the Electrical Contractors’ Association (LPG 40)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Electrical Contractors’ Association (ECA) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Department for Communities and Local Government’s Local Government Procurement Inquiry
[normal] 
[normal]call for evidence:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local authorities’ purchasing of goods and services is a significant contributor to local, regional and ultimately national economic growth. We believe that local authorities (and other Government agencies) can quickly and cost-effectively improve their procurement activity in 
[normal]at least 
[normal]two key ways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold]&#xa0;[bold] Prompt supply chain payment[bold]Whilst the evidence suggests that local authorities are usually very prompt payers* (for which they should receive due recognition), too often their chosen main contractors do not pass favourable payment terms down the supply chain. We know that late payment is a major contributor to small business failure and more widely, it prevents many firms from investing and expanding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Local authorities should stipulate in their contracts with main contractors that the 30 day maximum payment terms which councils adhere to, are then applied rigorously down the project or service supply chain. This would then help to strengthen smaller suppliers’ cash positions (and hence their business outlook).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](*e.g. A Forum of Private Business report in August 2012 showed that 92.7% of local authorities in England pay within 30 days and 51% pay within 10 days. The average bill was settled 17.5 days after invoice).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Standard pre-qualification[bold]Local authorities, like other construction buyers, maintain ‘approval to tender’ lists that are accessed by potential suppliers who 
[normal]need to 
[normal]complete lengthy pre-qualification questionnaires (PQQs). Instead of each council requiring (or running) a separate basic PQQ assessment, a common system of basic PQQs should be established across public sector procurement. Having a common basic PQQ template in order to access any local authority tender will save SMEs time and money, and allow these businesses to compete for more work in their area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] PAS 91 provides such a template for construction work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The recent report by Lord Young of Graffham on helping micro-businesses (published in May 2013) called for a standardised public sector PQQ template, as the basis for cross-recognition between basic PQQ responses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We believe this recommendation should be implemented with all speed. We also believe that any local authorities that do not implement this measure should be required to explain to Government why they choose not to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ensuring prompt payment throughout the supply chain[bold]Slow payment is one of the biggest business issues affecting our members, who typically work for clients or main contractors in the wider construction sector. This has led to many firms having to concentrate on winning smaller contracts (in the hope that any late or non-payment issues will not entirely de-stabilise their business) and to cut back on investment such as buying equipment or taking on staff, including apprentices. It is all too common for poor payment to render business insolvent due to cash flow difficulties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ECA survey response[bold]s[bold]The ECA conducted a member survey in April-May 2013, to which 230 of its members responded. The results showed that lack of prompt payment is still widespread, even where the end client is a public sector body. The relevant question and response follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Thinking about the sub-contracted work you carried out for a public body end client(s), how often were you paid by the main/ higher tier contractor within 30 days of sending your invoice?
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•​Less than 20% of the time​​ 52.3%
[normal]•​21-40% of the time​​ ​7.8%
[normal]•​40-60% of the time​​ ​11.2%
[normal]•​60-80% of the time​​ ​7.8%
[normal]•​More than 80% of the time​ ​12.4%
[normal]•​Did not do any work in area​​ 8.5%
[normal]​​​​​​
[normal]​The response suggests that numerous main/higher tier contractors are not passing these terms on to their suppliers
[normal] 
[normal](N.b. t
[normal]he 
[normal]response was
[normal] similar when the end client was a private sector client
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]As such, local authorities should use their purchasing power and stipulate that the
[normal]ir
[normal] main contractors
[normal] 
[normal]pay their suppliers promptly, once paid by the authority. By helping to ensure suppliers’ cash flow, councils can play an active role in helping local businesses to grow and prosper.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Making it easier for SMEs to [bold]access[bold] local authority work[bold]As noted in the summary, local authorities maintain ‘approval to tender’ lists that are accessed by completing 
[normal](often 
[normal]lengthy
[normal])
[normal] questionnaires. These require answers to a range of questions that relate to the competency of suppliers, both generally and, subsequently, specific to the work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Excessive paperwork and confusion due to the inefficient use of PQQs adds significant costs to buyers and suppliers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Councils (and indeed the wider public sector) should now adopt a system of mutual recognition of pre-qualification questionnaires, requiring a supplier to fill in only one form to be able to access multiple local authority tender lists, and allowing local authorities to cross-recognise basic PQQ responses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This would save businesses, particularly SMEs, time and money
[normal]. It will also allow them 
[normal]to compete for more work, increasing competition (including local competition) in the marketplace. Local authorities would also save 
[normal]time and 
[normal]money on 
[normal]their own 
[normal]PQQ activity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government has previously encouraged local authorities to use a PQQ system already developed by the Government (PAS 91). However, take-up of PAS 91 has been disappointingly low. This was borne out by an ECA member survey (April-May 2013). The relevant question and response follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“In the last 12 months, when you have responded to a public sector tender or to go on an approved list, have you been asked to respond using the PAS 91 pre-qualification questionnaire?
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•​Yes​​​​
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 19 – 8.3%
[normal]•​No ​​​​ 90 – 39.1%
[normal]•​Don’t know​​​
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 22 – 9.6%
[normal]•​Have not tendered directly​
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 99 – 43%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of those respondents that directly tendered for public sector work, the overwhelming majority had not been asked to respond using a standardised PQQ process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We suggest that PAS 91 is ‘fit for purpose’: there seems no credible reason for it not to be adopted by local authorities generally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Noting the UK's on-going local
[normal], regional
[normal] and national requirements to promote economic growth, including support for smaller business, we also suggest that where a local authority does not procure using a national standard PQQ template (for some reason), it should have to provide written evidence to Government. This should be to explain clearly why it believes its different approach to PQQs is better at achieving 
[normal]economic 
[normal]growth and supporting SMEs than using (or building on) a standardised basic PQQ.
[normal]   
[normal]We expect that many public bodies will choose to procure using a recognised 
[normal]and efficient 
[normal]standard approach, rather than having to explain why they do not.

[normal] “This free Publicly Available Specification (PAS) provides a set of questions to be asked by buyers of potential suppliers to enable prequalification for construction projects. PAS 91 also specifies requirements for the consistent use of those questions across projects of varying sizes and types including in respect of the OJEU procurement thresholds for public sector procurement.  It is intended that the questions also be used by assessment providers in their intermediary role between buyers and suppliers.
[normal]PAS 91:2013 is a revision of PAS 91:2010 and was sponsored by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) to take account of the experience of users of the first edition to keep abreast of current developments in construction procurement processes.  PAS 91 has been developed with the objective of streamlining and reducing the cost of prequalification in construction procurement processes”.
