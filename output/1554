defaultWritten evidence submitted by Dr Clair defaultHardakerdefault [OLS 0006]default&#xa0;
defaultIn this document I discuss the following four points:
default(1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst my research has covered strategies of content filtering, it relates better to the discussion of "preventing abusive or threatening comments", and less directly to "protecting minors from adult content" or "filtering extremist material such as child abuse imagery". I therefore do not comment on these two areas.
default(2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA crucial point note, however, is that 
defaultfiltering
default content intended to promote harmful behaviour (e.g. terrorism, violence) is unlikely to deal with the online grooming responsible for inciting these behaviours. Grooming is typically an interactive process involving a manipulator persuading a vulnerable target to undertake action that is in the manipulator's interest, and typically harmful to the target (e.g. extremist violence, suicide, self-harm, age-inappropriate sexual behaviour, etc.).
default(3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSuch grooming is likely to occur in interactive environments such as 
defaultchatrooms
default, 
defaultmessageboards
default, and via private direct-message software (e.g. Windows Live Messenger) where content filtering will struggle to apply, and where processes of moderation are likely to be far more effective. I would therefore suggest that content filtering as a strategy for dealing with material intended to promote terrorism or other acts of violence is unlikely to tackle this point with much success.
default(4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are arguably three major factors (though easily more besides):
default(5)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe internet offers a perceived anonymity that has no real parallel offline, and this appearance of invisibility encourages the user to feel that they can do unpleasant things with a highly reduced risk of suffering any consequences. In turn, the sense of being invulnerable encourages 
defaultdisinhibition
default: the user thinks that she is safe from repercussions, so behaves in a mildly objectionable way. Each time there is no negative consequence, her behaviour may gradually escalate.
default(6)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy itself, however, anonymity does not explain why the internet seems to bring the worst out in some, since many of us are online and anonymous all the time, yet would never think to behave in this way. A second issue to consider, then, is detachment.
default(7)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLinked to 
defaultdisinhibition
default is the way that the internet allows us to shut down our empathy, and in particular, our compassion. In fact, we can choose not to empathise at will, especially when dealing with someone we dislike. The internet, however, drastically increases this ability, and allows us to emotionally distance ourselves—not just from people we don't like but also from those we don't even know—in several ways:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDehumanising
default: Because we lose many indications of emotional response (eye contact, tone of voice, facial expressions) it is easier to "forget" that we are communicating with another human. Instead, we have only the words and/or images sent back and forth.
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevaluing
default: The above means that we can downplay any emotional reaction. If they claim to be offended or hurt, because we don't see that reaction, it is easier to believe that they are lying or exaggerating. It is also easier to quickly forget the incident, whilst it may linger in the other's mind for days.
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultVictim-blaming
default: It can be easier for the bully/troll to shift the responsibility for what they are doing from themselves, and blame their victim for what is happening, because, e.g., they're famous, or they made a tribute page public, etc.. This stance is typically also indicated by "solutions" such as telling the victim that if they don't like it, they should "get off the internet".
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSelf-vindicating
default: It can also easier to diminish the severity of our behaviour to ourselves. Because we each inhabit our own heads, it seems obvious to us just how seriously we meant something, so when trolls/
defaultcyberbullies
default are confronted, we tend to hear excuses like, "Stuff said on the internet isn't real. I was just joking. I obviously didn't really mean that [rape-threat/defamatory statement/etc.]." Our innate bias means that we are more likely to adopt such a self-supporting viewpoint than to judge our own behaviour as reprehensible.
default(8)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe third aspect that seems to encourage some to be deliberately mean online long predates the internet. It is simply the human tendency to enjoy and glorify aggression. Evidence for this can be found worldwide, stretching back over millennia. For brevity, however, we need only look at ancient military artefacts (e.g. the Bayeux tapestry, Homer's 
defaultIliad
default, 
defaultBeowulf
default), the sports descended directly from warfare (javelin, archery, fencing, boxing, wrestling, martial arts), and archaeology built especially for the enjoyment of bloodshed (e.g. the Coliseum, the Hippodrome).
default(9)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultToday, one glance at mainstream entertainment demonstrates that this interest is not remotely abated. For instance, 
defaultThe Hunger Games
default is a book series about individuals forced to fight to the death for a reality television show. 
defaultShawshank
default Redemption
default tells of a man wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife and incarcerated in a brutal, corrupt prison where inmates are beaten to death, shot, and raped. 
defaultThe X Factor
default television series places competitors into highly stressful, even cruel environments with antagonistic judges. And many of the biggest games titles, such as the 
defaultCall of Duty
default, 
defaultHalo
default, and 
defaultGrand Theft Auto
default series, involve players simulating extreme violence and murder.
default(10)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe above should demonstrate that humans are entertained by violence, and that this is by no means a new phenomenon brought about by digital media. For some, however, simply consuming aggression-based entertainment from fiction (e.g. books, films) or simulation (e.g. games, sports) is not enough. For them, the internet presents a virtual Coliseum where they can amuse themselves by attacking others without risk of "injury", since they can hide behind a cloak of anonymity, and silence their own conscience by ignoring their target's feelings.
default(11)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo reiterate a point from above, whilst many of us are frequently online anonymously 
defaultand
default enjoy consuming violence (it is a rare person who hasn't watched an action movie!), it is still a relatively small number who feel motivated to take advantage of the conditions that the internet presents, and to actually engage in abusive or threatening online behaviour. In the same way, many of us drive, but however annoyed we may become behind the wheel, mercifully few of us are ever turn our car into a lethal weapon.
default(12)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn other words, each individual needs a trigger, or motive to push them into using the internet as a weapon. Unsurprisingly, the evidence suggests that there is no single, over-riding motive for being abusive or threatening online, but that whilst there certainly are 
defaulttrends,
default there are also many unique cases. Some of those broad trends include:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBoredom, a need for entertainment
default: This is perhaps the most trivial reason (and therefore, perhaps also the most frustrating and difficult to resolve)—simply too much free time after 
defaultschool, at work, or between jobs. These are the individuals who are killing time, and even seeking impress others of a similar mindset. Groups of trolls coalesce on sites like 4chan, post links to targets that might prove "fun", and compete against each other to see who can be the funniest, cleverest, or most extreme. They may also organise troll raids via more secure systems (e.g. 
defaultIRC
default, 
defaultTorchat
default), and train newer recruits in how to be less identifiable online, e.g. by sharing information about identity-protecting software such as 
defaultTOR
default, 
defaultI2P
default, and 
defaultPsiphon
default.
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA need for attention
default: these individuals seem to display a craving for any kind of attention, whether positive or negative. Such individuals may also post annoyingly implausible stories, grand claims, age-inappropriate content, etc
default..
default This may be symptomatic of emotional, social, and/or psychological problems.
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRevenge, disenfranchisement
default: these appear to be individuals who feel cheated, short-changed, or otherwise wronged on a personal level, and appear to want to "fix" this by making the object of their malice feel as miserable as 
defaultthemselves
default. This may be symptomatic of a struggling economy, e.g. the student who can't find work and has therefore taken to targeting his local MP.
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolitics, activism
default: whilst the motive in its own right may be good (e.g. fighting for racial equality) the method may not meet that same moral standard. This said
default,
default it's easier to comprehend why individuals might choose this noisy, attention-grabbing route if we consider that letters to politicians, newspapers, and economists are all too easily ignored. This may be symptomatic, therefore, of a political system that appears (to the trolls/bullies) to ignore their voices.
default(13)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn summary, motivations for posting abusive/threatening content can spring from a number, and a mixture of sources, including emotional, psychological, social, political, economical, etc
default..
default This means that there is likely to be no 
defaultsingle
default approach that will have any meaningful impact on this issue. Instead, it is far more likely to require addressing on multiple fronts. I discuss this area next.
default(14)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are two classic "solutions" that have been proposed to fix online abusive comments. I deal with them briefly since they merit very little serious consideration.
default(15)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn a nutshell, this is borderline impossible, if only because it is unenforceable, and unworkable. Even if all countries agree to legally mandating online identity disclosure (unlikely) the costs of setting up, administrating, and then enforcing it would be staggering. Further, we need only consider the risks inherent in having a child's name, age, location, etc. available online to realise that online identity disclosure would actually create more dangers than anonymity currently averts.
default(16)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is not only bizarrely unrealistic, since the internet is now 
defaultubiquitous,
default it is also ineffective (kids don't need a single device to be 
defaultcyberbullied
default) and puts responsibility on the victim, rather than the attacker (see victim-blaming, 
defaultpara
default. (7(c)) above).
default(17)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no single answer to this complex problem, but several smaller improvements can, collectively, advance online safety. I therefore recommend five ways forward.
default(18)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn a perfect world, we would always choose prevention over cure, but this requires well-informed vigilance both from potential targets and from those responsible for protection. At present, 
defaultChildnet
default does outstanding work, teaching school-children to be safe 
defaultand kind
default online, and I welcome the fact that online safety has been introduced across the 2014 National Curriculum.
default(19)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor best effect, however, these lessons need to be appropriately supported (see 
defaultparas
default. (21)
default-(
default23) below), sufficiently detailed/thorough, and adopted across 
defaultall
default schools (private, public, and free). These lessons also should not be restricted purely to Computing, but should be adopted across a number of classes, including PSHEE and Citizenship.
default(20)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, in order for this to be successful, teachers themselves need to be well-trained in the safety measures, in tell-tale signs, and in appropriate strategies of intervention. Teachers also need the support of parents and caregivers, and this leads into a second area of improvement.
default(21)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe assistance that 
defaultChildnet
default currently offers teachers is also invaluable, but it could be substantially underpinned with compulsory online safety training in all PGCEs, since NSPCC research shows that far too many teachers currently don't feel confident when it comes to 
defaultadvising pupils on safe social network practices
default.
default(22)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMeanwhile, parents would benefit from proactive, face-to-face training in:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultsigns indicative of 
defaultcyberbullying
default (whether as victim or bully);
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultways to keep children safe online
default (technologically, behaviourally);
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe many organisations that offer help and advice (e.g. 
defaultBeatBullying
default, 
defaultChildline
default, 
defaultChildnet
default, 
defaultGet Safe Online
default, 
defaultIWF
default, 
defaultNSPCC
default, 
defaultSIC
default, 
defaultNHS
default, 
defaultCEOP
default)
default(23)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst these organisations all do invaluable work, they cannot be a standalone solution. A third area of improvement, then, is through sites themselves.
default(24)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe generally expect social networks to offer the tools and support to keep us safe. Indeed, the expectation seems fairly reasonable. If Mr Smith wants to profit from people buying his goods or services, his products and premises must meet the relevant legal requirements to protect customers from loss and harm. However, should Mr Smith want to profit from people using his social network, in the UK at least there appear to be no similar legal requirements.
default(25)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt seems reasonable to argue that the opportunity to profit from a social network should also entail a duty of care towards that site's users. However, whilst most social networks require registrants to enter into agreements forbidding abusive behaviour, beyond that, sites differ widely in the availability, sophistication, and transparency of their safety features. At the most basic level, social networks should:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultallow users to control their own environment (e.g. privacy settings)
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultflag up content for the site to manage (e.g. report abuse buttons)
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultproactively use their own management tools (e.g. IP blocks)
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultpublish clear guidelines on how they will deal with complaints, handle abuse reports, and cooperate with criminal investigations
default(26)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt present, whilst some sites offer all of these and more, others provide none, and some even appear to 
defaultstonewall those trying to tackle online abuse
default. This takes us into a fourth area of improvement – enforcement.
default(27)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhere cases become too serious for a user or site to deal with, we would naturally turn to the police. However, whilst 
defaultSOCA
default does tackle cybercrime, its focus tends to divide between child sexual exploitation and online fraud. SOCA and the 
defaultPolice Central e-Crime Unit
default are forming a new 
defaultNational Cybercrime Unit
default, but it remains unclear whether online abuse will form part of this organisation's remit.
default(28)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis means that for now at least, online abusive messages and threats are more likely to be dealt with by ordinary police officers, and that makes it difficult for the average non-high-profile individual to find 
defaultappropriately trained police who will take their complaint seriously
default. In short, it is vital that we have the necessary resources and training for police, including:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPerception change
default: online offences are "real crimes" that should be taken seriously; users can't just resolve the problem by simply "switching off" (see 
defaultpara
default. (16) 
defaultabove
default).
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBasic training
default: unsurprisingly, non-specialist officers appear to be largely unaware of the sheer scope of online "misbehaviours" that exist, how online attackers work, their strategies of concealment, standard denial excuses (e.g. "yes it came from my computer but I didn't send it"), methods of gathering evidence, the investigation that needs carrying out, etc.. This is an issue that can only be resolved with extensive training. Without it, officers are likely to shy away from or find excuses for avoiding such areas, in turn institutionally embedding the concept that they only deal with "real" (i.e. offline) crime.
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore resources
default: even were the above not an issue, officers also appear to be largely under-resourced in terms of time. The solution to this seems to be an extension to the remit of CEOP, SOCA, or the newly-proposed NCU (see 
defaultpara
default. (27) 
defaultabove
default).
default(29)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAssuming that a case is investigated by the police and the CPS decides to pursue criminal charges, many of the Acts that might by employed (e.g. 
defaultMalicious Communications Act 1988
default, §5 of the 
defaultPublic Order Act 1986
default, 
defaultProtection from Harassment Act 1997
default, 
defaultCommunications Act 2003
default) were created before the advent of major social networks, and so are imperfectly equipped to deal with the new behaviours that these sites have created.
default(30)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor instance, the most recent, relevant legislation, the Communications Act, came into force in July 2003. However, an Act of this magnitude—more than 250,000 words spanning over four hundred sections—takes years to write and enact. The section relevant to online behaviour (§127) is therefore far more heavily informed by the internet of the 1990s than that of the new millennium. Meanwhile, massive, ubiquitous social networks like 
defaultFacebook
default and 
defaultTwitter 
defaultwere founded 2004 and 2006 respectively. As sites like these have evolved, so too have the behaviours associated with them, yet the legislation remains largely unchanged.
default(31)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst the CPS published 
defaultguidelines
default on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media in June this year, like much current legislation designed for supposedly-similar offline behaviours, these guidelines do not explicitly address the critical differences that the online environment offers:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe speed with which content can be reproduced;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe breadth and sensitivity (e.g. family, school peers) of audience that can be reached;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe inability of targets to entirely eradicate malicious content in some cases;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe
default expense and difficulty (as outlined above) of prosecuting even very serious online offences.
default(32)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is therefore worth considering whether these Acts need updating, or whether we actually need a new Online Communications Act that specifically covers the increasing range of abusive behaviours on the internet.
default(33)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis difficulty is further exacerbated by a culture in which offline crime still seems to be seen as more serious than any supposed online counterpart. For instance, the CPS provides useful guidance on behaviours such as 
defaultstalking
default, 
defaultharassment
default, and 
defaultschool bullying
default, but if one reads these guidelines, it seems that the offline version is considered the norm, and any online variant, where it is even acknowledged to exist, is simply considered a sub-type.
default(34)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis overlooks the fact that supposedly equivalent behaviours like 
defaultcyberstalking
default, 
defaultcyberharassment
default, and 
defaultcyberbullying
default can have their own unique attributes, methods, and consequences which 
defaultrequire dealing with in fundamentally different ways. Indeed, what little the CPS has to say about online antisocial behaviours tends 
defaultto be vague
default.
default(35)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn short, it appears that we need CPS guidance for the police, court system, legal practitioners, etc. that would provide definitions for, and explanations of the various antisocial online behaviours (e.g. trolling, 
defaultcyberbullying
default, 
defaultcyberstalking
default, etc.), and information with regards to issues of jurisdiction and proof.
default(36)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFinally, across the European Union, the 
defaultSafer Internet Programme
default is promoting 
defaultself-regulation
default, and already, several high-profile corporations have signed up to a set of 
defaultSafer Social Networking Principles
default. This is a great start, but these principles are purely voluntary, and whilst it would be inappropriate to enforce such principles across all EU-based social networks, it is worth returning to the example of Ms Smith, and to ask whether those profiting from social networks should have similar duties of care towards their site users.
default(37)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe full potential of the internet is yet to be realised. If we are to fully enjoy the benefits, and reduce online threatening and abusive behaviour, my belief is that we must approach this in a comprehensively and holistically. I hope the above may offer some ways in which to achieve this.
