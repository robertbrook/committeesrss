default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the Committee's recognition 
defaultthat isolated communities are an issue for urban, as well as rural areas.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccessibility Planning is a key tool used by transport authorities to identify demand for passenger transport but should be used more widely to implement both transport 
defaultand
default non-trans
defaultport solutions to accessibility problems. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdeally, public transport should provide a general service that is available, affordable, accessible and acceptable to all. Where this is not the case, certain groups are particularly vulnerable to experiencing is
defaultolation. PTEs are involved in a range of initiatives to ensure their needs are taken into account.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKey challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities include funding; the deregulated nature of 
defaultthe bus market outside London; land-use planning decisions; and a lack of recognition among other sectors of the importance of transport to the successful delivery of their policy objectives.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe extent to which transport authorities can address these chal
defaultlenges is constrained by cuts to local government and transport funding, however, interventions include: the provision of tendered 'socially necessary' 
defaultbus 
defaultservices; use of alternative transport solutions; use of Local Transport Act 2008 powers; more effic
defaultient use of existing transport resources; and marketing and behaviour change initiatives. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultC
defaultonnecting isolated communities to services and opportunities is the responsibility of all those involved in the planning and delivery of public services - not just 
defaultthe transport sector.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity Transport is effective at understanding the needs of local people but, as services come under increasing pressure, operators 
defaultface challenges in ‘scaling up’
default to meet demand or make the most of opportunities for sustainability
default. Capacity building as well as closer working with transport authorities could be helpful.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultServices in isolated communities should be tailored to demand. If demand levels suggest that a taxi or demand-responsive transport would meet the needs of communitie
defaults, then provision of these services should be sufficient. However, it is important to ensure that these services are
default well publicised as well as
default affordable, accessible and acceptable to users.
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe 
defaultwelcome
default the Committee’s recognition that isolated communities are an issue for urban, as well as rural areas. 
defaultIn both 
defaultarea types
default, communities can become 
defaultisolated if public transport is not available, affordable, accessible or acceptable.
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRural residents
default can experience isolation due to their geographical distance
default from
default key centres. In urban areas, distances to key services are often shorter, but communities 
defaultca
defaultn still find themselves isolated when transport services do not connect the
defaultm to the places they want to go,
default at the times they need to travel or if those services are not affordable or accessible.
default 
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUrban communities may
default, for example,
default find themselves cut o
defaultff from
default key employment sites 
defaultbecause transport is
default unavailable at times which correspond to late night or early morning shifts. Furthermore, 
defaulttransport services may not connect employment sites with the communities who have the skills to fill available jobs
default. 
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the key tools 
defaultused
default to identify demand for passenger transport
default is Accessibility Planning, a
default cornerstone of the 2003 Social Exclusion Unit 
defaultreport ‘Making the Connections’.
default Accessibility Planning
default was designed to provide an opportunity for local part
defaultners, from across sectors, to develop a systematic approach to 
defaultidentifying gaps in the network and 
defaultimproving people’s access to key services and employment sites.
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccessibility Planning was intended to 
defaultdeliver
default both transport and non-transport solutions to 
defaultaccessibility problems, recognising that changes to where and how key services are delivered can be as important as the provision of transport.
default 
defaultHowever, perhaps because the production of an Accessibility Strategy became a Local Transport Plan requirement, 
defaultaccessibility
default is
default, in many areas,
default primarily seen as the responsibility of transport authorities, undermining the partnership approach originally envisaged.
default A 
defaultrecent evaluation of Accessibility Planning for the
default Department for Transport
default (DfT)
default 
defaultconfirmed this t
defaulto be the case
default.
default3.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccessibility Planning is in widespread use among transport authorities, but we would welcome a re-emphasis – across departments – of 
defaultits value
default and 
defaultthe
default need for a 
defaultpartnership approach
default to explore both transport and non-transport solutions
default. T
defaulto underline this, all relevant government departments should issue or update their own Accessibility Planning guidance.
default The recent Environmental Audit Commission
default (EAC) inquiry into transport and the accessibility to public services
default 
defaultsupports thi
defaults recommenda
defaulttion, stating: 
default‘The Government should publish up to date guidance which makes a compelling case for accessibility to be addressed, not just by local authorities but by all central government departments.’
default 
default 
defaultIndeed, we would suggest that a number of the EAC’s recommendations are of relevance to this inquiry and are something that the Committee may wish to 
defaultmake reference to
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving identified a demand, transport authorities then face the challenge of prioritising the limited funding available to achieve the most socially and economically advantageous outcome
default (see section eight)
default.
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal Transport Plans (LTPs) are the core strategic documents used by transpor
defaultt authorities to set the context for 
defaultdeveloping
default public transport networks and servic
defaultes. Equality impact assessments 
defaultform part of the LTP proc
defaultess and test
default the likely impacts of
default proposals on
default different 
defaultcommunities and 
defaultgroups.
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdeally, public transport should 
defaultprovide a general service that is available, affordable, accessible and acceptable to all, regardless of where they live, their income, age, ability or level of confidence. 
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransport for Greater Manchester’s (TfGM) 
default‘
defaultLocal Link
default’
default 
defaultservices
default for example,
default provi
defaultde transport for many of the area’s isolated communities. Anyone living in the community can use the service – there are no age or disability restrictions and vehicles used are accessible. The services
default are often tailored to
default link to Greater Manchester’s hos
defaultpitals, colleges and ra
defaultil stations, with markets determined through Accessibility Planning principles.
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultP
defaultublic transport
default 
defaultthat 
defaultis not available, affordable, accessible and acceptable
default risks leaving people isolated. Certain groups, including people with disabi
defaultlities, people on low incomes, older people and young peo
defaultple are particularly vulnerable as they are more likely to rely on public transport as their main means of getting around. 
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPTEs are involved in a range of initiatives to ensure the needs of differen
defaultt groups of passengers are taken into account.
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPTEs f

default including the statutory national concessionary fares scheme for older and disabled people, 
defaultdiscretionary 
defaultenhancements to that scheme and concessions for other groups
default such 
defaultas
default children and young people and jobseekers.
default 
default4.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPTEs work to ensure that tendered bus services are compliant with accessibility regulations.
default Where individuals are unable to use conventional public transport, they provide specialist services to ensure people 
defaultare not left without an independent means of getting around. 
defaultIn more isolated communities t
defaulthese 
defaultcould, for example,
default take the form of 
defaultdemand responsive door-to-door services
default or support 
defaultfor the use of accessible taxis
default.
default4.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPTEs also consult with different groups
default of passengers directly. Taking the time to understand the needs of different user groups is vital to ensure that the services provided are the right ones and ones that people will use and value.

default 
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA key
default challenge concerns
default the
default funding of bus and rail s
defaultervices to isolated communities,
default 
defaultcovered in section eight of this response.
default 
defaultAside from funding issues, 
defaultanother 
defaultchallenge 
defaultfor 
defaulttransport authoritie
defaults is that
default bus services outside London 
defaultare
default privately operated under a deregulated framework. In practice, this means that 
defaulttransport authorities
default h
defaultave no direct control over which communities 
defaultreceive 
defaultcommercial
default bus service
defaults
default 
default(
defaultwhich comprise 
defaultalmost 80% of total bus mileage). 
defaultTransport authorities
default also have no direct control over the 
defaultfares
default, quality or frequency of commercial services or the extent to wh
defaultich they form part of an integrated transport network.
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn this environment, bus operators – as private companies – need to ensure that, overall, their operations are profitable. They are unlikely to run services that lose money, even if 
defaultthere i
defaults a need for
default them in the community. Often, this means bus operators pull out of running services to isolated housing estates or rural areas, focusing instead on profitable major corridors and commuter routes.
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis may result in gaps in transport connectivity for some 
defaultcommunities, impacting on access to employment, education, key services and so
defaultcial activities. In these cases
default 
default(
defaultand where budgets allow
default – see section eight)
default,
default transport authorities may step in to fund extra ‘socially necessary’ bus services (also known as te
defaultndered services). They may also assess whether
default alternative 
defaultsolutions such as
default demand responsive transport; taxis; Wheels to Work schemes; community transport; car sharing; o
defaultr walking and cycling provision might represent a more efficient use of resources.
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe challenges of a deregulated market for bus can
default also
default be tackled through the use of powers granted under the Local Transport Act 2008 which: 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultM
defaultade it easier to negotiate 
defaultV
defaultoluntary 
defaultPartnership Agreements
default with bu
defaults operators to improve services
default. All PTEs ar
defaulte investing heavily in voluntary partnerships to benefit passengers.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMade it easier for transport authorities to facilitate voluntary Qualifying Agreements (QA) between competing operators to coordinate their timetables. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExpanded the scope of Statutory Qu
defaultality Partnerships
default (SQPs)
default whereby binding agreements can be voluntarily entered into between 
defaulttransport authorities
default and bus operators, including on
default fares, frequencies and timings
default. PTEs were the first to introduce an SQP (in Sheffield) and a number of other 
defaultagreements have b
defaulteen reached since, with Bath and North East Somerset Council being the first to make a scheme embracing the full range of measures available.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMade Quality Contracts (QC
defaults
default) a more realistic option. A QC involves replacing the existing deregu
defaultlated bus markets with a franchising system (similar to that in London) where the local transport authority specifies what the bus network will provide and the private sector competes for the right to provide it. Services to 
defaultisolated communities can be spe
defaultcified as an integral part of the package that 
defaultoperators
default bid for
default, allowing cross-subsidisation of such services by more profitable routes
default. 
defaultSeveral PTEs are developing proposals for QCs, with Nexus the first to launch a formal public consultation.
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA further
default challenge is that l
defaultand-use planning decisions are frequently made with little consideration for people who do not have use of a car, leading to communities being cut off from accessing key services
default and the creation/
defaultexpansion of isolated housing estates
default. T
defaulthe problem is exacerbated by trends towards the centralisation of public services, such as healthcare and education, which mean that people have to travel further or to differen
defaultt locations to access services, running the risk that real choice across servic
defaultes is more constrained for communities that are dependent on public transport.
default5.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe increasing liberalisation of the planning system
default 
defaultruns the risk of creating further isolated communities if development is permitted in inaccessible areas on the grounds of 
defaultshort-term economic growth benefits.
default 
default5.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLand-use planning decisions at their earliest stages should look at locating developments so that they connect to existing public transport networks.
default 
defaultIn South Yorkshire, close partnership working between 
defaultthe 
defaultPTE
default (SYPTE
default)
default and the South Yorkshire districts
default through the South Yorkshire Land Use and Transport Integration (SY LUTI) project
default has helped to ensure that new developments are prioritised around existing public transport corridors and that any sites which are poorly c
defaultonnected have been outlined as requiring developer contributions towards public transport services. This work has been welcomed on a city region basis, with partners outside of South Yorkshire now requesting LUTI modelling.
default5.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMixed use developments should
default al
defaultso
default be encouraged to allow people to walk or cycle to key services.
default 
defaultTogether with taking transport into account at the earliest stages of planning, t
defaulthis could avoid communities becoming isolated and save money on costly trans
defaultport interventions to fill gaps.
default5.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to note that connecting isolated communities to services and opportunities is not just a problem for the transport sector to solve, it is the responsibility of all those involved in the planning and delivery of public services.
default 
defaultThere needs
default to be greater recognition among other sectors of the importance of transport to the successful delivery of their policy objectives, and a willingness to invest in it accordingly. Furthermore, there needs to be a 
defaultreadiness
default to consider, and fund, non-transp
defaultort solutions to the accessibility problems of isolated communities.
default 
defaultC
defaultloser city region working models
default should help in this respect, although
default 
defaultf
defaulturther devolution of 
defaultthe 
defaultcontrols and funds that shape public service restructuring would 
defaultalso assist
default.
default 
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity Transport
default (CT)
default operations are embedded in the communities they serve, meaning that they can be very effectiv
defaulte at understanding what types of services residents want and what gaps 
defaultexist
default.
default CT can offer a flexible means of filling the
defaultse
default gaps in commercial and tendered bus services.
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCuts to tendered bus services, together with policy developments such as personalised 
defaultsocial care 
defaultbudgets
default and cuts to local authority in-house transport services
default, are leading to more pressure on 
defaultCT
default services which are not always 
defaultready
default to meet demand.
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultForms 
defaultof grant funding that the sector has traditionally relied upon 
defaultare fast disappearing
default, impacting on staffing, fare levels and ability to maintain and replace vehicles
default.
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome 
defaultCT operators 
defaultmay
default lack the skills and resources needed to bid for local transport con
defaulttracts which could potentially offer more financial sustainability.
default 
defaultThe sector could be supported through capacity building to assist in understanding the opportunities available, the surrounding legislation and in
default how to
default meet the basic tendering criteria.
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCloser working with transport authorities can be helpful
default in building understanding and relationships on both sides
default. 
defaultTfGM
default, for example
default, is delivering f
defaultour new or improved services in partnership with CT operators to connect isolated communities with key em
defaultployment sites.
default6.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultDfT
default may wish to look at how government and local authorities could promote a healthy CT sector, for example, through a ‘Better Community Transport’ initiative linked to funding to improve fleets. The Department for Business Innovation a
defaultnd Skills could look at how the sector could be up-skilled 
defaultand how innovation could be encouraged.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProviding transport s
defaulter
defaultvices
default 
defaultto
default isolated communities
default will always be costly
default and
default,
default at a time when budgets are under pressure, 
defaultmust
default be tailored to demand
default. Demand is rarely
default static
default, meaning that flexibility is required
default. If demand levels suggest that a taxi or demand-responsive transpo
defaultrt (DRT) service would adequately serve that community’s needs, then provision of thes
defaulte services should be sufficient, as long as they are well 
defaultpublicised
default.
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultS
defaultervices must
default also
default be affordable for 
defaultpassengers
default. Taxis in particular can be 
defaultprohibitively
default expensive.
default 
defaultptegdefault commissioned research in two
default urban
default communities experiencing
default isolation as a result 
defaultof cuts to tendered bus services
default. Residents 
default(particularly older and younger people)
default were having to rely more on costly taxi services to get around and were having to cut back on their journeys as a result. 
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is potential to make it easier for taxis to fill gaps in the network through smartcard technology, so that journeys can be pai
defaultd for without the need to carry cash, or even allow for a certain number of journeys to be pre-paid or discounted
default for certain groups
default, as with the Nexus TaxiCard
default.
default Smartcards also have the potential to enable taxis to be better integrated into local public 
defaulttransport networks, forming
default part of a package for mobility where one card unlocks a range of transport options.
default7.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn respect of taxis, it should
default also
default be noted that there are issues around standards and safety, given that drivers and operators are not bound b
defaulty safety standards that apply to public service vehicle
default (PSV)
default operators
default (e.g. mandatory breaks, limits on working hours). There should be greater synergy between taxi licensing and passenger transport/PSV licensing regimes.
default8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA key issue is that transport priorities at national level are centred 
defaulton creating economic growth - a
default 
defaultvital goal -
default but one that has 
defaultresulted 
defaultin the side-lining of
default social inclusion issues. 
defaultEconomic growth
default priorities are reflected in funding criteria which can make it difficult to secure resources for initiatives serving isolated communities, wher
defaulte economic returns may be lower or more difficult 
defaultto quantify.
default At local level, this can
default result in such initiatives
default being scaled back and focus shifting towards projects aimed at creating growth, in recognition of Government priorities. 
default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe EAC inquiry into transport and accessibility to public services
default 
defaultrecommended that the Government should review its transport funding for local authorities to ensure that pro-accessibility services that are particularly depe
defaultndent on revenue, rather than
default capital
default,
default expenditure are not disproportionately curtailed.
default8.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFunding t
defaultransport 
defaultin
default isolated communities will
default, however,
default always be challenging as often passenger numbers are low and demand is limited
default, making services costly to provide.
default8.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith regard to rail, for example, new stations or increased services at existing stations are
default 
defaultoften unaffordable
default. For isolated communities there would need to be careful consideration given to whether levels of d
defaultemand would justify the costs, including those associated with
default the slowing down of other services to accommodate an additional stop.
default 
default8.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn 
defaultbus, as described above, the bus market outside of London is deregulated and commercial operators are unlikely to choose to run a service that is unprofitable. Where gaps in services emerge, transport authorities must decide whether to fund a 
defaulttendered 
defaultbus 
defaultservice to 
defaultcover unmet transport needs
default.
default Whether they do this will depend on factors such as cost and available budget; the number of people who would use it; whether there are other ways people could
default get around if there was no bus; and likelihood of self-sufficiency in the future.
default8.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCuts to 
defaultpublic spending have left transport authorities less able to fill gaps in this way. Tendered bus services are a non-statutory area of spend making them vulnerable as
default transport authorities seek to ensure they can continue to meet their core legal responsibilities (such as funding free off-peak bus travel for older and disabled people).
default8.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUrban areas have been particularly hard hit
default by public spending cuts
default overall
default. In the 
default2011-12 Local Government Funding Settlement, funding for Metropolitan Districts fell by around 10% in real terms, compared to a 5% cut in Shire areas, relative to the previous year
default. This impacts on transport spending in the cities as PTEs derive nearly th
defaulte entirety of their revenue budget income from a levy on District Councils.
default8.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPTEs are doing all they can to mitigate the effects of these funding challenges, including using the powers and options granted in the Local Transport Act 2008 to protect and impro
defaultve bu
defaults services (see
default section five
default)
default as well as investigating alternative solutions such as walking, cycling, DRT, community transport, car sharing/community car initiatives and taxi services.
default8.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default‘Total Transport’
default approaches
default could also help to ensure that the 
defaultfunding and resources that are available for transport are used as efficiently as possible.
default The public sector provides and funds collective transport in a variety of forms
default,
default 
defaultincluding conventional bus services,
default healthcare services, 
defaultsocial services and educa
defaulttion transport. 
defaultIn addition,
default there is community transport and other voluntary sector collective provision. These services are often provided through different budgets and by different administrative arrangements and can 
defaultsee
default vehicles
default 
defaultunderutilised for large
default parts of the day whilst elsewhere transport needs go unmet. There is scope for greater pooling of budgets and vehicle fleets to provide a single service more cost effectively. 
defaultInvestigation of such an approach was also recommended in the EAC’s transport a
defaultnd the accessibility to public services inquiry
default.
default8.10.
default 
defaultThis 
defaultTotal Transport
default approach is already being applied in some areas of the UK but so far to a very limited effect. Some countries in mainland Europe have gone much further and pooled public transport, educ
defaultation, healthcare and social services budgets into one pot to provide a single transport service – capable of providing a mainstream service which can also flexibly respond to the needs of particular users. 
default8.11.
default 
defaultTotal Transport on a large scale is probably mos
defaultt easily achieved in isolated communities where most public transport is publicly supported, and where the scale of the administration for currently separate budgets and vehicle fleets is more manageable.
default This is not to say that such an approach is straigh
defaulttforward to deliver or that it will be a suitable in all circumstances. However, there are a range of 
defaultexperiences, both from
default 
defaultthe UK
default and abroad that can be drawn upon.
default Following the publication of our report into Total Transport
default, we hosted a practitioner e
defaultvent in 2012 aimed at kick-starting the sharing of lessons 
defaultlearnt
default.
default8.12.
default 
defaultMarketing and behaviour change techniques also have a role to play in making transport for isolated communities more affordable by boosting patronage and thereby making services more financ
defaultially sustainable. Customer engagement and research can help identify passenger needs and motivations and ensure that services provided are the ones people want and will use.
