[[[Crime Statistic]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Thank you for your letter of 6th December 2013.&#xa0;Please find below my response to the two questions posed.&#xa0;

[[[1. What, if]]]

[[[ any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[has on police recording crime practices?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I do not set targets for my force. Targets are, in my opinion, counter-productive because they become an end in themselves.&#xa0;Instead I set out very clearly in my Police and Crime Plan the views of the people of Lincolnshire on how they believe their county should be policed. This takes into account the concerns, suggestions and aspirations of the communities that the force and I serve.&#xa0;Since there are no targets, there should be no impact on the way crimes are recorded. I believe there is no impact My force is involved in preventing and detecting crime, not target-chasing.&#xa0;

[[[2. How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct?]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I have never had any reason to doubt the way in which crime figures are recorded.&#xa0;I have examined the methodology of crime recording and I have monthly meetings with the Chief Officer team. I meet the Chief Constable far more frequently on a one-to-one basis. Among other things, this enables me to have a firm grasp on those areas of performance where the most recent data or an emerging trend indicates that action needs to be taken. As an example, this approach led a rising trend in shoplifting to be visible to me, enabled me to discuss with senior officers their plans for addressing it and monitor and challenge the impact their actions were having. &#xa0;The point is that I am able to scrutinise the latest data at any time, not simply at meetings concerned with performance. I take full advantage of this - I think to the benefit of the people I represent, which of course includes my force's officers and staff; they, too, along with volunteers are my constituents.&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
