[[[Assessment of exempt and non-exempt status]]]

[[[d)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Key learning points]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The amount of supported housing in an area, the types of landlords and the levels of costs vary significantly from one local authority to another. A local authority’s decision whether to retain its sheltered stock or transfer it to a provider registered with the HCA is the single most important factor determining the pattern of provision but is not the only one.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The relative proportions of working age supported housing and of sheltered housing for older people in authorities depend on the level of provision for what were in the Supporting People programme called the “socially excluded” groups. Broadly speaking, provision for these groups has tended historically to be concentrated in major population centres.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is not a neat division between people of working age and people of pension age. The proportion of people of working age living in sheltered housing for older people is higher than the proportion of people above pension age living in supported housing for people of working age, as are the actual numbers, but there is a signficiant mix in many projects in all areas.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The cost of ordinary sheltered housing for older people is generally lower than the average costs of supported housing for other types of provision (including Extra Care sheltered housing). This apart, there is no other consistent pattern of varying costs across client groups either in the degree of variation or the client groups that are most expensive.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current level of understanding of either providers or local authorities is such that we cannot be confident accommodation is being accurately categorised by Housing Benefit departments as exempt or otherwise. For the time being Single Housing Benefit Extract data cannot be relied on even as a measure of the volume of supported exempt accommodation and the Housing Benefit expenditure upon it.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The amount of Housing Benefit claimed by people of working age in supported and sheltered housing in any local authority depends less on the proportion of supported and sheltered housing that currently counts as exempt accommodation than on the extent to which that local authority has provision for what in the Supporting People programme were known as the “socially excluded” groups.
