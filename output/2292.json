"&#xa0;\nRCH0010&#xa0;NSPCC written evidence to the Education Select Committee inquiry on Residential children’s homes&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;Summary &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Whether the DfE’s proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes are appropriate and sufficient&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhether the reforms are likely to prove effective or further measures are needed &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStrong, stable\n relationships\n are essential to safeguarding\nis available for children’s homes managers and practitioners to draw on. \nExisting \nevidence \nsuggests that, although important\n, it is not \nonly \nstaff qualifications and staffing \nratios that are the most important factors in determining children’s outcomes. In\nstead, it is the quality of care and relationships that are central to safeguarding.\n \nThis practice is consistent with government reforms of social work more widely, stemm\ning from the Munro Review\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVariable standards i\nn current safeguarding practice\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUnderstanding \nthe views and experience of children\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe role of commissioners in improving outcomes for children in residential care\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion and key recommendations&#xa0;i) Expectations on the quality of care from providers needs to be high and there should be greater local authority accountability for the outcomes of children in their care. Informing the market about need and encouraging new entrants won’t necessarily lead to better quality care, especially if expectations of care, specifications\n and contract management remain the same. \nii) The quality of care provided by staff is about much more than qualifications. Imp\nortant\n factors such as leadership and ethos, the size of the care home and the importance of staff consensus and shared working philosophy must not be overlooked and support should be provided to develop these throughout the sector.\niii) A strong parenting role among care workers is essential. This includes\n activities such as discussing problems and achieving a level of relationship that is more positive than potentially deleterious ones outside of the home.\niv) Commissioning and partnership working are hugely important. Increased\n efforts must be placed on strategies to encourage placement stability, such as efforts to retain social care staff and provide the continuity of a consistent adult figure.\n \nP\nlacement decisions should be based on risk assessments, which sh\nould include the children and young people already living in a placement and the impact that the ‘new’ child may have on them\n, given levels peer violence\n. \nv) Improvement of support mechanisms. Data and evaluation should be more central to our strategy to \nevalua\nte what works for care homes. There needs to be more opportunities for sharing good practice between children’s homes given the current lack of a mechanism to do this.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Hannon.
