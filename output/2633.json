"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) (CCS43)&#xa0;\nThe IEA is an intergovernmental organisation which acts as energy policy advisor to 28 member countries in their effort to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for their citizens. It is committed to promoting the “Three E’s” of balanced energy policy making: energy security, economic development and environmental protection. The United Kingdom has been a member country of the IEA since it was formed in 1974.\n&#xa0;\nIn its Technology Roadmap for Carbon Capture and Storage, 2013 update, the IEA \nreported that t\nhe next seven years are critical to the accelerated development of CCS\n.\n \nThe basis for this assessment was a review of the status of CCS globally, which found that:\nThe seven key actions below require serious dedication by gover\nnments and industry, but are realistic and cover all three elements of the CCS process.\nWhat types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 1. Routes to CO2 capture in power generation (by fuel) and industrial applications (by sector)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAre there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 2.
