[normal]Consumer Rights Bill – An additional, ‘satisfactory quality’ test for Services[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I was pleased to learn that the BIS Select Committee is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Consumer Rights Bill. As you know, I believe the draft Bill offers an important opportunity to secure more confident consumers and thereby generate a more dynamic and stronger economy. I understand my officials have been liaising with the Committee clerks to prepare scrutiny. We stand ready to support the Committee’s process and I look forward to discussing the measures in detail in the Autumn.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to write at this stage on one specific issue which we raised alongside the draft Bill - the idea of a new right that a service is provided to an additional “satisfactory quality” standard. I hosted a roundtable meeting in May on this issue and sought more specific evidence. I attach a note of the roundtable and the submissions received to aid your scrutiny process. The rest of this letter draws out some of the key points that I drew from the evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Satisfactory quality right” for services
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A “satisfactory quality” right already exists for goods. It focuses on the outcome produced for the consumer and whether it is what a reasonable person would expect, taking into account the description, price and other relevant circumstances. If goods are not of satisfactory quality, the right will be breached, no matter how much care and skill a trader has taken. The existing law on services is instead concerned with 
[normal]how
[normal] the service is provided, (whether it was provided with “reasonable care and skill”). As long as a trader has taken reasonable care and skill the trader is not liable, no matter what the end result. In 2010, an academic report commissioned by government proposed that we add a “satisfactory quality” right for services
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We received a range of views on this issue in response to our consultation. Some argued that consumers would benefit from a test that was more aligned to the satisfactory quality test for goods; others felt such a test would be complicated, costly or unworkable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Potential Benefits
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It was suggested to us that it would make consumer rights easier to understand and this would give consumers more confidence to challenge traders. For example, consumers could see for themselves whether a wall had been evenly painted. However, they might feel they would need to ask an expert to assess whether the wall had been painted with “reasonable care and skill”, particularly if the trader said the reason for any uneven patches was because of pre-existing damp problems.  Which? responded to our request for evidence that “consumers understand the concept of ‘satisfactory quality’. This is how they assess any goods they purchase (and have done so for many years). It also reflects the natural parlance.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some also felt that a focus on the outcome would increase dialogue between consumers and traders, as traders would need to explain, discuss and understand the result the consumer required before and during provision of the service. The dialogue could also help manage consumer expectations of the outcome and therefore reduce the potential for disputes once the service had been performed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research
[normal] indicates that 7% of consumers have experienced a problem with a regulated service in the last 12 months. Some stakeholders have told us that these, and problems in the non-regulated sectors, would be more likely to be resolved if consumers were equipped with this new right. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Potential drawbacks
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It was also suggested to us that a new right would create more complexity for both consumers and traders because the same right could not be interpreted in the same way universally across all services. For example, the outcome of a service related to a physical product (such as a car repair) is much easier to define than one that does not (such as a beauty treatment) where expectations are likely to vary considerably. Exempting or applying different standards to different types of service would make the law more complex and be counter to the aims of the draft Bill to streamline and clarify consumer rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Often there will be matters of uncertainty to the trader that will mean that they will not be able to specify or meet the pre-contractually negotiated outcome. For example, a dry-cleaning firm cannot be certain that their solvents will be sufficient to shift a stain of uncertain origin.  A private French tutor cannot be sure that his methods will help you improve your confidence in the language. An architect cannot guarantee that her design is the optimum solution for your range of requirements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some felt businesses would be discouraged from taking on higher risk contracts. For example, renovation work on an old house, where the risks of finding problems mid-job are high. Business might also break big jobs into small parts, where they have more control of the outcome or include more contingency in the price to cover themselves against more eventualities. This could result in increased complexity and higher prices for consumers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There was also concern that a “satisfactory quality” right would lead to traders using more legal disclaimers. The aim would be to clarify what “satisfactory quality” would look like. This is important because some types of services have relatively subjective outcomes, with expectations varying by consumer, such as the benefit expected from a life coaching session or new central heating system. Disclaimers could, of course, be helpful if they lead to a better understanding by the consumer of the likely outcome but they could also encourage unnecessary paperwork and an increase in “small print” as traders anticipated all potential eventualities.  Such multiple disclaimers could make it harder for consumers to understand if their rights had been breached, to prove the breach or to enforce their rights. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It has proved difficult to assess the cost implications. Business groups have told us that a satisfactory quality test would mean they had to spend more on legal advice, appropriate disclaimers and potentially higher insurance costs for services where the outcome was harder to manage. SMEs may be particularly affected by the costs involved in taking external legal advice or adopting a more risk-averse approach to the service they felt they could provide; in turn this could reduce consumer choice and competition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this summary and the detailed evidence I am attaching is helpful to your consideration. There clearly remains a divergence of views and I believe the case still has to be made to warrant a change from the current position. I therefore will continue to consider further evidence and views as they are debated during pre-legislative scrutiny and I look forward to learning the Committee’s views and to discussing them with you in due course.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Annex 2[bold]Evidence from Citizens Advice[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The CA Consumer Service (advice line) received over a million contacts in 2012/13, relating to 837k individual cases. Of these issues, 173,562 (21% of all issues) were categorised with a complaint description of ‘substandard services’. These are summarised by Tier 1 issue (business area) in the table below:

[normal]Of the largest, “House Fittings and Appliances”, “Home maintenance and Improvements” was by far the largest with 30578 cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From a sample of cases, we deduce that the majority of consumers already apply an “outcome based” standard to services provided.

[normal]---------------------------------------------------------------------
[normal]Annex 4 [bold]Which? Evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Complaints levels about services are quite high
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A number of service providers do not take responsibility for problems
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2 in five complaints aren’t resolved by the provider, although this varies by sector. And top reasons include a shifting of the blame.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Problems not being resolved by the provider seem most prevalent in:
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Trades services – 58%
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Airlines/holiday operators – 56%
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Car/vehicle repairs – 53%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That the problem was caused by circumstances out of their control – 26%
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That another company was responsible – 15%
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That it was not possible to fix the problem – 15%
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That they have done what they had promised to do – 13%
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That the terms and conditions of your contract said they weren’t liable – 11%
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That the problem was caused by consumer – 10%
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The provider ignored the issue/gave no response – 9%
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That they have complied with the industry standard – 9%
[normal]Having further discussed this issue with the Which? telephone lawyers, we have identified the following scenarios where a change in to a ‘satisfactory service obligation’ is most likely to be of benefit to consumers (ignoring for now the general benefits previously discussed, such as empowerment from it being more intuitive and objective standard):
