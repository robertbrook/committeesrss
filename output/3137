[normal]Written evidence from Bailey Pollock Electrical Services Ltd[bold] [bold]I watched the recent Committee meeting where you took evidence from Certsure, Napit
[normal] and others over the single register. As a registered electrician, I have a number of concerns on this matter and how it is currently operated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Put simply my main concerns are:
[normal]I would advocate and support a single register but not by a body such as the NICEIC. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this information is of some use to you and I will be very ha
[normal]ppy to provide further information or explanation should you need it.
