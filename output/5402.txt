[[[&#xa0;]]]Thank you for your letter of 16 December seeking views on the impact on the work of select committees of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011.&#xa0;In my view, the key benefit for select committees is the ability to plan our programme of work with greater certainty. &#xa0;Under the previous arrangements, by this stage of a Parliament there would have been considerable uncertainty about whether there would be sufficient time to conclude and report on an inquiry which had just been started, before a dissolution was announced.&#xa0;As a result of the new system, when my Committee met to consider its programme earlier this month, we could be sure that the new inquiries we agreed to undertake  would be able to run their planned course and would not have to be rushed to a conclusion. This meant that we could plan inquiries up to the end of this year. &#xa0;The certainty of a full five-year Parliament also allows select committees the time to cover the span of their remit more effectively within a parliamentary term. This is particularly important for a committee like mine which has seen major reform since 2010 across all of the policy areas it covers. &#xa0;I hope this input is helpful to your Committeeâ€™s inquiry. &#xa0;&#xa0;21 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
