[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carers UK is a charity set up to help the 6.5 million people who care for family or friends. At some point in our lives every one of us will be involved in looking after an older relative, a sick friend or a disabled family member. Whilst caring is part and parcel of life, it can affect your job, your health and your finances. Without the right support the personal costs can be high.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carers UK is a membership organisation of carers, run by carers, for carers. We have 17,000 members and a reach of many more. We provide information and advice about caring alongside practical and emotional support for carers. Carers UK also campaigns to make life better for carers and influences policy makers, employers and service providers, to help them improve carers' lives.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carers UK’s advice and information services answer around 16,000 queries from carers and professionals every year. Our website is viewed by over 100,000 people every month, 27,000 subscribe to our monthly email newsletters, and the combined reach of our online communities and social networks exceeds 38,000. We’re in regular contact with around 1,500 local organisations, including many run by carers, who are in touch with around 950,000 carers.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carers UK has offices in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This response reflects the views of the organisation, UK-wide.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carers UK believes that funding decisions about the health and care system need to consider the role of family and the impact that the health and social care system has on it. The system is not currently sustainable for families and will become increasingly untenable if it does not adapt and change to accommodate our evolving demographic structures.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Publically funded social care continues to be tightly rationed and despite the rise in the number of older people and the number of children with complex needs living into adulthood, the number of people accessing social care is going down.

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The NHS Information Centre figures show that the “total number of people receiving services in 2012-13 was 1.3m (down 9% from 2011-12 and down 25% from 2007-08). Of these, 1.1m received community based services (a fall of 10% from 2011-12), 209,000 received residential care (a fall of 2% from 2011-12) and 87,000 received nursing care (which is less than a 1% change from 2011-12). Feedback from councils suggests that the fall this year is again due to a number of reasons including raised eligibility criteria for services and reduced funding/resources within Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities, but also the contribution of an increase in the provision of reablement services outside of a formal assessment process.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Families are increasingly bridging this gap in funding and social care support by providing greater amounts of care themselves. The latest Census results tell us that there are 6.5 million carers throughout the UK. There are 1.3 million who are providing 50 hours of care or more per week. This number providing substantial amounts of care has been on a steady increase from 1985, and continues to rise much more rapidly than the total carer population – a 35% increase compared to an 11% rise in the total carer population.  This is occurring at the same time as a shift towards community-based care moves NHS responsibilities to local councils yet the amount of social care provided is decreasing relative to the number of people who need it.

[[[    ]]]&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The care provided by family and loved ones is unpaid but it does come at a cost to the finances and health of the families involved and to the wider economy.  Family and close friends who provide care are a vital and critical part of the health and social care system, but continue to be overlooked and often taken for granted.  Without better support for families from health and social services, the ability of many carers to provide care is threatened.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By 2050 globally three times more people of working age will be looking after two billion ageing family members – and the majority will have to combine that care with paid work. There is not a ready “pool” of family members who are ready and able to take on an increased level of caring without significant consequences for their own health and well-being, ability to work and short and long term personal finances.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The health and social care system needs to invest more in supporting and sustaining families who care and integrate and align the ways it works to meet the needs of whole families.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The impact on the NHS of social care services which are unable to properly support families can be seen in emergency admissions to hospital and readmission after discharge.

[[[ ]]]Carers UK’s State of Caring survey of over 3,900 carers, asked a wide range of questions about their experiences of caring. 55% of survey respondents said that the person they care for has been admitted to emergency hospital services in the last three years.

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many survey respondents attributed emergency admissions to a lack of support. Whilst 64% of survey respondents did not believe that the emergency admission of their loved one could have been prevented, significant percentages identified areas where additional support could have prevented admission:This evidence shows that greater and higher quality support from care services could have a significant impact on the number of emergency admissions to hospital.&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The most recent survey from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Care annual survey of suggests that in the three years since the beginning of the current austerity programme, some £2.68 billion savings will have been made by adult social care - 20 per cent of net spending.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; These spending reductions mean that millions of older and disabled people are unable to access care to meet ‘moderate’ needs for care and support. Age UK in its Care in Crisis report has estimated that of 2 million older people in England with care-related needs nearly 800,000 receive no support from public or private sector agencies” and found a £500 million shortfall in social care funding.&#xa0;4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A number of charities representing working age disabled people have made similar calculations and found that social care for working age disabled adults is underfunded by at least £1.2 billion.  They also estimate that 69,000 disabled people with 'moderate needs' are not currently receiving support, meaning they are likely to struggle with day-to-day life.&#xa0;4.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In making decisions about the balance of future funding for the health and social care systems, the Government must seriously consider the impact on the NHS of the current crisis in social care funding. Earlier investment to meet lower level needs and enable the management of long-term conditions can prevent or delay the development of needs which may require a greater level of care and be more likely to require acute care.&#xa0;4.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Under current proposals local authorities would fund substantial care only and only the cost of meeting substantial needs will count towards the cap on care costs. A lower eligibility criteria would act as an important lever in preventing the development of need for care and support.  There is an economic case for making the change. Economic modeling on four different service types carried out by Deloitte in 2013 found that for every £1 spent on support for people with ‘moderate’ level needs, an average of £1.30 will be saved in the NHS, local and central government.&#xa0;4.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The wider cost to the economy of carers being pushed out of the workforce are significant.  Research from the LSE Personal Social Services Research Unit has estimated that the public expenditure costs of carers leaving employment is £1.3 billion per year. Further work from Age UK based on these figures suggests that when lost earnings are taken into account this rises to £5.3 billion.&#xa0;4.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, if the Government puts in place eligibility set at substantial it is vital that local authorities have adequate funding to put in place free or affordable preventative services such as telecare and adaptations.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Without a bigger funding commitment for preventative services and services which enable people and their families to manage long-term conditions, disabled and older people and their families will continue to struggle without proper support until their needs escalate to a high and expensive level.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In relation to General Practice, there are high-impact, low-cost measures which GP surgeries can put in place to make a significant contribution to prevention. GP surgeries are often the first and most regular point of contact for families affected by disability and ill health. Their role in identifying individuals with caring responsibilities and signposting them to information and support – particularly advice on their rights and entitlements to financial and practical support – can result in carers accessing support far earlier and preventing them from reaching breaking point. However Carers UK’s State of Caring research 2013 showed that 67% of carers say that their GP is aware of their caring responsibilities but gives them no extra help. &#xa0;4.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carers UK’s Local GP Ambassadors, volunteer carers and former carers, demonstrate how change can be delivered through partnership work with local support groups and advice agencies to embed carer-identification and signposting. Carers UK continues to argue that the best driver of change would be a duty on NHS bodies to identify carers and promote their wellbeing.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some of the most significant problems that are caused for families can stem from lack of coordination between different services within the health service and social care, and this extends into housing, work, benefits and other related entitlements. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Being passed from one department to another, being asked to repeat their medical history and struggling to get the right treatment from a complex and fragmented health and care system are all common experiences of patients. It is often families and carers who take on the role of trying to navigate this system. Therefore, the principle recently suggested by the Department of Health of having one accountable person, for every older person receiving care, who has an in-depth knowledge of how the whole care system works and who can coordinate and bring together different services and treatments is a very welcome idea. In Kensington and Chelsea, for example, there is commissioning of link workers that go into GP practices to offer to link up with the rest of the services that families need.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A fundamental shift is needed in the perspective of the NHS in relation to supporting families. Carers UK is proposing a target duty on health bodies to identify carers and promote the health and well-being of carers as a strategic role. This would also help to redress the huge imbalance in rights and attitudes.  With social care moving towards fully integrated carers’ rights, the NHS meanwhile has no duty of care towards the carer, apart from when they are a patient in their own right. It is critical to align these duties by introducing new legislation

[[[.]]]&#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Data remains a significant barrier to integration of health and social care.              Health and social care also need to explore confidentiality so that information can be given to families and carers when needed. Coupled with new technology that enables carers to see care records updated, support families to co-ordinate caring and care services, this could revolutionise families’ ability to care.
