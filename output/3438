defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default defaultGood afternoon
default,
default w
defaultelcome
default,
default and thank you for coming.  Thank you for your written submissions.  As you will probably appreciate, we have a huge amount of written 
defaultmaterial
default already, but I can assure you that yours ha
defaults
default all been read.
default 
defaultThe session will last for approximately 60 minutes and, before I engage with you, I need to say that Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare them.  The session is on the record and is being webcast live
default,
default and will be subsequently accessible via the 
defaultp
defaultarliamentary website.  The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and to correct.  This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the 
defaultp
defaultarliamentary website.
default 
defaultIf you feel that after this session there
default i
defaults something else you would like to add, please feel free t
defaulto get in touch with the clerk. 
defaultThank you very much for your written submissions.  I would now like to ask you, if you could, to begin by stating your names and official titles for the record and, if you wish, as we would like you to, by each making an opening statement.
defaultAngus Graydefault: I am Angus Gray and I am

defaultD
defaultivision, part of the Department for Work and Pensions.  
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I am Bill Wells; I head 
defaultthe 
defaultlabour 
defaultmarket
default&#xa0;
defaultanalysis branch 
defaultin the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.  
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: Hello, my name is Lindsey
default&#xa0;
defaultLewis. My title is Europe
default&#xa0;
default2020 Programme
default&#xa0;
defaultManager, which means I lead employment and social policy interactions with the EU for the Department for Work and Pensions.
defaultThe Chairman:default defaultBefore I ask the first question, do you have an opening statement, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultGray?
defaultAngus Graydefault: Thank you for this opportunity to make some opening remarks.  I thought it would be helpful to briefly set out the way the 
defaultYouth
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment
default&#xa0;
defaultInitiative 
defaultwill work in the 
defaultUK
default and to set that in the context of our wider efforts to tackle youth 
defaultun
defaultemployment.
defaultThe primary responsibility for tackling youth unemployment, of course, rests with 
defaultmember state
defaults.  The Government already ha
defaultve
default a range of help in place, including the 
defaultYouth Contract
default, which provides additional support for young people
default,
default worth almost £1
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion over three years, providing work experience for all young people who want it, wage incentives, incentives for apprenticeships and additional support for disengaged 16 and 17
default 
defaultyear
default&#x2011;
defaultolds.  
defaultIn addition,
default there is the Work
default&#xa0;
defaultProgramme, which offers tailored support for young people who have been claiming 
defaultj
defaultobseeker’s
default&#xa0;
defaulta
defaultllowance 
defaultfor more than nine months.  We are also using some of the current ESF allocation in 
defaultEngland
default on young people who are not in employment, education or training.
defaultWe estimate that the UK share of the 
default€3
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment
default&#xa0;
defaultInitiative will be worth €194
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, which will be shared between the five regions in the UK 
defaultthat
default have a youth
default 
defaultunemployment rate of 25% or higher.  In 
defaultEngland
default, those regions are inner 
defaultLondon
default, Merseyside, 
defaultTees
default 
defaultValley
default and 
defaultDurham
default, and the 
defaultWest Midlands
default.  South
default-
defaultwest 
defaultScotland
default is also expected to qualify.  The money needs to be spent by 2018.  The €194
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion equates to just less than €40
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion 
defaulta
default year.
default  
defaultThe money therefore makes an important contribution to our efforts to tackle y
defaultouth unemployment, but it is dwarfed by the scale of our other existing investments.  
defaultThe Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment
default&#xa0;
defaultInitiative has been added to the 
defaultEU’s 
defaultESF r
defaultegulation
default,
default and so it will be integrated into the 
defaultESF 
defaultoperational programme for 
defaultEngland
default.  As with ESF overall, it is for 
defaultmember state
defaults to decide how to spend the money.
default  
defaultThat will include the Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment
default&#xa0;
defaultInitiative, but operational programmes need to be
default 
defaultnegotiated and then agreed with the European
default&#xa0;
defaultCommission.  The main thing they will be looking for is 
defaultan assurance
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a clear rationale for our proposal, based on the evidence.  Proposals need to reflect the differen
defaultt position
default in each 
defaultmember state
default: the level of unemployment, delivery systems and the coverage of existing provision.
defaultI should perhaps have clarified at the beginning that I am responsible for ESF in 
defaultEngland
default only, because the structural funds are a devolved matter.  In 
defaultEngland
default, the 
defaultlocal
default&#xa0;
defaultenterprise
default&#xa0;
defaultpartnerships
default, of which there are 39, have been asked to develop strategies for how the funds should be spent.  That includes the ESF, the European
default&#xa0;
defaultregional
default&#xa0;
defaultdevelopment
default&#xa0;
defaultfund and 
defaultpart of the European 
defaultagricultural fund for rural developme
defaultnt.  There are seven of these LEPs affected by the Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment
default&#xa0;
defaultInitiative
default,
default so they have built proposals for how to spend that money into their overall approach to the structural funds.  They have been consulting local partners over the summer about their plans
default,
default and they submitted their draft strategies to us on 7
default&#xa0;
defaultOctober.  We are now working with them to ensure 
defaultthat 
defaulttheir proposals add value to what already exists.  We are hoping to see some interesting and creative approaches to tackling this important problem.
defaultThe Chairman:default defaultMr Wells?
defaultBill Wellsdefault:
default That was the only opening statement.
defaultThe Chairman:default defaultAnd likewise?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault:
default Likewise.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default O
defaultne thing strikes me.  When you started off, you mentioned 
default€184
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion out of €3
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion
default. H
defaultow is that sorted out?
defaultAngus Graydefault: It is based on the analysis of which regions in the EU have youth unemployment of 25% or more.  There will obviously be countries with much higher levels.
defaultThe Chairman:default defaultWhat is the Gover
defaultnment’s position with regard to youth unemployment in the 
defaultUK
default?  What is the role of the devolved 
defaultA
defaultdministrations in tackling the issue?  You did relate to that up to a point.  Who would like to answer that question?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: If I may, Chairman, I will start to answer and then I will ask my colleague Bill to follow.  While youth unemployment in the 
defaultUK
default is significantly lower than much of the rest of the EU, 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment believe that
default this is still a significant issue that needs to be tackled.  Around 9% of 
default16
default to 
default24 
defaultyear
default&#x2011;
defaultolds are unemployed and not in full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime education; we think this is too high.
default  This is why the Government have
default implemented a range of policies to address this: those that Angus touched on, the Youth Contract
default,
default and the Work Programme in particular.  
defaultWe are also reforming apprenticeships to create more opportunities for training via that route.  Our aim is to make our apprenticeship programme the new international benchmark for excellence.  We are seeing success.  For example, the number of 
default16 to 24 year-old
defaults who are not employed or in full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime education fell by 7,000 in the last quarter and has fallen by 65,000 since the recent peak about two years ago.  I will ask my colleague Bill whether he wants to add anything.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: It is quite important to distinguish between unemployment and other forms of worklessness.  Perhaps the best division is between those on 
defaultjobseeker’s allowance
default, those on other benefits and those not on any other benefits.  In general, the story is that those on JSA are improving; those on other benefits—primarily lone parent and disability benefits—are at roughly the same level they were 
defaultat 
defaultbefore the recession.  The major problem tends to be 
defaultpeople 
defaultwho are not on benefits and who are making the transition from education to work.  In our evidence, this is on chart
default&#xa0;
default5.  These people have not 
defaultyet 
defaultmoved
default.
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYes
default, they have 
defaultmoved f
defaultrom one to the other.  
defaultBill Wellsdefault: It is important to realise that quite a lot of these people are not on benefits and are quite difficult to get hold of to help.
defaultThe Chairman:default Why are they not on benefits?  It cannot be that they do not know benefits are available.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: This is because it is 
default16 to 24 year-old
defaults: 16 and 17
default 
defaultyear
default&#x2011;
defaultolds are not eligible for benefits.  Also, sometimes it takes a long time either to move into education or employment
default,
default or to get involved in the benefits system.  That applies equall
defaulty to people leaving university.
defaultOver the last decade or so, it is taking longer for people who are leaving all forms of education to move into work.  In general, the story regarding the other two aspects that I mentioned—
defaultjobseeker’s allowance
default and other benefits—is very good compared 
defaultwith
default the mass unemployment of the 1980s
default,
default and as Lindsey said, for those on unemployment benefits there is now an improvement for those aged 18
default to 
default24.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultCould I ask a final question on that?  Have you done any work that gives you good evidence of how long it takes for somebody who, say, leaves school to actually 
defaultget
default a benefit?  I ask 
defaultbecause 
defaultthere are an awful lot of scare stories in local newspapers at the moment.  The statement was made to me only yesterday that it takes 15
default&#xa0;
defaultweeks for somebody to get a benefit.  If they are not living with their parents and have left school, this is really quite serious.  Do you have any idea about this?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: The people from the DWP might want to add something to this, but there is a distinction between whether you are applying and then how long it takes you, once you have applied for it, to get the benefit.  The problem lies in 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst of those, not the second, because Jobcentre
default&#xa0;
defaultPlus has targets for how quickly the benefits are paid.  
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultCould you actually tell us what the targets are, once someone has registered?
defaultAngus Graydefault: I am afraid I have not come—
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultIf you have any solid evidence on that, we would be grateful.
defaultAngus Graydefault: No, we will have.  Certainly, when I was working more closely with Jobcentre
default&#xa0;
defaultPlus, we published data regularly on those clearance times.  As Bill says, as well as the potential gap before someone realises there is help available and they claim, in the processing part of the organisation we also face the problem that people need time to respond when we ask for additional information.  Sometimes the delay is because they did not provide the evidence we asked for in the first place.  The delay quite often starts there.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: 
defaultFifteen 
defaultweeks sounds like an awfully long time to clear the benefit.  I would be very surprised if the evidence suggested it was anything like that.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThe problem with 
defaultsomething like 
defaultthis is 
defaultthat 
defaultit is always the rogue one that gets noticed; I do understand that.
default  defaultThe question also asked what the role of the devolved 
defaultA
defaultdministrations is in tackling the issue
default.  Is it different from the way it is tackled in 
defaultEngland
default?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: Employment policy is not devolved
default,
default except in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.  
defaultNorthern
default&#xa0;
defaultIreland
default tends to take a mirrored position to 
defaultGreat
default&#xa0;
defaultBritain
default.  However, related issues such as 
defaulttraining, skills and education are devolved issues.  All the devolved authorities can choose how they approach those important issues.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Haskel:default defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultWells told us about splitting up unemployed young people into three: people on 
defaultjobseeker’s allowance
default, people on other benefits and people on no benefits.  Is there any further disaggregation necessary of the different types of young people and their different needs, so we can ensure the effectiveness of the policies?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: Again, I probably have to distinguish between those on benefits and those not on benefits.  The focus of the work on people on benefits is individual
default&#x2011;
defaultbased; it is not based on their characteristics.  When they come in, there is a discussion with their advis
defaulte
defaultr, if it is Jobcentre
default&#xa0;
defaultPlus, as to the most effective way to get them into work.  There is a jobseeker’s agreement, which will take account of individual characteristics: for example, whether a lone parent 
defaultneeds
default to have a certain work pattern.  However, the general policy of the 
defaultUK
default in this area is to focus on the individual and not to identify particular groups and treat 
defaultthem
default as homogenous groups.
defaultLord Haskel:default defaultOn the question of disaggregation, when we get the figures quoted they usually include full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime students.  You carefully disaggregated the full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime students.  How many full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime students are there?  What is the real figure?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I am not sure 
defaultthat 
defaultI should say this is the real figure, but there are about 950,000 people on ILO unemployment and about 300,000 of those are in full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime education.  The improvement in ILO unemployment, although not substantia
defaultl, has been greater than among
default the ILO unemployed who are in full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime education.
defaultLord Haskel:default defaultDo you disaggregate the people as to their capabilities: for instance, into higher skills levels or higher academic levels?  Do you judge people and say, “He does not have much potential” or
default 
default“She does not have much potential”?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I will let my DWP colleagues talk about this a little.  It differs in different parts of the system.  If you 
defaultare going in
defaultto the Department for Work and Pensions, the disaggregation is based on the most effective way of getting them into work.  If you go through the education system, it is based on the best way to get them into education or the best way to get them into training.  From an employment perspective, which tends to be my background, the distinction is based on the most effective way of getting people into work.
default 
defaultAngus Graydefault: That is absolutely right: there is this individual diagnosis.  You would tend to give advice based on all sorts of things: ability, but also aspiration and motivation.  Often, the problem with young people is getting them 
defaultfocused
default and interested.  At the beginning of entering the labour market, finding something that interests them and that they are capable of is as important as anything.
defaultOn your disaggregation point, the only thing I would add is that there is a bit of bias in the system around age.  There is a bias towards education and skills the younger they are in this group
default,
default and there is a growing bias towards work as they get older.
defaultThe Chairman:default There is a big focus on NEETs. H
defaultow useful is it as a category?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: It is slightly unfortunate that everybody collapses
default it
default into the word “NEETs”, because it is actually “not in education, employment or training”
default,
default and so, for example, someone who leaves university and might be waiting to take up a job is included in the NEET figures.  This is a nightmare
default, given 
defaultthe different definitions in this area.
defaultThere are two definitions I would distinguish between, which might be helpful: one is unemployment, where people are looking for work; the other one is what I call economic inactivity, which is where someone is outside the labour market and not looking for work.  The workless include both those groups.  The problem tends to be, as I 
defaultintimated
default before, among
default the people who are not looking for work and not looking for education either.  It is the workless people who are regarded in the labour
default&#x2011;
defaultmarket statistics as not looking for work, where the structural problem in youth worklessness
default, 
defaultas I would call it
default, 
defaulthas grown over time.  If you do not look for work, you will not get a job.
defaultAngus Graydefault: Bill’s analysis of the numbers is absolutely right.  However, you can look beyond the numbers at some of the people we worry about.  This is my own word association, but when I think about NEETs I think about some of the most disadvantaged young people.  At the 
defaultyounger ages, you
default might think of persistent truants and people who have chaotic lifestyles at home.  You need to find them first, but the focus on them is absolutely crucial, because we are trying to avoid them losing
default—
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultT
defaulthe ability to work.
defaultAngus Graydefault:
default Yes.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: To pick that up, part of the story is that there is a greater focus within the system on the most disadvantaged people.  One of those elements is how long they have been in that situation.  The long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm unemployed would receive more direct help from Jobcentre
default&#xa0;
defaultPlus, whereas the expectation is that you get the short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm unemployed to look for work effectively and most of them will find that job within not very long at all.
defaultThe Chairman:default A lot of these people come from homes where people have never worked; there is no tradition of working.  There is 
defaultmore 
defaulta tradition of, “Well, we will just g
defaultet
default by
default. T
defaulthere is
default nothing 
defaultwe are skilled for”
default— 
defaultdepression really
default. 
default 
defaultIs that true?  We hear a lot of stories about that.  Again, this could just be anecdotal.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: It is overstated.
defaultThe Chairman:default Is it?  I see.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: It may be that the numbers do not tell the whole story, but if you look at the stories about two or three generations where nobody has worked, from what we can tell the numbers are quite small.
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you have any actual evidence of that or numbers you could quote us?  It would be great if we could actually make that point in our final report.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: Yes, we do.
defaultThe Chairman:default Do not worry about it now, but we would be grateful if you could send it to us.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: Yes, of course.
defaultAngus Graydefault: My understanding is that Bill is absolutely right, but you do get families and communities and where there is very little work.  Never having worked is quite a high bar.  You might have done the odd week or two
default,
default and then you are not in the “never worked” category.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: 
defaultT
defaulthe concentration of worklessness 
defaultmay be 
defaultan issue, rather than the history of worklessness.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Fearn:default To what extent is the Government’s position on youth unemployment influenced by EU policy?  How are EU actions to tackle youth unemployment generally being interpreted and delivered in the 
defaultUK
default?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: 
defaultMy 
defaultLord Chairman, employment policy remains a 
defaultmember state
default competence, but we do value the opportunity given by the European
default&#xa0;
defaults
defaultemester to share experiences with other 
defaultmember state
defaults.  For example, we are sending a 
defaultUK
default official to a mutual
default&#x2011;
defaultlearning event in the 
defaultNetherlands
default in November and we are holding a mutual
default&#x2011;
defaultlearning event here on the minimum wage in April next year.  We will take part in multilateral surveillance, as part of the European
default&#xa0;
defaults
defaultemester process, where we will be challenge
defaultd
default on our performance in this area and we have the opportunity to challenge others.
defaultThe Chairman:default It is a useful function, is it not?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: I believe so, yes.
defaultLord Fearn:default When this deputation goes, are they going with 
defaultUK
default policy on the unemployed?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: The people who are going are policy officials, who are responsible for developing our policy.  It should inform policy development going forward.
defaultLord Fearn:default What 
defaultis the backup from 
defaultthat?  Where does it go after that, when they get back from 
defaultHolland
default?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: It informs the policy process.  It is an opportunity to learn about a number of other countries’ policies and the way things work in their systems and to feed that into policy development in the 
defaultUK
default.  There is no formal product, but it then becomes part of our knowledge base and our understanding.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: There is an important point about how most different countries have different systems.  Therefore, it is not a case of, say, going to the 
defaultNetherlands
default,
default seeing the system and importing it wholesale over here.  The good ideas of things that seem to work are purloined by us and put alongside ours to see whether we could develop the policy in ways that suit the 
defaultUK
default system.  Particularly in the employment field, the labour markets tend to be quite different in many of the 
defaultmember state
defaults.
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default What I was going to ask follows on from that and
default from what 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultGray said at the beginning about the EU’s Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment
default&#xa0;
defaultInitiative, which has the rather odd acronym of YEI.  How does that tie in with our own policies?  Let us divide it up, if you would, into the 
defaultyouth
default&#xa0;
defaultguarantee 
defaultscheme, European
default&#xa0;
defaultalliance for apprenticeships and the quality framework for traineeship
defaults.  Taking that last one, I notice that the paper from
default the
default Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which I thought was very good, said about traineeship
defaults
default that if some of the Commission’s proposals were taken into account it would not 
defaultactually 
defaultproduc
defaulte
default the right sort of answers; it would do exactly the opposite.  Could you deal with these three different categories?
defaultAngus Graydefault: To start with the overall bit about the YEI, the good news is that it is an additional source of funding, rather than a set of activities.  Because it fits within the European
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial
default&#xa0;
defaultFund framework more generally, it is for 
defaultmember state
defaults to 
defaultdesign
default what they are going to do with the allocation.  That very much leaves us free to design interventions 
defaultthat
default we think are appropriate for our context.  However, probably most importantly in 
defaultEngland
default, the challenge for the European
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial
default&#xa0;
defaultFund is always to add value to what already exists.  In some of the EU 
defaultmember state
defaults, the structural
default&#x2011;
defaultfunds investment is either the only thing or by far the biggest thing that happens in their country on these topics, whereas we already have substantial investment of all sorts.  Therefore, what you need to do is make sure ESF is filling the gaps.
defaultWe have seen this with some of the strategies that have come back
default. O
defaultften, one of the things ESF can helpfully be used for is preparing people so they are ready for other mainstream provision
default, 
defaultif that makes sense.  If they are some of the most disadvantaged, finding and equipping them so they are more likely to benefit from a traineeship or an apprenticeship is one of the key added
default&#x2011;
defaultvalue actions we can take.  In that respect, the YEI is not a separate 
defaultEU
default policy that we have to worry about
default. I
defaultt is largely a source of money, with which we can do something sensible.
defaultWe do have more reservations about the Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultGuarantee, not in its aspiration that you need to help young people with a range of different offers, but more in the insistence that it should be done at the four
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth period.  As Bill was saying, particularly for those on 
defaultjobseeker’s allowance
default, people already find work quickly.  Over 80% of 18
default to 
default24
default 
defaultyear
default&#x2011;
defaultolds flow off 
defaultjobseeker’s allowance
default within six months.  If you put that kind of mandatory blanket provision in place
default 
defaultat
default four months, you will actually slow that down and hold people back from entering work when they would have done otherwise.  It is a cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffectiveness issue
default,
default and the dispute hinges aro
defaultund that four
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth threshold.
defaultWe have succeeded
default, 
defaultat least in our reading of the 
defaultr
defaultegulation
default,
default 
defaultin making the 
defaultr
defaultegulation more flexible on this point.  The release of the money is not tied to the implementation of a Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultGuarantee scheme; it is one of the things you can do with it.  There is a clause in the 
defaultregulation
default now that talk
defaults
default about including the Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultGuarantee scheme.  
defaultClearly
default, that only applie
defaults
default where regions and countries are implementing one.
defaultOn traineeships and apprenticeships, we are very much behind the principle of the European
default&#xa0;
defaultAlliance for
default&#xa0;
defaultApprenticeships.  It is about sharing good practice between countries.  As ever, we are slightly sceptical about mechanisms and bureaucracy and whether you need an alliance as such to deliver that, but learning from each other seems a perfectly sensible thing to us.  If other 
defaultmember state
defaults want an alliance to share it, that is fine.  We are still partly reserving 
defaultjudgment
default on 
defaultthe 
defaultQuality Framework for Traineeships.  Traineeships are something we have started to introduce in 
defaultEngland
default as of August this year; we are relatively new to them.  The focus is really about taking people who are not quite ready for apprenticeships and giving them that first intervention to help them take advantage of further help in due course.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default On the traineeships, you are 
default“
defaultwaiting to see
default”
default, 
defaultmore than 
default“
defaultalready feeling
default”
default.  It is rather implied by the paper that there are some points in this it would not be sensible for us to apply.  I get the feeling that it is too rigid.
defaultAngus Graydefault: Yes.  There was a sense that the definition they are using is much broader than 
defaultwhat we would term a
default traineeship.  We are not quite sure whether it is helpful or not.
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default defaultOn th
defaulte
default point you have made, 
defaultpage 27 of the 
defaultpaper you are referring to says, rather strikingly, “As a result, there is a potential for such a measure to exacerbate youth employment rather than reduce it”
default.
default  That is in paragraph
default&#xa0;
default98.  It is quite a striking statement and I wonder 
defaultwhether 
defaultyou could enlarge upon it somewhat.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I would link this with the four
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth 
defaultissue
default.
default 
defaultEssentially, there is what works and also what you tell people to do.  However, in general, the 
defaultUK
default’s 
defaultapproach 
defaultis to have a rights 
defaultand
default 
defaultresponsibilities agenda, which is about ensurin
defaultg that the individual themselves tries 
defaultto take up a job and trie
defaults
default to move into education.  There are some sanctions associated with that.  Rather than that, if you pick someone up and put them into something that does not suit them, it may retard their improvement.
defaultIt comes back a bit to the focus on the individual and the help and pressure that is applied
default: 
defaultthat they go for something that suits them, rather than something that is specified 
defaulton a blackboard
default.
defaultAngus Graydefault: There is another point here, which you see played out in other policy debates: one man’s quality threshold is another man’s rigidity.  We are worried that the attempt to impose a quality threshold on traineeships means that the bar is set so high it would be 
defaultto
defaulto difficult to get employers involved in offering anything.  This is what we are getting at here: if you are not careful in your definition, you preclude all sorts of really valuable activities.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultIn terms of 
defaultdevolved Administration
defaults, you mentioned having to negotiate how 
defaultthe 
defaultmoney is going to be spent with the European
default&#xa0;
defaultCommission.  First of all, how does that work in general?  Secondly, how does it work when it is a 
defaultdevolved Administration
default?  South
default-
defaultwest
default&#xa0;
defaultScotland
default would be the only area in question.
defaultAngus Graydefault: We have layers of agreement with the Commission.  There is a partnership agreement, which is at a 
defaultmember state
default level.  We
default have to make a proposal and get i
defaultt agreed and negotiated with the Commission; that covers the whole of the 
defaultUK
default.  Our approach there is to set out an overarching 
defaultUK
default narrative about what we think the issues are and what we need to do.  There are then chapters for each of the 
defaultdevolved Administration
defaults going into more detail
default.
defaultYou are right: we are trea
defaultding a line at the moment between the 
defaultmember state being
default the whole of the 
defaultUK
default and some of these issues being 
defaultdevolved.  In that document, we try
default to
default do that.  Beneath that are things called operational programmes
default,
default and they are at the level of the 
defaultdevolved Administration
default.  The European
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial
default&#xa0;
defaultFund operational programme will be for 
defaultEngland
default only and there will be a separate one for 
defaultScotland
default.  The detail of how they will use the Youth
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment
default&#xa0;
defaultInitiative will be set out in their operational programme, which is for them to design.  They separately negotiate that with the Commission.
defaultThis will be my first attempt at this
default;
default I am not clear what the negotiation will actually look like.  We will propose it on paper and they will tell us the things they do not like.  My understanding is the hard conversation will be about target levels, as you might expect.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultYou mentioned a hard conversation.  Is it very time consuming?  Is it like going to an old
default&#x2011;
defaultfashioned bank manager
default who says, “No, y
defaultou are not going
default to get the money, sorry
default.
default”?
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultHe is too young to know about bank managers.
defaultAngus Graydefault: I have heard of them.  My sense is 
defaultthat 
defaultnothing is absolutely speedy in dealings with the Commission, but it is not supposed to be a lengthy, drawn
default 
defaultout process and, indeed, they are committed to getting it done maybe quicker this time than we have managed in the past, because the tripartite negotiations over the regulations have taken time
default. W
defaulte are now in October with no regulations agreed
default,
default with a January start date.  We will need to be swift in our discussions.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Haskel:default 
defaultRather than the memory of bank managers, I wish to talk about traineeships very quickly.  They are what we used to call sandwich courses, but you are too young 
defaultto know 
defaultthat.  I would like to know how keen employers are on these various schemes.  How keen are employers on having traineeships and putting effort into it?  Of course, without the 
defaultco-operat
defaultion of the employers, it is all a bit of a waste of time.
defaultAngus Graydefault: Precisely, yes.  I do not know about these precise schemes; they are relatively new.  We only launched them in August this year, so we probably do not have any feedback on this particular scheme, but my experience of working with employers in Jobcentre
default&#xa0;
defaultPlus was always that the trick was to speak their language
default.
defaultIf you go with a pre
default&#x2011;
defaultprepared product that is traditionally bureaucratic and full of detail and requirements, they will push back
default. H
defaultowever, for their own economic growth and business, they need good people
default, 
defaultand they need to take advantage of young people.  It seems to me, therefore, that our task in 
defaultg
defaultovernment is to design things that work for th
defaultem and work of the individual.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: The focus on 
defaultthe 
defaultindividual is partly that th
defaulte individual gets to the job or 
defaulttraineeship that suits them.  If it does not suit them, the employer will not 
defaultfancy them a lot
default,
default because you have two sets of people who are not happy with the arrangement.
defaultLord Haskel:default defaultPresumably, it is a way of employers assessing the abilities of somebody.  Then they can decide whether or not to employ them.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: It is one of the benefits of that.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThis has been a very useful discussion.  Can I just track back for about 30 seconds to the four months versus the six months?  This has been a bone of contention for a long time.  
defaultIt was 
defaultI think 
defaultthe Netherlands that said at a conference I at
defaulttended
default that it is only a month or 
defaulteven 
defaulta week in 
defaulttheir 
defaultexperience.
default  Do you have any evidence to give us about the 28 
defaultmember state
defaults and what the comparable figures are?  Is it that we are taking much longer than anybody else
default,
default or is it that the Commission 
defaultdoes not realise
default the reality of the situation, which is that it is nearer to six months than four months?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: We will have some evidence across the EU, but this is one area where the particular situation in 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default is quite important because, as Angus said, particularly on JSA the outflow rates are so large in the first year that it really is a waste of money 
defaultparking 
defaultsomeone who could be getting a job.  Having been involved in this discussion for a number of years, it is really the focus on the individual.  We have resisted the four
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth period; in fact, we have resisted most of the very short periods.  Part of the reason why people do it sooner rather than later is that they sometimes lose the young person, because they are not eligible for the benefit and therefore, when they leave school and go wherever they go into, they say, “Let us get them before they get lost
default”.
default  This is only one of the very many different systems across the EU
default, and
default one size does not fit all.
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThat point obviously needs making, however.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default defaultWe had an interesting discussion about NEETs earlier, but I wonder if I may come back to them for this question.  The EU and 
defaultUK
default youth
default 
defaultunemployment policies place great emphasis on young people not in employment
default,
default 
defaulteducation
default or training.  Is this emphasis justified or are there good arguments for steering greater support towards 
defaultmore 
defaultemployable young people, given that they might have a faster and more sustainable impact on overall youth unemployment?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I have touched on this a bit before, in the sense that it is important to realise that 
defaultNEETs
default are not exactly the most disadvantaged or the most “unemployable”.  They are a range of different people
default.
defaultIn general
default, the 
defaultUK
default policy is not to help those who need the least help; it is to help those who need the most help.  Most of the 
defaultUK
default system is about pointing people
default in the right direction and 
defaultmaking sure that they behave properly in terms of their rights and responsibilities.  However, when that does not succeed—it tends to be either on the education side or the employment side—they get
default more
default help from the state.
defaultOne of the things I should say is 
defaultthat 
defaultour labour market is sufficiently flexible that there are jobs for everybody, in the sense that it is very diverse and dynamic.  It is actually quite difficult to regard someone as unemployable, because the range of jobs in the 
defaultUK
default is quite great.  Labelling them as unemployable may have damaging consequences as well.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultDo you not think somebody should take that up from a political point of view or at least advertise that everybody can do a job and everybody can get the enjoyment from a job?  There are so many different varieties of job.  
defaultBill Wellsdefault: 
defaultAngus might need to finish it
default.
defaultAngus Graydefault: In the words 
default“
defaultsupport
default”
default,
default 
default“
defaultattention
default”
default or 
default“
defaulthelp
default”
default lurks a plethora of offers.  Actually, even for people who are on the more employable end of spectrum, some of the employers I have spoken to think that one of the gaps is good
default 
defaultquality careers advice at the moment.  This is quite a theme in the plans that are coming forward.  They are saying, “We have some really exciting opportunities coming up over the next few years as we build 
defaultX
default, 
defaultY
default and 
defaultZ
default”.
default  A good example might be the announcement of the nuclear reactor in 
defaultSomerset
default.
default 
defaultHowever, we do not have enough kids coming through the 
defaultschool 
defaultsystem who think that is a worthwhile outcome.  
defaultW
defaulte need to educate the labour force of tomorrow about the opportunities that do exist in this area.  That is not skills help or investment but, as you say, good signposting and good advice to them about what opportunities are coming up and therefore what choices they might make.  It is an important part of the system.
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Valentine:default I am trying to join up the dots on some of this.  I am 
defaultchief
default&#xa0;
defaultexecutive 
defaultof London
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst, which is an employer group, so I understand the 
defaultLondon
default dimension of it.  Very roughly, the number of vacancies and unemployed used to be about the same
default. Y
defaultou now have 25% youth unemployment in inner 
defaultLondon
default.  I did not quite get what you were saying, but you are saying that employability skills may not be a big problem across that 25%.  Then you have lots of low
default&#x2011;
defaultskill entry jobs.  You know the old Pr
defaultê
defaultt
default&#xa0;
defaultà
default&#xa0;
defaultManger thing
default,
default where people go on hospitality jobs, he
defaultlping as waiters and waitresses—
defaultand 
defaultthen you play in immigration as well, obviously, to that
default.  However, I cannot quite get 
defaultwhat 
defaultthe spectrum of those 25% youth unemployed is
default 
defaultfrom what you are saying
default.  I can understand 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are all individuals, but what I hear most typically from the employers is 
defaultthat 
defaultif 
defaultHilton advertise
defaults
default a job for a waiter, no local British person applies
default. L
defaultots of other people apply.  There is something going on there
default.
defaultYou also hear that people do not have the employability skills
default. 
defaultI am sure you are bored of hearing this
default. They 
defaultdo not turn up at nine o
default’
defaultclock in the morning and they do not have the work ethic.  I then hear these anecdotes that they come from families 
defaultwith 
defaultthree generations 
defaultwho 
defaulthave not been employed and therefore they do not have a culture of working, but you are saying 
defaultthat 
defaultthat is something of a myth.  I cannot make 
defaultall
default these things join up.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: Can I have a go at a couple of these?  The first thing is that the 25% is not a static group.  It is very important to realise that people move in and out
default of
default jobs quite a lot.  
defaultA
defaultbout 
default6 million
default people move into and then out of a job each year.  To some extent, the unfilled vacancies are almost irrelevant, because there is always a range of vacancies available.
defaultThe other element about the flows into work—you mentioned Pr
defaultê
defaultt
default&#xa0;
defaultà
default&#xa0;
defaultManger—is not true.  There are lots of young people moving into jobs.  A lot of the 25% is a sho
defaultrt period of unemployment while
default they take up the job.
defaultHowever, the other feature that is real, which we mentioned, is this point about where you lose people from the system and they are not looking for those jobs.  The numbers that we quote with some g
defaultlee about the JSA off-
defaultflows do suggest that most people who get on
default 
defaultto JSA leave
default,
default and leave for a positive outcome
default,
default very quickly.  There is not the same success with people 
defaultwho 
defaultwe are not in touch with
default,
default and they tend to be people who are not looking for work.  It is important to focus on the flows in this.  There is a set of positive flows, which most young people go through and find jobs across a range of industries
default. T
defaulthere is then a smaller group who we mostly have not 
defaultgot hold of
default, who are there for a long period of time.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default 
defaultHow would you describe the employability skills of that group you are talking about there?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: We do not know, because we cannot 
defaultget
default them.  From the surveys, they tend to be dominated by people at the lower end of the employability
default 
defaultskills spectrum
default. H
defaultowever, they are not all in that group.  I am less sure about this, but the employability of this group seems to have improved over time.  It is the matching of the individuals to the jobs that is really quite important
default, 
defaultif we are going to concentrate on jobs.  There are similar issues around moving into education and training.
defaultAngus Graydefault: One of the risks here is that the generalisation of the diagnosis could lead to a generalisation about the solution for the individual.  It is one of the things we are always weighing up.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThat is life, though, is it not?  We all do that.
defaultAngus Graydefault: 
defaultW
defaulthat you do not want to do is say, “Everyone has to be at this level before we even allow them to think about 
defaultgoing into 
defaultwork
default”.
default  As Bill says, there are all sorts of vacancies.  Equally, I am 
defaultpretty 
defaultsure 
defaultthat 
defaultmy classics degree made me less employable.  
default 
defaultThe definitions are key.
defaultLord Cotter:default 
defaultI have 
defaulta wee little
default point.  I was very pleased to hear you mention careers advice and guidance
default 
defaultyourself.  N
defaultot to diverge
default too long by talking about it now
default, on the other hand
default it comes through very strongly indeed from employers
default.  I
defaultt also comes through very strongly in a lot of the written evidence 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have rec
defaulteived from all sorts of sources. I
defaultt comes through very strongly indeed from 
defaultp
defaultarliamentarians
default,
default and I do not think 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Government as such
default, 
defaultwithout being too specific
default, 
defaultare prepared to address that issue.  I hope officials will be pushing in that direction.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is a very good point.  Thank you, Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultCotter.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default There are only certain 
defaultUK
default areas 
defaultthat
default will be eligibl
defaulte to receive the €6
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion earmarked.  You said at the outset 
defaultthat 
defaultthose are areas where there is unemployment of 25% or more.  If I may be permitted a little personal reminiscence, when the European
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial
default&#xa0;
defaultFund was introduced in the earl
defaulty
default 1980s, I was a 
defaultMember of the European
default&#xa0;
defaultParliament for 
defaultLiverpool
default.  In Liverpool there was need, but in 
defaultLiverpool
default there was also a very well advanced group of civil society representatives.  With help, encouragement and information from me, in that first year we received more in social funding in Liverpool than anywhere else in the 
defaultUnited
default&#xa0;
defaultKingdom
default.  My question now is this: what work is being done, and by whom, to prepare and deliver projects that will help with the youth unemployment and be able to tap into this earmarked funding for the 2014
default&#x2011;
default16 period?
defaultAngus Graydefault: This is very much a joint enterprise.  As I said in my opening remarks, we have 
defaultset local
default&#xa0;
defaultenterprise
default&#xa0;
defaultpartnerships the task of 
defaultleading on the development of strategies for the structural funds in those areas.  If, like Merseyside, they are one of the YEI areas, that will include this element, recognising where their skills lie, w
defaulthich is principally in employer 
defaultled conversations about growth.  We have also made clear that they need to develop new strategies in partnership with others.  You have mentioned civil society
default. T
defaulthat is one of the key groups they need to consult and involve, but there are many others, too.
defaultWe are currently assessing the strategies, but our first pass suggests that they have mostly done a good job on consultation with partners and they can continue to do that.  They are coming up with ideas about how they might use it.  It is fair to say they are in high
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel embryonic form at the moment, but the common 
defaulttheme was
default careers advice and guidance
default, as 
defaultI have mentioned already.  Because they are business leaders, they have an opportunity to display leadership in their area and work with employers to help young people make that transition from education into work.
defaultWhether it is people leaving care or people suffering other disadvantages, the other theme is a recognition that more specialised and targeted help for some of those groups might be necessary.  The process we are going through is agreeing those strategies with those areas.  It will then become even more of a joint enterprise between 
defaultg
defaultovernment and the area, turning those into more detailed plans that the
defaultn
default turn into projects and delivery on the ground to target the individuals, areas and themes that they want us to focus the money on.
defaultBaroness Hooper:default defaultAre we prepared to take it up as rapidly as the Commission is advocating?
defaultAngus Graydefault: There are many nights 
defaultwhen 
defaultI wake up in a cold sweat
default,
default and that was increased with the notion that YEI had to be frontloaded in the first two years, until my more experienced colleagues reminded me that because of the European rules on spend, the two years is when we have to commit the money, but the 
defaultn+3
default rule
default 
defaultmeans that we do not have to spend it all until 2018.  We have to get our plans in order quickly
default. W
defaulte have to mobilise the procurement and project sta
defaultrt
default relatively quickly.  However, we have a total of five years to spend the money
default, which is more reassuring 
defaultand
default,
default 
defaultI think, 
defaultperfectly possible.
defaultLord Cotter:default 
defaultWhat is the Government’s view on the use of the European
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial
default&#xa0;
defaultFund to tackle youth unemployment specifically?
defaultAngus Graydefault: It has long been a feature of our use of the ESF to focus on young people.  As I said earlier, we use it 
defaultin 
defaultthat way at the moment.  This is just a strengthening of that focus.  Without the YEI, we would have 
defaultfocused
default a decent proportion 
defaultof the resources 
defaulton youth unemployment.  I would be surprised if there were many of the 39 areas that do not have a focus on youth unemployment, given its current level.  In the five areas covered by this, it would simply be an additional focus in order to use the additional funding.  The important thing, as I have said a few times, is that we design interventions that fit with what already exist
defaults
default.  The notion that we should be helping young people as we emerge from recession must be absolutely right.
defaultLord Cotter:default defaultL
defaultocal enterprise partnerships
default 
defaulthave a really strong focus locally in all 
defaultareas on 
defaultthe point of view of the business side of things.  How do you 
defaultfeel
default you would specifically work through the 
defaultlocal enterprise partnerships 
defaultto advance the sensible use of the ESF?  They are rather 
defaultfocused
default not on social issues
default but on how businesses are run in the area
default. T
defaulthey are important 
defaultfrom
default that point of view, of course.  How can you use them?
defaultAngus Graydefault: You are absolutely right.  From the point of view of the ESF, this is genuinely both a threat and an opportunity.  We have stressed tha
defaultt the LEPs cannot do this alone
default because, as you say, they have a particular focus.  
defaultAll
default the boards are a mixture of business and civic leadership—i.e
default.
default local authorities.  Local authorities clearly have a very keen interest in a whole range of social issues, but particularly youth, because they have a key accountability in relation to young people and raising the participation age, so they are engaged.  Even with that
default,
default the LEP by itself is necessary but not sufficient
default. T
defaulthat is always what I say
default.
defaultThis is why we have required them to engage with a wider range of partners locally to get ideas about what should be done.  It is also a real opportunity, because although, as Bill says, there are jobs coming up all the time, we also need more growth.  Therefore,
default we 
defaultwould be more likely to engage young people in those upcoming opportunities if we can both drive 
defaultgrowth 
defaultin local areas through these funds and use 
defaultthe 
defaultESF to make sure people can take advantage of 
defaultthe 
defaultopportunities
default,
default and make that link between employers and young people
default, 
defaultboth encouraging them to make opportunities available
default and
default, on the issue of careers guidance
default, having
default a powerful story about what jobs will be coming up.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Cotter:default defaultCan I pick you up on your words once again?  There is a little window of opportunity there.  You mentioned relating to young people.  Again, this is something 
defaultthat 
defaultmany of us feel very strongly about.  Again, quite a lot of the written evidence 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are getting is talking about what is happening in 
defaultEurope
default in terms of relating to young people.  Quite a lot is done in that direction.  There is a concern that perhaps—you mention
defaulted
default it
default, so
default I am picking up on it—there is a great need for young people to be around the table and tell
defaulting
default us what they really think about their different areas of experience.  What do you think of that?
defaultAngus Graydefault: What we tend to do
default, 
defaultnot just with young people
default, 
defaultis engage with representative groups.  There is a slight challenge here if you are thinking about young people who are out of work who you want to help into work.  They disqualify themselves from the organising committee by getting a successful outcome.  I am not sure how you would con
defaultstruct
default that kind of body in such a flexible and dynamic labour market
default. E
defaultqually, we are open to ideas and thoughts about how to make that work locally, because you need to design services that appeal.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWe are 
defaultopen if
default you have further ideas yourself.  If you do, please let us know.
defaultLord Cotter:default 
defaultYes, please do, because it really is such an important issue.  
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultIt is terribly important.  Certainly, we have discussed this around this table before now.  We cannot ignore these people.  We simply cannot do it.  It is more important that we really get started on that bottom part
default while 
defaultobviously encouraging 
defaultg
defaultovernment.
defaultLord Cotter:default 
defaultThis is such a strong issue.  There was a very good debate on Friday about young people voting at 16.  A lot of issues came out of that.  
defaultPlease
default pick up on that
default and help us.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultIt is in 
defaultHansard
default for the House
default&#xa0;
defaultof
default&#xa0;
defaultLords last Friday.  It was Friday, was it not?
defaultLord Cotter:default 
defaultIt was on Friday.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Valentine:default 
defaultYou have already touched on best practice from other EU countries.  I know you have said 
defaultthat 
defaultyou cannot lift and shift things, but are there examples of things that have the germs of ideas that you would like to see how you can implement or in some way plagiarise in the 
defaultUK
default from the rest of 
defaultEurope
default?
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: We do not have specific ideas, but 
defaultEurope
default is a fertile ground to look at what other 
defaultmember state
defaults are doing.  In the scheme of thi
defaultn
defaultgs, we are actually doing quite well in
default 
defaultthis area.  We have seen lower levels of unemployment
default th
defaultan following previous recessions
default,
default and we are doing better than the European average.
defaultHowever, there are European 
defaultmember state
defaults that are performing better than us
default,
default and some of them are performing
default better
default than us because their economy is doing better, but there are ot
defaulthers that are performing better
default but have also had a difficult economic time.  One of those examples would be the 
defaultNetherlands
default.  This is partly why we are going to take part in this event in November to try 
defaultto
default explore 
defaulta bit more 
defaultwhat they are doing and what drives their outcomes.  However, as we said before, the 
defaultNetherlands
default has a structure that is quite strongly based on sector
default&#x2011;
defaultwide collective
default 
defaultagreements with employers, which is quite different from our own situation.  How much we can lift directly is not clear, but it should still have some interesting learning 
defaultopportunities 
defaultfor us.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: As well as that, there are multinational organisations.  In our evidence, we mentioned some of the work that is done by places like the OECD.  For a very long time, they have considered young people
default. H
defaultowever, they have also considered best practice across the whole of the labour market.  Therefore, we listen to them, partly because they tend to try to evaluate the results and make them generally applicable.  Some of our policies have a strong feeling of some of the reports from the OECD.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default defaultCan I follow up on that
default?  
defaultThe OECD sound
defaults
default like a very good example.  This is probably a whole set of prejudices all muddled up together, but my sense is that Germany has training much better ingrained into the private sector and has had that philosophy
default 
defaultfor many years, whereas in Britain we passed it all over to the public sector for a couple of decades and it is now trying to come back in again.  I am interested 
defaultin
default, for instance, the German example
default,
default 
defaultor
default 
defaultare
default the lessons more about the broader context in which one does training, rather than specific examples
default?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: There is a history for this, because our system at one stage look
defaulted
default much 
defaultmore 
defaultlike the German system
default, albeit 
defaultquite a long time ago.  You are quite right: it is embedded in both the education system and the labour market.  The transition for a large part of the youth cohort 
defaultmostly 
defaultinto apprentices is a big feature in 
defaultGermany
default.  It is partly the quality of 
defaultthe 
defaultapprenticeships, but it is also the links between 
defaultthe 
defaulteducation and the apprenticeship and between the apprenticeship and what happens when people leave the apprenticeship
default.
defaultWe may not be able to replicate the German system, but the setting up of the wiring and increasing the extent of jobs with training, particularly apprentices, is something we probably ought to aspire to
default. W
defaulte have not managed it for quite a long time.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWe have not managed it yet.
defaultAngus Graydefault: We are probably slow to
default give
default credit 
defaultto 
defaultwhere we get 
defaultour 
defaultideas from, but we have been pushing and massively expanding our apprenticeship programme in recent years.  We have introduced the traineeships this year.  It does not say on the bottom of the tin, “Imported from 
defaultGermany
default”, but it would not surprise me at all if my colleagues were learning what worked from them.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I think we have probably spoken to 
defaultGermany
default before.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default 
defaultI am sure we 
defaultwould 
defaulthave spoken to them
default first and then imported it back
default.
default  
defaultHowever, your 2020 horizon is almost the kind of timeframe in which there might be a cultural shift.  One of the 
defaultissues
default we were discussing is that this
default is
default not a quick
default&#x2011;
defaultfix problem.
defaultAngus Graydefault: It is partly always about the dual system: trying to give equal parity to academic and non
default&#x2011;

default 
defaultin

default they have that cracked.  We do not

defaultyet.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default T
defaulthis is the final question
default. I
defaultt will raise a few har
defaulte
defaults, I think.  What is the Government’s view on encouraging the migration of unemployed workers from areas of high unemployment to those of high employment, both within the 
defaultUK
default and across the EU?  I have to declare an interest.  
defaultHaving been educated in Ireland
default, 
defaultI always say that 
defaultthree times in my lifetime 
defaultthey educated people for the 
defaultemigrant
default ship, but in fact two of the results were that a much higher skilled labour force came back.  It is in the DNA of the Irish to travel the world
default. I
defaultt has been since about the fifth century.  However, bear in mind 
defaultthat 
defaultthe p
defaulteople we are talking about now think nothing about going off to Stansted and having a weekend in 
defaultItaly
default, whereas when I was their age it would never have happened.  I 
defaultwonder
default whether that comes into your thinking at all
default. D
defaulto the Government actually think in this way?  I hop
defaulte there are no reporters here.
defaultBaroness Hooper:default 
defaultThis is being broadcast.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYes it is
default, 
defaultof course.  However, they might suggest, “She says, ‘Shove them all abroad’ or, ‘Migrate from the Isle of Skye to the 
defaultIsle of Wight
default’”
default.
default 
default However, w
defaulthat is the view?  
defaultLindsey Lewisdefault: As you rightly say, there are two aspects to this.  There is one about moving within the 
defaultUK
default and one about moving within the EU.  In the 
defaultUK
default, we do already 
defaultencourage 
defaultjobseekers to search for work beyond their immediate location.  
defaultJ
defaultobseeker’s allowance
default claimants are expected to search for work within 90 minutes’ travel distance from their home unless they have a specific issue like caring 
defaultresponsibilities
default or a physical or mental condition.  Jobcentre
default&#xa0;
defaultPlus 
defaultadvisers
default can also provide jobseekers with support to cover the costs of
default attending
default interviews within the 
defaultUK
default.  There is support and encouragement for moving around.
defaultAs regards the EU, t
defaulthe 
defaultUK
default supports the principle of free movement of workers within the EU
default. H
defaultowever, we need to be careful that we do not end up shifting unemployment around 
defaultEurope
default.  We want to attract the brightest and best to the 
defaultUK
default and we want to use EU workers to fill short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm skills gaps in shortage professions while we train 
defaultUK
default workers to take 
defaultup 
defaultthose positions
default.
defaultW
defaulthere there is high demand for labour
default but it cannot be filled locally, e
defaultncouraging migration can be helpful
default. 
defaultGermany
default would be a good example.  
defaultIt has 
defaultlabour shortages and 
defaultit is 
defaultencouraging migration from 
defaultmember state
defaults with high unemployment, like 
defaultSpain
default.  That could be helpful.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I had a couple of characteristics to mention about the diversity of individuals and jobs as well.  The first thing is that, within the 
defaultUK
default, it tends to be that the people who are workless are in the same place as where there are jobs.  For example, in 
defaultLondon
default there are 5
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion jobs, but there are only around 3.9
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion Londoners in work.  The rest are taken by commuters, basically.  There are opportunities for people who are there.  A similar example is 
defaultMiddlesbrough
default. 
defaultI do not know whether it is a town or a city.
defaultThe Chairman:default It is a city, I am sure.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I am sorry.  It is a city that has a major problem, but there are actually more jobs in Middlesbrough than there are people from 
defaultMiddlesbrough
default who are in jobs.  The reason I emphasise this is that there are opportunities
default.
defaultMoving a bit more broadly to the overall situation, the employment rates of migrants within the EU ha
defaultve 
defaultmoved to be higher than for the domestic group
defaults
default.  That is true whether it is for Polish people coming over here or British people in 
defaultSpain
default.  If there is a theme for what I am saying, it is that because there are these vacancies, if you can match the people with the vacancies you get very surprising results
default.
defaultThere is a very diverse situation with higher levels of employment than you might imagine in southern 
defaultSpain
default among
default British people who have never been close to speaking Spanish
default. A
defaultnd vice versa
default: 
defaultthere is the 
defaultPrêt à Manger
default 
defaultdiscussion
default.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThat is very interesting.  It has been brought to my attention that the OECD report in the writt
defaulten evidence—the Government seem
default to emphasise this quite a lot—suggests there is more updated research available, such as Eurofound, which is the work foundation.  Why have you taken th
defaulte old and probably out 
defaultof
default 
defaultdate research as opposed to this more recent research?
defaultBill Wellsdefault: I have two comments on this.  We mentioned one set of information in the OECD.  They have subsequently done quite a lot of work, including on young people.  We used this as a summary of what we thought was best practice.  Regarding the comparison of Eurofound and the OECD, there tends to be a greater market orientation in 
defaultthe 
defaultanalysis within OECD than there is within Eurofound.  It is not that we do not take information from 
defaultall
default these 
defaultelements
default; it is more that we can recognise some of the features of the policies and institutions in the UK in some of the OECD analysis more than we ca
defaultn in Eurofound’s, for example. 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultI 
defaultwonder
default whether it would be worthwhile having a second look at that.
defaultBill Wellsdefault: Yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultDo not spend much time doing it, but if you could
default,
default let us know.  I am a bit concerned 
defaultnow 
defaultthat this has come into my brain.
defaultFinally, I always ask our witnesses, if you were in my position, what questions would you have asked that I have not asked and how would you answer them?  I do not suggest that you should give me the answer straight
default 
defaultaway, but again on the basis that we have found this session very interesting and most informative
default—
defaultwe want to take the most we can from you, and there might be glaring 
defaultholes
default that we have not actually covered
default—
defaultif you could think about that and write to us, we would be delighted.
defaultBaroness Hooper:default defaultThis may be one of those holes.  A
defaultt the outset, 
defaultAngus
default&#xa0;
defaultGray said he was speaking for
default 
defaultEngland
default, as it were.  On the background information, it says “
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultGibraltar
default”.  Given that I have a debate coming up on economic development 
defaulti
defaultn the overseas territories later this week, I would be very interested to know if any of this applies to 
defaultGibraltar
default, please.
defaultAngus Graydefault: Do you want me to answer now?
defaultBaroness Hooper:default 
defaultYes
default,
default 
defaultbecause the debate is this week.
defaultAngus Graydefault: The current ESF 
defaultoperational 
defaultprogramme, which I am responsible for, is 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultGibraltar
default.  As you are probably more aware than I am, 
defaultGibraltar
default i
defaults a fairly unique place.  While
default they run their own ERDF programme, we subcontract the ESF
default programme
default to them.  That is not 
defaultquite 
defaultthe right language, but 
defaultthat is kind of
default the relationship.  I have encouraged them to take fuller ownership of the ESF for next time.  It is clearly some extra work for them and a bit less work for me, but that has not been the main driver.  The opportunity to integrate what they are doing on ERDF with what they do on ESF is an opportunity I am encouraging them to take.
defaultBaroness Hooper:default 
defaultThey are not exactly a high unemployment area in any event, but there could be youth issues that could apply.
defaultAngus Graydefault: Indeed, yes.  The good news is that because it is such a small 
defaultcommunity
default, they tend to know the young people who are out of work
default,
default and they know which ones who are out of work because their parents are too generous and those out of work because they need help.
defaultThe Chairman:default defaultThat is a new category, is it not?  On that happy note, I am sure I speak for all the Committee when I thank you all very much indeed.  It has been a most helpful session, but we would like further information from you
default, 
defaultif you have it.  Thank you very much.
