[normal]Q1 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] [bold]Good afternoon
[normal],
[normal] w
[normal]elcome
[normal],
[normal] and thank you for coming.  Thank you for your written submissions.  As you will probably appreciate, we have a huge amount of written 
[normal]material
[normal] already, but I can assure you that yours ha
[normal]s
[normal] all been read.
[normal] 
[normal]The session will last for approximately 60 minutes and, before I engage with you, I need to say that Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare them.  The session is on the record and is being webcast live
[normal],
[normal] and will be subsequently accessible via the 
[normal]p
[normal]arliamentary website.  The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and to correct.  This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the 
[normal]p
[normal]arliamentary website.
[normal] 
[normal]If you feel that after this session there
[normal] i
[normal]s something else you would like to add, please feel free t
[normal]o get in touch with the clerk. 
[normal]Thank you very much for your written submissions.  I would now like to ask you, if you could, to begin by stating your names and official titles for the record and, if you wish, as we would like you to, by each making an opening statement.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: I am Angus Gray and I am 
[normal]h
[normal]ead of the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fund 
[normal]D
[normal]ivision, part of the Department for Work and Pensions.  
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I am Bill Wells; I head 
[normal]the 
[normal]labour 
[normal]market
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]analysis branch 
[normal]in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.  
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: Hello, my name is Lindsey
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lewis. My title is Europe
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2020 Programme
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Manager, which means I lead employment and social policy interactions with the EU for the Department for Work and Pensions.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] [bold]Before I ask the first question, do you have an opening statement, Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gray?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: Thank you for this opportunity to make some opening remarks.  I thought it would be helpful to briefly set out the way the 
[normal]Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Initiative 
[normal]will work in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and to set that in the context of our wider efforts to tackle youth 
[normal]un
[normal]employment.
[normal]The primary responsibility for tackling youth unemployment, of course, rests with 
[normal]member state
[normal]s.  The Government already ha
[normal]ve
[normal] a range of help in place, including the 
[normal]Youth Contract
[normal], which provides additional support for young people
[normal],
[normal] worth almost £1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion over three years, providing work experience for all young people who want it, wage incentives, incentives for apprenticeships and additional support for disengaged 16 and 17
[normal] 
[normal]year
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]olds.  
[normal]In addition,
[normal] there is the Work
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Programme, which offers tailored support for young people who have been claiming 
[normal]j
[normal]obseeker’s
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a
[normal]llowance 
[normal]for more than nine months.  We are also using some of the current ESF allocation in 
[normal]England
[normal] on young people who are not in employment, education or training.
[normal]We estimate that the UK share of the 
[normal]€3
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Initiative will be worth €194
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million, which will be shared between the five regions in the UK 
[normal]that
[normal] have a youth
[normal] 
[normal]unemployment rate of 25% or higher.  In 
[normal]England
[normal], those regions are inner 
[normal]London
[normal], Merseyside, 
[normal]Tees
[normal] 
[normal]Valley
[normal] and 
[normal]Durham
[normal], and the 
[normal]West Midlands
[normal].  South
[normal]-
[normal]west 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] is also expected to qualify.  The money needs to be spent by 2018.  The €194
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million equates to just less than €40
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million 
[normal]a
[normal] year.
[normal]  
[normal]The money therefore makes an important contribution to our efforts to tackle y
[normal]outh unemployment, but it is dwarfed by the scale of our other existing investments.  
[normal]The Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Initiative has been added to the 
[normal]EU’s 
[normal]ESF r
[normal]egulation
[normal],
[normal] and so it will be integrated into the 
[normal]ESF 
[normal]operational programme for 
[normal]England
[normal].  As with ESF overall, it is for 
[normal]member state
[normal]s to decide how to spend the money.
[normal]  
[normal]That will include the Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Initiative, but operational programmes need to be
[normal] 
[normal]negotiated and then agreed with the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Commission.  The main thing they will be looking for is 
[normal]an assurance
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]there is a clear rationale for our proposal, based on the evidence.  Proposals need to reflect the differen
[normal]t position
[normal] in each 
[normal]member state
[normal]: the level of unemployment, delivery systems and the coverage of existing provision.
[normal]I should perhaps have clarified at the beginning that I am responsible for ESF in 
[normal]England
[normal] only, because the structural funds are a devolved matter.  In 
[normal]England
[normal], the 
[normal]local
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]enterprise
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]partnerships
[normal], of which there are 39, have been asked to develop strategies for how the funds should be spent.  That includes the ESF, the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]regional
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]development
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]fund and 
[normal]part of the European 
[normal]agricultural fund for rural developme
[normal]nt.  There are seven of these LEPs affected by the Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Initiative
[normal],
[normal] so they have built proposals for how to spend that money into their overall approach to the structural funds.  They have been consulting local partners over the summer about their plans
[normal],
[normal] and they submitted their draft strategies to us on 7
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]October.  We are now working with them to ensure 
[normal]that 
[normal]their proposals add value to what already exists.  We are hoping to see some interesting and creative approaches to tackling this important problem.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] [bold]Mr Wells?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]:
[normal] That was the only opening statement.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] [bold]And likewise?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]:
[normal] Likewise.
[normal]Q2 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] O
[normal]ne thing strikes me.  When you started off, you mentioned 
[normal]€184
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million out of €3
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion
[normal]. H
[normal]ow is that sorted out?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: It is based on the analysis of which regions in the EU have youth unemployment of 25% or more.  There will obviously be countries with much higher levels.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] [bold]What is the Gover
[normal]nment’s position with regard to youth unemployment in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]?  What is the role of the devolved 
[normal]A
[normal]dministrations in tackling the issue?  You did relate to that up to a point.  Who would like to answer that question?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: If I may, Chairman, I will start to answer and then I will ask my colleague Bill to follow.  While youth unemployment in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] is significantly lower than much of the rest of the EU, 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government believe that
[normal] this is still a significant issue that needs to be tackled.  Around 9% of 
[normal]16
[normal] to 
[normal]24 
[normal]year
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]olds are unemployed and not in full
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time education; we think this is too high.
[normal]  This is why the Government have
[normal] implemented a range of policies to address this: those that Angus touched on, the Youth Contract
[normal],
[normal] and the Work Programme in particular.  
[normal]We are also reforming apprenticeships to create more opportunities for training via that route.  Our aim is to make our apprenticeship programme the new international benchmark for excellence.  We are seeing success.  For example, the number of 
[normal]16 to 24 year-old
[normal]s who are not employed or in full
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time education fell by 7,000 in the last quarter and has fallen by 65,000 since the recent peak about two years ago.  I will ask my colleague Bill whether he wants to add anything.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: It is quite important to distinguish between unemployment and other forms of worklessness.  Perhaps the best division is between those on 
[normal]jobseeker’s allowance
[normal], those on other benefits and those not on any other benefits.  In general, the story is that those on JSA are improving; those on other benefits—primarily lone parent and disability benefits—are at roughly the same level they were 
[normal]at 
[normal]before the recession.  The major problem tends to be 
[normal]people 
[normal]who are not on benefits and who are making the transition from education to work.  In our evidence, this is on chart
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.  These people have not 
[normal]yet 
[normal]moved
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Yes
[normal], they have 
[normal]moved f
[normal]rom one to the other.  
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: It is important to realise that quite a lot of these people are not on benefits and are quite difficult to get hold of to help.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Why are they not on benefits?  It cannot be that they do not know benefits are available.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: This is because it is 
[normal]16 to 24 year-old
[normal]s: 16 and 17
[normal] 
[normal]year
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]olds are not eligible for benefits.  Also, sometimes it takes a long time either to move into education or employment
[normal],
[normal] or to get involved in the benefits system.  That applies equall
[normal]y to people leaving university.
[normal]Over the last decade or so, it is taking longer for people who are leaving all forms of education to move into work.  In general, the story regarding the other two aspects that I mentioned—
[normal]jobseeker’s allowance
[normal] and other benefits—is very good compared 
[normal]with
[normal] the mass unemployment of the 1980s
[normal],
[normal] and as Lindsey said, for those on unemployment benefits there is now an improvement for those aged 18
[normal] to 
[normal]24.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Could I ask a final question on that?  Have you done any work that gives you good evidence of how long it takes for somebody who, say, leaves school to actually 
[normal]get
[normal] a benefit?  I ask 
[normal]because 
[normal]there are an awful lot of scare stories in local newspapers at the moment.  The statement was made to me only yesterday that it takes 15
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]weeks for somebody to get a benefit.  If they are not living with their parents and have left school, this is really quite serious.  Do you have any idea about this?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: The people from the DWP might want to add something to this, but there is a distinction between whether you are applying and then how long it takes you, once you have applied for it, to get the benefit.  The problem lies in 
[normal]the 
[normal]first of those, not the second, because Jobcentre
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus has targets for how quickly the benefits are paid.  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Could you actually tell us what the targets are, once someone has registered?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: I am afraid I have not come—
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]If you have any solid evidence on that, we would be grateful.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: No, we will have.  Certainly, when I was working more closely with Jobcentre
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus, we published data regularly on those clearance times.  As Bill says, as well as the potential gap before someone realises there is help available and they claim, in the processing part of the organisation we also face the problem that people need time to respond when we ask for additional information.  Sometimes the delay is because they did not provide the evidence we asked for in the first place.  The delay quite often starts there.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: 
[normal]Fifteen 
[normal]weeks sounds like an awfully long time to clear the benefit.  I would be very surprised if the evidence suggested it was anything like that.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]The problem with 
[normal]something like 
[normal]this is 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is always the rogue one that gets noticed; I do understand that.
[normal]  [bold]The question also asked what the role of the devolved 
[normal]A
[normal]dministrations is in tackling the issue
[normal].  Is it different from the way it is tackled in 
[normal]England
[normal]?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: Employment policy is not devolved
[normal],
[normal] except in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal].  
[normal]Northern
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ireland
[normal] tends to take a mirrored position to 
[normal]Great
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Britain
[normal].  However, related issues such as 
[normal]training, skills and education are devolved issues.  All the devolved authorities can choose how they approach those important issues.
[normal]Q3 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] [bold]Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Wells told us about splitting up unemployed young people into three: people on 
[normal]jobseeker’s allowance
[normal], people on other benefits and people on no benefits.  Is there any further disaggregation necessary of the different types of young people and their different needs, so we can ensure the effectiveness of the policies?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: Again, I probably have to distinguish between those on benefits and those not on benefits.  The focus of the work on people on benefits is individual
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]based; it is not based on their characteristics.  When they come in, there is a discussion with their advis
[normal]e
[normal]r, if it is Jobcentre
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus, as to the most effective way to get them into work.  There is a jobseeker’s agreement, which will take account of individual characteristics: for example, whether a lone parent 
[normal]needs
[normal] to have a certain work pattern.  However, the general policy of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] in this area is to focus on the individual and not to identify particular groups and treat 
[normal]them
[normal] as homogenous groups.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] [bold]On the question of disaggregation, when we get the figures quoted they usually include full
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time students.  You carefully disaggregated the full
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time students.  How many full
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time students are there?  What is the real figure?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I am not sure 
[normal]that 
[normal]I should say this is the real figure, but there are about 950,000 people on ILO unemployment and about 300,000 of those are in full
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time education.  The improvement in ILO unemployment, although not substantia
[normal]l, has been greater than among
[normal] the ILO unemployed who are in full
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time education.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] [bold]Do you disaggregate the people as to their capabilities: for instance, into higher skills levels or higher academic levels?  Do you judge people and say, “He does not have much potential” or
[normal] 
[normal]“She does not have much potential”?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I will let my DWP colleagues talk about this a little.  It differs in different parts of the system.  If you 
[normal]are going in
[normal]to the Department for Work and Pensions, the disaggregation is based on the most effective way of getting them into work.  If you go through the education system, it is based on the best way to get them into education or the best way to get them into training.  From an employment perspective, which tends to be my background, the distinction is based on the most effective way of getting people into work.
[normal] 
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: That is absolutely right: there is this individual diagnosis.  You would tend to give advice based on all sorts of things: ability, but also aspiration and motivation.  Often, the problem with young people is getting them 
[normal]focused
[normal] and interested.  At the beginning of entering the labour market, finding something that interests them and that they are capable of is as important as anything.
[normal]On your disaggregation point, the only thing I would add is that there is a bit of bias in the system around age.  There is a bias towards education and skills the younger they are in this group
[normal],
[normal] and there is a growing bias towards work as they get older.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] There is a big focus on NEETs. H
[normal]ow useful is it as a category?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: It is slightly unfortunate that everybody collapses
[normal] it
[normal] into the word “NEETs”, because it is actually “not in education, employment or training”
[normal],
[normal] and so, for example, someone who leaves university and might be waiting to take up a job is included in the NEET figures.  This is a nightmare
[normal], given 
[normal]the different definitions in this area.
[normal]There are two definitions I would distinguish between, which might be helpful: one is unemployment, where people are looking for work; the other one is what I call economic inactivity, which is where someone is outside the labour market and not looking for work.  The workless include both those groups.  The problem tends to be, as I 
[normal]intimated
[normal] before, among
[normal] the people who are not looking for work and not looking for education either.  It is the workless people who are regarded in the labour
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]market statistics as not looking for work, where the structural problem in youth worklessness
[normal], 
[normal]as I would call it
[normal], 
[normal]has grown over time.  If you do not look for work, you will not get a job.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: Bill’s analysis of the numbers is absolutely right.  However, you can look beyond the numbers at some of the people we worry about.  This is my own word association, but when I think about NEETs I think about some of the most disadvantaged young people.  At the 
[normal]younger ages, you
[normal] might think of persistent truants and people who have chaotic lifestyles at home.  You need to find them first, but the focus on them is absolutely crucial, because we are trying to avoid them losing
[normal]—
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]T
[normal]he ability to work.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]:
[normal] Yes.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: To pick that up, part of the story is that there is a greater focus within the system on the most disadvantaged people.  One of those elements is how long they have been in that situation.  The long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term unemployed would receive more direct help from Jobcentre
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus, whereas the expectation is that you get the short
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term unemployed to look for work effectively and most of them will find that job within not very long at all.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] A lot of these people come from homes where people have never worked; there is no tradition of working.  There is 
[normal]more 
[normal]a tradition of, “Well, we will just g
[normal]et
[normal] by
[normal]. T
[normal]here is
[normal] nothing 
[normal]we are skilled for”
[normal]— 
[normal]depression really
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Is that true?  We hear a lot of stories about that.  Again, this could just be anecdotal.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: It is overstated.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Is it?  I see.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: It may be that the numbers do not tell the whole story, but if you look at the stories about two or three generations where nobody has worked, from what we can tell the numbers are quite small.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Do you have any actual evidence of that or numbers you could quote us?  It would be great if we could actually make that point in our final report.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: Yes, we do.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Do not worry about it now, but we would be grateful if you could send it to us.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: Yes, of course.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: My understanding is that Bill is absolutely right, but you do get families and communities and where there is very little work.  Never having worked is quite a high bar.  You might have done the odd week or two
[normal],
[normal] and then you are not in the “never worked” category.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: 
[normal]T
[normal]he concentration of worklessness 
[normal]may be 
[normal]an issue, rather than the history of worklessness.
[normal]Q4 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] To what extent is the Government’s position on youth unemployment influenced by EU policy?  How are EU actions to tackle youth unemployment generally being interpreted and delivered in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: 
[normal]My 
[normal]Lord Chairman, employment policy remains a 
[normal]member state
[normal] competence, but we do value the opportunity given by the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]s
[normal]emester to share experiences with other 
[normal]member state
[normal]s.  For example, we are sending a 
[normal]UK
[normal] official to a mutual
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]learning event in the 
[normal]Netherlands
[normal] in November and we are holding a mutual
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]learning event here on the minimum wage in April next year.  We will take part in multilateral surveillance, as part of the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]s
[normal]emester process, where we will be challenge
[normal]d
[normal] on our performance in this area and we have the opportunity to challenge others.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It is a useful function, is it not?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: I believe so, yes.
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] When this deputation goes, are they going with 
[normal]UK
[normal] policy on the unemployed?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: The people who are going are policy officials, who are responsible for developing our policy.  It should inform policy development going forward.
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] What 
[normal]is the backup from 
[normal]that?  Where does it go after that, when they get back from 
[normal]Holland
[normal]?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: It informs the policy process.  It is an opportunity to learn about a number of other countries’ policies and the way things work in their systems and to feed that into policy development in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  There is no formal product, but it then becomes part of our knowledge base and our understanding.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: There is an important point about how most different countries have different systems.  Therefore, it is not a case of, say, going to the 
[normal]Netherlands
[normal],
[normal] seeing the system and importing it wholesale over here.  The good ideas of things that seem to work are purloined by us and put alongside ours to see whether we could develop the policy in ways that suit the 
[normal]UK
[normal] system.  Particularly in the employment field, the labour markets tend to be quite different in many of the 
[normal]member state
[normal]s.
[normal]Q5 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] What I was going to ask follows on from that and
[normal] from what 
[normal]Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gray said at the beginning about the EU’s Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Initiative, which has the rather odd acronym of YEI.  How does that tie in with our own policies?  Let us divide it up, if you would, into the 
[normal]youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]guarantee 
[normal]scheme, European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]alliance for apprenticeships and the quality framework for traineeship
[normal]s.  Taking that last one, I notice that the paper from
[normal] the
[normal] Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which I thought was very good, said about traineeship
[normal]s
[normal] that if some of the Commission’s proposals were taken into account it would not 
[normal]actually 
[normal]produc
[normal]e
[normal] the right sort of answers; it would do exactly the opposite.  Could you deal with these three different categories?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: To start with the overall bit about the YEI, the good news is that it is an additional source of funding, rather than a set of activities.  Because it fits within the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fund framework more generally, it is for 
[normal]member state
[normal]s to 
[normal]design
[normal] what they are going to do with the allocation.  That very much leaves us free to design interventions 
[normal]that
[normal] we think are appropriate for our context.  However, probably most importantly in 
[normal]England
[normal], the challenge for the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fund is always to add value to what already exists.  In some of the EU 
[normal]member state
[normal]s, the structural
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]funds investment is either the only thing or by far the biggest thing that happens in their country on these topics, whereas we already have substantial investment of all sorts.  Therefore, what you need to do is make sure ESF is filling the gaps.
[normal]We have seen this with some of the strategies that have come back
[normal]. O
[normal]ften, one of the things ESF can helpfully be used for is preparing people so they are ready for other mainstream provision
[normal], 
[normal]if that makes sense.  If they are some of the most disadvantaged, finding and equipping them so they are more likely to benefit from a traineeship or an apprenticeship is one of the key added
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]value actions we can take.  In that respect, the YEI is not a separate 
[normal]EU
[normal] policy that we have to worry about
[normal]. I
[normal]t is largely a source of money, with which we can do something sensible.
[normal]We do have more reservations about the Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Guarantee, not in its aspiration that you need to help young people with a range of different offers, but more in the insistence that it should be done at the four
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]month period.  As Bill was saying, particularly for those on 
[normal]jobseeker’s allowance
[normal], people already find work quickly.  Over 80% of 18
[normal] to 
[normal]24
[normal] 
[normal]year
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]olds flow off 
[normal]jobseeker’s allowance
[normal] within six months.  If you put that kind of mandatory blanket provision in place
[normal] 
[normal]at
[normal] four months, you will actually slow that down and hold people back from entering work when they would have done otherwise.  It is a cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]effectiveness issue
[normal],
[normal] and the dispute hinges aro
[normal]und that four
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]month threshold.
[normal]We have succeeded
[normal], 
[normal]at least in our reading of the 
[normal]r
[normal]egulation
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in making the 
[normal]r
[normal]egulation more flexible on this point.  The release of the money is not tied to the implementation of a Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Guarantee scheme; it is one of the things you can do with it.  There is a clause in the 
[normal]regulation
[normal] now that talk
[normal]s
[normal] about including the Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Guarantee scheme.  
[normal]Clearly
[normal], that only applie
[normal]s
[normal] where regions and countries are implementing one.
[normal]On traineeships and apprenticeships, we are very much behind the principle of the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alliance for
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Apprenticeships.  It is about sharing good practice between countries.  As ever, we are slightly sceptical about mechanisms and bureaucracy and whether you need an alliance as such to deliver that, but learning from each other seems a perfectly sensible thing to us.  If other 
[normal]member state
[normal]s want an alliance to share it, that is fine.  We are still partly reserving 
[normal]judgment
[normal] on 
[normal]the 
[normal]Quality Framework for Traineeships.  Traineeships are something we have started to introduce in 
[normal]England
[normal] as of August this year; we are relatively new to them.  The focus is really about taking people who are not quite ready for apprenticeships and giving them that first intervention to help them take advantage of further help in due course.
[normal]Q6 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] On the traineeships, you are 
[normal]“
[normal]waiting to see
[normal]”
[normal], 
[normal]more than 
[normal]“
[normal]already feeling
[normal]”
[normal].  It is rather implied by the paper that there are some points in this it would not be sensible for us to apply.  I get the feeling that it is too rigid.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: Yes.  There was a sense that the definition they are using is much broader than 
[normal]what we would term a
[normal] traineeship.  We are not quite sure whether it is helpful or not.
[normal]Earl of [bold]Liverpool[bold]:[bold] [bold]On th
[normal]e
[normal] point you have made, 
[normal]page 27 of the 
[normal]paper you are referring to says, rather strikingly, “As a result, there is a potential for such a measure to exacerbate youth employment rather than reduce it”
[normal].
[normal]  That is in paragraph
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]98.  It is quite a striking statement and I wonder 
[normal]whether 
[normal]you could enlarge upon it somewhat.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I would link this with the four
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]month 
[normal]issue
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Essentially, there is what works and also what you tell people to do.  However, in general, the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s 
[normal]approach 
[normal]is to have a rights 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]responsibilities agenda, which is about ensurin
[normal]g that the individual themselves tries 
[normal]to take up a job and trie
[normal]s
[normal] to move into education.  There are some sanctions associated with that.  Rather than that, if you pick someone up and put them into something that does not suit them, it may retard their improvement.
[normal]It comes back a bit to the focus on the individual and the help and pressure that is applied
[normal]: 
[normal]that they go for something that suits them, rather than something that is specified 
[normal]on a blackboard
[normal].
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: There is another point here, which you see played out in other policy debates: one man’s quality threshold is another man’s rigidity.  We are worried that the attempt to impose a quality threshold on traineeships means that the bar is set so high it would be 
[normal]to
[normal]o difficult to get employers involved in offering anything.  This is what we are getting at here: if you are not careful in your definition, you preclude all sorts of really valuable activities.
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] 
[normal]In terms of 
[normal]devolved Administration
[normal]s, you mentioned having to negotiate how 
[normal]the 
[normal]money is going to be spent with the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Commission.  First of all, how does that work in general?  Secondly, how does it work when it is a 
[normal]devolved Administration
[normal]?  South
[normal]-
[normal]west
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scotland
[normal] would be the only area in question.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: We have layers of agreement with the Commission.  There is a partnership agreement, which is at a 
[normal]member state
[normal] level.  We
[normal] have to make a proposal and get i
[normal]t agreed and negotiated with the Commission; that covers the whole of the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  Our approach there is to set out an overarching 
[normal]UK
[normal] narrative about what we think the issues are and what we need to do.  There are then chapters for each of the 
[normal]devolved Administration
[normal]s going into more detail
[normal].
[normal]You are right: we are trea
[normal]ding a line at the moment between the 
[normal]member state being
[normal] the whole of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and some of these issues being 
[normal]devolved.  In that document, we try
[normal] to
[normal] do that.  Beneath that are things called operational programmes
[normal],
[normal] and they are at the level of the 
[normal]devolved Administration
[normal].  The European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fund operational programme will be for 
[normal]England
[normal] only and there will be a separate one for 
[normal]Scotland
[normal].  The detail of how they will use the Youth
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Initiative will be set out in their operational programme, which is for them to design.  They separately negotiate that with the Commission.
[normal]This will be my first attempt at this
[normal];
[normal] I am not clear what the negotiation will actually look like.  We will propose it on paper and they will tell us the things they do not like.  My understanding is the hard conversation will be about target levels, as you might expect.
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] 
[normal]You mentioned a hard conversation.  Is it very time consuming?  Is it like going to an old
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]fashioned bank manager
[normal] who says, “No, y
[normal]ou are not going
[normal] to get the money, sorry
[normal].
[normal]”?
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]He is too young to know about bank managers.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: I have heard of them.  My sense is 
[normal]that 
[normal]nothing is absolutely speedy in dealings with the Commission, but it is not supposed to be a lengthy, drawn
[normal] 
[normal]out process and, indeed, they are committed to getting it done maybe quicker this time than we have managed in the past, because the tripartite negotiations over the regulations have taken time
[normal]. W
[normal]e are now in October with no regulations agreed
[normal],
[normal] with a January start date.  We will need to be swift in our discussions.
[normal]Q7 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] 
[normal]Rather than the memory of bank managers, I wish to talk about traineeships very quickly.  They are what we used to call sandwich courses, but you are too young 
[normal]to know 
[normal]that.  I would like to know how keen employers are on these various schemes.  How keen are employers on having traineeships and putting effort into it?  Of course, without the 
[normal]co-operat
[normal]ion of the employers, it is all a bit of a waste of time.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: Precisely, yes.  I do not know about these precise schemes; they are relatively new.  We only launched them in August this year, so we probably do not have any feedback on this particular scheme, but my experience of working with employers in Jobcentre
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus was always that the trick was to speak their language
[normal].
[normal]If you go with a pre
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]prepared product that is traditionally bureaucratic and full of detail and requirements, they will push back
[normal]. H
[normal]owever, for their own economic growth and business, they need good people
[normal], 
[normal]and they need to take advantage of young people.  It seems to me, therefore, that our task in 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment is to design things that work for th
[normal]em and work of the individual.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: The focus on 
[normal]the 
[normal]individual is partly that th
[normal]e individual gets to the job or 
[normal]traineeship that suits them.  If it does not suit them, the employer will not 
[normal]fancy them a lot
[normal],
[normal] because you have two sets of people who are not happy with the arrangement.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] [bold]Presumably, it is a way of employers assessing the abilities of somebody.  Then they can decide whether or not to employ them.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: It is one of the benefits of that.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]This has been a very useful discussion.  Can I just track back for about 30 seconds to the four months versus the six months?  This has been a bone of contention for a long time.  
[normal]It was 
[normal]I think 
[normal]the Netherlands that said at a conference I at
[normal]tended
[normal] that it is only a month or 
[normal]even 
[normal]a week in 
[normal]their 
[normal]experience.
[normal]  Do you have any evidence to give us about the 28 
[normal]member state
[normal]s and what the comparable figures are?  Is it that we are taking much longer than anybody else
[normal],
[normal] or is it that the Commission 
[normal]does not realise
[normal] the reality of the situation, which is that it is nearer to six months than four months?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: We will have some evidence across the EU, but this is one area where the particular situation in 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK
[normal] is quite important because, as Angus said, particularly on JSA the outflow rates are so large in the first year that it really is a waste of money 
[normal]parking 
[normal]someone who could be getting a job.  Having been involved in this discussion for a number of years, it is really the focus on the individual.  We have resisted the four
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]month period; in fact, we have resisted most of the very short periods.  Part of the reason why people do it sooner rather than later is that they sometimes lose the young person, because they are not eligible for the benefit and therefore, when they leave school and go wherever they go into, they say, “Let us get them before they get lost
[normal]”.
[normal]  This is only one of the very many different systems across the EU
[normal], and
[normal] one size does not fit all.
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That point obviously needs making, however.
[normal]Q8 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Earl of [bold]Liverpool[bold]:[bold] [bold]We had an interesting discussion about NEETs earlier, but I wonder if I may come back to them for this question.  The EU and 
[normal]UK
[normal] youth
[normal] 
[normal]unemployment policies place great emphasis on young people not in employment
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]education
[normal] or training.  Is this emphasis justified or are there good arguments for steering greater support towards 
[normal]more 
[normal]employable young people, given that they might have a faster and more sustainable impact on overall youth unemployment?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I have touched on this a bit before, in the sense that it is important to realise that 
[normal]NEETs
[normal] are not exactly the most disadvantaged or the most “unemployable”.  They are a range of different people
[normal].
[normal]In general
[normal], the 
[normal]UK
[normal] policy is not to help those who need the least help; it is to help those who need the most help.  Most of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] system is about pointing people
[normal] in the right direction and 
[normal]making sure that they behave properly in terms of their rights and responsibilities.  However, when that does not succeed—it tends to be either on the education side or the employment side—they get
[normal] more
[normal] help from the state.
[normal]One of the things I should say is 
[normal]that 
[normal]our labour market is sufficiently flexible that there are jobs for everybody, in the sense that it is very diverse and dynamic.  It is actually quite difficult to regard someone as unemployable, because the range of jobs in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] is quite great.  Labelling them as unemployable may have damaging consequences as well.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Do you not think somebody should take that up from a political point of view or at least advertise that everybody can do a job and everybody can get the enjoyment from a job?  There are so many different varieties of job.  
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: 
[normal]Angus might need to finish it
[normal].
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: In the words 
[normal]“
[normal]support
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]attention
[normal]”
[normal] or 
[normal]“
[normal]help
[normal]”
[normal] lurks a plethora of offers.  Actually, even for people who are on the more employable end of spectrum, some of the employers I have spoken to think that one of the gaps is good
[normal] 
[normal]quality careers advice at the moment.  This is quite a theme in the plans that are coming forward.  They are saying, “We have some really exciting opportunities coming up over the next few years as we build 
[normal]X
[normal], 
[normal]Y
[normal] and 
[normal]Z
[normal]”.
[normal]  A good example might be the announcement of the nuclear reactor in 
[normal]Somerset
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, we do not have enough kids coming through the 
[normal]school 
[normal]system who think that is a worthwhile outcome.  
[normal]W
[normal]e need to educate the labour force of tomorrow about the opportunities that do exist in this area.  That is not skills help or investment but, as you say, good signposting and good advice to them about what opportunities are coming up and therefore what choices they might make.  It is an important part of the system.
[normal]Q9 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Valentine:[bold] I am trying to join up the dots on some of this.  I am 
[normal]chief
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]executive 
[normal]of London
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]First, which is an employer group, so I understand the 
[normal]London
[normal] dimension of it.  Very roughly, the number of vacancies and unemployed used to be about the same
[normal]. Y
[normal]ou now have 25% youth unemployment in inner 
[normal]London
[normal].  I did not quite get what you were saying, but you are saying that employability skills may not be a big problem across that 25%.  Then you have lots of low
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]skill entry jobs.  You know the old Pr
[normal]ê
[normal]t
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]à
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Manger thing
[normal],
[normal] where people go on hospitality jobs, he
[normal]lping as waiters and waitresses—
[normal]and 
[normal]then you play in immigration as well, obviously, to that
[normal].  However, I cannot quite get 
[normal]what 
[normal]the spectrum of those 25% youth unemployed is
[normal] 
[normal]from what you are saying
[normal].  I can understand 
[normal]that 
[normal]they are all individuals, but what I hear most typically from the employers is 
[normal]that 
[normal]if 
[normal]Hilton advertise
[normal]s
[normal] a job for a waiter, no local British person applies
[normal]. L
[normal]ots of other people apply.  There is something going on there
[normal].
[normal]You also hear that people do not have the employability skills
[normal]. 
[normal]I am sure you are bored of hearing this
[normal]. They 
[normal]do not turn up at nine o
[normal]’
[normal]clock in the morning and they do not have the work ethic.  I then hear these anecdotes that they come from families 
[normal]with 
[normal]three generations 
[normal]who 
[normal]have not been employed and therefore they do not have a culture of working, but you are saying 
[normal]that 
[normal]that is something of a myth.  I cannot make 
[normal]all
[normal] these things join up.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: Can I have a go at a couple of these?  The first thing is that the 25% is not a static group.  It is very important to realise that people move in and out
[normal] of
[normal] jobs quite a lot.  
[normal]A
[normal]bout 
[normal]6 million
[normal] people move into and then out of a job each year.  To some extent, the unfilled vacancies are almost irrelevant, because there is always a range of vacancies available.
[normal]The other element about the flows into work—you mentioned Pr
[normal]ê
[normal]t
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]à
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Manger—is not true.  There are lots of young people moving into jobs.  A lot of the 25% is a sho
[normal]rt period of unemployment while
[normal] they take up the job.
[normal]However, the other feature that is real, which we mentioned, is this point about where you lose people from the system and they are not looking for those jobs.  The numbers that we quote with some g
[normal]lee about the JSA off-
[normal]flows do suggest that most people who get on
[normal] 
[normal]to JSA leave
[normal],
[normal] and leave for a positive outcome
[normal],
[normal] very quickly.  There is not the same success with people 
[normal]who 
[normal]we are not in touch with
[normal],
[normal] and they tend to be people who are not looking for work.  It is important to focus on the flows in this.  There is a set of positive flows, which most young people go through and find jobs across a range of industries
[normal]. T
[normal]here is then a smaller group who we mostly have not 
[normal]got hold of
[normal], who are there for a long period of time.
[normal]Baroness Valentine:[bold] 
[normal]How would you describe the employability skills of that group you are talking about there?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: We do not know, because we cannot 
[normal]get
[normal] them.  From the surveys, they tend to be dominated by people at the lower end of the employability
[normal] 
[normal]skills spectrum
[normal]. H
[normal]owever, they are not all in that group.  I am less sure about this, but the employability of this group seems to have improved over time.  It is the matching of the individuals to the jobs that is really quite important
[normal], 
[normal]if we are going to concentrate on jobs.  There are similar issues around moving into education and training.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: One of the risks here is that the generalisation of the diagnosis could lead to a generalisation about the solution for the individual.  It is one of the things we are always weighing up.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That is life, though, is it not?  We all do that.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: 
[normal]W
[normal]hat you do not want to do is say, “Everyone has to be at this level before we even allow them to think about 
[normal]going into 
[normal]work
[normal]”.
[normal]  As Bill says, there are all sorts of vacancies.  Equally, I am 
[normal]pretty 
[normal]sure 
[normal]that 
[normal]my classics degree made me less employable.  
[normal] 
[normal]The definitions are key.
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] 
[normal]I have 
[normal]a wee little
[normal] point.  I was very pleased to hear you mention careers advice and guidance
[normal] 
[normal]yourself.  N
[normal]ot to diverge
[normal] too long by talking about it now
[normal], on the other hand
[normal] it comes through very strongly indeed from employers
[normal].  I
[normal]t also comes through very strongly in a lot of the written evidence 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have rec
[normal]eived from all sorts of sources. I
[normal]t comes through very strongly indeed from 
[normal]p
[normal]arliamentarians
[normal],
[normal] and I do not think 
[normal]that 
[normal]the Government as such
[normal], 
[normal]without being too specific
[normal], 
[normal]are prepared to address that issue.  I hope officials will be pushing in that direction.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That is a very good point.  Thank you, Lord
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cotter.
[normal]Q10 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] There are only certain 
[normal]UK
[normal] areas 
[normal]that
[normal] will be eligibl
[normal]e to receive the €6
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion earmarked.  You said at the outset 
[normal]that 
[normal]those are areas where there is unemployment of 25% or more.  If I may be permitted a little personal reminiscence, when the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fund was introduced in the earl
[normal]y
[normal] 1980s, I was a 
[normal]Member of the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Parliament for 
[normal]Liverpool
[normal].  In Liverpool there was need, but in 
[normal]Liverpool
[normal] there was also a very well advanced group of civil society representatives.  With help, encouragement and information from me, in that first year we received more in social funding in Liverpool than anywhere else in the 
[normal]United
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Kingdom
[normal].  My question now is this: what work is being done, and by whom, to prepare and deliver projects that will help with the youth unemployment and be able to tap into this earmarked funding for the 2014
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]16 period?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: This is very much a joint enterprise.  As I said in my opening remarks, we have 
[normal]set local
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]enterprise
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]partnerships the task of 
[normal]leading on the development of strategies for the structural funds in those areas.  If, like Merseyside, they are one of the YEI areas, that will include this element, recognising where their skills lie, w
[normal]hich is principally in employer 
[normal]led conversations about growth.  We have also made clear that they need to develop new strategies in partnership with others.  You have mentioned civil society
[normal]. T
[normal]hat is one of the key groups they need to consult and involve, but there are many others, too.
[normal]We are currently assessing the strategies, but our first pass suggests that they have mostly done a good job on consultation with partners and they can continue to do that.  They are coming up with ideas about how they might use it.  It is fair to say they are in high
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]level embryonic form at the moment, but the common 
[normal]theme was
[normal] careers advice and guidance
[normal], as 
[normal]I have mentioned already.  Because they are business leaders, they have an opportunity to display leadership in their area and work with employers to help young people make that transition from education into work.
[normal]Whether it is people leaving care or people suffering other disadvantages, the other theme is a recognition that more specialised and targeted help for some of those groups might be necessary.  The process we are going through is agreeing those strategies with those areas.  It will then become even more of a joint enterprise between 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment and the area, turning those into more detailed plans that the
[normal]n
[normal] turn into projects and delivery on the ground to target the individuals, areas and themes that they want us to focus the money on.
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] [bold]Are we prepared to take it up as rapidly as the Commission is advocating?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: There are many nights 
[normal]when 
[normal]I wake up in a cold sweat
[normal],
[normal] and that was increased with the notion that YEI had to be frontloaded in the first two years, until my more experienced colleagues reminded me that because of the European rules on spend, the two years is when we have to commit the money, but the 
[normal]n+3
[normal] rule
[normal] 
[normal]means that we do not have to spend it all until 2018.  We have to get our plans in order quickly
[normal]. W
[normal]e have to mobilise the procurement and project sta
[normal]rt
[normal] relatively quickly.  However, we have a total of five years to spend the money
[normal], which is more reassuring 
[normal]and
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I think, 
[normal]perfectly possible.
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] 
[normal]What is the Government’s view on the use of the European
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fund to tackle youth unemployment specifically?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: It has long been a feature of our use of the ESF to focus on young people.  As I said earlier, we use it 
[normal]in 
[normal]that way at the moment.  This is just a strengthening of that focus.  Without the YEI, we would have 
[normal]focused
[normal] a decent proportion 
[normal]of the resources 
[normal]on youth unemployment.  I would be surprised if there were many of the 39 areas that do not have a focus on youth unemployment, given its current level.  In the five areas covered by this, it would simply be an additional focus in order to use the additional funding.  The important thing, as I have said a few times, is that we design interventions that fit with what already exist
[normal]s
[normal].  The notion that we should be helping young people as we emerge from recession must be absolutely right.
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] [bold]L
[normal]ocal enterprise partnerships
[normal] 
[normal]have a really strong focus locally in all 
[normal]areas on 
[normal]the point of view of the business side of things.  How do you 
[normal]feel
[normal] you would specifically work through the 
[normal]local enterprise partnerships 
[normal]to advance the sensible use of the ESF?  They are rather 
[normal]focused
[normal] not on social issues
[normal] but on how businesses are run in the area
[normal]. T
[normal]hey are important 
[normal]from
[normal] that point of view, of course.  How can you use them?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: You are absolutely right.  From the point of view of the ESF, this is genuinely both a threat and an opportunity.  We have stressed tha
[normal]t the LEPs cannot do this alone
[normal] because, as you say, they have a particular focus.  
[normal]All
[normal] the boards are a mixture of business and civic leadership—i.e
[normal].
[normal] local authorities.  Local authorities clearly have a very keen interest in a whole range of social issues, but particularly youth, because they have a key accountability in relation to young people and raising the participation age, so they are engaged.  Even with that
[normal],
[normal] the LEP by itself is necessary but not sufficient
[normal]. T
[normal]hat is always what I say
[normal].
[normal]This is why we have required them to engage with a wider range of partners locally to get ideas about what should be done.  It is also a real opportunity, because although, as Bill says, there are jobs coming up all the time, we also need more growth.  Therefore,
[normal] we 
[normal]would be more likely to engage young people in those upcoming opportunities if we can both drive 
[normal]growth 
[normal]in local areas through these funds and use 
[normal]the 
[normal]ESF to make sure people can take advantage of 
[normal]the 
[normal]opportunities
[normal],
[normal] and make that link between employers and young people
[normal], 
[normal]both encouraging them to make opportunities available
[normal] and
[normal], on the issue of careers guidance
[normal], having
[normal] a powerful story about what jobs will be coming up.
[normal]Q11 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] [bold]Can I pick you up on your words once again?  There is a little window of opportunity there.  You mentioned relating to young people.  Again, this is something 
[normal]that 
[normal]many of us feel very strongly about.  Again, quite a lot of the written evidence 
[normal]that 
[normal]we are getting is talking about what is happening in 
[normal]Europe
[normal] in terms of relating to young people.  Quite a lot is done in that direction.  There is a concern that perhaps—you mention
[normal]ed
[normal] it
[normal], so
[normal] I am picking up on it—there is a great need for young people to be around the table and tell
[normal]ing
[normal] us what they really think about their different areas of experience.  What do you think of that?
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: What we tend to do
[normal], 
[normal]not just with young people
[normal], 
[normal]is engage with representative groups.  There is a slight challenge here if you are thinking about young people who are out of work who you want to help into work.  They disqualify themselves from the organising committee by getting a successful outcome.  I am not sure how you would con
[normal]struct
[normal] that kind of body in such a flexible and dynamic labour market
[normal]. E
[normal]qually, we are open to ideas and thoughts about how to make that work locally, because you need to design services that appeal.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]We are 
[normal]open if
[normal] you have further ideas yourself.  If you do, please let us know.
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] 
[normal]Yes, please do, because it really is such an important issue.  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]It is terribly important.  Certainly, we have discussed this around this table before now.  We cannot ignore these people.  We simply cannot do it.  It is more important that we really get started on that bottom part
[normal] while 
[normal]obviously encouraging 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment.
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] 
[normal]This is such a strong issue.  There was a very good debate on Friday about young people voting at 16.  A lot of issues came out of that.  
[normal]Please
[normal] pick up on that
[normal] and help us.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]It is in 
[normal]Hansard
[normal] for the House
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lords last Friday.  It was Friday, was it not?
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] 
[normal]It was on Friday.
[normal]Q12 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Valentine:[bold] 
[normal]You have already touched on best practice from other EU countries.  I know you have said 
[normal]that 
[normal]you cannot lift and shift things, but are there examples of things that have the germs of ideas that you would like to see how you can implement or in some way plagiarise in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] from the rest of 
[normal]Europe
[normal]?
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: We do not have specific ideas, but 
[normal]Europe
[normal] is a fertile ground to look at what other 
[normal]member state
[normal]s are doing.  In the scheme of thi
[normal]n
[normal]gs, we are actually doing quite well in
[normal] 
[normal]this area.  We have seen lower levels of unemployment
[normal] th
[normal]an following previous recessions
[normal],
[normal] and we are doing better than the European average.
[normal]However, there are European 
[normal]member state
[normal]s that are performing better than us
[normal],
[normal] and some of them are performing
[normal] better
[normal] than us because their economy is doing better, but there are ot
[normal]hers that are performing better
[normal] but have also had a difficult economic time.  One of those examples would be the 
[normal]Netherlands
[normal].  This is partly why we are going to take part in this event in November to try 
[normal]to
[normal] explore 
[normal]a bit more 
[normal]what they are doing and what drives their outcomes.  However, as we said before, the 
[normal]Netherlands
[normal] has a structure that is quite strongly based on sector
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]wide collective
[normal] 
[normal]agreements with employers, which is quite different from our own situation.  How much we can lift directly is not clear, but it should still have some interesting learning 
[normal]opportunities 
[normal]for us.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: As well as that, there are multinational organisations.  In our evidence, we mentioned some of the work that is done by places like the OECD.  For a very long time, they have considered young people
[normal]. H
[normal]owever, they have also considered best practice across the whole of the labour market.  Therefore, we listen to them, partly because they tend to try to evaluate the results and make them generally applicable.  Some of our policies have a strong feeling of some of the reports from the OECD.
[normal]Baroness Valentine:[bold] [bold]Can I follow up on that
[normal]?  
[normal]The OECD sound
[normal]s
[normal] like a very good example.  This is probably a whole set of prejudices all muddled up together, but my sense is that Germany has training much better ingrained into the private sector and has had that philosophy
[normal] 
[normal]for many years, whereas in Britain we passed it all over to the public sector for a couple of decades and it is now trying to come back in again.  I am interested 
[normal]in
[normal], for instance, the German example
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]or
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] the lessons more about the broader context in which one does training, rather than specific examples
[normal]?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: There is a history for this, because our system at one stage look
[normal]ed
[normal] much 
[normal]more 
[normal]like the German system
[normal], albeit 
[normal]quite a long time ago.  You are quite right: it is embedded in both the education system and the labour market.  The transition for a large part of the youth cohort 
[normal]mostly 
[normal]into apprentices is a big feature in 
[normal]Germany
[normal].  It is partly the quality of 
[normal]the 
[normal]apprenticeships, but it is also the links between 
[normal]the 
[normal]education and the apprenticeship and between the apprenticeship and what happens when people leave the apprenticeship
[normal].
[normal]We may not be able to replicate the German system, but the setting up of the wiring and increasing the extent of jobs with training, particularly apprentices, is something we probably ought to aspire to
[normal]. W
[normal]e have not managed it for quite a long time.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]We have not managed it yet.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: We are probably slow to
[normal] give
[normal] credit 
[normal]to 
[normal]where we get 
[normal]our 
[normal]ideas from, but we have been pushing and massively expanding our apprenticeship programme in recent years.  We have introduced the traineeships this year.  It does not say on the bottom of the tin, “Imported from 
[normal]Germany
[normal]”, but it would not surprise me at all if my colleagues were learning what worked from them.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I think we have probably spoken to 
[normal]Germany
[normal] before.
[normal]Baroness Valentine:[bold] 
[normal]I am sure we 
[normal]would 
[normal]have spoken to them
[normal] first and then imported it back
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]However, your 2020 horizon is almost the kind of timeframe in which there might be a cultural shift.  One of the 
[normal]issues
[normal] we were discussing is that this
[normal] is
[normal] not a quick
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]fix problem.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: It is partly always about the dual system: trying to give equal parity to academic and non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]academic routes f
[normal]ro
[normal]m 16.  That is a cultural thing
[normal],
[normal] and through their long history
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]Germany
[normal] they have that cracked.  We do not
[normal], 
[normal]yet.
[normal]Q13 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] T
[normal]his is the final question
[normal]. I
[normal]t will raise a few har
[normal]e
[normal]s, I think.  What is the Government’s view on encouraging the migration of unemployed workers from areas of high unemployment to those of high employment, both within the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and across the EU?  I have to declare an interest.  
[normal]Having been educated in Ireland
[normal], 
[normal]I always say that 
[normal]three times in my lifetime 
[normal]they educated people for the 
[normal]emigrant
[normal] ship, but in fact two of the results were that a much higher skilled labour force came back.  It is in the DNA of the Irish to travel the world
[normal]. I
[normal]t has been since about the fifth century.  However, bear in mind 
[normal]that 
[normal]the p
[normal]eople we are talking about now think nothing about going off to Stansted and having a weekend in 
[normal]Italy
[normal], whereas when I was their age it would never have happened.  I 
[normal]wonder
[normal] whether that comes into your thinking at all
[normal]. D
[normal]o the Government actually think in this way?  I hop
[normal]e there are no reporters here.
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] 
[normal]This is being broadcast.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Yes it is
[normal], 
[normal]of course.  However, they might suggest, “She says, ‘Shove them all abroad’ or, ‘Migrate from the Isle of Skye to the 
[normal]Isle of Wight
[normal]’”
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] However, w
[normal]hat is the view?  
[normal]Lindsey Lewis[bold]: As you rightly say, there are two aspects to this.  There is one about moving within the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and one about moving within the EU.  In the 
[normal]UK
[normal], we do already 
[normal]encourage 
[normal]jobseekers to search for work beyond their immediate location.  
[normal]J
[normal]obseeker’s allowance
[normal] claimants are expected to search for work within 90 minutes’ travel distance from their home unless they have a specific issue like caring 
[normal]responsibilities
[normal] or a physical or mental condition.  Jobcentre
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus 
[normal]advisers
[normal] can also provide jobseekers with support to cover the costs of
[normal] attending
[normal] interviews within the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  There is support and encouragement for moving around.
[normal]As regards the EU, t
[normal]he 
[normal]UK
[normal] supports the principle of free movement of workers within the EU
[normal]. H
[normal]owever, we need to be careful that we do not end up shifting unemployment around 
[normal]Europe
[normal].  We want to attract the brightest and best to the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and we want to use EU workers to fill short
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term skills gaps in shortage professions while we train 
[normal]UK
[normal] workers to take 
[normal]up 
[normal]those positions
[normal].
[normal]W
[normal]here there is high demand for labour
[normal] but it cannot be filled locally, e
[normal]ncouraging migration can be helpful
[normal]. 
[normal]Germany
[normal] would be a good example.  
[normal]It has 
[normal]labour shortages and 
[normal]it is 
[normal]encouraging migration from 
[normal]member state
[normal]s with high unemployment, like 
[normal]Spain
[normal].  That could be helpful.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I had a couple of characteristics to mention about the diversity of individuals and jobs as well.  The first thing is that, within the 
[normal]UK
[normal], it tends to be that the people who are workless are in the same place as where there are jobs.  For example, in 
[normal]London
[normal] there are 5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million jobs, but there are only around 3.9
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million Londoners in work.  The rest are taken by commuters, basically.  There are opportunities for people who are there.  A similar example is 
[normal]Middlesbrough
[normal]. 
[normal]I do not know whether it is a town or a city.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It is a city, I am sure.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I am sorry.  It is a city that has a major problem, but there are actually more jobs in Middlesbrough than there are people from 
[normal]Middlesbrough
[normal] who are in jobs.  The reason I emphasise this is that there are opportunities
[normal].
[normal]Moving a bit more broadly to the overall situation, the employment rates of migrants within the EU ha
[normal]ve 
[normal]moved to be higher than for the domestic group
[normal]s
[normal].  That is true whether it is for Polish people coming over here or British people in 
[normal]Spain
[normal].  If there is a theme for what I am saying, it is that because there are these vacancies, if you can match the people with the vacancies you get very surprising results
[normal].
[normal]There is a very diverse situation with higher levels of employment than you might imagine in southern 
[normal]Spain
[normal] among
[normal] British people who have never been close to speaking Spanish
[normal]. A
[normal]nd vice versa
[normal]: 
[normal]there is the 
[normal]Prêt à Manger
[normal] 
[normal]discussion
[normal].
[normal]Q14 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That is very interesting.  It has been brought to my attention that the OECD report in the writt
[normal]en evidence—the Government seem
[normal] to emphasise this quite a lot—suggests there is more updated research available, such as Eurofound, which is the work foundation.  Why have you taken th
[normal]e old and probably out 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]date research as opposed to this more recent research?
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: I have two comments on this.  We mentioned one set of information in the OECD.  They have subsequently done quite a lot of work, including on young people.  We used this as a summary of what we thought was best practice.  Regarding the comparison of Eurofound and the OECD, there tends to be a greater market orientation in 
[normal]the 
[normal]analysis within OECD than there is within Eurofound.  It is not that we do not take information from 
[normal]all
[normal] these 
[normal]elements
[normal]; it is more that we can recognise some of the features of the policies and institutions in the UK in some of the OECD analysis more than we ca
[normal]n in Eurofound’s, for example. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]wonder
[normal] whether it would be worthwhile having a second look at that.
[normal]Bill Wells[bold]: Yes.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Do not spend much time doing it, but if you could
[normal],
[normal] let us know.  I am a bit concerned 
[normal]now 
[normal]that this has come into my brain.
[normal]Finally, I always ask our witnesses, if you were in my position, what questions would you have asked that I have not asked and how would you answer them?  I do not suggest that you should give me the answer straight
[normal] 
[normal]away, but again on the basis that we have found this session very interesting and most informative
[normal]—
[normal]we want to take the most we can from you, and there might be glaring 
[normal]holes
[normal] that we have not actually covered
[normal]—
[normal]if you could think about that and write to us, we would be delighted.
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] [bold]This may be one of those holes.  A
[normal]t the outset, 
[normal]Angus
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gray said he was speaking for
[normal] 
[normal]England
[normal], as it were.  On the background information, it says “
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Gibraltar
[normal]”.  Given that I have a debate coming up on economic development 
[normal]i
[normal]n the overseas territories later this week, I would be very interested to know if any of this applies to 
[normal]Gibraltar
[normal], please.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: Do you want me to answer now?
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] 
[normal]Yes
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]because the debate is this week.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: The current ESF 
[normal]operational 
[normal]programme, which I am responsible for, is 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Gibraltar
[normal].  As you are probably more aware than I am, 
[normal]Gibraltar
[normal] i
[normal]s a fairly unique place.  While
[normal] they run their own ERDF programme, we subcontract the ESF
[normal] programme
[normal] to them.  That is not 
[normal]quite 
[normal]the right language, but 
[normal]that is kind of
[normal] the relationship.  I have encouraged them to take fuller ownership of the ESF for next time.  It is clearly some extra work for them and a bit less work for me, but that has not been the main driver.  The opportunity to integrate what they are doing on ERDF with what they do on ESF is an opportunity I am encouraging them to take.
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] 
[normal]They are not exactly a high unemployment area in any event, but there could be youth issues that could apply.
[normal]Angus Gray[bold]: Indeed, yes.  The good news is that because it is such a small 
[normal]community
[normal], they tend to know the young people who are out of work
[normal],
[normal] and they know which ones who are out of work because their parents are too generous and those out of work because they need help.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] [bold]That is a new category, is it not?  On that happy note, I am sure I speak for all the Committee when I thank you all very much indeed.  It has been a most helpful session, but we would like further information from you
[normal], 
[normal]if you have it.  Thank you very much.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
