[normal]CYCLE SAFETY: HoC Library Briefing Document on Vehicle Excise Duty
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Could members of the transport select committee please read 
[normal]˜Roads: vehicle excise duty (VED) - Commons Library Standard Note”
[normal]. This gives the history of vehicle excise duty and confirms that “road tax”
[normal] does not exist and has not existed since 1937.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some motorists use the belief in this long-dead tax to bully and intimidate cyclists, both verbally and physically and use of the phrase by MPs shows ignorance of Britain’s
[normal] tax 
[normal]system and how roads are funded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If MPs wish to call VED by an easily understood term, use car tax, as VED is a tax on cars and other vehicles, not a tax on roads or a fee to use them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Motorists do not pay directly for the roads. Roads are paid for via g
[normal]eneral and local taxation. In 1926, Winston Churchill started the process to abolish road tax. It was finally culled in 1937.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Car tax is based on amount of CO2 emitted so, if a fee had to be paid, cyclists - who are sometimes branded as 'tax dodgers' by s
[normal]ome motorists - would pay the same as 'tax-dodgers' such as disabled drivers, police cars, the Royal family, and band A motorists, 
[normal]ie
[normal] Â£0.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Most cyclists are also car-owners, too, so pay VED.
