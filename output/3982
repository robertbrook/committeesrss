defaultCYCLE SAFETY: HoC Library Briefing Document on Vehicle Excise Duty
default&#xa0;
defaultCould members of the transport select committee please read 
default˜Roads: vehicle excise duty (VED) - Commons Library Standard Note”
default. This gives the history of vehicle excise duty and confirms that “road tax”
default does not exist and has not existed since 1937.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome motorists use the belief in this long-dead tax to bully and intimidate cyclists, both verbally and physically and use of the phrase by MPs shows ignorance of Britain’s
default tax 
defaultsystem and how roads are funded.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf MPs wish to call VED by an easily understood term, use car tax, as VED is a tax on cars and other vehicles, not a tax on roads or a fee to use them.
default&#xa0;
defaultMotorists do not pay directly for the roads. Roads are paid for via g
defaulteneral and local taxation. In 1926, Winston Churchill started the process to abolish road tax. It was finally culled in 1937.
default&#xa0;
defaultCar tax is based on amount of CO2 emitted so, if a fee had to be paid, cyclists - who are sometimes branded as 'tax dodgers' by s
defaultome motorists - would pay the same as 'tax-dodgers' such as disabled drivers, police cars, the Royal family, and band A motorists, 
defaultie
default Â£0.
default&#xa0;
defaultMost cyclists are also car-owners, too, so pay VED.
