[normal] is a prototype brokerage system aimed at delivering an alternative model of demand responsive passenger transport.   The aim is to deliver comprehensive taxi-bus services by utilising a variety of approaches.
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Approach 1:  Provide a dedicated forum where p
[normal]rospective travellers can ask for taxi-bus routes they require in the long term (for work commute, school run or similar regular journey).
[normal]  Such route requests should be clustered together and be subject to precise query by potential providers (i.e.  show 
[normal]all route requests between point A &amp; point B within the time window of ???)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Approach 2: Provide a database where taxi operators can list taxi-bus routes they are considering trialling, as a means of gathering expressions of interest from potential travell
[normal]ers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Approach 3: Provide a database where taxi  operators can list taxi-bus routes they are actively operating, and provide a means to log seat availability and to organise bookings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Approach 4: Offer guaranteed taxi-bus services to fixed settings with h
[normal]igh demand within variable radius &amp; sub-contract transport to suitable taxi-operators.
[normal]Approaches 1-3 are available on the prototype system:

[normal]Approach 4 has been successfully t
[normal]rialled in rural North Yorkshire over a three week period in 2010; offering guaranteed taxi-bus services to and from a theatre production at Ripley Castle within a radius of 25 miles for .30p per person per mile
[normal].   The trial provided door-to-door transport
[normal] for 80 people over the three week period, with some travelling just a couple of miles, and others travelling from as far as York.  It was delivered at break-even cost.  It is anticipated that this model could be extended to offer similar guarantees to tra
[normal]nsport to towns at commuter times.
