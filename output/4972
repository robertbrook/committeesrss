[normal]PREAMBLE[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Reptile &amp; Exotic Pet Trade Association[bold] [bold](REPTA)
[normal] 
[normal]was 
[normal]formed in 2005 to represent the interests of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] reptile
[normal] &amp;
[normal] exotic pet
[normal] industry. Its primary objectives are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]REPTA predominately works with issues relating to the trade of reptiles and amphibians
[normal], but also promotes responsible keep
[normal]ing of so-called exotic pets, including primates and other taxa.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]UK
[normal] has a long tradition of keeping reptiles and amphibians in captivity
[normal] and with trade,
[normal] with records dating back to the 1600’s
[normal] and t
[normal]oday in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] more than 
[normal]a 
[normal]million households keep in e
[normal]xcess of eight million reptiles and amphibians
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he reptile industry is valued at over two hundred 
[normal]and fifty 
[normal]million
[normal] £
[normal] annually
[normal] and significant numbers of other non-tradition, or exotic, species are also kept as companion animals.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The trade in reptiles 
[normal]as pets is dominated by captive bred animals, 
[normal]with 
[normal]some 90% of the trade in 2013 comprising of such animals.
[normal]  Species such as bearded dragons, leopard geckos, corn snakes and royal pythons are now regarded as domesticated species and 
[normal]form part of the mains
[normal]tay of the general pet trade
[normal], 
[normal]no 
[normal]being 
[normal]longer regarded as specialist species. 
[normal]The reptile market is now dominated by relatively few commonly produced species but
[normal] specialists
[normal] have also kept 
[normal]over 3,600 species and subspecies
[normal], many of which have been bred in 
[normal]captivity, which h
[normal]ave been legally traded in the passed ten years. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The trade in p
[normal]rimates is not a matter
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]concern
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]the day to day work of REPTA
[normal],
[normal] as there is 
[normal]effectively 
[normal]no trade within the pet industry for primates as pets.  Notwithstanding 
[normal]this, 
[normal]theoretically should such a trade exist it would fall under our remit 
[normal]and 
[normal]it is
[normal], therefore,
[normal] appropriate we should make a submission in respect of this 
[normal]investigation
[normal].

[normal]SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]TRADE IN PRIMATES AS PETS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1) 
[normal] 
[normal]In the 
[normal]UK
[normal] today the ‘trade’ (defined as sale from establishments licensed under the Pet Animals Act or imported for commercial purposes) 
[normal]of
[normal] primates as pets is nonexistent.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2)  
[normal]There 
[normal]are
[normal] thought to be 
[normal]m
[normal]ore than
[normal] 3,000 licensed pet shops in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], although
[normal] at the end of 2013
[normal] there
[normal] was
[normal] no central record of licenses issue
[normal]d
[normal] so the precise number is unknown. 
[normal] 
[normal]As far as a 
[normal]REPTA
[normal] investigation
[normal] 
[normal]could determine, there were, however, no establishments licensed to s
[normal]ell primates
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)  
[normal]The 
[normal]sale of animals
[normal] from establishment
[normal]s
[normal] licensed under the Pet Animals Act
[normal] requires all species to be
[normal] included on 
[normal]a
[normal] schedule
[normal]. If any species (including primates) is 
[normal]sold
[normal] without having been listed on this schedule, the owner would be
[normal] in breach of the terms of licence
[normal], an offence
[normal] actionable by the relevant Local Authority
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he s
[normal]ale
[normal] of any primate 
[normal]at an
[normal] establishment 
[normal]licensed under the Pet Animals Act
[normal] that
[normal] has specifically listed the relevant species on its schedule
[normal] is
[normal] both permissible 
[normal]and within the law, although constitutes an event sufficiently rare as to be unrecorded
[normal] in recent history
[normal]. There are
[normal] procedures in place to deal with transgressions of
[normal] existing
[normal] law
[normal] and further controls would be disproportionate to the scale of the potentia
[normal]l problem (currently estimated as zero)
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4)  
[normal]T
[normal]here has
[normal], historically,
[normal] been a small trade in primates as pets
[normal], predominately wild
[normal]-caught
[normal] animals imported
[normal] in the late nineteenth 
[normal]to late
[normal] twentieth century
[normal], but today such a 
[normal]trade is 
[normal]nonexistent.  A report 
[normal]by the RSPCA ‘Primates
[normal] as Pets published 
[normal]in 
[normal]July 2012 
[normal]revealed
[normal] that a survey of pet shops in 2008 
[normal]showed 
[normal]none sold primates.
[normal] 
[normal]This research is by no means 
[normal]exhaustive and
[normal] does not mean there are no pet shops licensed to sell primates,
[normal] the fact that
[normal] none are 
[normal]know
[normal]n
[normal] to either the RSPCA or REPTA
[normal] is, however, suggestive of that any such trade is negligible to non-existent
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]   
[normal]5)  
[normal]The importation of primates into the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]and 
[normal]EU) is regulated under EU Council Regulation 338/97: The EU Wildlife Trade 
[normal]Regulations.  All primates are listed on either Annex A or Annex B of the
[normal]se
[normal] regulations and
[normal],
[normal] thus
[normal],
[normal] require valid CITES documentation (import &amp; export certificates)
[normal].  The importation of primates for trade as pets is not banned
[normal] per se
[normal],
[normal] although 
[normal]there is a pr
[normal]ohibition 
[normal]and REPTA is unaware of any legal
[normal]ly
[normal] imported trade,
[normal] either
[normal] wild-caught or captive-bred
[normal],
[normal] into the 
[normal]UK
[normal] from third
[normal]-party
[normal] countries (i.e.
[normal] those
[normal] outside of the EU) since the 
[normal]enactment of 
[normal]Regulation 
[normal]338/97.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6)  
[normal]There are many private keepers and breeders of primates (number unknown) who 
[normal]produce
[normal] and occasional
[normal]ly
[normal] dispose 
[normal]of
[normal] (sell)
[normal] surplus animals.  
[normal]Such activity is 
[normal]outside the auspices of 
[normal]the pet industry 
[normal]and is
[normal] not 
[normal]licensable under the Pet Animals Act
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The pet tra
[normal]de and t
[normal]he Pet Animals Act is specific to the commercial sale of animals from 
[normal]e
[normal]stablishment
[normal]s
[normal] (premises)
[normal] of animals 
[normal](primates or otherwise) 
[normal]intended to be kept 
[normal]as pets. 
[normal]The Act 
[normal]focus
[normal]es
[normal] on trade, i.e. the act of buying with the intent
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]re-
[normal]sell
[normal],
[normal] and specifically excludes the 
[normal]activity of 
[normal]breeding by private keepers. 
[normal]The b
[normal]reeding
[normal] of companion
[normal] animals is
[normal] generally
[normal] not licensable under the aforementioned Act
[normal], with the exception of
[normal] dogs
[normal],
[normal] breeding of which is regulated by
[normal] the
[normal] Breeding of Dogs Act
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DEFINING WHAT IS A PET?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7)  
[normal]Defining what constitutes
[normal] a pet primate
[normal] is a
[normal] fundamental 
[normal]issue
[normal] that needs to be 
[normal]addressed
[normal], 
[normal]as 
[normal]the
[normal] current
[normal] situation is entirely ambiguous.  In l
[normal]ieu
[normal] of a legal definition
[normal],
[normal] REPTA would 
[normal]suggest that
[normal] a ‘pet primate’ 
[normal]should be defin
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]as an animal 
[normal]kept in isolation
[normal] from others of its species purely
[normal] for human companionship
[normal] and/or entertainment
[normal].
[normal] It was historically common practice to keep primates in this manner but the practice has now fallen into disuse and primates are now kept in p
[normal]urpose-built enclosures in appropriate social groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8)  
[normal]There are numerous dictionary definitions of 
[normal]what we understand by the term 
[normal]pet
[normal] but not 
[normal]specifically 
[normal]pet primate
[normal] and
[normal] REPTA 
[normal]sources are
[normal] unaware of any
[normal] case law or
[normal] legal definitions 
[normal]on the issue 
[normal]other then 
[normal]that offer
[normal]ed
[normal] by HMRC in respect of application of Value Added Tax (VAT)
[normal] which 
[normal]can be 
[normal]found at 
[normal]HMRC Reference: Notice 701/15 (December 2011)
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9)  
[normal]The keeping of non-domesticated animals has become a priority issue for the Animal Rights movemen
[normal]t, often using the term ‘exotic pets’.  The reality is 
[normal]that 
[normal]for taxa other than 
[normal]traditional 
[normal]domestic pets (cats &amp; dogs) virtual all species kept 
[normal]b
[normal]y man are exotic, i.e. not of native origin
[normal] and that
[normal] the keeping of native species is
[normal],
[normal] in most cases
[normal],
[normal] prohibit
[normal]ed.
[normal] 
[normal]The Animal Rights movement is a very powerful lobby that often masquerade
[normal]s
[normal] under the banner of animal welfare, 
[normal]although the two
[normal] are separate ideolog
[normal]ies. 
[normal]The keeping of 
[normal]primate
[normal]s
[normal] is an emotive issue and it is 
[normal]imperative that 
[normal]an 
[normal]animal rights
[normal] agenda
[normal] does
[normal] not cloud the 
[normal]issue
[normal]s pertaining to the private ownership of
[normal] primates in captivity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF PRIMATES[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10)  
[normal]U
[normal]nder 
[normal]UK
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]i
[normal]ndeed EU
[normal],
[normal] legislation animals are regarded as chattels, i.e. property
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]ownership is,
[normal] thus
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]afforded
[normal] protection
[normal] as
[normal] enshrined under the Human Rights Act.  It is
[normal],
[normal] therefore
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]assumed unrealistic 
[normal]to
[normal] suggest that private ownership of primates should be banned, 
[normal]but
[normal] ensure that controls are in place to ensure
[normal] that 
[normal]the manner
[normal] in which they are maintained 
[normal]is appropriate to the
[normal]ir welfare.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11)  
[normal]The keeping of a
[normal] solitary
[normal] primate as a ‘pet’ is already effectively unlawful (illegal)
[normal] under t
[normal]he Animal Welfare Act
[normal], as
[normal] underpinned by a Code of Practice for primates, “
[normal]Code of Practice
[normal] 
[normal]for the Welfare of Privately Kept
[normal] 
[normal]Non-Human Primates
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal] published
[normal] in
[normal] 2009.   Compliance with this code precludes the keeping of primate
[normal]s
[normal] as pet
[normal]s
[normal], i.e. a 
[normal]solitary
[normal] 
[normal]animal
[normal] kept in isolation in an unsuitable environment for human companionship.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12)  
[normal]Non-compliance with a Code of Practice is not
[normal],
[normal] in itself
[normal],
[normal] an
[normal] offence, 
[normal]but
[normal] places the evidential burden on the keeper to demonstrate they are discharging the Duty of Care enforced upon them by the Animal Welfare Act.   
[normal]REPTA is of the opinion this would be an insurmountable challenge
[normal] to
[normal] the keeping of a single prima
[normal]te as ‘pet’ (companion animal) and would
[normal],
[normal] thus
[normal],
[normal] render the keep
[normal]er liable
[normal] to prosecution under Section 4 or 9 of the Animal Welfare Act. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT LEGISLATION [bold]&#xa0;[bold]13)  
[normal]It is clear
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]there is already sufficient legislation
[normal] under the Animal Welfare Act
[normal] that prevents the
[normal] inappropriate 
[normal]keeping of primates as pets 
[normal]and that 
[normal]current
[normal] legislation is
[normal] adequate and
[normal] effective
[normal].
[normal] Current
[normal] legislation
[normal] is appropriate and proportionate in that it
[normal] prohibits the inappropriate keeping of primate
[normal]s, but facilitates the responsible private ownership of such animals.  This legislation continues to be used 
[normal]by the RSPCA
[normal],
[normal] and other prosecutors
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to take action against inappropriate keeping.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14)  
[normal]REPTA research suggests 
[normal]that in the pas
[normal]t
[normal] twelve months the RSPCA have 
[normal]successfully 
[normal]secured
[normal] at least
[normal] five successful convictions against individuals keeping primates as pets, 
[normal]which
[normal] is clear and irrefutable evidence
[normal] that current
[normal] legislation is working and fit for purpose. 
[normal]We should not
[normal], however,
[normal] c
[normal]onfuse successful prosecutions of 
[normal]a few 
[normal]private keepers 
[normal]of
[normal] ‘pet’ primates as 
[normal]indicative 
[normal]that
[normal] private keepers of primates 
[normal]are
[normal] poor
[normal] as
[normal] 
[normal]most are maintaining their animals to an extremely high standard. Many other taxa of commonly kept pet species (primarily d
[normal]ogs and cats) are subject to very high levels of
[normal] successful prosecutions for 
[normal]breaches
[normal] of the Animal Welfare Act
[normal], although there is no suggestion that these species should be the subject of ownership restrictions and/or bans
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15)  
[normal]If there is any
[normal] issue i
[normal]t is
[normal] lack of appropriate enforcement of the
[normal] current (adequate)
[normal] legislation.  If the current legislation is
[normal], as REPTA would suggest,
[normal] broadly fit for purpose but not enforced effectively
[normal],
[normal] it is difficult to see how 
[normal]increased
[normal] legislation without 
[normal]further enfor
[normal]cement 
[normal]resources would be workable
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]COMMENTS &amp; OBSERVATIONS[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16)  
[normal]REPTA recently participated 
[normal]in the Working Group which revised Model Standards for Pet Shop Licensing
[normal] 
[normal]underpin
[normal]ning
[normal] the Pet Animals Act.  The
[normal]se
[normal] standards have been substantially 
[normal]amended
[normal] since the last revision of 1998
[normal] and, whilst t
[normal]he WG 
[normal]considered including
[normal] model standards for trading in primates
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]dismissed
[normal] this due to
[normal] 
[normal]evidence suggest
[normal]ing no
[normal] 
[normal]such trade existed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17)  
[normal]The Working Group concluded that there was no evidence to suggest there
[normal] was any trade in primates by establishments regulated under the Pet Animals Act
[normal] but,
[normal] should this prove inaccurate
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]such 
[normal]guidance could be drafted
[normal] and incorporated into the
[normal] revised
[normal] 
[normal]M
[normal]odel 
[normal]S
[normal]tandards. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18)  
[normal]REPTA is a member of the Pet Advertising Advisory 
[normal]Group (PAAG)
[normal] which 
[normal]recently produced a voluntary Code of Practice (Minimum Standards) for internet 
[normal]advertising
[normal],
[normal] launched at a parliamentary 
[normal]reception on the 
[normal]4
[normal]th
[normal] of September 2013
[normal].
[normal]   
[normal]The issue of advertising of primates on the internet has been discussed 
[normal]within the group, but conclu
[normal]ded that
[normal] a very high percentage of such ad
[normal]vertisement 
[normal]are
[normal] bogus
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]scams
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19)  
[normal]Further regulation of private primate ownership, if any is needed, must be reasonable and proportionate
[normal] and w
[normal]hat appears to be lacking is hard empiri
[normal]cal data
[normal] that this is necessary. T
[normal]here is a plethora of anecdotal and 
[normal]speculative 
[normal]testimony 
[normal]provided by organisations and individual
[normal]s
[normal] opposed to private ownership
[normal] of primates and
[normal] the v
[normal]eracity
[normal] of such evidence should be questioned.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20)  
[normal]Even basic informat
[normal]ion
[normal],
[normal] such as how many primates kept by private keepers
[normal],
[normal] is unknown
[normal], although i
[normal]t is speculated the
[normal] number of primates kep
[normal]t by private keepers var
[normal]ies
[normal] from
[normal] low
[normal] 
[normal]estimate
[normal]s
[normal] of 
[normal]3,000 to 5,000 
[normal]to as
[normal] high as 15,000 to 20,000
[normal] (or 
[normal]higher
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]Without
[normal] such basic informat
[normal]ion assessing the need for further regulation
[normal],
[normal] such as 
[normal](
[normal]perhaps
[normal])
[normal] the licensing of all private owners of primates 
[normal]is at best conjuncture and not based on
[normal] 
[normal]reliable
[normal] 
[normal]supporting 
[normal]evidence. 
[normal]O
[normal]btaining accurate data on the current number of primates kept by private
[normal] keepers would be challenging
[normal] but
[normal] other pertinent data would be 
[normal]accessible
[normal] and could 
[normal]be valuable in assessing requirement for further legislation (if any).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21)  
[normal]D
[normal]ata would ideal
[normal]ly be
[normal] collected and collated by an independent body, i.e. not an organisation 
[normal]that campaigns against (or indeed for) private ownership of primates
[normal] which 
[normal]is
[normal],
[normal] perhaps
[normal],
[normal] a task the Select Committee
[normal] could con
[normal]si
[normal]der undertaking during the course of its enquiry. 
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]ata
[normal] 
[normal]that is eminently available 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]retrieval from 
[normal]the relevant government
[normal] de
[normal]partments
[normal] (local &amp; central) 
[normal]could be co
[normal]mpiled
[normal] for a specific time period (suggest the previous five years) and could include
[normal]:   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22) 
[normal]T
[normal]h
[normal]is
[normal] data would be
[normal] 
[normal]of value 
[normal]in establishing the true extent of issues relating to primates as pets, even if it is not possible to qua
[normal]nt
[normal]ify in relation to the number
[normal] of animals kept.
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CONCLUSIONS [bold]&#xa0;[bold]23)  
[normal]The 
[normal]fundamental issue is not lack of 
[normal]legislation
[normal], it
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]lack of appropriate 
[normal]enforcement of the legislation
[normal] due 
[normal]to lack of funding 
[normal]and direction from central government.
[normal]  Animal welfare is a low priority
[normal] for
[normal] Local Au
[normal]thorities, 
[normal]which, 
[normal]whilst regrettable
[normal],
[normal] is understandable
[normal] when resources are stretched thinly.
[normal] 
[normal]Legislation governing the private ownership or trade
[normal] of animals
[normal], i.e. The Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Pet Animals Act 1951
[normal] are all broadly fit for purpose
[normal]. Any
[normal] failure of these Acts
[normal] is due to problems with
[normal] enforcement by Local Authorities that are 
[normal]inadequate
[normal]ly
[normal] equipped to fulfil the task
[normal]s
[normal] demanded of them.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]24)  
[normal]The administration of the aforementioned Acts (and the Zoo Lic
[normal]ensing Act) 
[normal]should, therefore,
[normal] be removed from Local Authority administration and discharged by central government.  
[normal]Until such time as this happens we shall continue to see inconsistencies and failures in administration of legislation that will compromise
[normal] the welfare of 
[normal]both
[normal] primates but other species.
