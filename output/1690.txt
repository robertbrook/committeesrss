[[[(NPL) (WSC043)]]]Executive Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;BackgroundThe National Physical Laboratory (NPL) welcomes the opportunity to make an input into this Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry into women in STEM careers. As a Research Technology Organisation (RTO) NPL is part of the research infrastructure in the UK and has been a highly regarded national laboratory, undertaking publicly-funded research, for over a century. Our role is to act as the UK’s National Measurement Institute (NMI). We sit at the intersection between scientific discovery and real world application, working as a bridge between academia, business and government. Our expertise and original research have underpinned quality of life, innovation and competitiveness for UK citizens and business since the opening of the laboratory over 100 years ago.Key facts:&#xa0;NPL’s performance and reputation relies on the first-class people and particularly the exceptional scientists who work at the laboratory. As a non-academic organisation NPL welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the inquiry and provide our view about what women value in a scientific career outside academia.Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? In all three years, once a female got to the promotion panel there was a 100% success rate. This is not the case for male candidates and might suggest that women wait until they feel completely ready before applying for promotion.&#xa0;When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
