"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Living Fuels (HOT53)&#xa0;\nOverviewThe Government’s Microgeneration Strategy and Annual Energy Statements since 2010 have noted that onsite renewable and low carbon technologies at the community level and commercial scale will play an important role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs. This is especially so as the energy supply decentralises, and small-scale Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is specifically included as an integral part of the Government’s plans.\n While CHP has not reached the levels found in some other countries, e.g. Germany, some steady progress has been made over the past few years and there could have been a promise of more.\n&#xa0;\nAt present, CHP stations fuelled by sustainable bioliquids such as used cooking oil (UCO) receive support under the Renewables Obligation. This is in recognition of their potential to provide a significant contribution to the Government’s targets for emission reductions as well as the industry’s role in creating jobs and generating investment in a niche and highly skilled sector of the economy.\n Bioliquid-fuelled CHP is easily scalable and can be implemented with low visual impact, unlike other biomass-fuelled CHP generation which has to be much larger in scale to be viable. This makes bioliquid-fuelled CHP uniquely flexible and available to be adapted quickly to existing environments. \n&#xa0;\nIn its consultations on the Renewable Heat Incentive \nDepartment for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) \nshowed continued support for bioliquid-fuelled CHP. For example, in the \nRenewable Heat Incentive: Expanding the non\n-\ndomestic scheme\n (closed on 7 December 2012) the Government states: “\nBioliquid CHP provides high levels of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas savings, hence we are proposing to introduce support for this technology\n.\n”\n&#xa0;\nHowever, in its consultation on the Electricity Market Reform Delivery Plan\n published in July 2013,\n DECC has outlined plans to exclude bioliquids in electricity and heat generation from the strike price mechanism under the new Contracts for Difference (CfD) Feed-in-Tariff system. \n&#xa0;\nThis lack of a joint-up approach will be detrimental to the CHP generation and will hamper the \ndevelop\nment\n \nof \nthe diverse mix of energy sources and technologies necessary to stimulate investment in the green economy and deliver a low carbon future\n.\n \nI\nnstead\n, DECC\n suggests a direct intervention in the\n electricity\n market to direct waste-derived bioliquids away from use in power\n generation\n and into transport,\n undermining at the same time the heat generation market. They propose this\n despite numerous studies showing that used cooking oil delivers the greatest efficiency and greenhouse gas savings when used in CHP.\n&#xa0;\nThese proposals are in real danger of undermining the high-tech bioliquids industry, discouraging the use of the most sustainable fuels in small-scale electricity and heat generation, distorting the market for renewable fuels and severely damaging the jobs and innovation that will be needed to deliver the Government’s ambitious targets for investment in the low carbon and renewables sector over the next twenty years.\n&#xa0;The merits of small-scale CHP and the role of waste-derived bioliquidsWhile Living Fuels is supportive of the move towards CfD Feed-in-Tariffs, we are deeply concerned that the current policy to exclude bioliquids from the strike price mechanism ignores the huge potential that UCO\n-\nderived bioliquids have to generate clean and sustainable onsite heat and power. By excluding bioliquids from the scheme unnecessarily, many project and technology developers will see the economic rationale of bioliquid CHP projects disappear.\n As heat is a by-product of electricity-generation, the RHI can only function as an additional measure of support and alone cannot compensate for the lack of support for the generation of electricity.\n The likely outcome of DECC’s current recommendations will be that all further development and building of new bioliquid\n-\npowered CHP stations will simply halt as developers move instead to more costly and less efficient or sustainable technologies.\n&#xa0;\nFor example, Living Fuels currently generates around 25MW through CHP\n and open cycle plants\n, ensuring that around 3,000 tons of UCO is recycled. It is committed to expand its CHP \nand open cycle plants\n to generate around \n5\n0MW by 2017, representing an investment of many millions of pounds. With its current supply of UCO, it could potentially build another 40-50 MW. However, this would not be economically viable beyond the end of the Renewables Obligation and the introduction of Contracts for Difference. This could have consequential loss of jobs and economic prosperity.\n&#xa0;\nAt the same time, renewable energy sources are increasingly required as part of n\new building developments. These \noften take the form of a District Heating Network and a\nre small-scale. Small bioliquid-\nfuelled CHP stations are the perfect fit for such requirements. While UCO-based CHP is easily scalable and has low visual impact, other biomass-based CHP facilities require space for bulk storage of fuel\n and have a large visual impact on their surroundings as they use, for example, high chimneys\n. This demands more space and more complex logistical arrangements, making these biomass-based CHP facilities unviable\n and unattractive at the community level.\n&#xa0;\nAs CHP is one of the most efficient ways to generate electricity and heat, removing support for UCO-based CHP\n in the electricity market\n is unhelpful with regards to the UK’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and making greater progress in landfill diversion and recycling. It is clear that renewable energy policy should consider wider environmental impacts as well as the dynamics of market forces that lie behind the choice of technology and resources.\n&#xa0;\nAs a material that has already fulfilled its primary use, bioliquids produced from used cooking oil are acknowledged to be one of the most sustainable renewable fuels. UCO is a waste product which poses a considerable risk to the environment and public health if it is not disposed of properly. Significant amounts of UCO are disposed of down the drain: water companies in the UK spend £15m per annum clearing used cooking oil from their sewers and 75% of the 200,000 drain clearance call-outs every year involve used cooking oil.\n&#xa0;\nUsing waste products to produce bioliquids for use in renewable heat and power has none of the potentially damaging environmental impacts traditionally associated with biofuels, such as using displacing food crops from agricultural land and growing biomass as a raw material. CHP stations are also the most energy efficient way to use bioliquids made from \nUCO. A study by North Energy funded by DECC and managed by the NNFCC showed that “the highest absolute savings in total greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved by using refined vegetable oil derived from used cooking oil in a CHP unit to displace heat generated \nfrom fuel oil and electricity from the grid.’’\n&#xa0;\nDistortion of the bioliquids market&#xa0;\nAt present DECC’s different approach to bioliquid-fuelled CHP in the RHI and the EMR suggest there is a lack of joined-up thinking in the Department on this issue. It suggests bioliquids are to be excluded from the EMR strike price mechanism since there are limited options to decarbonise the transport sector, and so renewable liquid fuel are best diverted into transport rather than into heat and power. However, this reasoning does not appear to apply to the RHI.\n&#xa0;\nThis ignores the fact that bioliquids require complex and costly refining and processing when used as a transport fuel, and that the bioliquids market is large enough to incorporate a wide use of end uses for waste feedstocks such as UCO. It also ignores research which shows that the most sustainable and carbon efficient use of UCO is in CHP stations. Indeed, a study by a number of academics has suggested that it is more efficient to use biomass feedstocks for the generation of electricity to power electric cars than to refine it into biodiesel. With 250,000-300,000 tons of UCO available in the UK, there is scope to use this as a diverse resource for different forms of renewable energy generation. In this point, we agree with the evidence taken by the Committee on 26 March from the Oil-Firing Technical Association.\n&#xa0;\nThe solution&#xa0;\nWe therefore believe that if the Government is serious about reducing carbon emissions generated by heat production, DECC needs to join up the RHI and the EMR on the point of bioliquids for CHP. There is a clear case for the inclusion of bioliquids within the strike price mechanism of EMR and that DECC should set a strike price along with other technologies which will be included in the first phase of the project from 2017. Living Fuels and others in the industry would be happy to consult with DECC about the optimum level for of support in both the RHI and the EMR, to ensure that there remains sufficient capacity within the UCO market to encourage both the decarbonisation of the transport sector as well as encouraging take up of small onsite and community CHP stations.\n&#xa0;Background to Living Fuels&#xa0;Living Fuels is a British subsidiary of the £73m AIM-listed renewable energy company Renewable Energy Generation Bio-Power. Living Fuels has researched and developed a process to purify used cooking oils (UCO) into a fuel grade product – LF100. LF100 is an ‘end of waste’ fuel which is used to generate renewable heat and electricity in onsite CHP systems.  Living Fuels has more than 500 public sector collections points for UCO and a number of industrial clients, such as food processors. In East Anglia and the East Midlands, where Living Fuels is based, \nwe\n also collect UCO \nfrom local small businesses\n.\n&#xa0;\nLiving Fuels' sister company, Living Power, uses LF100 to generate clean heat and power in small-scale CHP plants for the Port of Dover, local recycling sites\n and the National Grid\n. LF100 is also sold to external customers for use in larger-scale electricity and heat generation.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
