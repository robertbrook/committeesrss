defaultThis submission draws upon interim findings from a three-year (2012-2015) Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded project investigating the 
defaultrole
default and practice of school governance and accountability in England today (Grant ref. ES/K001299/1).
defaultExecutive summary defaultAccountability is the condition of securing public trust and public agreement on the equitable and fair distribution of public resources. On these terms account
defaultability refers to the duty
default and responsibility of all state-funded institutions to manage themselves efficiently and equitably through public consultation and transparency, and in accordance with the law. 
defaultIn the specific case of converter and sponsor academies – schools with the flexibility and freedom to be administratively self-governing – and many other types of state-funded independent schools
default (e.g. free schools)
default, 
defaultensuring 
defaultaccountability is 
defaultnot the strategic responsibility of
default local government (though some risk assessment of academies is still performed by local government). Instead accountability is dispersed and devolved to boards of trustees (in the case of Multi-Academy and Umbrella Trust setups) and individual school governing bodies
default – what we might call the new ‘middle-tier’ in state education. 
defaultThe Department for Education (
defaultDfE
default) at this time emphasizes the role and responsibility of school governors in facilitating ‘effective governance’, through providing scrutiny of direction, enabling strategy and hol
defaultding head teachers and senior leaders to account. 
defaultBut despite calls from the government, Ofsted and some school governor support services (e.g. The National Governors Association, NGA) to professionalize governing bodies en masse through increased training, support, self-evaluation, external inspection and exhaustive data provision, the task of how accountability can be best achieved in practice, within 
defaultand outside 
defaultthe dynamics of governing bodies, lacks specificity and direction.
