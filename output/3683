[normal]This submission draws upon interim findings from a three-year (2012-2015) Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded project investigating the 
[normal]role
[normal] and practice of school governance and accountability in England today (Grant ref. ES/K001299/1).
[normal]Executive summary [bold]Accountability is the condition of securing public trust and public agreement on the equitable and fair distribution of public resources. On these terms account
[normal]ability refers to the duty
[normal] and responsibility of all state-funded institutions to manage themselves efficiently and equitably through public consultation and transparency, and in accordance with the law. 
[normal]In the specific case of converter and sponsor academies – schools with the flexibility and freedom to be administratively self-governing – and many other types of state-funded independent schools
[normal] (e.g. free schools)
[normal], 
[normal]ensuring 
[normal]accountability is 
[normal]not the strategic responsibility of
[normal] local government (though some risk assessment of academies is still performed by local government). Instead accountability is dispersed and devolved to boards of trustees (in the case of Multi-Academy and Umbrella Trust setups) and individual school governing bodies
[normal] – what we might call the new ‘middle-tier’ in state education. 
[normal]The Department for Education (
[normal]DfE
[normal]) at this time emphasizes the role and responsibility of school governors in facilitating ‘effective governance’, through providing scrutiny of direction, enabling strategy and hol
[normal]ding head teachers and senior leaders to account. 
[normal]But despite calls from the government, Ofsted and some school governor support services (e.g. The National Governors Association, NGA) to professionalize governing bodies en masse through increased training, support, self-evaluation, external inspection and exhaustive data provision, the task of how accountability can be best achieved in practice, within 
[normal]and outside 
[normal]the dynamics of governing bodies, lacks specificity and direction.
