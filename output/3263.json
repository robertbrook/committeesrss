"Written evidence submitted by Lesley Riddoch&#xa0;&#xa0;\nDespite earlier Land Reform legislation and unilateral action by communities like \nEigg\n (of which I was a trustee for eight years), Scotland still has one of the most concentrated patterns of landownership in the developed world. I’m currently researching a\n PhD comparing Norway and Scotland – it would be hard to find a more striking contrast between two neighbouring nations. \n&#xa0;\nOne reason Norway had\n \none of the widest franchises in Northern Europe was the Constitution\n \nof 1814, which extended the vote to all male\n landowners over the\n \nage of 25 with the result that 45 per cent of men became eligible to vote overnight.\n \nThis compared with 0.173 per cent of Scots enfranchised by the British Reform Bill of 1832. Enfranchising landowners gave the vote to almost half of N\norwegian men but fewer than half\n&#xa0;\nof one per cent of Scotsmen in the early 19th century – and the result wouldn’t be very different in either country today.\n \nThe breadth of the Norwegian electorate meant that a cross-section of society had ‘skin in the game’\n and had to be politically accommodated. At first educated\n \nofficials in Oslo looked down on peasants as \n‘the\n estate of the most foolish’, but soon the liberal intelligentsia joined forces with them to make Government more responsive to Parliament, and forc\ne through new, elected, representative municipal councils in 1837 to permanently restrict the local power of central ‘\nDanophile\n’ elites and state officials.\n \nThis paved the way for the subsequent development of proportional representation, a political cultu\nre of compromise and the embrace of equality as the nation’s guiding social and economic policy objective. In 1814, the average Norwegian man had the vote and owned his farm. The average Scotsman had neither. That continues to have a massive effect on Scot\ntish democracy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEvery system becomes self-justifying and self-generating. So landowners believe that without their management, large areas of Scotland would \nlie depopulated\n and without investment\n. It’s very hard to see that \nmuch landowner largesse relies on a \ntaxation \nsys\ntem \nwhich doesn't charge business rates on most sporting estate\ns\n, \non \nTrusts which allow families to avoid \nother taxes and \ndeath duties and \non \nprimogeniture (which allows the eldest son to inherit land without division with siblings\n in Scotland.\n) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe best answer to this is an ambitious experiment begun 25 years ago by two Perthshire ecologists Ron Greer and Derek \nPretswell\n. The Scottish Government website tells us “invasive non-native species are the second biggest threat\n, \nafter habitat destructi\non\n, \nto native species and habitats worldwide.” Perhaps that’s wrong. The biggest threat to Scotland’s wonderfully diverse habitat is the legion of land owners (public and private) who believe Scotland is “naturally” a barren wilderness where nothing grow\ns except heather moorland (for grouse shooting) and rows of tightly packed, diversity-defeating conifers (for \nsale). Our land is capable of much, much more. Broad-leaved trees can grow anywhere sheep and deer are largely excluded. \n&#xa0;\nYou can see natural \nregro\nwth\n on sheep-free hills, hard-to-reach verges and central reservations where deer fear to tread. But soil also needs a revival. When that’s done, a lush, diverse, flower, herb and insect-rich woodland habitat can be re-created for next to nothing. The proo\nf lies in six areas of woodland off the A9 on the barren wasteland of \nDalnaspidal\n by Loch Garry. \n&#xa0;\nTwenty years ago local ecologists Ron Greer and Derek \nPretswell\n used a “succession planting” technique – mixing \nlupins\n and broom with broad-leaved saplings to \nimprove the soil, provide shelter and raise micro-temperatures so the trees would finally flourish. Sheep and deer were fenced out. After two years, \nlupins\n and broom seemed to take over. Today those first protective species have mostly gone, replaced by wi\nld raspberries, insects, herbs and flowers beneath tree species which provide daylight beneath canopies and leaf litter for bigger, healthier fish in the neighbouring loch – potentially adding to local food supplies. Exotic grey, red and green Alders have \nadded nitrogen to the soil. \n&#xa0;\nNon-shade creating Larch have allowed blueberries and heather to grow and make excellent wood for fuel. Ditto Norwegian Maple which also provides a source of glorious colour in the autumn. They are all non-native trees and utter\nly effective in transforming this part of the man and sheep-made desert that flanks the highest parts of the A9. \n&#xa0;\nWhy do Scots not demand leaf-litter-producing trees round lochs to double the size of fish? Is it because none but paying customers and friends\n of the landowner currently sees or tastes the high-protein products of our lochs and rivers? Ron Greer estimates the current mixed woodlands of Perthshire’s enormous \nAtholl\n Estate could keep the towns of \nPitlochry\n, Blair \nAtholl\n, \nDunkeld\n and Rannoch suppli\ned with wood for heat in perpetuity. With oil and gas prices about to hit the roof this winter why isn’t this home-grown solution even being discussed? Because our forests are off limits. \n&#xa0;\nWe could choose to transform highland deserts into mixed forests, co\nntaining new, self sufficient villages, fish-producing lochs and tourists keen to see the most spectacular Autumn Colours in Northern Europe.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs recommended by the report authors. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere has been comment on the agricultural, conservation and access grants available to landowners. I’d like to concentrate on the vast new subsidies now being earned by landowners through wind farms – bolstering perhaps the most concentrated system of lan\ndownership in Europe, denying communities income and the right to a say over developments and stoking up widespread resentment to renewable energy\n,\n especially wind\n,\n as nearby resource results in next to no reduction in soaring energy bills for rural cons\numers. \nScotland is reputedly the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy.\n Th\nat\n’s assumed to be \na reference to Scotland’s vast renewable resources – in wind, hydro, biomass and marine.\n \nPerhaps though, the most important parallel is rather different. Energy develop\nments in both countries benefit very few people directly because very few own the land.\n&#xa0;\nThe Kirk’s recent submission to the Land Reform Review Group (LRRG) made just this point. \n&#xa0;\n“The ownership of land in Scotland remains deeply inequitable and the new \nlanded income from wind power entrenches that inequality. If landowners are gaining financial rewards from \nrenewables\n while a growing number of households are living in fuel poverty, then the strong case for re-examining land reform to ensure the financial\n benefits of \nrenewables\n are shared more equitably is strengthened further.”\n&#xa0;\nThe Tory MEP Struan Stevenson \nrecently \ncalculated that the Duke of \nRoxburghe\n could net £1.5 million a year, the Earl of Moray, £2 million and the Earl of Glasgow more than £300,000\n from wind farms on their land. \n&#xa0;\nMr Stevenson and the Scottish Tories \nthink\n the solution is a one year moratorium on new wind farms and a halving of wind subsidies. And yet the Conservative environment spokesman, Jamie \nMcGrigor\n and Tory MSPs Alex Fergusson\n and John Scott are all set to receive big bungs from wind turbine developers. Double standards apart though\n, \nwhy is this a problem? \n&#xa0;\nFirst, unlike Saudi Arabia, Scotland is a democracy where one would expect wealth\n, \nincluding the wealth that arises fro\nm natural assets\n, \nto be shared. \n&#xa0;\nSecond, fuel poverty causes hyperthermia and chronic ill health\n, \nso a cash share in the country’s wind earnings would be a quick way to cut bills and save lives.\n&#xa0;\nThirdly, high energy costs deter industry by turning energ\ny-rich Scotland into an energy-expensive location for new business.\n&#xa0;\nFinally, it could be otherwise as the intriguing tale of the “wind crofter” demonstrated this weekend (Scotland on Sunday 26.5.13) Under the \nEnergise Scotland\n scheme smallholders, crofters\n and communities host small turbines and get free electricity while developers pay for the kit and sell excess energy to the grid. There may be better schemes around\n, \nbut “wind \ncrofting\n” demonstrates the empowering potential of wind income split more even\nly. A small turbine can reduce individual energy bills to zero and still make a profit for investors\n, \nas long as that individual owns land.\n&#xa0;\nAnd there of course is the rub.\n&#xa0;\nScotland may be a northern energy emirate, but ordinary Scots pay the highest elect\nricity bills in Europe because 60% of “our” \nprivate \nland is owned by just a thousand people – and the disappointing interim report by the Land Reform Review Group suggests this shameful picture is not about to change.\n&#xa0;\nNow admittedly, land ownership and the\n possibility of free or discounted electricity have not featured strongly in the wind farm debate so far. \n&#xa0;\nBattle lines have been drawn instead over appearance, intermittency and cost – and though a vocal minority won a ban on new wind farms in “scenic are\nas”, they’ve failed to dent the consistent majority for wind energy in regular opinion polls. \n&#xa0;\nDig deeper in the data however and its clear wind energy is more popular in cities than country areas. Is that because of visual interference or financial unfair\nness?  We’ll probably never know. \nSomehow the public hoped and presumed the renewable energy bonanza would be different. \n&#xa0;\nThe industry does offer community benefit – a sum per megawatt of wind generated locally. But some communities have not spent their w\nind cash and few have performed land buyouts to become joint wind developers – even though Duke-sized hand-outs await. What are communities waiting for?\n&#xa0;\nWell clarity, fairness, political backing and land reform.\nCommunities recognise what Ministers and the\n LRRG evidently cannot. The unavailability of land is a chronic problem and the time for sticking plaster solutions is over. Enthusiastic Scots are weary of shouldering terrifying legal burdens, cajoling reluctant banks, bending rules and using ad hoc arra\nngements to operate in markets designed for big commercial players.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSince 2003 17 land buyouts have taken place and a 2011 report shows those communities are measurably more resilient than they were as private fiefdoms. In \nStòras\n \nUibhist\n on South \nUist\n, turnover is ten times higher than it was in 2006, when Scotla\nnd’s largest community buyout\n \ntook place. In general, school rolls have almost doubled, population has increased, energy supply systems have improved, local land ownership has prompted young people to build homes and start families and old people don’t \nface the unpalatable choice of living locally without heat or in a distant old folk’s home without company. Historian Professor Jim Hunter has calculated that all the community buyouts and associated improvement grants have probably cost the public purse £\n100 million – roughly equivalent to eight weeks of agricultural subsidy. Do many other public realm projects show anything like such a healthy return on investment – in human or monetary terms? And yet, there’s still scepticism – about buyouts, community c\nontrol and the long term capacity of people managing their own land. \n&#xa0;\nThere are various reasons for that. The inspiring human stories of triumph over adversity\n \non \nEigg\n (for example) were all too quickly subsumed into a complex legal, political and historical case for land reform – absolutely necessary, but alienating for non-specialists. Broadcasters like the \nBBC \nwere wary about ‘taking sides’ and urban Scots wer\ne unable to see parallels between\n \ndramatic land battles ‘in the sticks’ and city problems of land scarcity and high prices on their own doorsteps. Few small mainland communities were well-enough organised to take advantage of the new buyout legislation. An\nd relatively few estates came onto the market anyway, giving locals little chance to make pre-emptive bids.\n&#xa0;\nAll in all, the community buyouts of the nineties and \nnoughties\n started a slow burn on neighbouring \nHebridean\n islands, but failed to set the mainlan\nd heather alight. Now – a decade after Scotland’s historic land reform legislation – fewer than one in ten communities that\n \nregistered a desire to buy land actually managed to do it, and only 142 communities out of tens of thousands even tried. That could \nmean life in Scotland’s rural areas is rosy… or it could mean the community buyout model is too daunting for all but the most threatened or determined island communities like \nEigg\n. I’d opt for the latter explanation. \n&#xa0;\nScotland still has one of the most con\ncentrated patterns of landownership\n \nin Europe. The government cannot finance more than a few buyouts and individuals still cannot get their hands on small, affordable parcels of land. The ball is still in t\nhe court of the large landowne\nr\n&#xa0;\nYes\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n"
