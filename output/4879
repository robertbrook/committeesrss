[normal]I have recommended that subject to resources, the operation of two further anti-terrorism laws (ATCSA 2001 and CTA 2008) should also be considered for independent review: 
[normal]The Terrorism Acts in 2011
[normal], June 2012, 12.1.

[normal] and Quinton v UK

[normal]Beghal
[normal] [2013] EWHC 2573 Admin (Schedule 7).
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]I consider the charging figures to be more informative than the figures for “
[normal]terrorism-related arrests
[normal]”, which may be criticised for subjectivity: see 
[normal]The Terrorism Acts in 2012
[normal] (July 2013) at 8.3-8.8.
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]The killings of Mohammed 
[normal]Saleem
[normal] and Drummer Lee Rigby in April and May 2013 were both investigated as terrorism by the police.  Suspects have been charged with murder in each case.

[normal]Detention of 
[normal]undeportable
[normal] foreign nationals in 
[normal]Belmarsh
[normal] (Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001), replaced in turn by control orders (Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005) and TPIMs (Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011).
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Particularly in the Terrorism Act 2006: see my report 
[normal]The Terrorism Acts in 2011
[normal], June 2012, 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Such measures may also encourage the terrorists.  As Jonathan Evans of MI5 said in 2010: “
[normal]In recent years we appear increasingly to have imported from the American media the assumption that terrorism is 100% preventable and that any incident that is not prevented is seen as a culpable government failure.  This is a nonsensical way to consider terrorist risk and only plays into the hands of the terrorists themselves.
[normal]” 
[normal]Ayman
[normal] al-
[normal]Zawahiri
[normal], the current leader of al-Qaida, confirmed the point in a recent message marking the 12
[normal]th
[normal] anniversary of 9/11: “
[normal]We must bleed America economically by provoking it, so that it continues its massive expenditures on security
[normal].”  
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]See the overview in my report 
[normal]The Terrorism Acts in 2012 
[normal](July 2013), 1.7-1.11.  The first two developments were prompted by judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, as was the requirement that the gist of the national security case against them be provided to control order and now TPIM subjects.

[normal]Descriptions of each current TPIM subject, taken from open sources, are given in
