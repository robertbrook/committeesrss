defaultWdefaultritten evidence submitted by defaultOverseas Development Institute default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government should include 
defaultboth international and domestic initiatives
default in its review and measurement of energy subsidies.
default This should include support provided directly by UK departments (DFID, DECC, DEFRA, CDC, and UKEF), through development finance institutions, and other intermediaries.
default1.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs t
defaulthe
defaultre is currently no
default 
defaultsingle 
defaultGovernment
default department responsible for reviewing and reporting energy subsidies, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC)
default should 
defaultidentify a single department or inter-departmental committee to lead in measurement and reporting of UK 
defaultdomestic and international 
defaultsubsidies.
default1.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs a first step the Government should apply the framework suggested to this i
defaultnquiry 
defaultby 
defaultAlan Simpson
default 
defaultto all
default 
defaultcurrent 
defaultdevelopment finance support to energy projects:
default1.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder its commitment to 
defaultsupporting low-carbon growth and adaptation in developing countries
default, the Government should
default 
defaultseek to 
defaultidentify 
defaultand quantify 
default‘harmful’ subsidies provided in the form of development finance.
default This includes support to fossil fuel energy projects.
default1.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the context of G20 commitments on phasing out inefficient subsidies, there have been calls to set up an international body on fossil fuel subsidies
default. The UK has the opportunity to lead by example in tracking its own subsidies, and to call for international cooperation in defining, monitoring and tracking inefficient or high carbon subsidies.
default1.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere ‘harmful’ or inefficient subsidies are identified these should be rationalized, and resources used to promote low carbon energy development both in the UK and internationally. This can include 
defaultsupport
defaulting
default developing countries with subsidy 
defaultreview and 
defaultreform
default.
default1.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs subsidies have a significant impact on private investment in 
defaultlow carbon energy, this inquiry and its resulting actions should inform the Committee’s parallel i
defaultnquir
defaulty
default on 
defaultGreen Finance.
default1.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs subsidies are a significant and growing element of UK development cooperation, this inquiry and its resulting actions should be linked to the current inquiry by the International Development Committee on the Future of UK Development Cooperation.

defaultThe Overseas Development Institute (ODI) is a leading independent think tank on international development and humanitarian issues. Our mission is to inspire and inform policy and practice which lead to the reduction of poverty, the alleviation of suffering and the achievement of sustainable livelihoods. We do this by combining high-quality applied research, practical policy advice and policy-focused dissemination and debate. We work with partners in the public and private sectors, in both developing and developed countries.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe International Monetary Fund (IMF)
default uses the following definition for energy subsidies:
default&#xa0;
defaultEnergy subsidies comprise both consumer and producer subsidies. 
defaultConsumer subsidies arise when the prices paid by consumers, including both firms (intermediate consumption) and households (final consumption), are below a benchmark price, while producer subsidies arise when prices received by suppliers are above this benchmark 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDevelopment finance and other international support to energy projects in developing countries, impacts both prices paid by consumers and 
defaultrevenues
default received by suppliers in those countries.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe submission 
defaultto this i
defaultnquiry by HM Treasury and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)
default, did 
defaultnot include any reference to the UK’s support to energy projects in developing countries. 
defaultI understand that 
defaultthe Department for International Development 
defaultand 
defaultUK Export Finance 
defaultare to provide separate 
defaultsubmissions.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThough not considered explicitly within the inquiry’s questions, or in the report prepared for this inquiry by Oxford Energy Associates
default, the
default role of development finance in energy su
defaultbsidies was raised:

default,
default3.4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultby Platform in its written submission
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs it applies to development finance, the Government does not appear to match up to best practice methodologies in how energy subsidies are defined and scoped.default&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs noted, the 
defaultsubmission by HM Treasury and the Department for Energy and
default Climate Change (DECC) to this i
defaultnquiry
default, did not include the UK’s support 
defaultfor
default energy projects in developing countries. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the Department for International Development (DFID), the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK Export Finance (UKEF), and CDC (the UK’s development finance institution) currently 
defaultprovide financial and technical 
defaultsupport 
defaultfor 
defaultenergy 
defaultsector activities 
defaultin developing countries. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese Government departments (and investors of UK tax revenues) provide support to energy projects either directly or through Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). 
defaultThere is a need to strengthen reporting systems, to allow a better understanding of whether this support results in 
default ‘harmful’ or ‘inefficient’ subsidies.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEstimates of fossil fuel support from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and National Development Banks (NDBs) range from $15 to $150 billion annually.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultExport Credit Agencies (ECAs) are bilateral organisations that provide financial services to support the overseas trade and investment activities of private domestic companies. While exact figures on ECA support for fossil-fuel projects are difficult to obtain, ECA financing often dwarfs official development assistance and, historically, a large portion of projects have been fossil-fuel related. International estimates of fossil fuel support from ECA’s ranges from $50 to $100 billion annually.
default As with IFIs, it is unlikely that all of this financing actually qualifies as a subsidy, but again, lack of disclosure prevents a more thorough analysis.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn ODI review of 
defaultOil Change International’s ‘Shift the Subsidies’ database identified
default 
defaultthat between 2008 and 2011 the majority
default of IFI
default energy project support was to fossil fuel projects. Over 75% of energy project support
default from IFIs
default to 
defaultIndia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Brazil, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Venezuela, Uzbekistan, Algeria, and Nigeria 
defaultwas to fossil fuel projects. These are 12 of the top developing country emitters. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA basic analysis by ODI of UK finance
default to energy projects through IFIs
default identified 
defaultmore than
default USD 3 
defaultbillion (or GBP 2 billion) in support
default between 2008 and 2011. Support to fossil fuel projects
default 
defaultthrough IFIs 
defaultwas 
defaulttwice as large as support for 
defaultclean energy projects
default.
default 
default  
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA
defaultn initial
default review by ODI of UKEF support indicates a wide range of support to energy projects, and energy intensive industries and sectors in developing countries:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn June 2013 - UK Export Finance announced that it will guarantee $700 million of finance for UK exports to a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn November 2011 -UK Export Finance is guaranteeing a $1 billion line of credit for Petroleo Brasileiro Sociedade Anonima (Petrobras) to finance UK exports for Petrobras’ investment programme. The line of credit is to expand Petrobras’ oil exploration and production facilities off the east coast of Brazil.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2011-12 UKEF
default 
default issued guarantees for civil aerospace business amounting to £1,832
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion (out of £2.3 billion), generating premium of £65.6 million and supporting the delivery of
default&#xa0;
default132 aircraft in total. The aircraft were delivered to 32 airlines and operating lessors. Where the aircraft were fitted with aero-engines supplied by Rolls-Royce, ECGD support exceeded 30 per cent of the financing cost of the aircraft. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most important markets for UKEF were Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brazil, Dubai, New Zealand, Norway, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The export contracts supported were for a diverse range of sectors including mining, flight simulators, packaging, wall coverings, petrochemical engineering, logistics, automotive supplies, clean air equipment, cardboard packaging plant, buses, natural gas delivery systems, remote operating vehicles, plasma furnaces, air traffic control equipment, construction, automated tolling, telecommunications, defence vehicles, training services, industrial catalysts, water treatment plant, steel manufacture and processing and pipe manufacturing.

defaultfor energy projects 
defaultis not 
defaultdisclosed in a transparent manner (even taking into considerations of commercial confidentiality)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government currently states that it does not provide ‘harmful’ subsidies. Therefore it is impossible to assess if the Government has plans or targets to reduce or eliminate ‘harmful’ subsidies; nor its progress in reducing such ‘harmful’ subsidies.default defaultHowever, the Government has a defaultcommitment to supporting low-carbon growth and adaptation in developing countries, defaultunder which defaultthe Government should seek to identify and eliminate ‘harmful’ subsidies provided in the form of development finance. This includes support to fossil fuel energy projects.default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe submission by HM Treasury and the Department for Energy and 
defaultClimate Change (DECC) to this i
defaultnquiry
default, states that the UK does not have any ‘harmful’ energy policies, but does not address the 
defaultbroader 
defaultquestion of ‘harmful’ subsidies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government does not consider that any of its energy policies are ‘harmful’. Furthermore, energy policy (as with other Government policy) is subject to an initial impact assessment and subsequent monitoring, evaluation and review. This ensures that the Government can provide confidence and certainty while ensuring that the policy advances the Government’s objectives in a coherent way that provides best value for money. It also ensures that detrimental consequences can be quickly and effectively addressed.
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe HM Trea
defaultsury / DECC submission to this i
defaultnquiry
default defines fossil fuel subsidies as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaultFor the purposes of G20 work on inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, the UK, along with other EU G20 members, defines a fossil fuel subsidy as any Government measure or programme with the objective or direct consequence of reducing, below world-market prices, including all costs of transport, refining and distribution, the effective cost of fossil fuels paid by final consumers, or of reducing the costs or increasing the revenues of fossil-fuel producing companies.
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK’s 2012 submission
default to the G-20 on the Commitment to Rationalize and Phase Out Inefficient Fossil Fuel Subsidies
default states that the ‘
defaultUK has no inefficient fossil subsidies
default’
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, a
default basic review by ODI of IMF data
default on energy subsidies in the G20 countries indicated that the UK 
defaultranked
default 14
defaultth
default 
default(out of 20) 
defaultin terms of 
defaultthe scale of its
default support for fossil fuels (including petroleum pro
defaultducts, natural gas, and coal). This was e
defaultquivalent to almost USD 11 billion
default (GBP 7 billion)
default in 
default2011. The IMF does not indicate if these subsidies are inefficient or ‘harmful’, however, 
defaultits calculations of 
defaultUK energy subsidies 
defaulttakes into account
default inadequate pricing of externalities, including carbon.
default&#xa0;
default6.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the Government does not have targets to track or reduce ‘harmful’ subsidies either provided through 
defaultOfficial
default Development Assistance (ODA) or other forms of development finance,
default i
defaultnternational support for high carbon technologies and approaches may not be consistent with the Government’s 
defaultclear 
defaultobjective to support low carbon climate resilient development.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom HM Treasury’s Spending Round 2013
default: 
defaultThe Government will maintain its effort on urgent action to tackle climate change by supporting low-carbon growth and adaptation in developing countries. The UK’s pool of money for climate change projects in developing countries will be increased to £969 million, funded by DFID, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government remains committed to supporting those people across the world whose economies are most in need of development. This is in the UK’s national interest. Tackling global issues such as economic development, effective governance, climate change, conflict and fragile states provides good value for money.
