defaultI'm writing about the public transport in poor places. I live in a small village called St 
defaultNewlyn
default East, the buses there are appalling they are either late or don't turn up. I have rung them several times to complain but nothing happens. There are a lot of people who rely on the public transport either to go to work or other needs like medical.

defaultOn the 10:10 it's a small little bus and always so busy and most people fight to get on as it's always full from 
defaultNewquay
default and 
defaultits
default not good enough, the bus company are also so rude. I find it hard to get a job as the buses are so poor there are no late buses and the last one from Truro is 6:10pm and sometimes that doesn't even turn up, we get no buses on Sundays nor bank holidays and we only get buses every hour. The bus company just took the half hour one off from us when people relied on that one as well it always seems to be us who gets it all the time and they will be stopping our buses march next year and everyone is worried.
