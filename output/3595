default£50 Billion.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.   Total Journey Times were not taken into account by KPMG.default1.1 Currently if you are travelling to 
defaultLondon
default from The West Midlands, your local train will stop at   
defaultBirmingham New St
default for your connection to London Euston.
defaultIn future, you and your luggage will have to leave 
defaultNew St
default and travel by foot or public transport to 
defaultCurzon St
default to catch  HS2.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 If you are travelling from the 
defaultCoventry
default area, currently all 
defaultBirmingham
default to London Euston trains stop at 
defaultCoventry
default, HS2 will not, and so there will be less trains per hour from 
defaultCoventry
default to Euston.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 If you are currently travelling from The West Midlands to 
defaultDerby
default or Nottingham, your local train will stop at 
defaultBirmingham New St
default for your connection to the centres of 
defaultDerby
default or 
defaultNottingham
default.
defaultIn future, you and your luggage will have to go to 
defaultCurzon St
default, where the train will take you to
default 
defaultToton
default/East Midlands Interchange, from where you will transfer to new rail links to existing conventional lines which go to the centres of 
defaultDerby
default or 
defaultNottingham
default.
defaultThese links have not been 
defaultcosted
default as part of the HS2 Project.
defaultHS2 quote the travel time to 
defaultDerby
default as 12 minutes and 
defaultNottingham
default 15 minutes but omit the average waiting time between HS2 and the local train.
default&#xa0;
default2.   Conventional Train time improvements were not considered by KPMG.default2.1 There are 3 
defaultpinchpoints
default on the WCML which restrict the speed at which conventional trains can travel. These would take 5 or 6 years to re-engineer, not 17 years as stated by the Minister of Transport.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 Network rail are planning to introduce In-Cab signalling which will allow conventional trains to travel faster.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.   The KPMG was biased.default3.1 It only considered a philosophy that was biased towards its paymaster, HS2 Ltd.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 What is required is a totally independent report (Not from KPMG)..
default&#xa0;
default4. There is no Capacity Problem on The West Coast defaultMain Linedefault.default4.1 There are four simple tests to help us understand whether there is a capacity problem.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultSeats Occupied. defaultThe official figures show that WCML Intercity trains are only c59% full at
defaultpeak times (Ref. a).
defaultLower seat loadings than all other domestic long distance routes into any London Terminus.(Ref. b).
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultTrain Configuration.  defaultThere are four first class carriages, which are a third full at peak (Ref. c). 
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultTrain Length. defaultAt present, trains are a mix of 9 and 11 carriages. 12 Carriage trains could be run to all destinations except 
defaultLiverpool
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultTrain Pathsdefault. defaultCould more trains per hour be run at peak times?
defaultRe-engineering 3 pinch points, and introducing In-Cab signalling will increase train speeds and therefore enable there to be more trains per hour.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 51M have shown that by reducing first class carriages to 3 per train and increasing train length to 12 per train, the number of seats per train will be 693, over four times the current average for the route of 164 per train. Network Rail has agreed these figures..
defaultIt more than meets the 
defaultDft’s
default forecast of passengers doubling by 2037.
defaultIn addition by dealing with the 3 
defaultpinchpoints
default on the WCML and implementing In-Cab signalling, extra trains per hour can be run.  
default&#xa0;
default4.7 So the above proves that there is no Intercity Capacity problem.
default&#xa0;
default4.8 Commuter capacity to Milton Keynes and 
defaultNorthampton
default is currently a problem.
default&#xa0;
default4.9 There are simple solutions:
defaultIn the short term allow travellers to Milton Keynes to get off Virgin Trains at 
defaultMilton Keynes
default. Currently the trains stop there but only to pick up passengers.
default default default default defaultIn the medium term spend £260 million on a flyover at 
defaultLedburn
default Junction and use faster commuter trains to increase the number of trains per hour. This could be completed in 5 
defaultyears time
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.10 Longer term, commuter services to Hemel Hempstead and 
defaultWatford
default to Euston need to be resolved, but a £50 Billion National Rail Service cannot be promoted as a sensible solution. 
default&#xa0;
default5. The Strategic Case has not considered alternative options for The defaultUnited Kingdomdefault to spend £50Billion.default5.1 The Financial Times, The Economist, The Spectator and The Sunday Telegraph all reject the HS2 Project as a sensible way to spend £50 Billion.
default&#xa0;
default5.2 Only 5% of 
defaultUK
default travel is by train. There are so many other significant projects outstanding that would generate wealth in the North of England. Widening the M6, building new Motorways, getting rid of traffic jams that increase travel time to and from work on a daily basis.
default&#xa0;
default5.3 Significantly more Capital Spending on Schools and Hospitals is required, but not available.
default&#xa0;
default5.4 Upgrading all 
defaultUK
default conventional rail services is necessary.  
default&#xa0;
default6. The numbers quoted by HS2 are grossly incorrect.default6.1 The Financial Times proved that the Peak Time Travel figures were incorrect by 50%.
default&#xa0;
default6.2 Wider benefits of £15 billion are now claimed by HS2. 25 times the value implied in the January 2012 Analysis.
defaultPassenger forecasts include an additional 45,000 return trips daily, generated by the introduction of HS2.
defaultDividing £15 billion by 45,000 and by 300 effective days per annum provides £1,100 for each generated return trip. As only business travel will generate income, that equates to £3,700 per business trip.
defaultWorse still, the benefit of a generated trip is usually only 50% of a pre-existing trip, and therefore each pre-existing  trip is generating £2200, and each pre-existing business trip is generating £7400 per annum. 
defaultMultiply 730 Million round trips per annum (Quoted by Network Rail) by £2,200 and it implies that 
default£1,600 Billion will be generated, which is greater than our Nation’s GDP. (
defaultRef.d
default).
default&#xa0;
default6.3 The most appropriate comparator for 
defaultDft
default passenger forecasts is HS1 which has produced just 38% of its business case forecast; this throws considerable doubt on HS2 forecasts.
default&#xa0;
default6.4 Communication Technology Improvements will reduce the need for business travel.
defaultBritish Telecom Plc. is already demonstrating a very sophisticated version of 3D Conferencing.
default&#xa0;
default6.5 Jobs created by HS2 relate to the construction and maintenance of the HS2 Lines and Rolling Stock, and at Retail Outlets at the new stations. When asked, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce replied they had no idea what sort of additional jobs would be created by HS2.
default&#xa0;
default6.6 HS2 will not create more freight capacity on the WCML, during the 10 years it will take to build Stage 2, HS2 will virtually demolish the current freight capacity between 
defaultLichfield
default and the North. (Ref. e)
default&#xa0;
default6.7 HS2 cost/benefit ratio falls in the bottom 25% of 
defaultDft
default Intercity  Schemes and in the bottom 10% of their projects overall ( Ref. f ).
