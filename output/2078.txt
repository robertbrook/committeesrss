[[[&#xa0;]]]Introduction

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Background&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Devolution and decision-making proposals&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;16 September 2013&#xa0;

[[[Appendix 1:  Specific comments on draft Deregulation Bill in order to promote rail devolution to the North of England.]]]The provisions in the Deregulation Bill that relate to rail devolution are contained within section 22 and Schedule 7.  In order to deliver the rail devolution agenda for the North, Local Transport Authorities would need to have the following powers:&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to form an accountable corporate body capable of contracting with other authorities, Government and Rail Operators;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to provide or procure rail passenger services under the Transport Acts across the geography of the area; and,3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to have the benefit of an exemption order from the Railways Act 1993 franchising provisions whilst retaining various powers and protections enjoyed by the Secretary of State under those provisions.&#xa0;All authorities currently have the first power.  However, in the metropolitan areas of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire, the second power is potentially restricted by the 25 mile limit on the exercise of their PTE’s power to carry or procure the carriage of passengers by rail.  This restriction is anomalous, since LTAs outside metropolitan areas which have no PTE do not have this restriction and can use their general power of competence.&#xa0;As regards the third power for rail devolution to work practically, it is important that LTAs and PTEs which manage services exempted from the national franchising regime should enjoy the benefits of some of the powers and protections in relation to any operating agreement enjoyed by the Secretary of State in relation to franchised services.  The existing legislation does not allow this.&#xa0;The provisions of the Deregulation Bill will address these legislative obstacles by giving authorities most of the requisite remaining powers, and is therefore welcomed.  There are some observations to be made however:

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Appendix 2:  Comments of suggested questions ]]]&#xa0;

[[[General ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;It is our opinion that the changes in powers that we seek cannot be achieved through secondary legislation.&#xa0;The changes in powers that we seek will provide the most robust underpinning for the operation of the proposed devolved decision-making structures.  &#xa0;&#xa0;N/a.  &#xa0;4. Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly? &#xa0;Yes.  Our proposals will lead to better prioritisation of national and local resources into rail service provision.  The legislation removes unnecessary restrictions in the Transport Act 1968 and the  Railways Act 1993.  &#xa0;5. Will the draft Bill generally benefit businesses by offsetting other regulatory burdens?  Are there indirect impacts on other businesses from reducing regulation in specific sectors? &#xa0;No significant issues arising.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]6. To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses? &#xa0;The use of the powers the bill contains will enable rail services to be managed closer to the beneficiary, whether that be local businesses or rail passengers.  We fully expect this will lead to better services that more closely match their needs.  &#xa0;7. How does the provision in the draft Bill affect: i. protections afforded to individuals under human rights and equalities legislation? ii. employment law, skills and the labour market? iii. the environment, particularly in the management of waste? iv. the provision of education? v. the effective administration of justice? vi. social, wellbeing or health inequalities? &#xa0;No significant impacts. &#xa0;8.              Have the measures set out in the draft Bill been subject to adequate cost-benefit analysis on the basis of consultation with those affected? &#xa0;A proposition and business case for the rail devolution proposals was submitted to the Department of Transport in August 2013.  It is currently under consideration.  It sets out the business case for the proposed changes according to Treasury guidelines on business cases.  &#xa0;9.               Will any or all of the proposals have any significant economic or financial impact? Do you have any evidence of the impact that will aid the Committee in their scrutiny? &#xa0;The primary aim of our proposals is to achieve better economic outcomes from rail service provision by managing that provision more locally.  &#xa0;

[[[Power to ]]]

[[[disapply]]]

[[[ legislation no longer of practical use ]]]&#xa0;10.               Is a new “power to disapply legislation no longer of practical use” necessary or are there existing procedures which could be used to achieve the same effect?” (Clause 51)? &#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue. &#xa0;11. Is the meaning of the phrase “no longer of practical use” clear? In this context, what is meant by “practical”? Should it be defined and, if so, how? Will removing any of the provision proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill have implications for any other areas of regulation? &#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue. &#xa0;&#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue. &#xa0;&#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue. &#xa0;&#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue. &#xa0;&#xa0;Suggested further changes are set out in Appendix 1.  &#xa0;&#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue. &#xa0;

[[[A duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;This provision echoes the general objectives we have for rail devolution.  We have formed no other opinion on the legislation in this regard.  &#xa0;&#xa0;This provision echoes the general objectives we have for rail devolution.  We have formed no other opinion on the legislation in this regard.  &#xa0;&#xa0;We have formed no other opinion on the legislation in this regard.  &#xa0;&#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue.  &#xa0;&#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue.  &#xa0;&#xa0;We have no opinion on this issue.  &#xa0;

[[[Devolution ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Some of the relevant rail services in the North of England also serve Scotland.  Transport Scotland has been consulted on, and supports, the outline governance model for devolved North of England rail responsibilities.
