"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence submitted by Kelly Butler, BEAMA (HOT0060)I was asked at the Select Committee this week what my views were on shifting ECO into a different levy structure.\n&#xa0;\n \nAs I said at Committee, we are supportive of the supplier delivery model which is tried and tested for many years. They have purchasing power, routes to customers and marketing weight.\n&#xa0;\n However, we do feel that it may be more transparent for customers to pursue the old Standards of Performance approach which was a fixed price levy.\n&#xa0;\n This means the suppliers are tasked to meet their obligations at a pre-d\ne\ntermined price point.\n&#xa0;\n Under this approach the suppliers cannot apply wildly varying levies on to the customer.\n&#xa0;\n The positive is that we retain the target based obligation but with a cost ceiling.\n&#xa0;\n"
