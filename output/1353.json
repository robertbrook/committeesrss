"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Chartered Institution o\nf\n Highways a\nnd Transportation\n (TIC 025)\n&#xa0;\nThe mobility of older people in isolated communities.\nIntroduction&#xa0;\nThis note \nis provided by the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation, a professional engineering institution with \n12,000 \nmembers\n who work in the highways and transportation sector. CIHT members plan, design, build, operate and maintain transport systems\n and infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.\n&#xa0;\nThis note is concerned with issues affecting the mobility of older people in isolated communities.\n&#xa0;\nMobility in isolated communities&#xa0;\nThe National Travel Survey, an annual household survey of \nsome\n \n15\n,000 \nto 18,000 \npeople, provides data on the number of journeys per year made using different types of transport by residents of different types of area.  Figure 1 sh\nows the numbers of journeys for people of all ages.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1  Jour\nneys per year by different means of transport and different types of area (National Travel Survey\n, 2003-05)\nThe total number of journeys increases slightly as the size of an urban area reduces, but is \nsimilar\n for\n large urban areas (population over 250,000) to\n rural areas\n (settlements with \npopulations of less than 3,000)\n.  The number of car driver journeys increa\nses with reducing urban size\n and is particularly large in rural areas.  Walk journeys are similar in number across all urban areas, but fewer in rural areas.  Bus journeys are most frequent in London and the metropolitan conurbations, and very few in rural\n areas.\n&#xa0;\nAlthough the data in Figures 1 and 2 are for 2003-05, the situation has not changed greatly since that date.  Data corresponding to Figure 1 for 2011-12 is similar, with a small reduction in total trip numbers, a significant reduction in car use a\nnd increase in bus use in London, and a reduction in walking in the larger urban areas, but not in the smaller urban and rural areas.\n  In 2011-12, the total number of journeys in rural areas was fewer than in urban areas.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 2 shows similar data for \npeople in different age groups.\n  Figure 2a shows data for those aged 25 to 49, Figure 2b for those aged 65 to 69 and Figure 2c for those aged 80 and over.\n  These show, for those aged 25 to 49, the importance of driving a car outside of London, and particul\narly in rural areas, and the relatively little use of buses outside London and the metropolitan conurbations.  For those aged 65 to 69, driving a car is still important, but fewer journeys are as a car driver; bus use in urban (population 25,000 to 250,000\n) and small urban areas increases relative to that by middle-aged people.  For those aged 80 and over, the total number of journeys has reduced considerably\n, and car driving in particular. \n \nJourneys as a car driver are still more in rural than urban areas,\n as are journeys as a car passenger.  Bus use has increased, relative to that by those aged 65 to 69.\nFigure 2a

communities&#xa0;\nThe ONS publication ‘Regional Trends’ publishes data on the proportion of people of retirement age \nin individual local authority areas.  This makes it possible to determine the relationship between population density and the percentage of the population of\n retirement age.\n&#xa0;\nFigure \n3\n shows this relationship for all local authorities in Great Britain in \n2008.\n  The percentage ranges from almost 35% in some low density areas to under 10% in the hi\nghest density areas of\n Inner London.\n  The curve is similar, but le\nss extreme, for Wales on its own, and the range is even smaller for Scotland on its own.\n&#xa0;\nThese data show that older people are disproportionately located in low density areas, where it is difficult and expensive to provide public transport and other servi\nces, and where people depend on cars to reach the services and facilities that they require.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure 3   Population density and percentage of people of retirement age,\nfor local authorities, Great Britain  (Regional Trends)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDriving licence holding by older people&#xa0;\nThe percentage of adults holding car driving licences has been increasing, particularly for older people and most r\napidly for older women (Figure 4\na and \n4\nb).  These data are from the National Travel Survey.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure 4\na  Percentage\n of men from different age groups who hold full car driving licences (National Travel Survey)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure 4b  Percentage of women from different age groups who hold full car driving licences (National Travel Survey)\n&#xa0;\nFor men aged 40 to 70, licence holding h\nas saturated at about 90% of the population.  For older age groups it is rising, for younger it has fallen and is now rather steady.  For women aged 30 to 60, licence holding has saturated at around 80%.  For those aged 60 \nto 69 it \nappears to be\n saturat\ning\n at around 70%  For older women it is still increasing\n rapidly\n, though from relatively low levels, while for younger women it has fallen but is now rather steady.\n&#xa0;\nThe National Travel Survey can provide data on the proportion of driving licence holders \nwho cease to hold a licence at different ages, by following cohorts from the start of reliable NTS data in 1972.  Both men and women start to reduce licence holding after age 70, probably by failing to renew licences rather than by actively surrendering th\nem.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 5 shows the percentages of men and women of various ages who held a car driving licence ten years earlier but have now relinquished it.  Both men and women start to relinquish licences at around age 70.  By age 80, about 15% of women and 10% of\n men who held a licence at age 70, no longer do so.  By age 90, over 40% of women and 20% of men who held licences at age 80, no longer do so.  Thus by age 90, about 60% of women and 35% of men who had held car driving licences at age 70 no longer do so.\n&#xa0;\nEven before relinquishing a driving licence, most older drivers reduce the amount they drive as they age, and progressively avoid stressful driving (night-time, motorways, peak times and busy town centres).\n  This limits the activities that they are able to\n reach by car.\n&#xa0;\nA significant proportion of older people who live in car-dependent areas will stop driving before they are 90 years old.  Those who do will then be dependent on other means of getting about, which may be family and friends, taxis, community\n transport or possibly local bus services.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 5    The percentages of men and women of various ages who held a\ncar driving licence ten years earlier but have now relinquished it\n(derived from National Travel Survey)\n&#xa0;\nImplications&#xa0;\nBuses are little used in rural areas and small urban areas (populations 25,000 to 3,000).  Most journeys are made by car, either as driver or passenger, or on foot.  In 2011-12, 87% of all journeys \nin rural areas \nwere made by car or on foot.\n&#xa0;\nThe increasin\ng number of older drivers living in low density areas where they have to depend on their car to reach the services and facilities they need for daily life pose\ns\n a large potential problem.  Many will have to stop driving \nin their 70s or 80s \nand will then be\n dependent on others for the mobility they need.\n&#xa0;\nOne action that would cost little is a campaign to persuade older people to move from isolated communities to places where they would not be car dependent, before increasing age forces them to restrict or s\ntop driving.\n&#xa0;\nA second action would be to support the many excellent local authority programmes to advise older drivers on their ability to continue \nto \ndriv\ne safely\n, many \nof which provide some training i\nn ways to extend safe driving further into old age.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
