[[[Executive summary]]]The Marine Reserves Coalition recommends that:

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The plans for implementing the 27 so far approved MCZs.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[How those MCZs will be monitored, managed and enforced, and the needs of different stakeholders — including fishing, leisure and extractive industries — will be balanced against environment protection.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The plans to improve the evidence base for considering potential further Zones, including the priorities and funding of the research bodies that will undertake the necessary research.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What the balance of factors should be — social and economic factors, as well as environmental factors — in considering further potential MCZs.]]]&#xa0;

[[[The level of ambition in the programme to establish protected areas (including MCZs), compared with the need for biodiversity protection.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;27 January 20147&#xa0; IUCN (2003).
