"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Rugby Football Union [WAS0029]&#xa0;\nAbout the RFU&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIntroductionWomen’s rugby in England\n has seen a steady increase in parti\ncipation and interest in \nrecent years from a very low base a decade ago\n.  \nPrior to 2011 the \nRugby Football Union \nfor Women \nwas a separate entity to the RFU.  Following \nintegration\n the RFU’s full resources have been put behind developing women’s rugby at all levels of the Game.  \n&#xa0;\nWith the platform of the Women’s \nRugby World Cup \nin 201\n4\n, a home\n Rugby World Cup in 2015 and rugby sevens entering the Olympics in 2016\n for both men and women\n, there is a huge opportunity for \nthe RFU \nto broaden the appeal of the Game amongst women.  The RFU is also working to widen \naccess\n to women workin\ng and volunteering in rugby at all the levels of the Game, as we recognise that a balanced workforce will strengthen \nthe Game\n.\n  As this submission will show, English rugby has developed from a heavily male dominated sport \nto a more balanced one \nin just a f\new years, and this progress will continue.  \n&#xa0;\nFemale engagement in rugby union in England is far higher than participation, suggesting that there \nare significant perception\n or practical barriers to women playing rugby.  This submission \nconsiders these barr\niers and makes some recommendations to the Committee on how public policy might help women and girl’s rugby to flourish further.\n&#xa0;\nThe RFU’s submission is divided into core areas of activity \n–\n \nperformance, media, commercial, fan engagement, leadership, \nfacilities and rugby in schools.  The RFU has also made some recommendations to the Committee.\n&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPerformance rugby1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEngland women’s teams are world beaters.  The \nSenior\n 1\n5-a-side team has\n enjoyed a sustained period of success coming 2\nnd\n place in the last thr\nee successive World Cups 2002, 2006 and 2010 in England.  They have won seven RBS 6 Nations titles since \n2003,\n and six Grand Slams in the last decade.  The Senior 7 a-side team are also very successful, and came runners up in the 2013 7s World Series.\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nRFU supports three women’s elite teams – \nSenior\n 15–a-side, Senior 7-a-side, and Under 20s 15-a-side.  Previously more teams have been supported but a decision was made to consolidate the offering to ensure quality was higher and support better for those to\np teams.\n&#xa0;\n \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are approximately 1,000 women playing rugby to a very high level within the talent pathway. The talent pathway focuses on talented players from U15 to senior level.  The markers used to assess the health of the game have been agreed with S\nport England. \nCase Study 1: Player, Sarah Hunter \nEngland XIs Captain\n&#xa0;\nSarah began playing rugby league aged nine at primary school and started in union five years later. Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sarah attended Goathland Primary and Longbenton\n Community College in North Tyneside before gaining a BSc in Sport Science and Mathematics at Loughborough University. She is now a RFU University Rugby Development Officer for the South West.\n&#xa0;\nHer achievements feature winning the British Universities Cham\npionship with Loughborough, captaining Lichfield from 2005-09, the North East U18 and Northumberland U16 sides. Her international triumphs span the Six Nations five times, together with the European Championship, Nations Cup and European Trophy twice each.\n Personal accolades are players’ player awards at Novocastrians, Lichfield, Loughborough University and the England Academy.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU invested approximately\n £2.5m on women\n’s \nelite rugby\n last year, which \nincludes talent\n identification and development\n.\n&#xa0;\n This\n is lower than the investment in the men’s elite programme, due to a number of factors including that the RFU has to pay release fees from Premiership clubs\n \nfor the men.  \nThe RFU has been relatively well placed internationally in investment in the women’s \n7s programme\n.  \nThe England 15s programme is one of the best resour\nced in the world which allows England\n to compete at the top level.\n&#xa0;\n \n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThough the sponsorship value of the women’s Game is significantly lower than the men’s at present\n,\n which is why we offer \nsponsors rights to both (see 3.1)\n, the RFU is committed to investing in women’s rugby over and above the income it \ncurrently \ngenerates\n.  \nThe RFU does not receive any public funding from UK Sport to support the elite women’s programme but does from\n Sport En\ngland through to 2014.  Public investment in women’s rugby is vital, and we urge the Government to continue to invest in women\n’s rugby\n.\n \n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010 England hosted the fifth Women’s Rugby World Cup.  This marked a significant shift in interest in elite women’\ns\n rugby. (Case Study 2\n)\nCase Study 2: Major event, Women’s Rugby World Cup&#xa0;\nIn 2010 England hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup.\n&#xa0;\n  The competition was contested over 16 days with 30 matches between 12 nations. \n&#xa0;\nInterest in the tournament was far higher \nthan in the previous five WRWCs.  Thirteen matches were broadcast live by Sky Sports to 127 countries and all pool games were sold out with a total attendance of 30,000 over the tournament.\n&#xa0;\nThe final was held at the Twickenham Stoop with England \nfinishing\n as runner up\n.  \nIt\n was attended by a \nworld \nrecord crowd for the wo\nmen’s \n15\ns game of around 13,500, and saw a TV audience of half a million.\n&#xa0;\n2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMedia 2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe media can play a crucial role in challenging \nmis\nperceptions of rugby as a \nsport exclusively for men\n.  \nTh\ne RFU seeks to get the \nEngland\n women extensive coverage in print\n,\n broadcast \nand social \nmedia\n.  The RFU employs a full time Communications M\nanager to work on promoting women\n’\ns elite rugby. Promoting grassroots women\n’\ns and girls\n’\n rugby is part of the RFU’s Regional \nCommunications\n team’s remit\n and we have introduced targets to try and increase local coverage\n.\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRapid improvements in the coverage of \nelite \nwomen\n’\ns rugby have been made in the last decade.\n  Prior to 2009 there was little\n national coverage of women’s rugby.  \nEngland hosting the 2010 Women\n’\ns Rugby World Cup prompted a\n significant shift and the\n media became much more engaged.\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe WRWC\n \nsaw\n record media coverage and attendances (noted above\n in \nCase Study 2\n).  Sky Sports televised 13 games live in \ntotal\n,\n and \nthe commercial value of the \n‘known’ \nmedia coverage (excluding TV and radio) equated to more than £1.1 million.  The total ‘known’ media circulation figure saw our reach as exposing 77\n \nm\nillion\n people to E\nngland Women’s rugby.\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 2010\n,\n interest in England Women’s rugby has continued to increase with consisten\nt national media coverage.  \nAll the England women home games \nwere\n accessible to watch or listen live on Sky Sports, BBC, radio 5 live or\n \nRFU.com in \nthe \n2012/13\n season\n.\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe RFU media team feel that despite not being part of the \n2012 \nOlympic \nGames, the focus on women’s sport has boosted women’s rugby also.  The RFU has seen a shift in the media being more proac\ntive in promoting women’s rugby\n.\n  \nThe RFU b\nelieves that there has been a significant change in the mind\n-\nset of the media\n following 2012\n, and urges the Committee to encourage the media to push \nthemselves\n even further.\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU media team use the profile of the men’s squad and management team to drive\n coverage of the women’s \nteam and their \nachievements.  The RFU has found that joint press conferences are successful in raising awareness of the women’s Game\n, and result \nin \nmore press coverage than a standalone women’s team press conference.  Joint press c\nonferences will be held for the forthcoming QBE Internationals and RBS \n6\n Nations.\n&#xa0;\n3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommercial investment3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the Rugby Football Union for Women was integrated with the RFU, the RFU does not separate its sponsorship of women’s and men’s programmes.    The\n RFU has a strong commercial \nprogramme\n, and works with partners to ensure that they have a far-reaching and embedded place within England rugby.\n  This ensures the m\naximum commercial investment in\nto all aspects of the Game, including women’s rugby.\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany of \nthe RFU’s sponsorship agreement contain rights related to both the men’s and women’s programmes.  \nAmong our commercial agreements, O2 sponsors both the men’s and women’s senior \n15\ns, and Canterbury provides the match, training and leisure kit for both the m\nen’s and women’s programmes.\n&#xa0;\n The RFU’s sponsorshi\np agreement with Canterbury\n contain\ns\n a specific minimum allocation of kit for the women’s programme.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nCase Study 3: Heathrow ExpressT\noday (19\nth\n October 2013) the RFU has \nannounced \nthat Heathrow Express is the new Official Principal Partner of England Sevens.  \nThe premium air-rail link will feature on the front of the playing shirt for both the England men and women Sevens teams\n, and will be the Official Transport Provider for them\n.\n  The partnership\n \nalso \ngrants the right to imagery of, and appearances by, both the men’s and women’s squads.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGender-based tournament prize money is not relevant within the RFU.\n&#xa0;\n Success in international tourname\nnts results in payments to the U\nnion \nconcer\nned \nrather than payment to individual participants.\n  \nWhile neither the men’s nor the women’s senior 15-a-side players are employed by the RFU to play for England, the RFU has recently instituted an Elite Player agreement for the women’s players which, like\n that for the men’s, \nsets out the support from the Union in areas such as training and medical cover.\n&#xa0;\n4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFan engagement4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU has recently undertaken research on fans so we can better understand our customers with a view to making their experience better, and \nto widen\n access to rugby to attract those who don’t currently come to Twickenham.  M\natches at Twickenham attract a\n surprisingly high proportion of women\n \ncompared to similar sport\ns\n with approximately 35% attendees at rugby matches at Twickenham being female.  For th\ne \nMarriott London Sevens\n weekend the \nattendees are equally split between male and female\n, due to the youn\nger profile of the audience and the relaxed atmosphere of this particular event.  The RFU will be \nanalysing\n these results and working with focus groups \nto find out why there is such a gulf between the n\number of women who claim to be “passionate about rugby\n”\n, and the numbers that are motivated to participate in the Game.\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEngland Connected is the RFU’s campaign to ensure everyone feels part of the rugby community.  Written inside the sleeve of the England jersey for all England teams is the slogan \n“\nEngland Co\nnnected\n”\n to remind all players that they are part of \none\n \nEngland \nrugby family.  Players are also encouraged to support each other publically. \nEngland captain, \nChris Robshaw\n,\n regularly sent\n messages of support via social media to the women’s team for example.\n  This helps drive media attention and fan \nsupport\n from the men to \ngetting behind\n the women’s team\ns\n also.\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, England Rugby 2015 \nLimited (the RFU’s wholly-owned subsidiary establish\ned to deliver the Rugby World Cup 2015) \nhas launched “Front Row”.  Fans are encouraged to sign up to receive news first on tickets and volunteering opportunities for the Rugby World Cup.\n  \n27% \nof those who have signed up to date \nare female\n, \nreflecting atten\ndee numbers \nat Twickenham (4.1)\n.\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis shows the number of females engaged in rugby is currently far higher than those participating the Game.  Further analysis on the potential barriers of moving from a fan to \na participant\n is below (Section 6). \n&#xa0;\n5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeadership5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the same time the RFU is committed to ensuring increases in participation in all levels of rugby amongst women and girls, we recognise that \nwe have an important role to play in addressing any real or perceived barriers to women achieving leade\nrship positions in our sport.\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU\n as an employer is committed to\n achieving the National Equality Standard devised by Ernst and Young \nby 2015.  \nThe current gender ratio of \nemployee\ns is approximately 70% male and 30% \nfemale,\n with initial investigative re\nsearch indicating that average salaries by grade and gender does not give rise to equality issues.\n&#xa0;\n \n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU is led by an Executive team of nine, including four female Directors which includes Chief Commercial Officer, Sophie Goldschmidt\n (Case study 5\n); \nLegal and Governance Director, Karena Vleck, HR Director, Julia Dell, and ER2015 CEO,\n Debbie Jevans CBE (Case Study 4\n).\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEngland Rugby 2015 is a wholly owned subsidiary of the RFU and has been set up to run the 2015 Rugby World Cup.  \nThe gender ratio of emp\nloyees is currently is 59% male, 41% female. 50% of ER2015’s Executive Team is female with Debbie Jevans CBE (CEO) Joanna Manning Cooper (Director of Comms and Marketing) and Rachel Brace (Head of HR). \n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU Board currently has three independent non-exe\nc\nutive Directors with one female B\noard member.\n&#xa0;\n Price\n W\naterhouse Coopers have made a series of recommendations to increase diversity on the RFU Board and the RFU is committed to responding with a development plan that will aim to increase the potential pip\neline of women for these positions.\n  The RFU wishes to emphasise to the Committee that although setting targets for Board diversity can be helpful, the crucial change is to ensure that there is a healthy pipeline of women coming through the governance stru\nctures in sport to feed into positions of leadership in rugby.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase Study 4: ER2015 CEO, Debbie Jevans CBEDebbie Jevans joined England Rugby 2015 as Chief Executive in October 2012.  Debbie is the first female ever to be appointed as Chief Executive \nof a Rugby World Cup. Leading the Rugby World Cup 2015 Tournament Organising Committee, Jevans\n \nand her team will deliver the third largest global sporting event, hosted in England between September 18 and October 31 2015. Preparations for the Tournament; w\nhich will see 48 games played across the breadth of the country, with attendances of over 2 million and an excess of 500,000 spectators travelling into England, are well underway.  \nPreviously Director of Sport for LOCOG, Jevans was part of arguably the mo\nst successful Olympic and Paralympic Games in history.  Previously she ran her own sport consultancy firm working with clients such as the International Tennis Federation (ITF), BBC, the International Rugby Board (IRB), International Cricket Council (ICC) \nand UK Sport.  Debbie is also a member of the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s Committee of Management and Championships Committee and sits on the UK Sport Major Events Panel.\n&#xa0;\nCase Study 5: RFU Board member, Sophie Goldschmidt \nSophie Goldschmidt has been \nthe Rugby Football Union’s Chief Commercial Officer and a member of the RFU Board since July 2011, joining from the National Basketball Association (NBA) where she was Senior Vice President for Europe, Middle East and Africa Operations.\n&#xa0;\nThe Chief Commerci\nal Officer role at the RFU gives Sophie responsibility for all the union’s commercial programmes in addition to marketing, digital and resourcing.

The advantages of Touch is that it is great for fitness, men and women can play together, and the rules are very simple so it is an easy way to start playing rugby\n – all of these poi\nnts address barriers to women and girls starting to play rugby\n.  Of those signed up to the O2 Touch rugby programme, 18% are female.  This is a good start but we aim to increase the proportion of female participants further\n as overall participation with To\nuch rugby increases\n.\n6.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGrassroots rugby relies on the support of England rugby’s 60,000 volunteers.  The RFU aims to increase volunteering in rugby by both men and women.  The RFU’s development team is working with potential volunteers to identify how the RF\nU could attract more female volunteers to support their local rugby clubs.  \nCase Study \n9\n is on Sophie Morris, a volunteer at Millwall \nR\nugby \nC\nlub and a great example of\n how volunteers support our\n member clubs. \nCase Study 8: Club volunteer, Sophie Morris Sophie is a Sponsorship and Marketing Consultant and volunteer.  Her involvement in rugby began when she was a Director of Marketing for a Financial Services firm which sponsored the Barbarians games at Twickenham.  \n&#xa0;\nIn 2012 she wanted to do some volunte\ner work and searched on a Government website for opportunities and found Millwall Rugby Club.  \nThe Club welcomed her expertise and she was appointed the\n Development Officer, looking after sponsorship, marketing and press.  Having not played team sport sinc\ne school, she took up Touch and then \nmoved on to contact rugby, playing for Millwall’s ladies team.  Sophie now sits on the Essex County RFU Development Committee.\n&#xa0;\nAmong Sophie’s many achievements are increasing sponsorship income to Millwall Rugby Club b\ny more than 500%, and the recruitment of the club’s first ever sponsor of the Ladies team.  Sophie sits on one of the RFU’s six regional Rugby World Cup Activation and Legacy Groups which were set up to capitalise on the opportunity of 2015 to increase par\nticipation.\n&#xa0;\nAll the above roles are voluntary, and Sophie has recently set up her own Marketing consultancy, specialising in rugby sponsorship.  She is keen to promote sponsorship in the women’s side of the Game.\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are \napproximately 2000\n community rugby clubs in England and \nof these\n 77% have security of tenure over their ground\n.  The RFU supports clubs through loans, grants and advic\ne to ensure that these\n facilities are \nhigh-quality and well managed.\n  Clubs will drive increases in female \nparticipation and so it is vital that improvements are made to facilities to make them more attractive to women, although facility improvements will of course benefit all participants.\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConstituent Bodies (governance structure which broadly mirrors county b\norders) work with local Rugby Development Officers (50 full time RFU employees) to identify the needs of rugby clubs within the context of national priorities.\n  \nOne of the factors the RFU asks clubs and CBs to consider when seeking investment is the club’s\n plans for women and girls activity.\n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch by the RFU and the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation found that the main barriers to women and girls playing rugby are the changing and clubhouse facilities.  \nBetween 2003 and 2012 the RFU and Rugby Football\n Foundation has invested £23.4m of grants and loans in 763 clubhouse projects with a total project cost of £72m, focusing on improved changing facilities and clubhouses. The improvements to clubhouses are designed to meet “RFU Guidance Note 5: Clubhouses a\nnd Changing Rooms” which has been developed to produce facilities that meet the needs of all users of rugby clubs (adult, youth and child, male and female). A large number of these projects are focused on supporting clubs to grow the number of women and gi\nrls teams as well as male provision, but we do not count them separately.\n \n7.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU plans to \ninvest £10m into 500 rugby clubs as part of its Lead Up and Legacy Programme (\nthe\n RFU’s legacy plan to use the 2015 RWC to grow participation). Changing room improv\nements remain a key part of this programm\ne and in the first round £600,000 went to eight projects. Round Three\n of the programme is particularly focused at transforming social spaces in clubhouses with £2.5m investment. The RFU is developing support and gui\ndance for clubs participating in this round to design and furnish these spaces in line with the findings of the RFU’s work with the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation.  \n&#xa0;\n8. Rugby in schools8.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU works in schools, colleges and universities to provide \nopportu\nnities for girls to play rugby.  Encouraging school age girls to play rugby is vital to the future health of the Game in general participation and elite success.  \n8.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt primary \nschool \nage the RFU want to see \nstudents\n receive a broad and balanced PE ex\nperience, and then get more opportunities to be involved in sport specific activities and pla\ny rugby in Key Stages 3 and 4.  \nThe RFU’s primary focus for delivering schools-based rugby is at secondary level as this is where we can have the bigger impact on \nparticipation in encouraging young people to tak\ne up and continue playing rugby beyond school age.\n  \n8.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are 3126 schools affiliated to the England Rugby Football Schools Union, many of which have good quality sporting facilities.\n As part of the Rugby Wo\nrld Cup legacy work, last year the RFU launched \nthe \nAll Schools \nProgramme \nto \nhelp\n more state secondary schools to offer rugby to their students (Case Study \n10\n).\n8.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU provides coaching, kit, equipment and teacher training, and in a typical year our natio\nnwide community rugby coaches would impact on an estimated 750 secondary schools.   \n&#xa0;\nCase Study 10: All Schools Programme In 2012 \nThe RFU launched All Schools.  \nAll Schools was founded on the principles that ALL schools can play rugby, ALL of t\nhe \nchildren in the school can\n play, and rugby has a positive impact on ALL of the school. \n&#xa0;\nThe RFU provides tailored support to each school, depending on their needs, challenges and opportunities\n over a three year period\n.  The RFU are therefore pleased that \nmore than half of the schools in Phase 1 opted to have girls-only or mixed sessions in their schools.\n&#xa0;\nAll Schools is one of seven area areas identified by the RFU to deliver the greatest participation legacy for the game in the lead up to the Rugby World \nCup 2015 and beyond.  The RFU has set up All Schools to \nhelp more state schools that haven’t traditionally played rugby to offer the Game to their students.  We aim to help 400 state secondary schools new to rugby to become self-sufficient rugby playing sc\nhools and linked into their local rugby clubs by the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n&#xa0;Schools have been identified in small clusters, allowing them to play rugby against each other locally.  The schools in Phase 1 2012-13 (100) and Phase 2 2013-14 (an additional 100\n) have been selected on a number of factors including: local rugby club need for young players, proximity to potential RWC2015 venues, and areas of the country that to date haven’t had a large rugby union following.\n&#xa0;\nRugby generates whole school improvemen\nt and the RFU encourages coaches and teachers to help youngsters understand and practice rugby’s core values – \nTeamwork, Respect, Enjoyment, Discipline, Sportsmanship.  Teachers from schools which have participated in Year 1 have reported improving behavio\nur, enhanced learning and increasing self-esteem amongst students.  \n&#xa0;\nCanterbury, the kit partner of England Rugby, is the Official Partner of All Schools.  Each school taking part in the programme is given the opportunity to attend a Canterbury kit design\n workshop.  The students design their own team rugby shirt, whilst learning about the core values of rugby, the pride associated with the shirt and the importance of colours, logos and emblems, which is made up and presented to the schools at Twickenham.\n  \n&#xa0;9. Conclusions and recommendations \n9.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU warmly welcomes the Committee’s focus on women and girls\n’\n sport.  Much progress has been made in recent years in developing women’s rugby from grassroots to high performance, and the RFU is keen to work with our partners and stakeholders to \nenco\nurage more females to play\n. \n9.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RFU makes the following policy sugg\nestions to the Committee for Members’ consideration:\n9.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStability for Government’s sport policy and public investment in grassroots sport-\n \nNational Governing Bodies are a key delivery partner for increasing participation amongst women and girls\n. Stability in \nGovernment \npolicy\n and investment\n will\n allow \nus and other \nNGBs\n to concentrate on delivering the agreed participation outcomes.\n9.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic investment in elite sport – \nThe RFU urges continued public investment in elite women’s sport, and would welcome \nconsideration of whether sports not currently supported may be eligible in the future\n.\n9.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncentivise girls’ and women’s opportunities for grassroots clubs- \nThe \nGovernment could consider additional rate relief for comm\nunity clubs which offered opportunities f\nor girls and women.\n \n9.2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPromoting media coverage- \nthe Government should continue to encourage \nthe \nmedia \nto provide more coverage of\n women’s sport\n,\n and \nuse its \nown \nmedia platforms\n and assets\n to promote women’s successes\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
