"LGP83\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Jane Green BA Hons Economics and Admin1. I am an independent economist and researcher and have made a particular study of incinerator PFIs. I campaign for Zero Waste and am a West Midlands ‘Green Leader’. In the past year I have spoken at the Zero Waste International Alliance C\nonference in San Francisco and to the European Parliament in Brussels in support of a petition concerning lack of community ‘Access to Justice’ in regard to waste infrastructure.  \n2. Summary Points\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe drive to build municipal waste incinerators began abo\nut 15 years ago following the introduction of the Landfill tax which aimed to drive waste away from landfill which releases climate-changing methane gas. The amount of diversion from landfill thought possible \nby \nrecycling was just 25%.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince then recycling\n has reached 42% in England and 52% in Wales with a welsh target of 70% by 2025. The waste hierarchy which prioritises prevention, re-use, recycling and composting, over landfill and incineration, became a legal requirement in England and Wales in 2011. \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nN\nearly all local authority incinerators have been built using PFI/PPP and because of the extremely high costs, often totalling around £1 billion each, the Government has been distributing \n£3.5\n billion in PFI credits to around \n28\n projects as subsidies.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowev\ner the need for councils to build their own incinerator no longer exists as there is not only an overcapacity of UK ‘residual’ waste treatment predicted for 2015 but there is now a highly competitive waste market for all waste treatment including ‘end of p\nipe’ processes such as incineration at far lower gate fees.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe risks to council budgets of 25-30 year incinerator contracts has risen dramatically as it is the council who takes the risk of increases in recycling or future Environmental Legislation leadin\ng to unpaid or underpaid spare capacity.\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBoth DEFRA and the Treasury have a major involvement in a council’s decision to choose incineration and both have their own measures of Value for Money which are not in line with those of VfM for individual local au\nthority Business Cases. The Treasury is prioritising large infrastructure projects to achieve \nnational\n economic growth.  DEFRA is agreeing \nlocal\n VfM based on \nnational\n targets limited to only 2020 and has not attempted to cost the risk of foreseeable enviro\nnmental legislation\n or\n recycling rates exceeding 50%\n.\n \ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The NAO have now begun an investigation into DEFRA’s VfM guidance to councils with regard to incinerator procurement but this may be too late for those councils who are presently signing up to 25-30 y\near contracts which involve unnecessary extra £millions from council budgets. \nh)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI believe it is vital that the DCLG step in now t\no call for a moratorium for incinerator\n projects \nwhich have yet to have contracts \nsigned\n. This would\n \nallow time to \ndetermine goo\nd value for \nmoney and whether the economic and environmental objectives of local authorities are being met. \nBackground\nThis paper will argue that local authority incinerator contracts are being signed without due diligence in relation to whether they are\n (a) affordable; (b) represent value for money; and (c) \nwill \nnot burden the Councils with unpredictable costs in the future. \nI\nn particular \nit considers the assessment and m\nanagement of risk and argues that this\n is inadequate for \nproject\ns\n wi\nth a lifespan of\n 25-30 years which\n could therefore put future Council finances at risk.\nIncinerator project\ns\n should be able to prove that they can\n deliver a commercial benefit to the Councils \nover their\n 25 \n– 30 \nyear economic life\n despite\n \nc\nhallenges \nto \ntheir \nbusiness viabi\nlity \nfrom\n an increasingly competitive waste market, increased recycling and foreseeable legislation which would restrict the types of waste which can be burnt. \nFor a council a rigid long term incinerator contract represents risks which could be mitigated by a more flexible modular system and by accessing the cheaper waste market. For the private consortium (Private Partner) the contract represents an opportunity to ensure a high guaranteed income for 25-30 years, whilst not having to face competition from an increasingly competitive waste market. Financial Parameters\n1. \nAffordability\n \nCouncils \nshould be\n satisfied that the additional cost of the \nincinerator contract is\n affordable\n in relation to:\n1. a)\n \nCouncil Budgets\n The es\ntimated increase in costs for an\n incinerator above the existing waste budget, the ‘affordability gap’, will\n usually\n begin at \naround \n£6 million p\na\n. The total costs of the incinerator \nare usually\n around £1bn. \nA c\nouncil ha\ns to state that the \n‘\nlikely increases in costs’\n \nhave been included \nin\nto its MTFP. Given that most\n MTFP\ns\n \nare only for 3-4 years \nthis measure cannot mitigate risk for a 25 year project. The risk to Council finances has increased since the financial collapse, with reductions to council budgets making even medium term predictio\nns of ‘affordability’ problematic. The ring-fencing of waste contract payments will necessitate greater percentage cuts to other Council budgets.\nSpare capacity and minimum tonnages\nAll potential new \nincinerators\n \nare being \nbuilt with \nexcess \ncapacity and t\no\n maintain commercial viability\n will need to sell this space at a price equivalent to the total cost per tonne, including finance and running costs of the plant, estimate\nd to be around £130\n per tonne. As \nc\nouncil\ns\n will be contracted to pay for \nagreed \ntonn\nage\ns for the 25 year period,\n every tonne which is not used, or used for ‘substitute waste’ which needs Council subsidy, will effectively put up\n the price per tonne to over £13\n0.  This in effect acts as a ‘minimum tonnage’ imperative.\n2. \nOpportunity Costs\n \nAcc\nessing the waste market\nThe Opportunity Costs of incineration have increased dramatically \nfor \ncouncil\ns in the past several years and even for those whose procurement began 3-4 years ago. \nMSW can now be tendered on the competitive waste market far more cheaply (even for incineration or other ‘end of pipe’ solutions) and on shorter contracts than PPP new build. Best practice in waste management is also bringing the combined collection and di\nsposal costs down when recyclables, including food waste, are collected separately and the waste treated ‘per stream’.  \nThere has been transparency in waste treatment costs for the past 6 years with the publication of WRAP’s annual Gate Fees Reports\n whic\nh ‘\npresents a summary of gate fees for a range of waste treatment, recovery and disposal options. The indicative gate fees reported here are based on survey information from local authorities, MRF operators, compost facility operators, waste management com\npanies (WMCs) and other market intelligence’.\n The opportunity costs of not accessing the waste market are therefore now very clear with all treatments apart from landfill being considerably cheaper than incineration and in the case of recycling actually pa\nying councils. The information in these reports allows local authorities to make better informed decisions regarding waste ma\nnagement options but there is little\n evidence that the council\ns use this information.\n \nOvercapacity and falling gate fees\nAdrian Ju\ndge, now MD for Waste and Bioenergy at\n&#xa0;\nthe UK Green Investment Bank, has warned against the risks of an oversupply of residual waste treatment capacity, ‘\nTo properly assess the risks associated with finding the ‘right’ sort of substitute waste at this scal\ne requires a detailed understanding of the local C&amp;I waste market, and this comes at a time when funders have a lowered appetite for merchant risk’\n.\n \nWaste is now a commodity like any other and one for which there is increasing competition in the UK and a\nt a European level; due in part to overcapacity of incineration\n and increasing recycling. All incinerators in the West Midlands area have spare capacity and older incinerators like Coventry which have the historical advantage of established waste supplier\ns are able to charge around half the price which new build incinerators charge to remain commercially viable.\nDEFRA in their most recent ‘\nForecasting 2020 Waste Arisings and Treatment Capacity’\n \nsuggests that \n‘Spare capacity in EfW plants in Northern \nEurope may tempt some LAs to exploit the relatively low gate fees there through short- to medium-term contracts rather than enter into longer-term contracts for investment in new capacity in the UK’\n2. (f) \nOpportunity Costs of \nnot following \nBest Practice O\nptions\nThe\n opportunity cost of not following Best Practice \nin \nwaste management\n \ncould \nbe avoided by \nthe \nexamination \nof best (and worst) practice across other Councils\n.\n \nDEFRA does not \nprovide\n fully costed case studies \nof best practice \nto enable\n councils \nor\n t\nhe public \nto\n make comparisons. \nHowever\n,\n \nEunomia Research \nr\necently \nproduced a Report for a Council \nprocuring an \nincinerator\n. It gives cost comparisons taking into account changing waste management systems and accessing the open waste market. Instead of a \n240,000 tonne incinerator, they estimate that\n&#xa0;\n£10 million p\na\n would be saved\n&#xa0;by simply diverting recyclable materials out of the PFI contract and onto the open market. By getting out of the contract altogether\n&#xa0;\n£20 million per year could\n be saved.\nA\n Wychaven\n District Report ‘\nValue for Money. Waste service comparisons’ \n researched a comparable group of authorities and found that half of the authorities with high levels of recycling, including separate food waste collections, actually pay \nless for their waste s\nervices\n. They compare Wychaven at 44% recycling with South Oxfordshire at 65% but who pay 10% less on collections. \nThe Audit Commission’s document ‘Well Disposed’\n recommends that councils, ‘\nWork in partnership with WCAs where relevant, to ensure that was\nte management performance is optimised across the local area. This may involve supporting investment in new collection infrastructure in WCAs, where this could improve cost-effectiveness for council taxpayers in the long term’\n. \nOften councils do not look\n a\nt the savings that could be made in combined disposal and collection costs\n.\nThere \nis usually\n no \nup-to-date \nindependent \nreview \nundertaken \nof\n \ni\nncinerator proposal\ns\n \nin order \nto assess the opportunity cost of best practice elsewhere\n or risk assessments\n, or\n to compare\n 25 year incinerator contract\ns\n versus modular and more flexible options. This \nis important because \nthe \nearly \nproject weightings which \ndetermine\n a choice of incineration \nare \nheavily\n weighted towards\n ‘technical’ and\n ‘bankability’ \naspects \nand do no\nt reflect present day environmental concerns or employment and social dimensions.\n6. \nDEFRA must agree Variation on VfM grounds.\n \nDEFRA is being investigated by the National Audit Office in relation to its Value for Money Assessments for LA waste incinerati\non plants.\n A decision by DEFRA to back a scheme and offer grants of millions of pounds is usually enough to convince a council that building its own multi-million pound incinerator is a good business proposition. However DEFRA’s decisive role in assessing\n \nthe long term risks of changing waste legislation and technologies, management systems and markets in relation to costs and VfM is now being examined. \nIn fact DEFRA explains its promotion of incinerator projects in terms of the short term National impera\ntive to meet landfill reduction targets by 2020\n rather than developing sound long term environmental and economic waste solutions for Local Authorities. As we approach the closure of the ‘waste treatment capacity gap’ by 2020 those councils singled out by\n DEFRA to get incinerators are left to face disproportionate risks compared to non-incinerator councils who are free to access short term contracts for spare capacity whilst developing newer, cheaper and greener solutions, accessing the waste market and be\nnefitting from the sale of recyclates.\nThe degree to which DEFRA performs an independent scrutiny function for incinerator proposals has been questioned in Worcestershire where there is no record of communication between WCC and DEFRA on issues \nto do with \nVfM. In fact the P\nroject’s Risk Matrix lists DEFRA itself as a risk needing mitigation: ‘\nSenior officers to ensure early and continuous engagement with key DEFRA officials throughout process \nto ensure DEFRA buy in to scheme’. \nTreasury influence\nThe \nTreasury’s influence over the type of waste infrastructure available to LAs is via the PFI and WI grants it allows DEFRA, its provision of infrastructure guarantees and its choice of a Private Finance system which is biased towards large inflexible infrast\nructure on long contracts.\nPFI projects have been described as ‘eye-poppingly’ expensive by Hereford MP Jesse Norman and member of the Treasury Select Committee. The Treasury, in its overriding desire for infrastructure projects (which are funded ‘off-bala\nnce book’) to stimulate ‘growth’ has formed an ‘\nunholy alliance’\n with the private contractors ‘\nwhich all but bypasses relevant departments in its drive to get deals done’\n.\nFollowing the multi-billion\n \npound bail-outs of PFI hospitals in 2012 the NAO has wa\nrned of the cumulative impact of funding infrastructure which is paid for from budget revenue. The Public Accounts Committee when criticising the ‘spend now, pay later’ approach of the Treasury stated; ‘\nWe were surprised to find that the Treasury did not have a grip on trends in some key areas of risk or plans for managing them.’\n \nContractual Parameters\n1. (b) \nBringing the Waste Contract into compliance with current and foreseeable legislation.\nThe OBC risk register for W\norcestershire’s\n proposed incinerato\nr \nis typical of other incinerator OBC’s when it \nstates that if ‘\nthe councils significantly exceed their recycling targets\n [and] \nthe plant is oversized\n’, it will be ‘\nan additional cost to the Councils\n’. A change in ‘\nthe calorific value of delivered residual\n waste’\n is also\n \nstated to be ‘\nan additional cost to the Councils’. \n The Councils are named as the ‘risk owners’ in the Risk Matrix for changes in legislation or guidance either at European, National or Regional/local level. \nThese are very great risks for \nc\nouncils who will be unable to respond to the rapidly changing waste world\n without paying the private partner\n to provide extra new waste services or infrastructure. This process has already been witnessed by WCC where Mercia’s 15 year old waste contract ha\ns needed 56 variations costing £49 million in order to bring services in line with new environmental policy and legislation. \nThe EU Waste Directive is proposing to ban the incineration of all recyclable and organic material by 2020\n \nwhich \ncould clearly resu\nlt in incinerators becoming economically unviable. \nIt \nappears \nthat the recommendations of the \nTreasury Select Committee\n that ‘\nPFI is only likely to be suitable where the risks associated with future demand and usage of the asset can be efficiently transfe\nrred to the private sector’ \nhave not been followed.\nDEFRA, who are tasked with applying the trajectory of waste policy in relation to incinerator sizing for waste contracts, forecasts recycling rates peaking at around 50% in 2020 and remaining static for t\nhe next 25 years. This appears to contradict both reality and its own Waste Strategy for moving towards a Zero Waste Society. Wales is already exceeding 50% nationally and like Scotland aims for 70-75% within a few years. The Audit Commission’s document ‘W\nell Disposed’ states ‘\naround 70% of household waste is readily recyclable’ \nwhich is confirmed by the top performing councils in England who are now achieving around 70%. \nIncinerator business cases are being passed by DEFRA without sensitivity analysis for\n 60 and 70 % recycling being carried out.\n \nDespite being a prime example of infrastructure involving long-term commercial risk incinerator projects have not had either the academic research or governmental monitoring and oversight which other large privatel\ny funded LA infrastructure have received. \n&#xa0;\nIn contrast to the conservative predictions of DEFRA, and those parts of the waste industry wishing to secure incinerator contracts, the waste industry as a whole is gearing up to move its investment to the newer\n forms of waste treatment and sees ‘\nthe waste market is evolving into one with shorter-term local authority contracts and contracts based on specific waste streams across municipal and commercial sectors.’ \nInvestment will come from ‘\nCorporate investors…, t\nhe GIB…, overseas buyers attracted to both the scale of investment and pace of change in the market and Private equity attracted to the growth potential in areas such as recycling.’\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n \nComparing the cost of alternative waste treatment options\n.\n \nWRAP Gate Fees Report 2013 \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-gate-fees-report-2013\n Judge, A., \nDesigning for a changing \nfeedstock suppl. \nTolvik Consulting Ltd\n \nhttp://www.tolvik.com/markets-and-data/Designing-for-a-Changing-Feedstock-Supply.pdf\n \nResidual Waste Infrastructure\n Review\n. \nEunomia Consulting. \nhttp://www.eunomia.co.uk/product.php/113\n \n \nForecasting 2020 Waste Arisings and Treatment Capacity\n Feb 2013 revised October 2013 p 12\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251567/pb13883-forecasting-2020-waste-arisings-131017.pdf\n \nAssessing \nthe feasibility of an alternative plan for waste management in Cornwall. \nNovember 2012.
