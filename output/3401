default&#xa0;
defaultSince my complaint against
default&#xa0;
default LHB
default&#xa0;
default about my father's sad death 
default(above) was upheld by
default 
defaultthe Ombudsman,
default&#xa0;
default I've been struggling along in the system to read the two remaining documents in my father
default’
defaults file, in which I am apparently named.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrivate Eye have printed two articles on my case, one last
default&#xa0;
default August.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt present, I've
default been regurgitated by the PHSO
default&#xa0;
default - after my case was out forward by my MP David Davies - with a metaphorical paperwork clip round the ear, as its
default 
defaultcommunication isn't exactly user-friendly.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSo,
default&#xa0;
default having to fight my case, as an ex-journalist I did some res
defaultearch into the PHSO.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs I see that
default&#xa0;
default you are
default&#xa0;
default on the committee, I thought that you might be interested in
default 
defaultsome statistics and
default&#xa0;
default I might be in with a chance that you might actually read it.

defaultrun by trained lawyers.
default&#xa0;
default:::::
default&#xa0;
defaultThe other thing that I've done is to almost write a helpful guide to NHS complainants for phsothefacts website .. An anti-PHSO group.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Helpful Hints for Bereaved complainants going through the NHS
default 
defaultComplaints System
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default You witnessed negligence, your r
defaultelative died a sad and difficult
default 
defaultdeath, but be warned,
default&#xa0;
default as you emerge from
default&#xa0;
default the funeral service .....these forces are already aligned against you.
default&#xa0;
defaultHealth Boards
default&#xa0;
default1. The medical staff, who lie, as they wish to keep their jobs.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Human nature really. 
defaultWho could complain?
default&#xa0;
default..Well, you could.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Because 'complain' is what the NHS says that you are doing -
default&#xa0;
default even if
default 
defaultyou just want to know what happened, who was to blame and stop it
default 
defaulthappening to anyone else.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom that point on, think if yourself as a ta
defaultrget.
default&#xa0;
defaultShould you choose the Complaint system?
default&#xa0;
defaultIf you don't sue, and trustingly take your case through the Ombudsman,
default 
defaultyou will be badly out of pocket. So, if you are poor, don't bother.
default&#xa0;
defaultBecause,
default&#xa0;
default even if your case is upheld, it will end up on some obs
defaultcure
default 
defaultwebsite. Which nobody reads.... Well, maybe you.
default&#xa0;
defaultEven worse, nobody is held accountable and the names of those negligent
default 
defaultare not included in the final report. They will be free to carry on regardless
default&#xa0;
default in their careers. And you will be able to see th
defaultose ultimately responsible happily in ever better-paid NHS jobs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is because the Ombudsman only has the power to recommend change
default 
defaultand cannot hold the authority to account.
default&#xa0;
defaultFaint criticism
default&#xa0;
defaultIn effect, the Ombudsman's power is to
default&#xa0;
default say: 'Tut'.
defaultSometimes, a very cross
default&#xa0;
default Ombudsman even raises his/ her game to a:
default&#xa0;
default'Tsk, tsk,
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFor this small outcome -
default&#xa0;
default and going it alone without a lawyer -
default&#xa0;
default you could
default&#xa0;
default face:
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default Disbelief
default&#xa0;
default of everything that you didn't happen to photograph
default*
default&#xa0;
default Personal criticism as 
defaultto your motivations
default*
default&#xa0;
default Being played by professional NHS game players
default*
default&#xa0;
default Be ignored
default*
default&#xa0;
default Being lied to and lied about
default*
default&#xa0;
default Shouted at by the more aggressive caseworkers
default*
default&#xa0;
default And, eventually,
default&#xa0;
default possibly years later, and having clawed your way up to the top rung of 
defaultthe complaints ladder...arrogantly dismissed, without explanation.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe plus
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the plus side, the board chief executive could be embarrassed enough to make some improvements for patients if your case has been covered in the press.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. The complaints
default person - whilst simultaneously making soothing noises to you, promptly relays your complaint to an external professional
default&#xa0;
defaultcompany, employed to defend the NHS and advise the Board on how make you go away.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTactics
default&#xa0;
defaultA common tactic by complaints persons 
defaultis to answer their own questions....whilst ignoring yours. This strategy will be repeated at every stage of your journey.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo get used to it....and expect
default&#xa0;
default it. It's designed to annoy you enough in the sincere hope that you will
default&#xa0;
default go away - so that any NHS 
defaultnegligent death care can just carry on 
defaultu
defaultnnoticed as before.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultExample:
defaultQ. 'Who has authority over the deceased's body?'
defaultA. 'In answer to your question:....Enclosed you will find our guide to the mortuary temperatures and gurneys'.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPaperwork ping-pong
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe complaints person will try and fob
default&#xa0;
default you off by ping-ponging your requests for information in an attempt to tire you out.
default&#xa0;
defaultDon't be tempted to tear up letters which say:
default&#xa0;
default 'I hope this has been helpful' after you have even been driven to using a 
defaultmagnifying glass in the vain hope of finding any tiny thing of help.
default&#xa0;
defaultJust laugh at this cynical
default&#xa0;
default double-speak with the rest of the complainants, amongst whom it is now notorious.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHealth Boards can also legally withhold crucial files - which you may
default never know exist -
default&#xa0;
default if they assess it in your 'best interests'
default&#xa0;
default not to receive them.
default&#xa0;
defaultNb For 'your best interests' read 'their best interests'.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf you argue that certain files must logically exist and you are legally entitled to them
default&#xa0;
default ...they may be sud
defaultdenly found with an apologetic note on 'photocopying errors'.
default&#xa0;
default Or they have suddenly 'gone missing'.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt's no use asking why important details have been changed ..ie time of death..with no counter-signature,
default&#xa0;
default because everything will be put down to a 'pape
defaultrwork error'.
default&#xa0;
defaultSeemingly a 'paperwork error' is a get-out-of-jail card for all medical negligence.
defaultAs it is the board's strategy is to be blamed by 'Tut' for 'substandard paperwork', rather than 'Tsk, Tsk'd'
default&#xa0;
default for medical negligence.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLegal knowledge is
default necessary
default&#xa0;
defaultThe key here is to know that you might eventually get the files/answers, by extreme perseverance, around the six month mark.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, if you are not an expert in the Access to Health Records Act, Freedom of Information Act and Data Protectio
defaultn Act and gave to learn about such things, your work hours will
default&#xa0;
default increase on this low estimate.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis complexity makes it almost impossible for you to avoid employing a lawyer.
defaultClever compo-seekers will have gone this route from the start.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultHealth Board hopes that you can't afford one.
default&#xa0;
defaultBecause you are grieving, nice and still trying to understand what went wrong and don't want to sue anyone...
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately,
default&#xa0;
default the board sees the sign invisible which reads: SUCKER!
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultReview
defaultEvery time y
defaultou get a quarter-answer to your request you may be so bold as put your request for information into Review.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Review takes up yet more of
default&#xa0;
default your teeth-gritting time.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut obviously
default&#xa0;
default it makes work for the NHS senior officers, who have completed the Adva
defaultnced Gobbledegook course and are advised by private contractors,
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default You may not understand the result of your Missing Information Review.... But,
default&#xa0;
default then again, you are not supposed to. So don't feel a failure if the reply is totally 
defaulti
defaultncomprehensible.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou
default’
defaultr
defaulte
default supposed to give up, as you are a defeated bereaved person who cannot cope with your grief and constantly being played by the Health Board at the same time.
default&#xa0;
defaultYour work Hours: ( If you already partly understand the Acts)
default&#xa0;
default : 22
defaultIf you don't and have to 
defaultlearn from scratch and research cases etc
default&#xa0;
default - 40 hours.
default&#xa0;
defaultPaperwork pile: 6 inches
default..But 8 inches , if you include basic legal research.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. The complaints company,
default&#xa0;
default which is on a contract with the NHS and whose continued employment is dependent on 
defaultgetting
default&#xa0;
default rid of your complaint and also may advising withholding
default&#xa0;
default files legally due to you to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou will probably never know they exist. Everything they do is private and protected by law. And yet they are able
default&#xa0;
default to write comments about you on the NH
defaultS file.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnything they like..... True, untrue..libellous. What they think your motivations are.
defaultWhat they think you ate for breakfast, or how your sex life is..you will never know.
default&#xa0;
defaultHealth Boards increasingly farm out work to private companies..
defaultEven in 
defaulta proven case of medical negligence their contribution remains secret.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. The chief nursing officer, who will always defend the medical staff and disbelieve the complainant - as he/she also has a very well paid job to defend.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default And that job is:
default&#xa0;
default Chief Nursing Officer (God).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHe/she may imply that you are lying and construct their own reality of the scene both you and your family have witnessed.
defaultAnd this cannot be contradicted - being written by what is considered an immaculate being within th
defaulte NHS.
default&#xa0;
defaultAny summary of CNO( God)'s
default&#xa0;
default opinion will be so couched in approval of staff you know to be negligent,
default&#xa0;
default you can dismiss it. Because, even with your limited medical knowledge,
default&#xa0;
default you will be able to see that it's unbelievably biased.
default&#xa0;
defaultYour work Hours
default: 36 .. Sudden
default&#xa0;
default increase by having to learn and check medical terms.
defaultPaperwork pile: 13 inches -
default&#xa0;
default more, if still grappling with legal stuff.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. The chief executive - who may ask all the right questions -
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default if smart.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut
default&#xa0;
default will believe the chief 
defaultnursing officer as he/she hasn't a clue as to what to do otherwise and has to write lots of reports on 'Care and Dignity'
default&#xa0;
default and about how well the board is doing. And, in particular, the CEO.
default&#xa0;
defaultThen rush off to reorganise ... Well...everything.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is a 
defaultpermanent state. Until the next chief executive arrives to reorganise again and write more reports snappily entitled
default&#xa0;
default 'Dignity and Care'.
default&#xa0;
defaultCEO correspondence is
default&#xa0;
default fruitless anyway.
default&#xa0;
defaultYour work Hours: 36.5
defaultPaperwork pile:
default&#xa0;
default Remains just over 13 inches.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNb. A small tip as to the general competence of a Health Board...
default&#xa0;
default...Ask how many reports it has with 'Care' and 'Dignity' in their titles.
defaultThe higher the number, the less likely it is
default&#xa0;
default that there will be either generally available.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default:::::
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ombu
defaultdsman
default&#xa0;
default1. The complaint handler/ caseworker, whose intelligence can range from the level of a dim - but arrogant - call centre operative, who likes to shout a bit at callers, to that of a reasonably understanding person.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow your
default&#xa0;
default case goes will depend 
defaultentirely on your luck in the caseworker draw and not how just it is.
default&#xa0;
defaultComplainants are advised to repeat the same thing (as in parrot training)
default&#xa0;
default in the hope that the exact nature if the complaint can be repeated by caseworker to the clinical advisor 
default....even though actual understanding of content might be absent.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. The clinical advisor
default&#xa0;
default.... Who either might be an NHS zealot , arrogant enough to make a diagnosis contradicting both
default&#xa0;
default deceased patient's GP and the doctor who signed the death ce
defaultrtificate.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default....Or a person who wants to do a good job ...but keeps making incisive comments like :
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 'Why wasn't this patient on The Liverpool Care Pathway?'
default&#xa0;
defaultBut missing the major fact that a patient has had neither food or fluid for a day.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is up to you to read and re-read the files detailing your relatives dying moments and point this out.
default&#xa0;
default You will cry a lot.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut keep pointing out all the unanswered - but central - questions.....even those complicated medical
default&#xa0;
default and legal
default&#xa0;
default ones that 
defaultyou only partly understand.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen you do, in retrospect, you will be
default&#xa0;
default (technical term here...)
default&#xa0;
default 'truly gobsmacked'
default&#xa0;
default at what has been missed.
default&#xa0;
defaultYour work Hours: 45
defaultPaperwork pile:
default&#xa0;
default 20+inches
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PHSO
default&#xa0;
defaultIf there was a government cup for 'Being 
defaultExtremely Useless and Expensive'
default&#xa0;
default ..this organisation would win hands down.
default&#xa0;
default(Yes, that's even including a late challenge by the UK Border Agency, which has now been allocated an entire class of its own).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PHSO relies on the well-known fact that inep
defaultt shouty caseworkers and frankly weird clinical advisors at stage 2
default&#xa0;
default are never wrong.
default&#xa0;
default And that 98.6 percent success rate by the Ombudsman in investigating cases is easily achievable every year.
default&#xa0;
defaultStats never lie:
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default The PHSO
default&#xa0;
default only investigates 1.4 perce
defaultnt of the complainant cases recommended to it by MP's, who are the only people allowed to refer complaints to the PHSO.
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default The PHSO costs taxpayers
default&#xa0;
default £32m a year.
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default Arrogance rating : Off-the-scale percent. Nuclear winter communication style.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo, hav
defaulting struggled through the system -
default&#xa0;
default sadly bereaved, becoming enraged and now simply flabbergasted -
default&#xa0;
default do not take this final rejection slip personally.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat were the chances? You would have only
default&#xa0;
default been in a marginally better position if you had posted yo
defaultur complaint down a drain.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, for eternal optimists who simply must:
default&#xa0;
default1. The caseworker who 'reads' your complaint.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default This person may not get:
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default your name right
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default the correct legal Act/s involved
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default or, most shockingly, what you are 
defaultcomplaining about.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite being hampered by this creative lack of concentration, the caseworker is entrusted with a large rubber stamp....which reads 'W'.
default&#xa0;
default( For Wastepaper bin,
default&#xa0;
default of course..shame on those that thought anything else).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultcaseworker can happily consign your case to the bin for a reason that you cannot possibly comprehend.... as it is astonishingly one that you haven't complained about. Simply because the Ombudsman's decision is final.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou will hope to get a letter which e
defaultxplains why your case was rejected.
defaultHope on.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PHSO does not have to explain its reasoning to a mere prole like you.
defaultIf it did, you might be able to ask why it peremptorily dismissed your case, as, if an explanation was given,
default&#xa0;
default it may seem that you
defaultr case
default&#xa0;
default had been inadvertently mixed up with someone else's and the explanation made no sense.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSo you may never know...Unless if course, you are prepared to start all over again on the ultra-masochistic Freedom of Information/Data Protection request pa
defaultper trail.
defaultReread strategies to 'withhold information'
default&#xa0;
default and 'dismissal of anyone who is chippy enough to ask about our private government business' tactics above ).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDon't be dispirited that the old ploy of
default&#xa0;
default simply not answering your question ....but an
defaultswering the one they'd wished you'd asked...
default&#xa0;
default is used. Yet again.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are some fine examples of this on the 'What Do They Know'
default&#xa0;
defaultwebsite if you are in the mood for laughing and groaning simultaneously. Removal of tight garments is advised for your own 
defaultprotection.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNb. * Don't forget to ask for handwritten notes. The PHSO forgets to include them.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ.
default 
defaultHow many of the letters that are addressed specifically to Dame
default 
defaultJulie Mellor, does she read herself?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA As we receive a great many enquiries each 
defaultyear (in 2012/13, we received 26,961), it would not be possible to extract this information for you without exceeding the appropriate limit as set out at section 12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis example, now used as compulsory training f
defaultor all would-be complainants:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. The Review Team
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the Review team just 
defaultsign stuff off and don't
default&#xa0;
default bother to read the files and so are simply unaware if what you complained about ... let alone understand it, it is a complete waste of time appealing to it.
default&#xa0;
defaultNb
defaultDon't bother complaining about any member of this team, as your comp
defaultlaint goes
default&#xa0;
default back to ....and is run by: (You've guessed it..) The Review Team.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe P
defaultHSO has no ethics officer as it
defaults staff are all trusted to get everything at least 100 percent , which, if course is better than the
default&#xa0;
default98.6 percent that the previous Ombudsma
defaultn was able to achieve.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. The Ombudsman
default&#xa0;
defaultThis semi-mythical creature, is hardly ever sighted
default&#xa0;
default by complainants and exists only in places of power.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is no use appealing to her office for sense, as bereaved complainants might be savagely put in 
defaulttheir place by a braying henchwoman.
default&#xa0;
defaultNb. It is more difficult to be informed the Ombudsman's timetable than it is to get the HRH, Her Majesty the Queen's.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn fact, it is rumoured that, statistically,
default&#xa0;
default a bereaved complainant might as well write to the Q
defaultueen as they would be more likely to get a signed invite to a garden party, at Buckingham Palace, than a meeting with the Ombudsman.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default (* MP's note: This means you too).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTime taken:
default&#xa0;
default About four years
defaultPaper pile:
default&#xa0;
default Leaning Tower of Pisa standard.
default&#xa0;
defaultE
defaultnd result:
default&#xa0;
default*
default&#xa0;
default Refurbishment of hospital ward. Now the dying have single
default&#xa0;
default rooms to die in and
default&#xa0;
default the nursing standards seem to be a lot higher.
default&#xa0;
default* Private companies are still able to write exactly what they like about people on NHS files - even though they may not even be the patient 
default- if the complainant chooses the Ombudsman route.
default&#xa0;
defaultPeople may not know:
default&#xa0;
default*who is writing about them
default*why they 
defaulthave written it
default* or what it says.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 'public interest'
default&#xa0;
default argument is not even worth being considered by the PHSO as one which overrides the secrecy
default&#xa0;
default of private companies -
default&#xa0;
default which may wish to withhold crucial files to protect the NHS,
default&#xa0;
default and even retain 
defaulttheir lucrative contracts on the basis of doing so - even in proven Ombudsman- upheld negligence cases.
