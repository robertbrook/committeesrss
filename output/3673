[normal]Following suggestion will drastically improve safety of cyclists and motor cyclists in Britain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I suggest cyclists should attach beacon flashing lights to their helmets which will make them visible to everyone even in day light the way it does with 
[normal]police cars etc. Such battery or reachable battery operated beacons are available at nominal price in market. This system will motivate cyclists wear their helmets.

[normal]This idea would also make motorcycle ride
[normal]rs safer
[normal] too by making them visible to everyone e
[normal]ven from distance.

[normal]Would you agree that unless we find a better system we should exploit proposed
[normal] to make cyclists
[normal] safer.
