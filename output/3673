defaultFollowing suggestion will drastically improve safety of cyclists and motor cyclists in Britain.
default&#xa0;
defaultI suggest cyclists should attach beacon flashing lights to their helmets which will make them visible to everyone even in day light the way it does with 
defaultpolice cars etc. Such battery or reachable battery operated beacons are available at nominal price in market. This system will motivate cyclists wear their helmets.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis idea would also make motorcycle ride
defaultrs safer
default too by making them visible to everyone e
defaultven from distance.
default&#xa0;
defaultWould you agree that unless we find a better system we should exploit proposed
default to make cyclists
default safer.
