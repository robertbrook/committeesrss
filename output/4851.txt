[[[Supplementary written evidence submitted by The Football Association [WAS0048]]]]&#xa0;Many thanks for inviting me and The Football Association to give evidence to the Select Committee last week. I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with a little further information following our discussion which perhaps you can consider as supplementary evidence. I shall also share this letter with the members of your committee too.Two points which seemed to strike a chord with the committee were mixed football and the new structure the Women Super League, so I wanted to briefly expand on those two points for you.The FA reviews mixed football on a yearly basis and last approved an extension of mixed-football to U15s in May this year. This was completed on the back of extensive research with Brunel University and consultation within the game. We will continue to review the need for extending the age range of mixed football based on physical development, empirical evidence and legal expertise.The FA continues to oppose mixed-football in adult football and prohibits it within any of its affiliated teams or competitions; this is based on the lack of evidence of safety. The FA is, however, keen to review this matter regularly, but it should be noted that we do so from the perspective of equality rather than encouraging female participation. Girls taking part in mixed football are nearly always those who have played regularly before and only amount to approximately 500 players per year in England.In terms of elite football, we are very encouraged by the progress made by the FA Women's Super League since its inception. In the last year FAWSL attendances have increased by 23 percent with major games regularly attracting over 1,000 spectators. A new broadcast platform has also been secured for 2014-17 with BBC and BT Sport working in partnership to broadcast live senior internationals and The FA Women's Cup with weekly domestic coverage of the FAWSL on BT Sport.The introduction of a summer league was completed in consultation with the women's teams across the country and the overwhelming majority were in favour of what has proved to be a successful change. I'm aware that a concern was raised about the level of funding for teams in the Women's Premier League today compared to before the FAWSL was introduced, however this simply does not compare like for like. The WPL today is the third tier of English women's football whereas it was the top tier previously; it is the status of the League and not the name of the League that should indicate the level of comparison in this instance.Should you like further information on these or any other topics please do let me know as I would be happy to provide more information for you for the final report. I am sure that the final document will not only examine the work done by national governing bodies to raise the profile of women's and girls' football in recent years but, alongside sporting recommendations, provide non-sporting recommendations for Government which will help improve participation.For example, the Government should be commended for recent changes to the CASC programme which sees further financial help extended to sports clubs. However, if the Government were to provide additional benefits such as further rate relief or tax benefits for providing specific programmes for girls and women, we would see an increase in community lead interventions for women's sport.The FA would also recommend that Government considers ensuring that Local Authorities have a statutory obligation to provide sport and produce a Local Authority Development Plan which explicitly considers girls' and women's provision. 80% of football is played on Local Authority facilities and, as a non-statutory provision, local investment in sport is beginning to be hit hard especially in northern England.Finally, football has experienced a real change in the perception of elite women's football in recent years thanks to improved media coverage of the product. We recommend Government continues to encourage broadcasters to promote better coverage of women's sports. Football has undoubtedly benefitted from the increased coverage we have received by being able to attract sponsors who want to be associated with the product and want to activate their sponsorship- our football festivals sponsored by Continental Tyres and supported by UEFA and Sport England have reached over 10,000 girls this year at 33 Football Festivals and match day fanzones. Unfortunately the Women's Super League is still heavily subsidised by the sponsorship and media rights from our men's team; however, we are putting the building blocks together for a long term sustainable product.Many thanks again for inviting me to give evidence and I wish you success in creating the final report.&#xa0;Kelly SimmonsDirector of National Game and Women's FootballThe Football Association&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
