[normal]the 
[normal]Committee asked
[normal] DFID
[normal] about the UK’s pledge to double aid to Africa. The UK’s commitment at Gleneagles in 2005 was to double bilateral spending in Africa between 2003/04 and 2007/08.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Aid to Africa increased by 57% between 2003 and 2008 (from £914m to £1,434m).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However, since 2011 over £2bn has been spent bilaterally 
[normal]each year
[normal] by the UK in Africa (more than double 2003 amount).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours sincerely 
[normal]&#xa0;
