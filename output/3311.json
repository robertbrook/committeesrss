"&#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDefence \nCommittee’s work during the period since Easter 2012 has continued to focus strongly on continuing operations in Afghanistan and preparations for the drawdown of the UK military \ncommitment in 2014.\n \nWe\n published \na\n major report on \nSecuring the Future of Afghanistan \n in March 2013; during the course of this inquiry \nwe\n \ntravelled to\n Afghanistan in November 2012, visiting Kabul and Helmand. \nWe are\n also conducting another visit to Afghan\nistan\n and Pakistan\n in the autumn of this year.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to focussing on ongoing operations, we have also been looking ahead to\n the 2015 Strateg\nic Defence and Security Review\n (SDSR)\n, continuing to assess the\n success and \neffect\ns\n of implementation of the\n 2010 SDSR and assessing em\nerging threats such as cyber\n, which will form an important part of the next Review. We have also focussed on \nthe operation\n of the Armed Forces Covenant\n and how the Ministry of Defence is managing within its financial settlement, \nin particular scrutinising steps taken to improve the efficiency of its equipment \nacquisition\n. \nWe\n visited Washington in May this year in the context of \nour\n \nwork on preparing for the next SDSR and \nour\n work on Afghanistan.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n also completed a major report o\nn the \ndefence \nimplications of Scottish independence\n with the intention of helping to inform debate in the run-up to the referendum next year.\n \nWe visited Scotland d\nuring the course of this inquiry\n.\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Defence Committee has on a number of occasions in the past held seminars to discuss its future programme. The last of these sessions was held at the \nRoyal United Services Institute (RUSI) in Oc\ntober 2012, and provided an opportunity for \nus\n, \nour\n staff and specialist advisers, to engage with academics and others including the Chief of \nthe \nDefence Staff to identify a programme for the remainder of the Parliament. \n \nWe\n took the unusual step of publis\nhing \nthis programme in a press release on 10 December 2012 with the intention \nof\n stimulating comment and engagement with outside bodies\n and commentators\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have\n not had occasion to commission specific pieces of research, but \nwe \ncontinue to receive treme\nndous support from RUSI. In the context of ongoing work on \nTowards the next Defence and Security Review, \nthe Committee has been extremely grateful for work \nundertaken\n by RUSI to encourage academics to engage with the inquiry and contribute material, some o\nf which may be used as evidence.\n \n \nIn approaching this \nwork we\n decided to pursue four different strands of inquiry that will feed into \na\n major \npiece of \nwork next year on the SDSR. Each of these strands – which are initially “paper-based” inquiries -  is bei\nng led by different Member\ns\n of the Committee who will act as “rapporteur\ns\n”.\n The\n reports on the\nse strands will be drawn together with other material to inform a major report next year. This represents a new long-term strategic approach for the Committee.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\ne have\n for some time adopted the practice of holding formal planning meetings prior to the commencement of each inquiry with the intention of identifying \nfrom whom we want to take \nevidence, \nwhat \nwe are\n seeking to achieve and ensuring that proper considerat\nion has been given to the timing of publication\n of reports\n. \nAs part of our development of a long-term communications plan, we held a briefing for Defence editors to\n accompany the launch of \nour\n forward programme in December 2012.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Commi\nttee has taken a number of steps to explore di\nfferent ways of taking evidence as well as engaging with a wider audience. In the context of\n our\n inquiry into \nFuture Army 2020\n, \n the Army Rumour Service \n(AR\nS\nSE) \nis hosting\n a web forum seeking views on \nthe \nGovernment\n’s plans for the future of the A\nrmy, with the intention of informing questions for \nour\n evidence sessions.\n It is often difficult for \nus\n to obtain the views of Service personnel on matters that affect them and the forum \nprovided an invaluable oppor\ntunity to do so\n. \nWe are extremely grateful to the House of Commons Digital Outreach Team for their help in setting up the forum and using it to \nprovide ongoing help in engaging \nS\nervice personnel wi\nth wider parliamentary activities. \n \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n took\n oral evidence\n from children, parents and teachers\n at Wellington Academy, Tidworth,\n as part of \nour\n inquiry into the \nArmed Forces Covenant\n in Action?\n: Educating the children of Service Personnel\n. \n We would like to put on record again our gratitude firstly to the children\n, parents and teachers we met and also to the school authorities for facilitating this session. \nWe\n also made use of web for\na\n hosted by the NAO \nto\n solicit evidence from Service p\nersonnel\n and their families\n directly in relation to \nthis \ninquiry \nand also our i\nnquiry \ninto the \nArmed Forces Covenant\n in Action?\n: Education of Service Personnel\n.\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n \nundertook professional \ntraining on \nimproving questioning techniques\n. \nWe\n held \ntwo\n session\ns with a trainer\n, analysing some of \nour\n past performances \nin questioning high profile witnesses, and working to identify which approaches to questioning worked best\n.\n This was a challenging and worthwhile exercise which we hope has had a positive impact on our \nwork\n.\n It has also inspired us to hold regular private “wash-up” sessions after each evidence session to discuss the effectiveness of the session and identify what needs to be followed up in future sessions or in writing.\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have taken a number of steps to contribute to the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill (further details are provided in p\naragraph\ns 22-23\n below). \nWe note that f\nour Members of this Committee were\n appointed to\n the Public Bill Committee exam\nining the Bill. \nT\nhis undoubtedly contributed to the expertise of the Committee scrutinising this imp\nortant piece of legislation\n and, indeed, \nprovided valuable insights for the Members involved\n. However, we do note that\n t\nhe burden placed on th\ne\n Members \nconc\nerned \nwas considerable and allowances h\nad to be made in scheduling our \nprogramme.\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n agreed to appoint Gisela Stuart as\n an\n informal rapporteur \non\n the FCO Balance of Competences Review: Foreign Policy Report.\n She maintained a wa\ntching brief for the Committee on this work.\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have been mindful of the Liaison Committee’s recommendations on keeping reports short and accessible without too many recommendations.\n However, \nwe have\n otherwise decided against altering the general style of \nour\n reports, including the manner in which recommendations are highlighted.\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere have been a number of occasions on which \nwe have\n taken further action pursuant \nto Government res\nponses to \nour\n reports. \nWe\n criticised the Government response to \nour\n report on \nthe \nArmed Forces Covenant in Action?\n:\n Military Casualties\n, specifically in the areas of Service family support and the long term needs associated with brain injury. \nWe\n issued a press notice highlighting these deficiencies and followed up these matters with Ministers via correspondence and a progress review after six months. Similarly, following receipt of the Government response \nto our\n report\ns on\n \nFuture \nMaritime Surveil\nlance\n, \nDefence and Cyber-\n security\n and \nOperations in Afghanistan\n, \nwe wrote\n to\n the MoD to highlight areas where the response\ns\n failed to address particular conclusions and recommendations.\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have\n for some time adopted the practice of holding a re\ngular follow-up of \nour\n reports, \nsix months after publication of the Government response. \nWe wish to place on record the MoD’s readiness to assist \nus\n in this work, including its submission of a follow-up paper on \nour\n report on \nFuture \nMaritime Surveillance\n b\nefore it had actually been commissioned \n(as noted above, we had been critical of the initial Government response)\n. \nWe also note the very full and constructive follow-up paper that was provided by the MoD on \nour\n report on \nThe Armed Forces Covenant in Action\n?: Accommodation.\n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the process of following up our report from February 2012 into \nDeveloping threats: Electro-magnetic pulses\n, the Committee initiated a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the threats posed by a possible space weather event or\n an\n attack \ncausing an\n electro-magnetic pulse \nevent\n. We were concerned that analysis of this emerging threat should be given a high priority within Government\n; we have published correspondence arising from our meeting with the Prime Minister, detailing actions\n that he has taken in response to the session, on our website. \n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have taken steps to apply for debates in backbench time, securing a debate \nin the House \non Armed Forces Personnel on 6 December 2012.\n This debate was centred around a number of the \nCommittee’s publications, including its reports on \nThe Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Military Casualties; The Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Accommodation; and  the Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2010-11\n and evidence taken on the wor\nk of the Service Complaints Commissioner of the Armed Forces. Further details of \nour\n contribution to informing debate in the House and in Westminster Hall is provided at paragraph \n28\n.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are currently engaged in a series of strands of activity building towards a major report in 2014 \nto inform\n the next Strategic Defence and Security Review. Whilst this document is now produced within the Cabinet Office, it\ns significance for the\n identification of threats to the UK and\n decisions relating to the allocation of resour\nces within Government will be fundamental. It will therefore have a key role in determining the future of the \nA\nrmed \nF\norces after 2015, and \nwe hope \nto have a significant input into the process.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur report on \nDefence and Cyber-Security\n has formed part of our important analysis of the emerging threats to UK security. \nThe \ninquiry explored whether the high profile given to the cyber-threat in the UK is m\natched by a coherent plan and chain of command in the event of a major cyber-attack on our national infrastructure or our national interests.\n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe undertook a major report into \nFuture Maritime Surveillance\n in response to the decision announced in the \nSDSR 2010 to cancel the Nimrod MRA4 programme. Rather than revisit the cancellation of Nimrod, we  examined the implications of the decision for future maritime surveillance capabilities and assessed how the resultant capability gap would be managed. This \nincluded an assessment of the strategic requirements for military and non-military maritime surveillance capabilities, the various ways they are provided currently and in the future and how this would be incorporated into work on the next National Security\n Strategy and next Strategic Defence and Security Review. A particular area of focus was cross-government cooperation, including the work of the Maritime Security Oversight Group and the National Maritime Information Centre.    \n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe continue to place a high priority on our work in scrutinising the Ministry of Defe\nnce’s Annual Report and Accounts, and the Department’s Estimates. The Report on \nthe \nMinistry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2011-12 highlighted\n the repeated qualification of the MoD Accounts; weak financial management information and the paucity of information provided in the Annual Report.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur reports on the MoD’s supplementary estimate for 2012-13 and its main estimate for 2013-14 noted \nthe im\nportance of the Treasury continuing to fund the additional costs of operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere and welcomed the use of the Budget Exchange Mechanism.\n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have not had any draft Bills to consider during the period covered by this \nmemorandum\n.\n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur\n work has contributed to informing the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill. \nThe Committee’s report on \nDefence Acquisition\n was tagged on the Order Paper to the Second Reading debate on the Bill wh\nich provides for a\n legislative framework for the establishment of a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GoC\no\n) \nbody\n to manage defence acquisition\n. \nOur\n inquiry \nraised a number of \nimportant \nquestions\n around the proposals,\n particularly relating to future go\nvernance; \nwhether problems would arise if a non-UK company were given responsibility for UK defence acquisition\n;\n and whether sufficient consultation with allies had taken place.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThe Bill also provides for reforms of the UK Reserve Forces. The Committee i\ns currently undertaking an inquiry into \nFuture Army 2020\n, and the Government’s plans to increase its reliance on \nR\neserve \nF\norces. Whilst the Committee is unlikely to have reported before this Bill leaves the Commons, we anticipate that the evidence that it \nhas so far taken will help to inform debate, and we will be asking for this to be tagged to the Order Paper\n for the report stage and third reading debates\n.\n \n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Armed Forces Act 2011 \nplaced a requirement on the Secretary of State \nfor Defence to make an annual statement to Parliament on the operation of the military covenant. This was the first legislative commitment pertaining to services provided to support service personnel. \nWe have\n undertaken a series of inquiries \non the theme o\nf\n \nThe Armed Forces Covenant in action?\n, examining military casualties, accommodation, education of \nS\nervice personnel and the education of children of \nS\nervice personnel. \n&#xa0;\n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDefence Committees have taken a keen interest for many years in the operation and effectiveness of the Service complaints process and the work of the Service Complaints Commissioner for the Armed Forces which was established under the Armed Forces Act 2006\n. \nWe\n conducted a\nn\n  inquiry into the work of the Commissioner, concluding that there was a lack of confidence among Service personnel in the complaints system and that the system was not working effectively or efficiently. \nWe\n also examined the role of the C\nommissioner and recommended that the \nrole\n should change to\n that of\n an Armed Forces Ombudsman. As a consequence of \nour\n report and the Commissioner’s annual report, discussions are ongoing between the MoD and the Commissioner to revise her role and to improv\ne the efficiency and effectiveness of the Service complaints system.\n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have\n been asked for a\n formal\n opinion by the European Scrutiny Committee on \na Commission Communication on \nTowards a more competitive and efficient defence and security\n sector\n.\n \nWe have\n undertaken to provide this opinion by the end of October.\n28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have\n not been required to undertake a formal pre-appointment hearing during the period covered by this paper\n, although we are expecting to hold a pre-appointment hea\nring with the proposed new Service Complaints Commissioner in the near future\n.\n We have also\n held \nevidence sessions\n with\n the new Chief of \nthe \nDefence Staff\n and\n the \nnew Permanent Under Secretary at the Ministry of Defence.\n \n29.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to the debates and tags mentioned above, \nour\n report on Future Maritime Surveillance was the subject of a debate in Westminster Hall in February this year.\n Evidence taken by the Committee during its inquiry on \nFuture Army 2020\n was tagged to the \ndebate on Defence Reforms allocated by the Backbench Business Committee, initiated by John Baron MP.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
