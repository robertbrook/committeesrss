"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Yorkshire and Humber Ecological Data Trust (YHEDT)&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis request for evidence was only brought to the attention of the Trust today by a colleague who is a member of the Royal Town and Country Planning Institute (RTPI). It has not been possible to complete a full evidence document; however, the Trust did not wish to let this opportunity pass without registering an interest. The Trust would be happy to supply a more complete submission, or to provide a representative to give verbal evidence on request.   This submission principally deals with the evidence base that would be necessary to underpin biodiversity offsetting\n2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey Assumptions2.1.1.\n \nTo be effective, biodiversity offsetting would need to be underpinned by a rigorous biodiversity evidence base, which was accessible to local planning authorities.\n2.1.2.\n \nTo ensure consistency across the country, this evidence base available to each authority should conform to a nationally agreed standard.\n2.1.3.\n \nFor sites considered for offsetting activities, it would be necessary to access the extent, and ecological character and condition of the sites before and after offsetting.\n2.1.4.\n \nWhere computer models are used to inform biodiversity offsetting, the capacity should exist locally to update both the data used by these models and some of basic model parameters to reflect, on an iterative basis, new data and new understanding.\n2.1.5.\n \nThe process of developing an offsetting proposal should be made as straightforward as possible for the developer to encourage wide uptake.\n2.1.6.\n \nBiodiversity offsetting should be within the framework of Green Infrastructure so that sites are not randomly dispersed but contribute to the connectivity and robustness of the underlying network. \n2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey Obstacles2.2.1.\n \nIn North Yorkshire, planning authorities use the North and East Yorkshire Ecological Data Centre, an Association of Local Environmental Record Centres (ALERC) accredited Local Record Centre (LRC) as the evidence base to underpin their existing statutory duties to biodiversity. It is common practice over much of the country for planning authorities to use Local Record Centres in this way.\n2.2.2.\n \nNone of the district level planning authorities in North Yorkshire contributes to the development and maintenance of any form of biodiversity evidence base and as a consequence, the independent Local Record Centre operated by YHEDT may not be sustainable, and certainly could not undertake additional work to inform biodiversity offsetting, without significant additional resources. Again, this situation is common across the country.\n2.2.3.\n \nThere is no coherent national framework for the collection, collation, management and dissemination of biodiversity data.\n2.2.4.\n \nThere is currently no accepted standard for a rigorous evidence base to support decision making with respect to biodiversity, nor any test of adequacy for data used in this context. The Defra recognised ALERC accreditation standard for Local Record Centres does not serve this function.\n2.2.5.\n \nThere is currently no single source which details all the sites that may be available for use in biodiversity offsetting. There is no agreed standard for recording the ecological character and condition of a site. There are a number of systems for describing the ecological character of a site, but many of these are mutually incompatible, with little attention given to characterising sites that may be amenable to restoration or improvement. Whilst systems exist for assessing the condition of sites which have Site of Special Scientific Interest status or are under agricultural stewardship, no system exists for describing the ecological condition of sites outside these designations.\n2.2.6.\n \nThe existing national priority habitat inventory, managed by Natural England, would not meet the needs of biodiversity offsetting.\n2.2.7.\n \nWere computer models are being developed, little attention is being given to the continued and sustainable use and development of these technological resources. Few of the organisations that are developing these tools have strategies for how they can continue to be supported after the development phase.\n2.2.8.\n \nIt is currently an onerous task for the developer to identify potential biodiversity offsetting land and to develop a proposal which may subsequently not be favourable to the LPA. \n2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnablers2.3.1.\n \nThrough a programme of surveillance or on-going monitoring of locally recognised or designated green infrastructure, sites which were candidates for biodiversity offsetting could be recognised and adopted by LPAs and outline management plans developed, allowing planners to present a developer with a viable offsetting option with most of the ground-work in place. \n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe North and East Yorkshire Ecological Data Centre (NEYEDC) is the Local Record Centre (LRC) covering North and East Yorkshire. It is one of a non-overlapping national network of Local Record Centres, which collate, validate, manage and disseminate ecological data to support environmental decision making. NEYEDC functions at local, regional and national level and is an integral part of the National Biodiversity Network.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNEYEDC is an operating function of the Yorkshire and Humber Ecological Data Trust (YHEDT); registered charity number 1075999. The Trust was formed in 2000 as a result of work carried out over a period of years by a consortium of stakeholders including local authorities, statutory bodies, Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber, non-government organisations (NGOs), commercial interests, environmental consultant, academics, amateur naturalists and interested members of the general public. Whist the original consortium represented a wide range of stakeholder groups; there was strong support for the existence of an independent collation of reliable, rigorously managed ecological data, which was widely and equitably available to all parties.\n4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCore Functions of an LRC4.1.1.\n \nLRCs are operated under a wide range of business models across England, most commonly existing as an integral part of a local authority, where they may be hosted within the planning, countryside, sustainable development or museum function. Other record Centres are hosted within a wide range of larger stakeholder organisations .The \ndevelopment of independent LRCs is a recent innovation and is therefore less common. All record Centres have some key features in common: -\n4.1.2.\n \nThey are not-for-profit organisations.\n4.1.3.\n \n They do not own most of the data which they hold, acting as custodians of the data under a data use / exchange agreement.\n4.1.4.\n \n They do not sell data, but grant a limited licence to use it for a specific purpose in exchange for a fee which covers the cost of data extraction and dissemination. LRCs are not permitted to charge an extraction fee which also covers the cost of data acquisition, processing and management.\n4.1.5.\n \nDespite the diversity in terms of business model, there is a high degree of commonality in the core functions of all LRCs and this \nconvergance\n continues to develop. NEYEDC was the first record centre to gain accreditation under the Association of Local Environmental Record Centre’s (ALERC) scheme, which is recognised by Natural England. The Centre met the standards under all twenty criteria, with only 16 being required to achieve accreditation.\n4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe core functions of NEYEDC are: -4.2.1.\n \nTo identify existing data sets pertaining to species, habitats, sites and related environmental factors from all professional and amateur sources and map the flow of this data from collection, through various stages of management to dissemination.\n4.2.2.\n \nWhere datasets are not currently widely available for use in the support of decision making processes, to engage with the data producers to allow the data to be disseminated through the Centre.\n4.2.3.\n \nTo enter into mutually beneficial, auditable agreements, which licence the use of data for wide dissemination, whilst at the same time protecting the interests of the data owner.\n4.2.4.\n \nTo formulate metadata to nationally accepted standards so that data holdings can be located and evaluated.\n4.2.5.\n \nTo convert data into appropriate electronic formats to allow its efficient dissemination and use either in hard copy or electronic formats and on-line as appropriate.\n4.2.6.\n \nTo subject all data to nationally recognised standards of validation and verification, and where appropriate ensure that errors are corrected. All data must satisfy the statement; \n“all reasonable measures have been taken to ensure the accuracy of the data provided by NEYEDC”\n.\n4.2.7.\n \nTo store and back-up electronic data securely and safely archive copies of the original data supplied to the Centre.\n4.2.8.\n \nTo contribute to regional and national collations of data where appropriate.\n4.2.9.\n \nTo make raw data available either in hard copy or appropriate electronic format to all interested parties in support of environmentally related decision making processes.\n4.2.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo subject the data to rigorous management and / or analysis to produce derived data products that can be used in support of environmentally related decision processes.\n4.2.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo identify systemic gaps in the available data that may lead to increased or unacceptable uncertainty in decision -making processes.\n4.2.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo proactively engage to promote the collection of data to fill data gaps.\n4.2.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo monitor the use of data and where appropriate report use and misuse of data to the intellectual property right holder.\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe views expressed above are based on the experience of the staff of NEYEDC in providing biodiversity evidence to planning authorities within North and East Yorkshire, combined with a number of recent publications and involvement with a number of research projects, currently being undertaken by both Natural England and Defra.\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 2007 the Trust has delivered a number of projects under the Defra Innovation Funding umbrella which address various elements of the obstacles described above. Copies of the reports from these projects can be obtained from Natural England or made available by us on request. \n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have not had sufficient time to fully compile this supporting evidence, but would be able to do so in the near future if it would further the work of your Committee.\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a requirement for a definition of what constitutes a sound, robust environmental evidence base. This should be linked to the aspirations set out by the INSPIRE directive and be designed underpin all aspects of spatial planning including Green Infrastructure and Eco-system Services. \n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe existing disparate elements should be brought together into a single, coherent framework for the collection, collation, management and dissemination of data as defined by the above standard evidence base definition.\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to maintain the delivery of that evidence base and its validity and currency, it needs to be underpinned by a secure, sustainable funding strea\nm linked to that delivery. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n15 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
