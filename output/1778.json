"&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Cabinet Office (LPG 15)&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\nThis note sets out how centralised \ncollaborative \nprocurement operations delivered by the Government Procurement Service\n (GPS) as part of the Cabinet Office\n \nsupports the delivery of value for money and savings to Local Government organisations. \n&#xa0;\nIt also sets and how the current implementation of Commercial Reforms in Central Government through the creation of the Crown Commercial Service, presents a significant opportunity for Local Government Procurement to access best in class procurement services, aggregated and benchmarked deals for commodities and training programmes such as the Commissioning Academy.\n&#xa0;\nLocal Government organisations’ take up of GPS services continues to grow as more compelling examples of success, such as those set below, become more widely known. However, there is a significant opportunity for more Local Government organisations to use and benefit from centralised procurement services without compromising the Localism Agenda and the critical need to support economic growth of businesses, in particular SMEs, in local areas.\n&#xa0;\nFor example, the use of centralised deals for commodities such as energy which are established through central government buying power and where contracts and key suppliers are actively managed, directly frees up budgets and capacity of Local Government procurement staff to focus on specialist and key strategic procurement projects that support local front line service delivery and make a difference to the organisation and the local people they serve.\n&#xa0;\nThe evidence provided below primarily supports a response to questions 2, 3 &amp; 4 (Annex 1).\n&#xa0;\nStrategic development of central government commercial operations which will benefit Local Government Procurement&#xa0;\nThe forthcoming creation of an integrated commercial service for Government in the form of the Crown Commercial Service (CCS)\n, building upon the existing GPS,\n will bring together Government’s central commercial capability into a single organisation to ensure maximum value is extracted from every commercial relationship and drive up the quality of service. It will fundamentally change the way we procure to improve efficiency, savings and service delivery.\n&#xa0;\nAs part of this new model, CCS will be managing the procurement of common goods and services on behalf of departments, working on the principle of buying once and buying better to maximise efficiency and savings delivery. However, as part of this new approach particular focus will be given to opening up markets and opportunities for SMEs as part of the frequent renewal of appropriate procurement frameworks – with G-Cloud for ICT services being a good example. There will also be a significant focus on effective contract management and increasing commercial skills.\n This is a key part of the \ncommercial\n and civil service reform programmes and the \nbenefits\n and experience of this will be shared across the public sector.\nGPS delivery of savings to Local Government organisations and provision of procurement services&#xa0;\nIn 2012/13\n GPS managed £11.44 billion \nof public spending\n, delivering £1.1 billion in savings. More than £6 billion of this spend came from wider public sector organisations including £1.25 billion from local authorities, saving them \nclose to £100 \nmillion\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Strategic alliances with Local Government Buying Organisations&#xa0;\nGPS is actively working with a number of local government buying organisations as part of strategic alliances to drive additional savings on common goods and services through increased aggregation and improved efficiency.  This has resulted in a number of collaborative procurements, including a joint framework for Multi-functional devices with ESPO and YPO which is delivering average savings of 46% on hardware and 49% on service costs by standardising specifications.\n&#xa0;\nSimilarly, GPS launched the first ever national pan-government framework for insurance in 2012/13, developed in part\nnership with Local Government buying organisations \nYPO, ESPO and NEPO, demonstrating joint\n commitment to \ndriving savings.\n  \nThese strategic alliances and joint activities will help to change buying behaviours for common goods and se\nrvices across the entire Local Authority landscape.\n&#xa0;Spend analysis and opportunity assessments&#xa0;\nGPS has undertaken individual \n(and cost free) \nspend analysis exercises across eight local authorities, including four London Boroughs, covering a total of £2.8 billion\n of total Authority expenditure\n.  The resultant savings opportunity assessments concluded savings of between 2% and 4% of total Authority spending by greater utilisation of existing centralised arrangements.\n&#xa0;\nInterrogation of this data also showed that for five of the authorities the top ten suppliers (by authority) represented over £790 million of spend and for the remaining three authorities the top twenty suppliers represented a further £487 million.  This limited supply base lends itself well to national aggregation to drive savings as well as more effective supplier management.\n&#xa0;As an \nexample, a spend analysis exercise undertaken by GPS on behalf of \na number of \nLondon\n Boroughs\n in 2012/13 revealed \nvarying prices \nfor similar software services from the same supplier \nincluding a fivefold variation \nbetween two London \nauthorities\n.  \nIn direct response the London ICT Programme has worked with four key software suppliers to provide Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) to provide fair and consistent pricing on day-rates and access to APIs (enabling links between software systems).  The MOU with Northgate, one of the four suppliers, is delivering savings of up to 25% on day rates for London authorities.\n&#xa0;\nPan-London ICT Procurement Programme&#xa0;\nA key initiative in local government which is already delivering encouraging results is the London ICT programme, a collaboration facilitated by GPS and led by the London Borough of Camden on behalf of all 33 London councils, working closely with Chief Information Officers.  London authorities spend £9 billion annually on ICT and GPS assigned \ndedicated resource to drive and facilitate greater collaboration on ICT, providing senior expertise to look at how savings could be achieved by working together to drive better value for money, improved supplier relationship management and technology transformation. \n&#xa0;\nThe\n London ICT Programme\n,\n working with GPS and local authority buying organisations across the country are \nnow \ndeveloping a new strategic procurement for Local Authority Software Applications which aims to bring greater transparency, value and innovation in this market. \nIn addition, the success of GPS’s relationship with London authorities has led to two further significant initiatives:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\neAuctions&#xa0;Increasing use of aggregated eAuctions to drive better value is \ndelivering significant savings.\n A\nn innovative \nforward eAuction managed by GPS on behalf of a group of local authorities in \n20\n12/13 \nfor the \nrecycling of newspapers and magazines into newsprint, generated £1.8m revenue, improving the pre-auction value by 17%.\n \nOther successful aggregated eAuctions for local authorities include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Commissioning Academy&#xa0;\nThe Commissioning Academy brings together senior commissioners from across the public sector to learn from the example of the most successful commissioning organisations – developing a growing cadre of professionals skilled in best practice. \n&#xa0;\nFollowing two pilot programmes, the Commissionin\ng Academy was formally launched \nin January 2013 and \ndemand for places has been high. O\nf the 114 participants across \nthe \npilots and first wave, \nover 58% (\n67\n)\n were from Local Authorities.\n&#xa0;\nThe 8 day programme includes a ‘provider perspective’, where conversations with different types of providers, including SMEs, help the participants gain a greater understanding of opportunities that are being missed to ensure we get the best outcomes possible for tax payers, communities and society as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;Issues facing Local Government Procurement teams which can be addressed through greater joint working with GPS&#xa0;The importance of procurement in local government has increased significantly in recent years \nand a consequent expansion of the role of procurement from what was previously a ‘buying’ role.    This has led to some capability gaps in authorities particularly with regard\ns\n to more strategic commercial skills whe\nre there is competition across i\nndustry for similar skill sets. \n&#xa0;\nAt the sector level, the absence of skills, systems and resources to implement a national procurement strategy and in particular a coherent pan-sector approach to category management is particularly evident\n.  \nGPS and the Local Government Association (LGA) are actively working to address these shortcomings and a strategic partnership is under active discussion.   \n&#xa0;\nOne of the biggest challenges is changing behaviours and coordinating activity across a large group of autonomous bodies.  There is significant duplication of effort and initiatives such as the local government procurement strategy face\n \nchallenges in establishing any means of implementing practical \nand effective work streams.  \n&#xa0;\nThe absence of coherent approaches to spend visibility, contract management and supplier management across local government makes effective category management\n very difficult\n.   The LGA led national procurement strategy which GPS fed in to, demonstrates commitment to improving efficiency and achieving better value and acknowledgement that problems have been identified, however there remains a significant gap between identification and action.\n&#xa0;\nSpend analytical capability\n is an ongoing issue in local government. This is reflected in a systemic inability to see where similar goods and services are bought at widely differing costs. There is little benchmarking and a reluctance to expose internal procurement practice to external scrutiny.  DCLG is currently discussing with GPS how to facilitate the rollout of spend analysis across local government, to provide the basis for more challenging innovations such as effective benchmarking and the identification of \nforward procurement pipelines.\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 1 – Questions asked by the Committee&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
