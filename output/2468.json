"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID) (LAI 0045)&#xa0;&#xa0;SUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFailure to evaluate impact of LASPO before introduction of further reforms to legal aid&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Karen Buck (Westminster North, Labour): To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether his estimate of potential savings in the legal ai\nd budget assumes a potential increase in costs to the court system arising from additional numbers of litigants in person.\n&#xa0;\n“Jeremy Wright (Kenilworth and Southam, Conservative): \n…….\nWhile the reforms may result in an increase in numbers of litigants in per\nson (LiPs), \nit is not immediately evident\n that this will \nresult in increased costs for the courts. The impact assessment which accompanied the Act set out a number of actions that the MOJ will, and is now, taking to monitor the impacts on the courts\n”\n (\nemphasis added\n)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nResidence test and immigration detention&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe ‘\nTransforming Legal Aid\n’ consultation\n exercise (\n2013\n) invited opinions on the proposal for \na residence\n test for \ncivil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to t\nhose with a “strong connection” \nwith the UK\n.  The \nsubsequent \nconsultation “Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps”\n, \nwhich \ncloses on 18\nth\n October 2013,\n introduce\ns\n a number of additional exceptions to the residence test.  The\n consultation document states:\n \n&#xa0;\n“We have also concluded that there are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain matters of law would not be required to meet the residence test. The test will therefore not apply to categories of case which \nbroadly rela\nte to an individual’s liberty\n, where the individual is particularly vulnerable or where the case relates to the protection of children” (MoJ, 2013)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“1.

Detainees making applications for \n[release on] tem\nporary admission\nBoth these situations will be exempt from the residence test, where they qualify for funding under\n&#xa0;\nparagraphs 5, 20, 25, 26 and 27\n&#xa0;\nof Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO.\n&#xa0;\n \nChallenges to \nthe lawfulness of detention by way of judicial review under paragraph 19, will also be exempt.\nDetainees who wish to make civil claims to challenge the legality of their detention after having been released.\nThese types of proceeding, which are funded \nunder paragraph 22 of schedule 1\n&#xa0;\nto\n&#xa0;\nLASPO,\n&#xa0;\nwill not be exempt from the residence test.\n” (Ministry of Justice, 2013)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase study: Beth and Daniel \nBeth’s grandfather, who was caring for her and her disabled brother Daniel during their mother’s detention, became seriously ill and was admitted to hospital three times. Beth had to stop attending school to care for her brother and grandfather and missed \nher GCSE exams.   Beth found it extremely difficult to look after her seven year old brother, was has limited motor control and severe behavioural problems. Children’s Services deemed Daniel to be at risk of emotional and physical harm, and found that: ‘Da\nniel has found it very difficult being separated from his mother…  [A] concerned neighbour rang to report that Daniel was playing alone in the road at 8pm... he walks into people’s houses.’  \n&#xa0;\nTwo months into his mother’s detention Daniel was hit by a car.\n  Despite receiving reports about the welfare of these children, the Home Office detained their mother for 160 days before she was released on bail by the Tribunal. The Home Office subsequently awarded the family compensation for the mother’s detention. Un\nder the proposed residence test, this mother would not have been able to access Legal Aid for her civil claim challenging the legality of her detention.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExceptional Funding&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nUnlike the State’s own nationals, \nforeigners have to meet a further, exceptional, test. It is not enough that they have legal rights, legal merits and the absence of means. They must \nshow that the refusal of funding in their individual case is itself a violation of the Human Rights Act 199\n8 or EU law. That is unequal treatment which is unjustifiable. The prohibition does not focus on legitimacy of the resort to the Court, the nature of the issue, the viability of the argument. Being a foreigner does not indicate a lesser need, or a lesser j\nustification, for effective access to the Court\n” (LIBERTY, 2013)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“To deny legal aid altogether to such persons, so that even the minimal rights provided to them by the law cannot be\n enforced, is in our view unconscionable”. \n&#xa0;\nUnaccompanied children&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTrafficked people in detention &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf not, t\nhe proposal \nto introduce a residence test \nshould \nat the very least \nbe subject \nto full Parliamentary scrutiny\n. \n&#xa0;Judicial review&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“T\nackl[ing] the burden that the \ngrowth in unmeritorious judicial reviews has placed on stretched public services\n…\n.\n \nIn this paper the Government sets out a series of further reforms which\n,\n \nit states\n, seek\n to address three interrelated issues: \ni. the\n impact of judicial review on economic recovery and growth, ii.\n The\n inappropriate use of judicial review as a campaign tactic, iii. \nThe\n use of the delays and costs associated with judicial review to hinder actions the executive wishes to take.\n”\n (MoJ, 2013:\n 6-7)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nThe Government is concerned by the use of \nunmeritorious\n applications for judicial review to delay, frustrate, or discourage legitimate executive action\n” (MoJ, \n2013: 7 iii))\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJudicial reviews to challenge removal from the UK&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase study\nFaith was detained with her partner for 206 days after serving a prison sentence. Her four children were aged between one and 11 when she went to prison; the eldest child was a British Citizen. The children were extremely distressed, and some of them devel\noped behavioural and health problems.  \n&#xa0;\nThree months into her detention, the Home Office wrote to Faith and her partner informing them that they intended to remove the parents and children together. The family had been separated for two years and five months. The Home Office noted the need for t\nhe children to ‘re-establish their relationship with their parents before removal,’ and envisaged that this might happen at Heathrow Airport. It is extremely concerning to see that the Home Office thought it would be appropriate to reunite these extremely \ndistressed children with their parents during the course of their forced removal. This removal attempt was cancelled, and the Home Office arranged a new date for the family to be removed using the same method, but this was prevented by a Judicial Review ap\nplication. The parents were subsequently released from detention and granted leave to remain in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nJudicial reviews challenging maltreatment of detainees &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nShe said her body was covered in bruises after the incident… an independent doctor warned that putting the woman on the plane without adequate monitoring while she was bleeding could lead to prematur\ne labour\n and ruptured membranes”\n’ \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n \n12\n&#xa0;\n \nHC Deb, 12 September 2013, c843W)\n The High Court has recently found breaches of the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment in Article 3 ECHR arising out of the treatment of mentally ill men held in immigration detention in four separate cases: R (S) v Secretary of State for the Ho\nme Department [2011] EWHC 2120; R (BA) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWHC 2748; R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWHC 2501; and R (HA (Nigeria)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWHC 979.\n \nThe Observer, Saturday 14\nth\n October 2013, Detainees at Yarl's Wood immigration centre 'facing sexual abuse' \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/14/detaine\nes-yarls-wood-sexual-abuse\n \n   UK Border Agency Annual Report and Accounts 201\n2-13 \n .  Available at \nhttp://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/annual-reports-accounts/annual-report-12-13.pdf?view=Binary\n \n \n \nBaroness Scotland of Asthal\n: \nTo ask Her Majesty’s Government how the proposed residence test envisaged by the Ministry of Jus\ntice consultation will impact upon the attainment of legal redress by non-\nresidents in challenging Government action\n.   \nThe Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally): \nAnybody excluded from civil legal aid as a result of the residence test in th\ne future would be entitled to apply for exceptional \nfunding, including in respect of services described in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 from which the individual has been excluded as a result of the\n residence test. \n[HL2223] \nHouse of Lords Summer Recess 2013 Written Answers and \nStatements,\n 23\nrd\n September 2013\n.
