[normal]I take the liberty as a believer on our Lord Jesus, to express my concern to the committee regarding the ease with which the children of our nation are being corrupted by free access to online pornography. The results are 
[normal]alarming, the consequences unthinkable.

[normal]God in His word, the Bible, Romans 13 v 1 â€“ 4 has set up government for the protection of its people. This present G
[normal]overnment therefore has a direct duty and responsibility to urgently find a way to stop this poison 
[normal]being made available to our children. A complete ban would be excellent.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is increasing genuine concern in this country about the control of this evil.
[normal]I would respectfully appeal to the committee to heed this concern and diligently pursue every aven
[normal]ue possible, to save the lives of our children.
