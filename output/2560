defaultGod in His word, the Bible, Romans 13 v 1 â€“ 4 has set up government for the protection of its people. This present G
defaultovernment therefore has a direct duty and responsibility to urgently find a way to stop this poison 
defaultbeing made available to our children. A complete ban would be excellent.
