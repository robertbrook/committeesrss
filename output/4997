defaultUK policies governing who can donate blood and blood products are insufficiently evidence based. Four UK studies on archived appendix and tonsil tissue have been well-conceived and well-conducted and have given broadly consistent results within statistical limits (1, 2, 3, 4). What is much more uncertain and less well explored is what the overall prevalence identified means both in public health terms and in absolute numbers of

default cases.

defaultThe disparity between apparent vCJD prevalence and actual vCJD cases was commented on at the time of the first published retrospective lymphoreticular tissue (LRT) study 10 years ago [1]. Initially there were plausible explanations as to why this might be the case, but the disparity has continued to grow over the subsequent years to the point where multiple scenarios acting in concert now have to be invoked to maintain any possible correlation between observed vCJD cases (both primary and secondary) and vCJD prevalence as consistently observed in increasingly large retrospective LRT studies [3,4].

defaultThe Department of Health have produced two reports both prior and subsequent to the Gill et al., 2013 publication [5,6]  which clearly identify this anomaly and discuss them at length. They provide the most comprehensive analyses to date of models describing the potential secondary transmission of vCJD via blood and blood components and show that many of these generate grossly implausible numbers for both present and future vCJD cases and have done so for some time. The calibration of potential models provided within is invaluable since it greatly narrows down the characteristics of the plausible and allows the implausible to be quickly weeded out. A credible transmission model needs to produce scenarios that are consistent not only with the number of blood-borne vCJD cases seen so far, but also with the number of primary cases seen and with the vastly higher level of putative carriers in the population.

default A model meeting the above requirements – an hypothesis 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent models assume that some, many or all vCJD infected individuals in the UK population (approx.1 in 2000, assuming 100% detection) as indicated by retrospective lymphoreticular prion immunohistochemistry will go on to develop the disease and in the interim present an infection risk to all those exposed to their blood and tissues. An alternative scenario is that lymphoreticular prion accumulation represents a purposeful long-term 
defaultsequestering of the vCJD infectious agent in an innocuous form, taking it out of the circulating blood following initial exposure and which can then only be transmitted further under exceptional circumstances (e.g. via blood transfusion from a rare individual who is in the process of developing vCJD and is close to the onset of clinical disease). Given that the great majority of the UK population alive over the course of the BSE epidemic would have been exposed to the B
defaultSE infectious agent (40-50 million?), an infection rate of 1 in 2000 would have been predicted to generate ultimately approximately 8000 primary vCJD cases even if only MM129 homozygotes were susceptible to developing the disease. Primary vCJD cases have plateaued at just 172 cases.

defaultAccording to the chronology of the BSE epidemic [7] there would have been a period of approximately ten years when significant quantities of BSE infectivity would have been entering the human food chain, prior to the first identification of a vCJD case. There would, therefore, have been infected and potentially infectious individuals unwittingly donating putatively vCJD infected blood into an essentially unprotected UK blood supply. Subsequent to this a series of protective measures have been introduced, including withdrawal of all blood components, plasma products or tissues obtained from any individual who later develops clinical vCJD to prevent their use (1997) and leucodepletion (1999) [8]. Why so few cases?

defaultAll three “implicated” transfusions were from MM-homozygotes and took place between 1996 and 1999, prior to the implementation of leucodepletion. Given that approximately six million units of blood would have been transfused over this period and perhaps 1 in 2000 would have come from vCJD infected codon 129 MM homozygotes, why have we not seen 3000 secondary vCJD cases via blood transfusion arising from this period rather than 3 cases only? Significantly all three cases had incubation periods of 5-8 years following transfusion and no vCJD cases via blood transfusion have been recorded in the subsequent 15 years. One scenario is that leucodepletion and other blood supply protection measures have been 100% effective, but this does not explain the paucity of vCJD cases arising between 1996 and 1999 unless there was no vCJD infectivity in the blood of the overwhelming majority of donations. The hypothesis proposed above explains both the three early iatrogenic cases – blood donations from donors actively incubating vCJD into recipients who were unfortunate enough to be susceptible both to the disease

default unsuccessful in clearing a low infectious dose exposure (as per the primary vCJD cases) and the greatly higher numbers either successfully clearing a low infectious dose exposure and remaining uninfected or, at an intermediate level  (&gt;/= 1:2000), being infected but successfully sequestering the infectious agent from the blood transfusion exposure into the lymphoreticular system and entering a long-term stable carrier state.

defaultApart from the susceptibility to developing actual clinical disease associated with the codon 129 MM phenotype present in 40% of the population, this model involves an essentially stochastic infectious process and is therefore compatible with both the lack of any clear familial or geographic associations in the primary vCJD cases observed in the UK.

defaultWhy should such a protective mechanism have been present to prevent a potentially massive vCJD epidemic?  Two alternative linked possibilities are immediately apparent: (a) serendipitously the vCJD agent is lymphotrophic unlike most prion agents. (b) during mammalian and human evolution such exposures will undoubtedly have occurred multiple times given the propensity of prion agents to cross species, genus, family and even order barriers. Recent recorded human history has seen the apparent appearance of “outbreaks” of new prion diseases in both man (Kuru,, iCJD, vCJD) and animals (Scrapie, TME, CWD, BSE, SEER and FSE), so it is unlikely that this is an isolated phenomenon. TSEs causing disease or death during the reproductive lifetime of the species concerned would have had reduced genetic fitness and evolution would have selected those variants better adapted to avoid premature death. This is, however, almost incidental to the more pressing questions 
defaultof how best to prevent further vCJD deaths and how to do this as cost-effectively as possible given that such cases are predicted to be exceedingly low according to the above hypothesis, which much better explains the evidence accrued to date on vCJD transmission and actual

defaultDoes this mean that UK blood, tissue and organ protection measures are redundant and can now be discontinued? Back in 2005 I wrote a paper for Health Protection Matters applauding the precautionary approach adopted by the UK regulatory authorities [9]. I believe that these measures should now be revisited for their effectiveness, not only in terms of overall morbidity and mortality but also for their cost effectiveness compared to other health protection measures. There is not an insignificant danger that while some measures are still prudent, inexpensive or have other benefits and should be retained (e.g. leucodepletion) other measures are both extremely costly but also very likely counter-productive (e.g. US sourced plasma where its method of procurement by payment rather than voluntary donation may mean that it has more potential to be contaminated by blood from intravenous drug users and have an increased infectious or illegal substance load. I am not an expert in this area and each SaBTO measure should be reviewed by those that are in light of my hypothesis and its implications.

defaultI do not believe the UK regulatory authorities have missed any measures in use in other countries worldwide that should have been employed in the UK. In many cases other countries have regarded variant CJD as a UK problem and not unnaturally it has been given vastly more consideration in the UK and other countries with vCJD cases (e.g. France and Ireland) than elsewhere. In my view, some UK committees have been overly bureaucratic in their attempts to be comprehensive and this may have slowed down decision making at times, but it has not resulted in incorrect or ill-advised decisions being made.  
defaultRecommendation
defaultI recommend that my very recently formulated lymphoreticular sequestration hypothesis considered and developed in response to the Parliamentary Science and Technology Committee’s call for written submissions relating to vCJD transmission is scrutinised as a matter of some urgency by experts in the field.
