defaultChair:default Good morning
default. 
defaultPerhaps I could just say welcome to our Jordanian colleagues, who are just observing how we operate as a Committee
default. 
defaultI hope you find it of some interest, but we will take no offence when you all get up and leave, because I appreciate you have other things to do
default. 
defaultWelcome to you, Mark
default. 
defaultAgain, for the record, perhaps you could just introduce your team
default. 
defaultI think we know them.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Thank you very much, Chair
default. 
defaultJoy 
defaultHutcheon
default is the Director General for Country Programmes, and Richard Calvert is the Director General for Finance and Corporate Performance
default. 
defaultMaybe I could just say, given we have your Jordanian counterparts 
defaulthere,
default it is a big day on trying to deal with the next phase of the 
defaultSyria
default and wider crisis today
default. 
defaultThe Secretary of State has been at the 
defaultKuwait
default conference and made an important announcement this morning on further support for the region
default. 
defaultWe all have the most enormous admiration for 
defaultthe
default burden the neighbouring countries in particular have borne, and we have been very pleased to have been able to follow up the set of decisions 
defaultMinister
defaults have made to strengthen our support, in particular for 
defaultJordan
default and 
defaultLebanon
default. 
defaultThat is an important new set of relationships for us
default. 
defaultChair:default Can I also say that the Committee, as you know, is visiting 
defaultJordan
default and 
defaultLebanon
default in March? We will perhaps see on the ground some of the impact
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default On the 
defaultSyria
default crisis, the 
defaultGovernment
default has pledged £500
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion
default. 
defaultWhat proportion of that has been disbursed and how quickly will the rest be disbursed?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: With today’s additional pledge, it is now £600
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion
default. 
defaultIn the 2011 year, Mr 
defaultBayley
default, if I am right—i.e. before the crisis—we spent about £2
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion in 
defaultSyria
default. 
defaultIn the 2012 year, it was about £73
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, as the crisis started to unfold
default. 
defaultLast year, the 2013 year, we do not have all the numbers in but it will probably be towards £300
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion and, unfortunately, the problem is not getting smaller and we are planning on the basis that a similar sort of level of activity will be needed at least for this year as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That actually leads in to the first question I was going to ask you anyway, which is really how you set your humanitarian budget and how you deal with it
default. 
defaultYou have had a large increase in humanitarian spend and you have explained part of the reason for that of course, in 2012
default&#x2011;
default13
default. 
defaultHow far were you able to do that because of the increasing budget, and how far will you 
defaultbe
default able to do it in other circumstances?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The starting point for the 
defaultGovernment
default’s approach on humanitarian and emergency response obviously goes back to the review that Lord Ashdown did in the 2010
default&#x2011;
default11 year
default. 
defaultOne of the key things he said 
defaultwas 
defaultthat most people expect humanitarian crisis to be, unfortunately, a growing problem, even as development proceeds in the years ahead
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment
default took a decision then largely on the basis that this is an area of activity where the UK internationally is highly regarded and has a lot of expertise and comparative advantage, so we would organise the Department to make a major contribution on this set of humanitarian
default&#x2011;
defaultrelated
default issues
default. 
defaultWe have been building the capacity of the Department, and also always plan to be able to respond both to chronic ongoing emergencies and to new sudden
default&#x2011;
defaultonset
default ones, within the way we budget in the Department.
defaultAs you say, the 2013
default&#x2011;
default14 year is the one where we have had the substantial increase to deliver the 
defaultGovernment
default’s commitment on 0.7%
default. 
defaultThat meant we had substantial additional resources compared with the previous year
default. 
defaultEqually, we had spent the last several years planning how to use those additional resources
default. 
defaultThe way in which we financed the biggest crisis we have been responding to over the last year, which is the Syria and wider Middle East crisis, was a combination of contingency funding that we always hold for these problems, budgets in the humanitarian departments—the Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department, CHASE, which you are familiar with—and also some slower
default&#x2011;
defaultthan
default&#x2011;
defaultexpected
default expenditure on one or two other areas
default. 
defaultFor example, the European Development Fund during the course of the year told us that they expected to need £160
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion less from us than they had previously told us, so that is the combination of ways in which we have funded it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Why did they not put it into the 
defaultMiddle East
default then?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It could not be EDF from the European side, because the European Development Fund only does African, 
defaultCaribbean
default and Pacific countries
default. 
defaultIn fairness to them, I do think that the role that ECHO has played, under 
defaultKristalina
default 
defaultGeorgieva’s
default leadership, has been really impressive on the 
defaultMiddle East
default crisis and certainly for us they are very important partners.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The bit that we are never quite clear about is, first of all, what the budget is
default. 
defaultBy definition, you do not know what is going to be presented as a humanitarian crisis, whether it is conflict or natural disasters
default. 
defaultPresumably when you are setting your budget, you have a provision for that and some contingency fund
default. 
defaultThere comes a point when presumably you 
defaultsay, “We’ve got 
defaultnothing left.” The concern for us is at what point it prejudices your commitment to 
defaultspending elsewhere
default. 
defaultI do not think anybody on this Committee is critical of the fact that the 
defaultGovernment
default has put as much as it has, in the circumstances, into 
defaultSyria
default, but there would come a point when for that kind of money you are saying, “This is not a poor part of the world
default. 
defaultIs that not at the expense of poorer people in poorer countries?” How can you reassure us that the system does not lead to that kind of conflict of priorities?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: At the beginning of the current spending review period, in 2011
default&#x2011;
default12, we set out plans for the resources that we would have available, either in the central humanitarian departments to respond on an ongoing basis to humanitarian problems, or in the contingency fund
default. 
defaultThat was always programmed to grow
default. 
defaultWe then have a long history of having to manage unexpected ebbs and flows in the scale of the need, so this is a problem that we have always had and we have to be able to juggle the whole range of the Department’s activities to cope with it
default. 
defaultThe period when this was most acute in the history of the Department was in 2003, when the 
defaultGovernment
default decided, following the commencement of the conflict in 
defaultIraq
default, that we 
defaultneeded to make a really, really 
defaultbig contribution on humanitarian reconstruction
default. 
defaultWe had to find something like £300
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion from a budget then that was, I guess, in the order of £3
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion or so, so that was a big commitment quickly
default. 
defaultWe had to do that by explicitly taking a set of decisions about what not to do
default. 
defaultWe closed down, as you may recall, a number of programmes in middle
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries at that time, in order to finance that commitment.
defaultWe have not faced that challenge on the same scale
default. 
defaultEven with the very major response we are making to the Syria crisis, the scale of our activity there, which may be 2
default% or
default 3% of the Department’s total budget this year, is not such as to do significant damage to all the other things the 
defaultGovernment
default has committed to on development.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default Why has there been such a significant reduction in the proportion of DFID’s bilateral aid going to middle
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries since 2010
default&#x2011;
default11?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Perhaps I could ask Joy, Mr 
defaultBayley
default, to lead on that.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: In 20
default12-
default13 we saw a slight increase in the funding going to middle
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries, but you are right
default that 
defaultin the year before that
default,
default there was a 15% decrease in the proportion to low
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default It goes up and down 2% every year, but there has been a drop in round terms from 80% to low
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries to 67%.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: Essentially, in 2011
default&#x2011;
default12 that was because of the reclassification of a number of countries in which we have large programmes
default.
default 
defaultNigeria
default, 
defaultPakistan
default and 
defaultGhana
default were all classified as middle
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries during 2011
default&#x2011;
default12, and there is a total of £450
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion of our programming that goes into those countries, which slightly more than accounts for that 15% fall.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default The overseas development Act commits us to use our aid primarily for poverty reduction and in poor countries
default. 
defaultAt the time of the Gleneagles G8, when we and many other countries gave significant pledges to increase our aid, we undertook to double aid to Africa and yet, within the totals in recent years, aid to 
defaultsub
default&#x2011;
defaultSaharan
default Africa has been static or falling and we are nowhere near on track for doubling our aid to 
defaultAfrica
default. 
defaultWe would have 
defaulthad to have increased our bilateral aid, or our combined bilateral and imputed multilateral aid, to something like £5
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion and it is somewhere like £3
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion
default. 
defaultHas the 
defaultGovernment
default abandoned our pledge made at Gleneagles to double aid to 
defaultAfrica
default?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I would need to go back to the 2005 numbers to check the baseline, but my recollection is that that commitment was met over the following three or four years
default. 
defaultThe point you allude to, Mr 
defaultBayley
default, which is right, is that over the last two or three years, until the beginning of the year we are now in, the total departmental budget has been roughly stable
default. 
defaultWithin that, 
defaultactually 
defaultthe total allocation to 
defaultAfrica
default has gone up a little bit in 2012 compared with 2011—about 2%
default. 
defaultWithin 
defaultsub
default&#x2011;
defaultSaharan
default 
defaultAfrica
default, it is roughly stable
default. 
defaultA bit depends on the treatment of debt relief, but the numbers are roughly stable for 
defaultsub
default&#x2011;
defaultSaharan
default 
defaultAfrica
default.
defaultWhat I can say is that, b
defaultased on the planning figures that we have published, which are in the Annual Report in front of you, those numbers will now rise, reflecting firstly the very high priority given to Africa in the 
defaultGovernment
default’s development policy, but secondly the growth in the departmental budget.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default Can I put two thoughts to you
default? 
defaultI was rather alarmed when I saw the figures showing the change in emphasis between middle
default&#x2011;
defaultincome and low
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries, but I think you give a good explanation as a short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm explanation
default. 
defaultIf we simply continue to fund countries as they get richer, and do not re
default&#x2011;
defaultconcentrate
default efforts on the poorest countries, and increasingly that would mean in 
defaultsub
default&#x2011;
defaultSaharan
default 
defaultAfrica
default, we would be betraying the key message that DFID sends to our donors around the world—that the greatest priority must be given to those in greatest need
default. 
defaultWhat can we expect to come from your 
defaultD
defaultepartment over the next year, in terms of a policy announcement that you intend, over perhaps a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period, to recalibrate back to low
default&#x2011;
defaultincome countries and particularly to substantially increase aid to 
defaultsub
default&#x2011;
defaultSaharan
default 
defaultAfrica
default?
defaultBond gave us some information
default. 
defaultThey say the current spending is down, but is at £3.41
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion
default. 
defaultThey are, within that figure, combining bilateral and the imputed 
defaultUK
default share of multilateral aid, I believe
default. 
defaultThey are saying that something like £5.2
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion would be needed for us to meet the Gleneagles pledge.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I perhaps can go back to the basis for the Gleneagles pledge and then respond on that narrow point
default. 
defaultOn the medium
default&#x2011;
defaultterm
default priority of Africa vis-à-vis other regions, and low income/least developed vis-à-vis low
defaulter
default middle income, that is a really a policy decision for 
defaultMinister
defaults over time to make and the Department then to implement
default.
defaultBeing a tiny little bit over the low
default&#x2011;
defaultincome threshold into the low
defaulter
default&#x2011;
defaultmiddle
default&#x2011;
defaultincome
default threshold is not necessarily an enormous transformation
default. 
defaultJoy mentioned that one of the countries in that position i
defaults
default Nigeria
default. 
defaultNigeria, in the north of the country, has 70
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion plus of the world’s poorest people in any non
default&#x2011;
defaultconflict
default zone in the world—the worst human development, infant mortality, children out of school, malaria and morbidity challenge that is available to see in a non
default&#x2011;
defaultconflict
default zone
default. 
defaultIt is right, if you want to have a strong focus on poverty, to have a focus on those kinds of countries
default. 
defaultLikewise in Pakistan, an enormous number
default of kids—
default7
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion kids, I think
default—
defaultare still out of school
default, and t
defaulthere is an enormous burden of avoidable disease
default,
default but, over the medium term, it must be right that aid resources are concentrated most on the places where the problems are biggest
default. 
defaultIt is a good thing if countries progress and graduate, and we can focus our resource in other places
default.
defaultChair:default That is helpful
default. 
defaultThere is some further debate about exactly where you make the cut
default&#x2011;
defaultoff and how you make the cut
default&#x2011;
defaultoff
default. 
defaultI think we will talk to 
defaultMinister
defaults about that as well
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default There has been a large reduction in budget support
default. 
defaultIs that large reduction down to the fact that 
defaultMinister
defaults in the Department have lost faith in providing aid in this way?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Thank you, Mr McCann
default. 
defaultMaybe I could start and ask Joy to come in
default. 
defaultWhen budget support was introduced about 15 years ago, in its modern variant anyway—budget support was part of the Department’s 
defaultand the Department’s 
defaultpredecessor
defaults’
default programme going back to the 1940s and 1950s—there were essentially four objectives that 
defaultMinister
defaults had
default. 
defaultThe first was to support macro
default-
defaulteconomic stability at a time when lots of countries were coming out of a period of high inflation, with lots of pressure on the external accounts, and some resources to help deal with that big problem was one objective
default. 
defaultThe second was to support recurrent cost financing, essentially paying teachers and health workers for the core essential work that needed to be done to meet the MDGs in countries that were not able to raise enough of their own tax to do that
default.
defaultThe third was to provide an incentive and a means of supporting public financial management reform and public expenditure
default reform
default. 
defaultThe fourth was to make as rational as possible the system by which all of the donors support an individual country, against a background where, as a lot of you have seen, too many finance 
defaultMinister
defaults in the poorest countries spend too much of their time having to talk individually to donors about little things, rather than running their country
default. 
defaultThose were the four objectives 15 years ago
default.
defaultWhat has happened is there has been a lot of progress in the 17 or 18 countries where we were doing especially general budget support on those objectives
default. 
defaultThe core reason why we do less of it now is 
defaultthat 
defaultcountries have progressed
default. 
defaultThat is a good thing
default. 
defaultThere are some short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm things going on as well and events we had to respond to, and Joy can talk a bit about some of that.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: When I look across the country portfolio, there are two sets of countries
default. 
defaultThere is one where we have a conscious plan to reduce budget support, for the reasons that Mark has talked about
default. 
defaultThat is in countries like 
defaultGhana
default, 
defaultZambia
default and 
defaultMozambique
default. 
defaultAs the Committee will be aware, there are three countries at the moment where we have had to effectively suspend budget support, and those are Rwanda, Uganda—which actually is also in the first category a little—and Malawi
default. 
defaultThere are some different pressures going on
default. 
defaultIn those countries, there is a mixture of reasons, but the fiduciary environment and simply the unacceptable level of risk about putting money as budget support into that fiduciary environment is particularly important in 
defaultMalawi
default and in 
defaultUganda
default.
defaultOne thing we are seeing, and I think we are going to see more of, is an increase in what we call financial aid, which is money that goes through 
defaultGovernment
default systems but is not budget support
default. 
defaultWe are working with a 
defaultGovernment
default, because the 
defaultGovernment
default systems are working and are an effective way of addressing a particular issue, but we are doing it very specifically to achieve a particular set of results or a particular change
default. 
defaultThe fact that budget support is reducing does not mean, per se, that we are stopping supporting 
defaultGovernment
defaults and using 
defaultGovernment
default systems, but we are finding new ways of doing it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default I do not know if it was your answer that led to the Jordanian delegation walking out, but in terms of these four objectives that you mentioned, they can broadly be described as building country capacity
default. 
defaultIn terms of paraphrasing everything you have 
defaultsaid
default,
default 
defaultdo 
defaultwe still believe budget support is a good idea, but the reduction has been down to your success
default?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: That is a very good way of putting it
default. 
defaultIn a way, 
defaultcountries needing less budget support is
default a sign of their progress
default. 
defaultThere will still be cases where part of what we do in a particular country should be budget support
default. Minister
defaults have taken a number of decisions along those lines
default. 
defaultThe broader context I would put this in is we are living through the period in human history that has seen the fastest ever reduction of poverty and the fastest ever increase of life expectancy
default. 
defaultMore countries are becoming less reliant on aid and the kind of aid support they need is evolving, so it is basically a good thing if they are building more of their capacity, as you say, and can raise more of their own tax revenue
default. 
defaultThat is an absolutely fundamental thing
default. 
defaultCountries do not really want to be dependent and we do not want them to be dependent either
default. 
defaultThose two things going together, as often as not, are success measures.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O’Donnell:default I wonder if I could just follow up, Mr 
defaultLowcock
default. 
defaultYou said that a reduction in budget support was a sign of success, because it meant the countries no longer needed budget support
default. 
defaultDoes that mean, in every case when we reduce or end budget support, it is because that country has no longer requested and no longer needs budget support?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Not in every case
default. 
defaultThere have been the cases Joy mentioned, where maybe we have not had the same degree of confidence in the fiduciary environment or the 
defaultGovernment
default’s commitment to improve the fiduciary environment
default. 
defaultThe more cases we have where we are changing the nature of our systems because the country is moving on, the better, from my point of view.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O’Donnell:default What assessment have you made of the impact of that reduction in budget support, particularly perhaps on health systems?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We did a major independent evaluation about four or five years ago now on the impact of budget support
default. 
defaultIt is a really good point
default. 
defaultI do not think we have done a major exercise like that since then
default—
defaultmaybe we should do that
default. 
defaultOne thing we are very careful to do is to try to be aware of the impact of what we do on what others might do
default. 
defaultUnfortunately, there is a bit of a herd effect in international development that, particularly in respect of the 
defaultUK
default, people tend to copy a lot of what the 
defaultUK
default does
default. 
defaultWe are alert to the danger that, if we take a different position in a particular country, others might do that and that could then be detrimental beyond the narrow impact that we make.
defaultAlso, one of the things I mentioned in terms of when countries need budget support less is when they have made progress on increasing their domestic revenue
default. 
defaultOf course, we want to see domestic resources being put to work on the MDGs
default. 
defaultPart of the ongoing dialogue is, when we are providing budget support, never mind when we are graduating from it, can you, a country, invest a bit more of your own resources in paying your health workers and teachers, so that they are on that journey
default. 
defaultHopefully, there is public demand in the country for that to be an important use of tax resources as well
default. 
defaultWe are alert to the danger of reverses of progress
default. 
defaultWe have not seen that in countries in a significant way, but we are alert to the danger of it.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: To the extent you are asking about when we stop budget support more suddenly because there is a crisis, it is always our first preoccupation to understand how we can continue to support the poor in that country by finding other routes that are acceptable in fiduciary terms.
defaultFiona O’Donnell:default In crisis and non
default&#x2011;
defaultcrisis
default situations, we need to evaluate that and understand what the impact is.
default              
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault:
default Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPauline Latham:default When you are giving budget support, how do you stop any corruption within the system
default? 
defaultOne of the criticisms we get regularly is, “We are giving all this money to these 
defaultGovernment
defaults
default. 
defaultAll they do is 
defaultbuy
default planes and the President gets lots of money, and it is all taken out of the country.”  How do you guard against that?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Maybe Joy can speak to the approach we take in assessing the fiduciary environment, the tracking of expenditure and the overall set of systems.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPauline Latham:default You can track your expenditure but, if you are putting money into a budget and they therefore take their money out of it, it is not improving anything
default. 
defaultIt is not just where your money goes but what they do with the money they have already put in their budget to go into that department
default. 
defaultBecause we put money in, their money is taken out.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Quite so, and one of the things we always track is if the total pot is increasing with ours
default. 
defaultIs there evidence that we are not acting in a way that produces the perverse effect that you intend
default? 
defaultIf the total contribution from the 
defaultGovernment
default to the sector is increasing, that gives us more confidence that it is safe for us to increase
default. 
defaultAt the end of the day, you are right; you can never prove perfectly the counterfactual
default. 
defaultWe do have a long track record of paying a lot of attention to levels of military expenditure, for example, and saying to countries we think there should be limits
default. 
defaultThe 2% figure has been used internationally for a long time and this is a big part of the dialogue
default. 
defaultSometimes, as you know, we have fallen out with countries because they have made what we thought were inappropriate expenditure choices, and we have decided to change the way we provide our assistance as a result.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPauline Latham:default At what point do you check that
default? 
defaultThey can say in their budget they are going to spend something; we can then put money in; but in year they can take it out
default. 
defaultDo you track what they do in year
default? 
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Yes, absolutely
default. 
defaultOf course, the credibility of what they say they are going to do the following year is heavily informed by what they actually did the previous year and what they told us about that
default. 
defaultThis is something that, under the framework normally provided by the IMF and the World Bank, our economists in every cou
defaultntry 
defaultare
default very heavily engaged with. 
defaultIt is an absolutely core part of what we talk to 
defaultGovernment
defaults about and what we track.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: Every budget support programme has a performance framework where results that are going to be achieved through the additional funding are set out, and there is a process every year of scrutinising the new budget and having a discussion with the 
defaultGovernment
default about budget allocations
default. 
defaultThe third thing that is worth mentioning is that we always, in budget support countries, work on strengthening public financial management systems very closely and support the national audit system, so that we are growing the capacity of the auditor general and the country’s own ability to audit its finances
default. 
defaultA number of the crises that we have had have been uncovered by the country’s own audit systems, national audit office and public accounts committees.

defaultPauline Latham:default Who discovered the crisis in 
defaultUganda
default?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It was exactly that set of institutions
default. 
defaultI am trying not to use the word “schizophrenic”
default, but 
defaultwe are a teeny bit schizophrenic about what happened in 
defaultUganda
default, because we made big investments to strengthen the public accounts committee, the auditor general, the accountant general and the media, which made them better at finding things going wrong
default. 
defaultPersonally, I think that is a jolly good thing for the country and most of my Ugandan friends agree with that, but it had some follow
default&#x2011;
defaulton consequences, which personally I think in the long 
defaultrun
default will be good for the country, but there is some noise in the meantime.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Just a very brief one: do you ever look at parliamentary expenditure in these countries
default? 
defaultIt seems that often the salaries and expenses of parliamentarians are in inverse proportion to the GDP of the country
default.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The biggest case where that has been a matter of significant concern to us
default—
defaultI guess you will be aware
default of it
default, Mr 
defaultLefroy
default—
defaultis in 
defaultKenya
default, which has some of the world’s most highly paid elected officials
default. 
defaultIt is not, candidly, that easy for civil servants in one country to engage with elected people from another country on that
default. 
defaultI do not know if, in the dialogue you have, for example in the Parliamentary Network 
defaultof
default the World Bank, that kind of thing ever comes up, but there is no question that decisions like that have an effect on the behaviour of a country’s international friends.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default Why do we not export IPSA?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: You are way beyond my pay grade on that, Mr McCann.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default Good morning
default. 
defaultCurrently, you have an ODA target that requires you to meet 0.7% of GNI each and every year
default. 
defaultWould other options be preferable, such as achieving 0.7% on average over, say, a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The 
defaultGovernment
default has a policy to hit 0.7% each and every year, so my job and the job of my colleagues 
defaultis
default to organise the work of the Department to deliver that policy
default. 
defaultAs you know, we have just completed the 2013 year, which is the first year the 
defaultGovernment
default said it would hit the target
default. 
defaultWe will have 
defaultthe out
default-
defaultturn
default in the spring
default. 
defaultYou have a report from the NAO, I know, which tells you that their view is that the Department has done what it needed to do in terms of the resources we control ourselves to achieve the target
default. 
defaultWe will see in the spring whether the numbers come out in that way
default. 
defaultWe believe we have managed our own affairs in a way to achieve that, but we will see
default.
defaultIn terms of whether it would be possible conceptually to have a different approach to this, it is something we have given some thought to
default. 
defaultMr 
defaultLefroy
default, in fact two years ago in this hearing, raised the same point 
defaultwith 
defaultme, and it is something we have given some thought to, but the position really is that the 
defaultGovernment
default has taken a decision on what 
defaultit 
defaultwanted to do and our job is to deliver that arrangement.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default I just wonder whether you have actually ever discussed any alternatives or whether you accept this is a settled position for the moment
default. 
defaultAlso, how much of your time and your staff’s time is actually spent managing that target
default? 
defaultMight it not be better spent ensuring that aid programmes actually deliver results
default? 
defaultIs there a self
default&#x2011;
defaultdefeating result in this, in terms of delivering?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Perhaps I could ask Richard to speak to both those two.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: Clearly, there is time spent in managing 
defaultour spend
default but, frankly, we would have to do that anyway
default. 
defaultIt is really important that, for a whole range of reasons, we understand and phase 
defaultour spend
default in a way that fits with parliamentary control totals, with the 0.7% target and other things
default. 
defaultWhen we set out on this trajectory in 2010 to scale up the Department’s work to 2013, and recognised the big uplift in the budget that was required, we were very clear at the start and have been right throughout that we had to spend money in a way that really delivered results and delivered value for money
default. 
defaultThe strategy that we have had over the last three years enabled us to get to a position this year where we were confident in the quality of 
defaultthe spend
default and the quality of the pipeline
default.
defaultOne of the things that we have been very clear with staff about throughout that period, including over the last few weeks and months of the financial year, is that quality of spend has to come first
default. 
defaultThe key to managing 0.7% over the last few months in particular has been ensuring that we have a strong enough pipeline of activity and a strong enough pipeline of payments, which enabled us to deal with what were inevitable fluctuations in other bits of the ODA GNI equation over the last few weeks and months of the financial year
default. 
defaultAs Mark says, we will know in March what the provisional numbers are
default. 
defaultOne of the complications is that, as I think the Committee is aware, some aspects of the equation are still not known
default. 
defaultObviously, the biggest part of it is what GNI will be calculated as, and we will have a number for that in time for the March calculation
default.
defaultThere are also aspects on the spending side of the equation that are uncertain, particularly the EC attribution figure, which is not an insignificant part of our overall spend at around £700
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion to £800
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion
default. 
defaultWe have to take an estimated figure on that in late December
default. 
defaultAlso, there are a number of different 
defaultGovernment
default Departments involved and DFID spend, to some extent, has to flex around the movement of other 
defaultGovernment
default Departments
default. 
defaultAs Mark says, we are clear on what our job has been this year, and that remains our job going into 2014
default. 
defaultWe should learn lessons from the process and we should think about how we manage this over the period ahead.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSir Peter defaultLuffdefault:default Is there any risk that you have to be more cautious in response to a humanitarian emergency early in the financial year and can be more generous at the end of the financial year
default? 
defaultThe timing of an emergency can influence the British 
defaultGovernment
default’s generosity towards the situation.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: That is a really good question
default. 
defaultThe total unpredicted humanitarian spend in recent years, as a proportion of the total budget, is probably not more than 2% or 3%
default. 
defaultI cannot think of a single case where we have held back in responding to a big humanitarian crisis for that reason
default. 
defaultAll the evidence is
default—
defaultthis is another big thing that came out of Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultAshdown’s review
default—
defaultthat the highest returns in dealing with a humanitarian crisis are available the faster you act
default. 
defaultThe best value for money arises from prompt response
default. 
defaultCertainly, the culture of the Department—you know we have 100 or so humanitarian specialists—
defaultis
default of quite can
default&#x2011;
defaultdo
default people
default. 
defaultTheir culture is to crack on
default. 
defaultI will, in the light of your question, go back and have a look at the first quarter over the last few years and whether there have been any responses that we held back on, but I cannot think of any off the top of my head.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O’Donnell:default Just very quickly, the three major political parties all had in their manifestos in 2010 to enshrine 0.7% in law
default. 
defaultI would imagine civil servants had done some preparation expecting that might be enacted
default. 
defaultIf that was the case, what impact would that have
default? 
defaultHow would you do things differently?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We are planning to hit the 0.7%
default. 
defaultWe planned to do that for 2013 from 2010
default. 
defaultWe have been planning to do it for 2013 ever since then and we are planning to do it for 2014
default&#x2011;
default15 onwards anyway
default. 
defaultI am not sure what we would do differently, to be honest, because it is a big thing that we are already doing
default. 
defaultIf a different policy decision was taken, of the sort that Fiona Bruce was alluding to earlier, then that of course would cause us to organise ourselves differently, but otherwise I am not sure we would do very much differently.
defaultChair:default We did do a report on the draft Bill that the previous 
defaultGovernment
default produced, which probably does give some light on that
default. 
defaultThe previous legislation gave a lot of excuses, effectively, and we also observed at that time that, of a number of countries that had both hit and maintained their commitment to 0.7%, almost none of them had actually got legislation
default. 
defaultPoint taken
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default Just going back to peaks and troughs, page 29 of the NAO briefing, figure
default&#xa0;
default12, shows that the Department’s expenditure will have peaked in November/December and will reduce rapidly
default. 
defaultWhat is the impact on your programme of accelerating this spending at the end of 2013 and then slowing down at the start of 2014, and the impact on your partners as well
default? 
defaultI note, for example, that in the report it says, “The Department is expecting that to live within its 2013-14 programme budget it will have to defer around £300 million of planned programme spend from the first three months of 2014 into the financial year starting in April 
default2014.”
default 
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Richard has spoken to the natural, if you like, seasonal variation—the December issue in particular
default. 
defaultEvery year we get a number for our EC attribution figure, a £700 million 
defaultor 
default£800
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion number, so it is a big number
default. 
defaultWe always pay our major contribution to the World Bank International Development Association then, so that is a big number and, because of the way that the Global Fund replenishment cycle now works, there is a number from them as well
default. 
defaultWhen you strip those three things out, December looks more normal.
defaultOn the second part of your question, the Committee has, in my opinion, rightly over the last several years worried that we have been rushing around, at the end of the calendar year or financial year, finding new things to spend money on in order to hit targets
default. 
defaultWhat you describe in the second part of your question is us now being in the healthier opposite position, which 
defaultis
default more good things that are great value that we can spend money on than we might always have the money available for
default. 
defaultI prefer to be in that position, where we are having to choose at the end of the financial year to re
default&#x2011;
defaultphase
default things, rather than to scramble round and to run the risk, which we do not think we have incurred, of funding slightly less high
default&#x2011;
defaultvalue
default things
default. 
defaultLet me ask Richard to add to that
default.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: I was just going to add one point, which is that, although we have this quite lumpy pattern of spend and essentially two year
default&#x2011;
defaultends
default that impact on the Department, this has been quite predictable
default. 
defaultWe have been able to foresee for some time now, as a result of the spending review settlements, that we would be spending in excess of 80% of our financial year budget in the first three-quarters of the financial year and a relatively small percentage in the first quarter of the calendar year
default.
defaultOne of the things
default—
defaultI think Joy would probably recognise this
default—
defaultthat is difficult for spending departments around DFID is unpredictable in
default&#x2011;
defaultyear
default changes in the profile of spend
default. 
defaultYou can plan for that kind of approach, particularly with multilateral payments
default. We 
defaultwill be making relatively few multilateral payments in the first quarter of the calendar year, but I do not think the consequences for the agencies we are working with will be significant at all, because we have anticipated that and set deposit or payment schedules in line with that.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: On a practical note, it is worth saying that, for most of the countries we work in, their financial year is not the same as ours, so the difference between a payment in the last week of March and the first week of April is not material to them
default. 
defaultTheir financial years are either the 
defaultUS
default financial year or the calendar financial year.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The other thing maybe to add, in terms of how big a problem this is in practice for us, is figure 11 has a row in it that talks about changes in the estimate during the year of the amount of DFID directly managed spend required to meet the target
default. 
defaultYou see from that figure that the range is plus or minus £200 million or £300 million, which is about 2% of the Department’s total budget
default. 
defaultThat is a range of variation that we are very comfortable managing within
default. 
defaultIf it turned out to be 10% or 15%, that would become much more problematic but, given that it is a relatively narrow range, we are normally able to manage it effectively.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default Do you feel a disproportionate amount of your time is spent profiling and re
default&#x2011;
defaultprofiling
default, or do you feel that this is good management in any event and that you would be doing it anyway?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The latter
default. 
defaultIt is a good thing to have a lot more discipline and focus on this, in my opinion
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Good morning
default. 
defaultJust picking up on one point that seems to have had an impact, which again I think we raised a couple of years ago, the amount attributed to Gift Aid has shot up in both of the last two years, which according to the report appears to have come from a reassessment of or perhaps better information that you get from charities
default. 
defaultIs that indeed the case
default? 
defaultI would still say the figure, at £91
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, looks on the low side, but it is getting closer to what I would expect.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Richard might want to add to this
default. 
defaultOne thing I think is happening is that more people are using Gift Aid
default. 
defaultMore publicity and discussion in public 
defaultfora
default like this I am sure contributes
default. 
defaultI have not myself seen data on the other part of your question, which is whether we are capturing it all
default. 
defaultGiven that most of it is from well-known official agencies, I would be disappointed if we are not capturing most of it
default. 
defaultI do not know if Richard knows more than that
default. 
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: We have improved our methodology and we have worked quite hard over the last couple of years to try to get an improved methodology
default. 
defaultIt is one of the figures that relies, to some extent, on extrapolation from evidence and survey information, but we have improved the evidence base, which has enabled us to come up with what we believe is a more accurate figure and for the statisticians to feel that that is properly justifiable.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Thank you
default. 
defaultI would like to turn now to non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default spending, i.e. spending 
defaultthat results
default in an asset on the balance sheet
default. 
defaultThe Treasury has asked you, or instructed you, to increase that by £500
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion in the year
default. 
defaultIs that actually happening?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Yes is the answer
default. 
defaultThe non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default includes three or four major categories
default. 
defaultThe biggest category by far is our contribution to the soft lending and granting arms of the multilateral development banks, so the World Bank, the African Development Fund, 
defaultthe
default Asian Development Fund and so on
default. 
defaultThe accounts classification scorers in the Treasury and the NAO have determined that those contributions are to be treated as non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default, so they have been growing
default. 
defaultThat is the biggest part of what we are doing
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Do they treat them at 100% of face value or do they discount them as, for instance, the student loan is discounted by 30% as non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default expenditure?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The rationale for this treatment of those contributions, as I understand it, is firstly to do with the fact that, were these institutions ever wound up, there would be a payment due back to the contributors to it
default. 
defaultSecondly, it is to do with the fact that this asset is held in special drawing rights
default. 
defaultCandidly, for reasons that are not completely transparent to me—and I am an accountant—the scorers have determined that 
defaultthat 
defaultis the right classification
default. 
defaultIt is not to do
default with
default the recoverable value of the asset, though
default. 
defaultThat is not the basis on which they have made that judgment
default. 
defaultFor other parts of the non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default, that is part of the basis, and maybe Richard could speak a little to those elements, a lot of which are new and come back to the discussion we had last year about lending instruments, equity and those sorts of things.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Before Mr Calvert speaks, if I may just ask, would you not think it was sensible that, like any business putting an asset on its balance sheet, we took a view as to whether that asset was worth what we are putting it at
default? 
defaultAs I say, the student loan book is scored at 70% of its face value, on the basis that 30% will not be collectable
default. 
defaultIf this money is going on soft loans to multilateral development banks, which we may never ever see back, but may continue to accumulate over the years, we are at the risk of having zombie assets on the 
defaultGovernment
default accounts, at some point, which have to be written down.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: You are asking me a question about a regime that I am told to live within, rather than be a designer of.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default I understand, but I would like your view
default. 
defaultGiven that you are responsible for giving this money to these banks, is it worth 100% of what we score it at?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The most I can say is that I think it is a good idea for us to manage these kinds of things more in the way that you would manage a normal asset, but there are particular issues around the scoring of these bits of expenditure
default. 
defaultThere is only a limited amount of productive time I can personally spend on engaging in the debate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default I fully understand, but what this comes back to is, if the banks themselves knew that we were taking a view that what we 
defaultlent
default them was not worth as much as the face value of the money, that should put pressure on them, if there is a problem—there may be no problem, but we do not know—to improve their lending regime
default.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: That is a really powerful point, Mr 
defaultLefroy
default. 
defaultThat is a very powerful point, which is one of the reasons I know was in the Secretary of State’s mind when she decided 
defaultthat, for the latest replenishment of IDA, we should make part of our contribution in very transparently repayable loans in order to increase the incentive the institution has to manage its balance sheet for full recovery
default. 
defaultI am completely with you on that point.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: We do hold on our balance sheet, in relation to the international financial institutions, what we believe is a fair share of our value in the assets for that organisation
default. 
defaultThe point around the capital subscriptions, because that is being put into a pooled fund, is we do not track through that particular share of the overall assets into the organisation, identify that share of the assets separately on our balance sheet and discount it or impair it, in the way that we will with some of the other instruments
default. 
defaultThe distinction I would draw, coming on to the other non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default assets, is that in those cases we have a much more identifiable specific asset, which we are buying into and holding either directly or a share of
default. 
defaultIn those cases, there will be a very strong focus on what the realisable value of those assets is
default. 
defaultWe are looking at the moment at the precise accounting treatment of those, although I think we are very close to finalising that
default. 
defaultWhat is often more complicated is the valuation methodology around those instruments but, again, we are working on that and our expectation is that, over the next few weeks, we will be clear both about the valuation methodology and the accounting treatment
default. 
defaultIn some cases, the focus on non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default has been about simply recognising as non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default the number of assets that effectively we already held but did not recognise on the balance sheet
default. 
defaultIn one or two other cases, and the private infrastructure
default fund—
defaultPIDG
default—
defaultis the most important one, it has led us to change the structure of our holding in PIDG in order to be clear that we are investing in a returnable capital instrument and an asset where we could realise value.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default It seems to me, Mr 
defaultCalvert, that
default we are beginning within DFID to create a quasi
default&#x2011;
defaultdevelopment
default bank by putting this non
default&#x2011;
defaultreturnable
default capital into more formal formats on the DFID balance sheet
default. 
defaultPerhaps you could just say how much non
default&#x2011;
defaultreturnable
default capital, including the investments in development banks, is on the DFID balance sheet at the moment.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: I would draw a distinction between holdings in the international financial institutions and the other non
default&#x2011;
defaultfiscal
default instruments, because we do have substantial holdings, as HMG, in the international financial institutions
default. 
defaultI do not off the top of my head recall the exact number, but it is extremely unlikely and there is no intention ever to realise that
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Having said that, if there is no intention to realise them, in effect they are worth nothing to the 
defaultUK
default taxpayer
default. 
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: They have a balance sheet value, but the 
defaultGovernment
default does not have an intention to take money out of those.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Could the 
defaultGovernment
default ever take money out?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It depends
default. 
defaultIt is a good mindset to be in to hope that, at some point, there are not enough poor countries that need to borrow from the World Bank to require all the balance sheet, and to work towards the point at which, therefore, the subscribers of the capital can be repaid
default. 
defaultThat is a good mindset
default. 
defaultNow, these are not traded assets so, in that 
defaultsense, your point is a very fair one
default, but the 
defaultalternative approach, which is to decide these are not assets at all, would create the wrong set of incentives in the minds of the World Bank and, indeed, the wrong sort of expectations for us and our taxpayers
default. 
defaultThere is a decent rationale for that treatment.
defaultQ35default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It is the reason we have a single full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime director, presumably.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It is among them, yes.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: To go to what may have been underlying your question, does it mean DFID is starting to operate as a bank or do we continue to operate, essentially, as a 
defaultfunder
default of others, including other banks
default? 
defaultAt the moment, we are still in a position where, fundamentally, we are funding other organisations
default. 
defaultThe resources we put in to the IFIs, the resources we put into PIDG or our work through the CDC essentially involves using a third party to operate as a bank
default. 
defaultWe are creating assets and you are right to identify this is a new way of operating for us
default. 
defaultWe are creating assets on the balance sheet, which we may choose to realise, but it is not our intention at the moment to operate those instruments on the basis that we are realising assets as part of our routine financial management or resource management processes, year on year
default. 
defaultAt the moment, the instruments we are setting up, including PIDG, are set up so that they are the ones that are actually doing the management of funds, the allocation of funds and realisation, rather than DFID.
defaultChair:default I think we might explore this a bit more when we have published our report on the future of development finance and seen the 
defaultGovernment
default’s response to it
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Could we just have, at some point, a list of all the assets that you have now created
default? 
defaultPresumably, you have done quite a lot of that in the last year
default. 
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We have done a little, but we can write to you now with a list, and of course they will be in the accounts.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O’Donnell:default My question is about multilaterals
default. 
defaultIt is in three parts, but it is probably easier to 
defaultput 
defaultthem all together
default. 
defaultThe National Audit Office brief shows that you have lots of initiatives under way just now to improve the value for money that we get from multilaterals
default. 
defaultWhy is there so much activity just now
default? 
defaultHave you got concerns about their ability to deliver value for money and also in terms of poverty reduction
default? 
defaultI just wondered more generally how you respond to the concerns that some people have that it is actually a lazy and easy way for the Department to spend money through multilaterals.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Why do we have a big focus on this
default? 
defaultFor the same reason that we have a big focus on value for money across the whole of the portfolio
default. 
defaultIt is a massive part of what we are doing on the bilateral programme as well
default. 
defaultWe are building our own skills, capability and so on, on value for money
default. 
defaultI guess we will come to some of that later in the hearing
default.
defaultWe did the Multilateral Aid Review in 2010
default. 
defaultWe identified a significant number of areas for improvement for all of the agencies, even the well-performing ones
default. 
defaultWe updated the Review in 2013 and we saw there was significant progress, so we were motivated to keep going on this agenda, because it absolutely is our view that there is no multilateral organisation that does not have significant room for improvement on value for money
default. 
defaultThe better they do on it, the more people we will lift out of poverty and the faster we will do 
defaultit. 
defaultIt is a core part of 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment
default’s overall approach to all the organisations we interact with
default. 
defaultIt is not just a multilateral
default&#x2011;
defaultversus
default&#x2011;
defaultbilateral
default thing.
defaultOn the lazy and easy way of disbursing resources point, what I would say is we have been extremely discriminating on the multilaterals to which we have provided additional core funding, and they have only been the ones that have ended up as the top performers through the Multilateral Aid Review
default. 
defaultThere are a number of organisations, as we discussed in the Committee before, which we either left or basically flat
default&#x2011;
defaultlined
default, when we could not leave them, or cut the funding
default. 
defaultProviding that incentive is an important thing to do
default.
defaultAnother way, as you know, in which we fund multilaterals is by using them as a delivery partner in-country, whether it is to deliver a girls’ education programme, a malaria programme or whatever
default. 
defaultOur starting point is the country team asking itself, “Okay, we’ve got this problem we want to try to help solve
default. 
defaultWhat is the range of partners we could use to solve that problem?” Particularly in fragile and conflict
default&#x2011;
defaultaffected
default states, where it is very difficult for us to work through 
defaultGovernment
default systems, essentially there are three main options
default. 
defaultWe can hire a private-sector contractor, which we often do; we can work through NGOs, which we do a lot; or we can identify a multilateral organisation
default. 
defaultThe big thing we have been trying to do is improve the value
default&#x2011;
defaultfor
default&#x2011;
defaultmoney
default drive when we choose a multilateral organisation to do that
default.
defaultFor example, we have done a series of portfolio reviews with UNICEF, looking at all of the cases where we have taken that decision to use UNICEF to deliver a programme in a country and learn the lessons, from country to country, across the whole portfolio we financed with UNICEF, on what has gone well and what has not, what they need to do better and how we make sure all our country teams know the lessons of good experience
default. 
defaultThat again has contributed to progress on value for money.
defaultLast year, you expressed some concern to us about whether
default we do too much of 
defaultwhat in the jargon is called multi
default&#x2011;
defaultb
defaulti
default, using a multilateral partner to deliver a bilateral programme
default. 
defaultWe have reduced the amount we have done in the last year, so that there is more competition from different suppliers or partners to deliver programmes for us when we are making that supplier choice in particular countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O’Donnell:default You may remember last time you appeared before us was a very difficult session about 
defaultTradeMark
default Southern Africa and the major failings in that project
default. 
defaultHow satisfied are you that you are now monitoring these kinds of projects, especially in terms of poverty reduction
default? 
defaultHave we got rigid and rigorous systems in place to monitor all projects now?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The Secretary of State and I were here last month, and we did poorly on that
default. 
defaultThe important thing is to make sure we do not have recurrences, we learn the lessons and we try to make an opportunity out of this bad thing that happened
default. 
defaultThe Secretary of State, since she arrived, has been putting in place a major programme of improvement in our project and programme cycle management, and we have been able to take further steps in the last few months or so
default.
defaultOne particular thing we have done, which as you know was a problem on TMSA, is clear the backlog of annual reviews so that, every year, we are taking a proper professional look, with some oversight on it, on how the project is going and whether there are any problems
default. 
defaultWe had a discussion with the Secretary of State earlier this week on how all that is going, and we will be reporting to her again at the end of the month on whether we have completely cleared the backlog, but we are making very good progress on that.
defaultThere is a range of other things we are doing to improve project and programme management capability
default. 
defaultWe are training hundreds of people around the organisation in those skills
default. 
defaultIn particular, we are investing in the commercial skills and commercial capability of very senior staff
default. 
defaultWe are putting the top 100 people in DFID all through commercial skills training
default. 
defaultThe first course was earlier this month; Richard and I were on it
default. 
defaultThe next one is in March, and then there will be one in May and August
default. 
defaultWe are investing in our internal audit capability to make sure that we catch problems
default. 
defaultThis whole area is right at the top of the Department’s priorities for this year, as it should be, because, having had this big scale
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default, we now have a central responsibility to get the best possible value for every penny that we are responsible for, under the 0.7%.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O’Donnell:default Are you confident then
default? 
defaultHugh 
defaultBayley
default, my colleague, referred to the core purpose of the Department for International Development, which is poverty reduction
default. 
defaultAre you auditing these projects on the basis of what they are delivering?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The most fundamental responsibility we have is to spend our budget in accordance with what Parliament has said it can be used for
default. 
defaultParliament, in the 2002 Act, said that we can only spend money on something if we are confident that the effect will be to reduce poverty
default. 
defaultI do not think there is any member of staff in the Department who does not know that is what we are about
default. 
defaultOf course, there are lots of ways in which you reduce poverty
default. 
defaultSometimes it is direct and sometimes it is indirect, but that is absolutely fundamental to the mission of the Department.
defaultChair:default I am going to ask colleagues to try to crisp it up a bit
default. 
defaultHugh 
defaultBayley
default has one specific supplementary and then I am going to bring Fabian
default&#xa0;
defaultHamilton in.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default We discovered recently that 87% of UK ODA is spent by your Department and 13% by other Departments, so my questions are: has that proportion changed perhaps over the last five years
default? 
defaultWhat oversight does your Department have of ODA 
defaultspend
default by the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and others
default? 
defaultIs there a Cabinet committee that brings together the Departments and exercises departmental oversight on ODA
default? 
defaultCould you, perhaps after this meeting, let us have a memo agreed, in a few paragraphs, I mean, with the permanent secretaries of the other ODA
default&#x2011;
defaultspending
default Departments showing the value of ODA that they each spend, indicating broadly how the money is spent
default? 
defaultWill you look at whether the 
defaultGovernment
default should be producing, perhaps as an appendix to your report, a consolidated overview of UK ODA, so that we can see the picture in one place?
defaultChair:default Can I suggest a quick response and some notes
default? 
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: On the penultimate question, yes
default, 
defaultI will ask my colleagues to agree that we give you the memorandum
default. 
defaultOn the last question, the consolidated overview, of course each Departmental Select Committee has oversight of this in these kinds of sessions
default. 
defaultI will take away whether there is some aggregation beyond that
default. 
defaultOn the question of oversight, each accounting officer is responsible for their budget
default. 
defaultWe have a lot of discussion, for example, on whether an activity would score as ODA
default. 
defaultThe other Departments constantly come to us for advice and help
default. 
defaultA lot of the way the cross
default&#x2011;
defaultGovernment
default ODA is managed is in joint teams, so our 
defaultstaff populate
default other Departments and we have imports
default. 
defaultOn the question of cross
default&#x2011;
defaultGovernment
default discussion at 
defaultministerial
default level, obviously the National Secretary Council, on which the Secretary of State sits, covers these issues and has had a number of discussions on development issues and more in prospect
default. 
defaultThere is political oversight as well
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default Has the proportion changed over five years?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The proportion I do not think has changed materially
default. 
defaultIt is in the 85% to 90% range every year, but we will go back to the numbers, Mr 
defaultBayley
default, and check.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default I want to go back to the money we spent multilaterally and I wanted to ask you about capabilities at a local level, before we actual commit to bilateral funding
default. 
defaultFor example, I note that ICAI found that a large number of separate relationships that DFID has with UNICEF makes it difficult for the two to share collective experience of working with each other
default. 
defaultI wonder whether you have been able to resolve this issue and, if so, what difference that has made to working, for example with UNICEF, and other similar organisations.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I think it was a really good insight from ICAI, which was why we did the portfolio review I described earlier
default. 
defaultJoy has been talking to UNICEF at the top level recently about this, so maybe she can give you more detail.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: I went to 
defaultNew York
default in November to conduct a review of the bilateral portfolio spent through UNICEF
default. 
defaultIt is £200
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, so it is 80% of our overall funding
default—
defaultour core funding is £40
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, so it was a really important thing to do to go and have that conversation
default. 
defaultWe had both gathered feedback from across our own organisations and we were able to have that conversation at the strategic level about the things that were happening variously at a local level
default.
defaultWe talked about issues about the recruitment and retention of UNICEF staff and the problems our teams sometimes have about capability on the ground, knowing what is happening and when there is staff turnover
default. 
defaultWe talked about what UNICEF is doing to promote effective programme management
default. 
defaultWe talked about programme design, where we thought that our teams could be agreeing on the shape of programmes, the results and the reporting cycles a bit earlier to make sure we had buy
default&#x2011;
defaultin
default from both teams
default. 
defaultWe talked particularly to UNICEF about how they exercise accountability on their downstream partners, where we wanted a bit more visibility over what was happening there
default. 
defaultI think it is very good that ICAI prompted us to start that set of reviews
default. 
defaultI am going back next month to do the same process with UNDP, where we have a portfolio of about the same size.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It might be worth saying, by the way, on this that I think this debate started with Mr McCann’s question to me in 2011, and we have been thinking about it since then
default. 
defaultIt has been reinforced by ICAI taking an interest.
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default You have a very good memory if you can remember back to 2011
default. 
defaultMr McCann:default It was a good question.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default It obviously was a good question
default, but 
defaultI was not on the Committee then
default. 
defaultJoy mentioned UNDP and I just wanted to pick you up on that, because we have a feeling sometimes on our visits that DFID funds UNDP because it is an organisation that does this kind of work for parliamentary strengthening, and we know it can absorb substantial sums of money without necessarily producing the kind of quality of work we would like to see
default. 
defaultI wonder how you plan to improve that
default. 
defaultObviously, going back to 
defaultNew York
default, you are going to talk to them, but what are you going to say to them?
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: We are in the process of preparing that at the moment, and I am meeting our country teams later this week to actually hear directly from them what they want me to say to UNDP
default. 
defaultThe MAR finding around UNDP was quite interesting, because it scored rather better than some of the frustrations the teams expressed would have led us to believe
default. 
defaultThis process enables us to join up a bit the MAR assessment and what our people are actually finding on the ground.
defaultOne of the things that we know we need to address with UNDP is that it has a slight propensity to take money for all sorts of activities and to be tempted not to focus on the key activities in their strategic plan
default. 
defaultWe want to have a discussion with them about how they are going to stay 
defaultfocus
defaulted, and I think they will challenge us not to offer them money for things that are not in their strategic plan, so we need to be disciplined about that as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I just interject there
default? 
defaultWe do not want to return to tied aid but you will find—we have published evidence on our Burma report and when we produce the report—that we think there is scope for DFID to support parliamentary strengthening in a different way and possibly to support some more British
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default capability rather than farm it all out.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Thank you very much, Chair
default. 
defaultI completely agree with that point
default. 
defaultWe need more competition to help countries tackle these sorts of problems
default. 
defaultAs you know, we have started funding the Westminster Foundation from the Department
default. 
defaultI hope that goes well
default. 
defaultThe first year’s performance in the annual review of that was quite positive, but there are quite big challenges ahead
default. 
defaultA lot of what we have done with other parliaments has been in the finance/public accounts space, and there is a range of potential suppliers you can go to there
default. 
defaultOne of the biggest drivers of the improvement that Joy has talked about and we would all like to see on UNDP is 
defaultthem
default feeling there is more competition
default. 
defaultI completely agree with you; most of the countries in which we work have British
default&#x2011;
defaultlike
default institutions
default. 
defaultWe have a comparative advantage to offer help in this area.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Yet we still farm it out to UNDP, so I am glad you are examining that and hopefully that will lead to a change
default. 
defaultICAI also found weaknesses in the EU’s performance management system, on which you need to rely in order to assess the value for money and impact of this spending
default. 
defaultI wonder what progress DFID has made on improving its oversight of EU contributions.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We have been pushing this
default. 
defaultIn December, the EU published their proposal for a results framework, which we hope will be implemented this year and they will start to report on next year
default. 
defaultI know this was a concern previously of the Committee
default. We 
defaulthave also commissioned a range of country offices to provide us with feedback on the performance of Commission programmes in the countries in which they work
default. 
defaultIn fact, when we did the MAR update, which was published in 
defaultDecember, that
default was informed in respect of the EU by all that country
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel
default data
default. 
defaultI know that people will keep looking at this
default. 
defaultWe have given our country offices extensive guidance on the importance of doing this work
default. 
defaultWe have also asked the Foreign Office to try to do that in countries where DFID is not represented, where the European Commission is spending money
default. 
defaultThat is sometimes a bit more difficult, because the size of FCO representations in lots of those countries is very small and they are quite hard
default&#x2011;
defaultpressed, but we recognise that this is something we need to do as well as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default You think the country offices are giving us some pretty good feedback, then, on the effectiveness of EU programmes.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It has definitely improved
default. 
defaultThe country officers are always quite hard
default&#x2011;
defaultpressed
default. 
defaultIt is not perfect, but the direction of travel is a bit better, I think
default. 
defaultI guess people will look at it again and we will get some more evidence
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Are you looking to make any changes at all?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We though
defaultt it was good to get the better-
defaultquality data country by country that we got when we did the MAR update so, in that sense, this new approach has been corroborated
default. 
defaultI w
defaultill
default be interested to see what evidence is generated on the use and real traction of the European Commission’s performance framework and how that has drilled down to the country level
default. 
defaultI would be interested to hear from our country offices and whether they see or hear anything of that
default. 
defaultThat will be an area to keep an eye on and we will have to adjust in light of experience.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPauline Latham:default If multilaterals are unwilling to compete against other providers, how can your teams be sure that a multilateral is the most cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective way of delivering a project?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Increasingly, what we have been trying to do when we are designing a project is avoid the country teams automatically resorting to the idea that, if it is this sort of project, it is Organisation X
default. 
defaultThe guidance on business cases and preparing ideas requires people to think much more explicitly now about the range of possible suppliers, so that introduces some implicit competition
default. 
defaultIf all the potential suppliers in a country know we are thinking about tackling a problem but we have not decided whether to use a private
default 
defaultsector route, an NGO route or a UN route, we hope that will encourage all of them to improve the quality of their offer
default.
defaultThe other thing we have done is to keep driving as hard as we can on administration costs, value for money and better procurement capability in all the multilaterals, so there is a big value
default&#x2011;
defaultfor
default&#x2011;
defaultmoney
default programme
default. 
defaultSince I was last answering questions on this, there have been some improvements
default. 
defaultThe Global Fund’s budget for 2013, for example, 
defaulto
defaultn administration was 15% lower than the 2012 budget
default. 
defaultThe European Development Fund budget for overheads was frozen at 3.25% rather than 5%, as part of the 
defaultGovernment
default’s overall approach to containing the costs of 
defaultEurope
default, so there is some progress
default. 
defaultWe see more people raising these issues
default. 
defaultAgencies are seeing that some of their competitors 
defaultare having
default to address this, so that again gives them an incentive, but, as I said much earlier in the hearing, this is going to be a constant theme
default. 
defaultI do not think we have got to where we should get to on really driving value for money across these organisations
default.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: The choices that teams are making are already being reflected in the composition of the bilateral portfolio
default. 
defaultThis year, in 2012
default&#x2011;
default13, 25% of the bilateral portfolio was through multilaterals
default. 
defaultIn the previous year it was 32%, and what we are seeing is the proportion of contracted programmes going up from 16% to 21%, so we are already seeing that shift starting but, as Mark said, not yet finished
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPauline Latham:default Does that give value for money?
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: The exam question that they are asking is, for this set of results, what is the best value
default&#x2011;
defaultfor
default&#x2011;
defaultmoney
default way of delivering it
default. 
defaultThey will then have a conversation with 
defaulta 
defaultcommercial adviser about different procurement routes and try to use all the evidence to make that judgment.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: On the cost side, we are definitely making progress on all of the different routes
default. 
defaultThey are all much more cost
default&#x2011;
defaultconscious
default, so value for money is a combination of the value you get and what you pay for it
default. 
defaultOn what we pay for it, we are definitely making progress
default. 
defaultWe are also making progress on the value side
default. 
defaultThe organisations are feeling a need to compete better on the quality of what they can offer for the price.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default The Secretary of State has made a high priority of improving DFID’s work with suppliers
default. 
defaultWhat progress has been made and have you addressed ICAI’s concerns?
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: Shall I start off on that
default? 
defaultAs you say, the Secretary of State has challenged the Department very clearly on this and, in many 
defaultways,
default the concerns raised by ICAI reflect that
default. 
defaultWe have acknowledged as a Department that we need
defaulted
default to strengthen our work in dealing with suppliers
default. 
defaultThere have been two or three key strands to that and I will describe some of the progress that we have made over the last year or so
default.
defaultFirstly, there was a much more active approach to engaging with and managing our key suppliers—our top 11 or so providers of services to DFID
default. 
defaultWe have now established a key supplier relationship with all of those
default. 
defaultWe have a member of the senior civil service in DFID responsible for each of those relationships
default. 
defaultWe have held our first key supplier conference, which has brought together 
defaultMinister
defaults, officials and key suppliers to work through any kind of key issues
default. 
defaultWithin the Department, we now have a much better sense that we should not think about suppliers just in terms of individual contracts, but we should think in terms of the relationship as a whole
default. 
defaultIt has given us a better basis for managing performance issues with suppliers, where they have arisen
default. 
defaultWe should also say, from our side, it has given us a better basis for getting learning and experience from suppliers
default. 
defaultAs the ICAI report pointed out, this is not simply a purchaser/supplier relationship
default—
defaultthere is an element of partnership in a lot of the work that we do with our key suppliers
default. 
defaultWe have made good progress on that
default.
defaultAs Mark alluded to earlier, we have been working hard on the skills and capability side within the Department
default. 
defaultWe will be up to 17 commercial advisers quite shortly, and that is really from a base of zero not very long ago, so that gives us a lot more specialist capacity at professional adviser level, but we will also, by the end of March, have had half of our senior civil servants go through the commercial awareness and training programme
default. 
defaultThe other half will be completed towards the end of 2014.
defaultOne of the things that 
defaultcomes
default out most consistently through all of these strands is the importance of thinking about the commercial and delivery aspects of an intervention at an earlier stage in the process
default. 
defaultThere are some specialist skills that are important in this, but a lot of this is about a change of mindset within the Department
default. 
defaultWhen we are thinking about the initial design of an intervention, we are thinking about how we are going to deliver it and what 
defaultare the most appropriate routes
default. 
defaultWe have talked about some of the choices between multilateral partners or suppliers
default. 
defaultProbably one of the biggest reasons why we have not been as good in the past always as we should have been is we have sometimes left that judgment 
defaulttoo far into the process of programme design, where we have taken design decisions that have effectively led us to a narrow route of options on delivery.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default Another criticism was project management delivery, which you know that ICAI identified as a weakness and thus was producing less value for money
default. 
defaultWhat progress has been made there?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I will perhaps start and ask Richard to come in
default. 
defaultI talked a bit earlier about the wide range of things we are doing to improve the quality of programme management
default. 
defaultOne of the biggest most important things is just investing in the skills and incentives and culture of the staff
default. 
defaultWe appointed a head of profession for programme management, who started work six months ago
default. 
defaultWe have had 700 staff through basic training programmes since the beginning of last year and, of those, something like 300 have reached the level where they have some accreditation
default. 
defaultWe are also building a more advanced level of accreditation, so people demonstrably have a better set of skills for programme management than they previously had
default.
defaultWe then have a much stronger focus in our management information, which is served up every month to the directors, then to the directors general, and then to me and to 
defaultMinister
defaults, so we can track what is happening on the major programmes
default. Minister
defaults are having a regular series of meetings, country by country, on this now, so there is much more scrutiny about what is going well and what is going less well
default. 
defaultWe are asking people a bit more explicitly to be up front in saying what their two or three worry projects are
default. 
defaultWe try to create a positive incentive to share a problem, so it can be fixed, rather than to conceal a problem
default. 
defaultAs you know, we have a kind of index that captures the overall aggregate score of the whole of the portfolio we invest in, and the score is reasonably stable
default. 
defaultOver time, as all these investments come in, we want to see that score moving up
default. 
defaultThat is evidence of getting better value for money and more successful project completion
default.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: You have covered a lot of the key points, Mark
default. 
defaultFor the Department as a whole, the strongest message is we need to be much more consistent in our approach to programme management
default. 
defaultWe have a lot of experience in good programme managers in the Department, but the approach we are taking at the moment is designed to ensure that we have greater consistency across all of our activities and projects, but also that we allow programme managers to spend their time in the most value
default&#x2011;
defaultadding
default way
default.
defaultOne of the other aspects of the work on programme management has been to look again at how we produce business cases and where effort goes in the programme cycle
default. 
defaultWe and others have recognised that, although the new business case that was introduced in 2010 has brought in a lot more rigour around important aspects of the appraisal process, it has also taken a lot of time and effort in teams to produce, and we have ended up with business cases taking up relatively more of the time of programme teams than we think is necessary
default. 
defaultNow, that is not to say that the business case is not always going to be a really critical document or a critical part of the programme process, but we are looking to slightly rebalance efforts so relatively more time is freed up to focus on the delivery and implementation, and to make sure the time spent at the business-case stage is time well spent
default. 
defaultWe are at the moment piloting a slight variation of the business-case format and approach, which keeps the rigour that we introduced in 2010 but takes away some of the unnecessary process and detail.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default I am sure the Committee will want to monitor the success of these programmes
default. 
defaultThe final point I would ask is this: Adam Smith International’s view is there is a difference between what is seen as a prestigious policy adviser and the worker bee of programme management implementation
default. 
defaultDo you think that is a legitimate criticism and, if so, what are you doing to stop 
defaultthat 
defaultinterpretation 
defaultor 
defaultthat division?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We think programme management is a profession, and those skills are needed in our advisory cadres, as well as in the programme support teams more narrowly described
default. 
defaultNo, I do not agree with that proposition at all
default. 
defaultOne thing we are doing is having much more explicit nomination of who the senior responsible person is for all the major programmes, and you will only be able to be a senior responsible officer for a programme if you demonstrably have the right set of programme management, commercial and related skills
default. 
defaultYou might have joined us as an economist, an engineer or a health professional but, unless you have that other set of skills, you will not be in those roles.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Moving on, on the same subject, we have had a note in confidence from a development professional who wishes to remain anonymous
default. 
defaultPerhaps you have pre
default&#x2011;
defaultempted this, Mr Calvert, but it said that “business cases are too intricate and require too many different people to be involved in their completion”
default. 
defaultIt was pointing out that “the combination of the unwieldy business case and the requirement for Secretary of State approval for virtually every spending decision” that is above £5
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, I think it is now, or even lower than that, “causes the most difficulty”
default. 
defaultI wonder what your reaction is to that
default. 
defaultTo some extent, you have begun to answer that—the fact that the business case takes a long time and involves a lot of redrafting, with perhaps people being very concerned to cover every single angle that the Secretary of State may raise.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Maybe I can deal with the second part of that and come back to Richard on what we are doing on documentation and so on
default. 
defaultWe had a discussion in 2012 when I was here about the advantage from my point of view of having much stronger 
defaultministerial
default engagement and oversight on a wider proportion of the portfolio, and I am absolutely clear that is a very positive thing
default. 
defaultIt is empowering and a positive thing for the staff 
defaultwho
default are developing programmes as well
default. 
defaultThey like the fact that there is top
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel political engagement in the work they are doing
default. 
defaultThere are two different things there
default. 
defaultHaving this real focus from our 
defaultministerial
default team is absolutely supportive of improving the quality of project and programme management
default. 
defaultThe question of documentation is a different thing
default. Minister
defaults quite rightly do not want to see documents being much longer than they need to be
default. 
defaultI can tell you that permanent secretaries are not very keen on that either and nor are directors general
default. 
defaultThe incentives are all completely aligned
default. 
defaultWe have been trying to make sure that documents cover what they need to cover and that they are done in a way that is proportionate
default. 
defaultThere have been cases where things have taken too long and too many people have been consulted
default. 
defaultWe are changing the processes and systems to deal with that, and it is a work in progress
default. 
defaultThe incentives coming down the system—I do not think anybody anymore can think that their prospects in life are improved by writing hundreds of pages of nugatory material, but maybe Richard could speak some more about the detail of all this.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: Just a couple of very brief points: one of the keys to the change in the business case is actually splitting what was previously the business case into two documents
default. 
defaultWe have what is essentially an appraisal and approval document on the one hand and, on the other hand, a programme delivery plan
default. 
defaultA lot of the detail that goes into the delivery plan, so 
defaulthow a project is going to be managed and delivered to—its lifecycle—is for the programme team to manage and keep as an ongoing document as the programme goes on
default. 
defaultThe previous business case format asked teams to try to compress that into a single document, so that is one of the big changes.
defaultThe second thing is not just about the document, but it is about really clarifying who is responsible for preparing and signing off a business case, and avoiding what we recognise as a bit of a tendency in DFID for lots of people to want to be involved and lots of people to want to have their say in the design
default. 
defaultWe are just being clear about who takes lead responsibility
default. 
defaultMark has talked about the senior responsible owner model that we are going to be introducing
default. 
defaultThere is a bit of culture and behaviour, and there is a bit of change in the documentation
default. 
defaultAs I said earlier, we are piloting the new approach at the moment with 10 live business cases and we will be very happy to share the results of that with the Committee
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Following on from that, is there any distinction in the amount of work being done for what would be classed as less risky or riskier business cases?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Yes, absolutely
default. 
defaultThere is and there should be
default. 
defaultThe riskier things should attract a greater degree of professional engagement, scrutiny and so on, and the less risky should be done in a more proportionate way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Finally
default,
default on implementation, clearly our view is somewhat coloured by 
defaultTradeMark
default Southern Africa and the real problems of implementation of that or complete lack of implementation there
default. 
defaultHow have you already changed your review of the way in which programmes are implemented as a result of that, as I imagine you must have done?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I have alluded to parts of that during the course of the hearing
default. 
defaultThe first thing is everyone around the whole organisation has seen we had a problem there, so everyone has a strong personal incentive to be all over the quality of implementation, so that they do not find themselves supervising a project with that kind of problem
default. 
defaultThat is a very big driver of change behaviour, activity and so on
default. 
defaultThe second thing, which I do think is really important, is a much more rigorous and tougher approach on the annual review process, and the third thing is improving the quality of management information, so that we see both a much more aggregated and disaggregated
default—
defaultby country, by sector and by theme
default—
defaultpicture month by month of what is going well and what is going less well
default.
defaultI am sorry to repeat a point I made earlier, but I think it is an important point
default. 
defaultWe need to build a culture where people think it is okay to express worries about how something is going
default. 
defaultSometimes what happens if you have a problem is everyone gets fantastically risk averse
default. 
defaultActually, that is counterproductive
default. 
defaultThere is a delicate balance to be managed here to encourage people to believe and act as though it is okay to expose a problem if you think there is a problem, and get help in dealing with that problem.
defaultChair:default I am conscious of the fact that we have a number of questions and we would still like to get people away for Prime 
defaultMinister
default’s Questions
default. 
defaultI
default&#xa0;
defaultthink Hugh
default&#xa0;
defaultBayley
default has a supplementary and Fabian Hamilton has one
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default My impressions from visiting your country offices over a number of years is that you put an enormous amount of effort into writing the business case, but surely 
defaultan equally important part of the process is the first conceptual take that the country team has that a particular block of work in the education field is necessary, which is not anything like as rigorously assessed
default. 
defaultAfter you have approved work in a particular field, there is to my mind far too little field engagement by your staff, because of pressures on numbers
default. 
defaultShould you not change the balance, so that you spend more time looking at the landscape of a country and sector in which you are working, and looking at the impact of projects, and rather less on gold
default&#x2011;
defaultplating
default the business case itself?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I particularly agree with your second point, which is we need to slightly move the balance of professional and staff effort to the post
default&#x2011;
defaultapproval
default phases, and that is what the end
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultend
default review and all the things I have been 
defaultsaying 
defaultabout
default 
defaultprogramme management, are intended to contribute to, so I agree with that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default One of the ways in which our teams might be able to avoid the operating cost limits on them is by contracting out services that might more sensibly, perhaps, be conducted within DFID
default. 
defaultI wonder if you can tell us to what degree you think this is actually happening and what controls are in place to ensure that teams do not contract out those services simply to avoid operating costs.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The controls are basically about the rules that apply to the administration budget and the operating cost budget, on the one hand, and the programme budget on the other hand
default. 
defaultWe have not had significant problems with breach of those rules
default. 
defaultI do not think it is a major problem in practice; it is one that conceptually could arise
default.
defaultAs you know, we have had a substantial growth in the professional capability of the Department over the last three years
default. 
defaultStaffing levels have gone to roughly 3,000 from 2,500 or so in 2010
default. 
defaultWe needed to do that because we were planning to deliver a lot more
default. 
defaultWe are still, by the way, in the position, as the NAO has said in their report, that “the best available evidence indicates the cost of delivering UK aid is low compared to other donor countries”—about half that of other donor countries, according to the NAO, so it is not as though we are lavishly staffed
default.
defaultWe are in a better position now than we would have been without this growth in our professional capability, especially at the front line, and I have not seen—
default Richard, 
defaultI do not know if you want to contradict this—significant or worrying breaches of the control regime about what is administration and operating costs, and what is programme
default. 
defaultYou can, if you want to, make a case to use some external piece of advice or help under your operating cost budget
default. 
defaultSometimes that is a rational decision, because we do not necessarily have all of the expertise that a Department like DFID sometimes needs inside
default. 
defaultSometimes it is rational to get a bit of help from outside, but the fact that we have grown our internal capability such a lot puts us in a better position.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default You are confident that this is not being done—that the contracting
default&#x2011;
defaultout
default is not being used as a way of avoiding operating costs.
defaultRichard Calvertdefault: We are confident
default. 
defaultAs Mark said, it is something that we have to keep under review, and the NAO and Treasury will do that
default. 
defaultAs Mark said, the rules are what really drive the classification, rather than who is carrying out the task
default. 
defaultIf you simply employ a contractor to fill the job of a core member of staff, that is still going to score as an admin charge
default. 
defaultI think we have enough controls, but there is equally lots of our work, particularly on the programme delivery side, where we are going to be using contractors
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Can I just follow up something that Hugh
default&#xa0;
defaultBayley
default said earlier about the global view of the work that DFID does
default? 
defaultICAI tells us that there 
defaultare
default a number of staff in different country offices who would actually quite like to see the impact of the programmes that they are putting into operation but, because of the 
defaultwork load 
defaulton them, they cannot get out into the field enough to see that
default. 
defaultWhat are you doing to try to ensure that is possible
default? 
defaultDo you think it is a good idea that our staff should see the impact
default?
defaultChair:default That is why they are pleased when the Committee turns up and enables them to do it.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Completely
default—
defaultit is 100% a good idea
default. 
defaultThere should be more of that
default. 
defaultHaving a stronger focus on the post
default&#x2011;
defaultapproval
default phases and a stronger requirement to do the annual reviews on time and to a higher quality will produce that as one of the effects, I hope.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Are you going to allow time to be freed up for staff to be able to do that?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: That is exactly what I would expect to see as a result of trying to streamline the process on the pre
default&#x2011;
defaultapproval
default phases of a business case to free up resource for its implementation.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: Some offices do this extremely well already
default. 
defaultEthiopia
default had 30 field visits in the third quarter of last year
default. 
defaultOne of the things we need to do is just make sure people are doing the right things while they are out on the visits and are joining up looking at the financial reports in the office with them going and looking at the results on the ground
default. 
defaultThere is quantity and quality that we need to keep an eye on
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default To go back to 
defaultFabian’s
default original point about the right balance, paragraph 5.3 of the report says that the Department’s latest 
defaultwork force 
defaultplans prepared by its advisers in September 2013 suggests an increase in the number of posts by around 5%, but it states in the same paragraph that there is not enough money to do that
default. 
defaultThat would suggest that what we have been saying over the last few years—that the Department is artificially depressing its costs—has actually taken place.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: If you look at the next page, you will see the staffing numbers’ growth that I was alluding to earlier
default. 
defaultThese do not include all the staff in the Department, by the way
default—
defaultone or two categories 
defaultare 
defaultnot included there.
defaultMr McCann:default That is in the field—the advisers.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: This is the total
default. 
defaultThe right
default&#x2011;
defaulthand side is the total, and most of the growth has been in the field, in the front line
default. 
defaultIt is true
default, and 
defaultyou are absolutely right, Mr McCann, that we are coming to the end of that phase of rapid growth
default. 
defaultThe total operating cost budget, including the administration budget, will be under more pressure for the period ahead
default. 
defaultExactly how that plays out in staffing levels is a slightly different thing, because people have got very efficient in working out whether it is better value for money to have an extra staff member rather than get something done outside
default. 
defaultI do not think there will be a lot of growth in the staffing of the Department over the period ahead, but I am not saying there will not be any growth.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default You can assure me that it will not be artificially depressed and the decisions made for reasons of value for money and delivery, and not because the budget has been capped
default.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I have given that assurance before
default. 
defaultI said, last year and the year before, that I am not ready to be in a position where I am worried that we do not have the capacity to deliver what we are trying to deliver
default. 
defaultWe have made a lot of progress on that and, candidly, the Committee over the years has given us some help with that
default. 
defaultI am less worried about that as a problem, personally, than I was some years ago but, if I become more 
defaultworried,
default it will be
default my
default responsibility to have something done about it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default defaultYou made the point just a moment ago, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultLowcock
default, that
default on the DAC figures the administrative cost of 
defaultUK
default spending is considerably lower than most other large donors but, if you spend less as a proportion on administration, does it not mean that there is a greater risk on quality and results?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It depends on how efficient we 
defaultare,
default what quality of processes we have and how well governed and managed we are
default. 
defaultWe are having another OECD DAC peer review this year of the Department, which will give us a comprehensive assessment of where we stand on the whole set of issues, including this, compared with our peers
default. 
defaultAs you know, over the last two or three reviews, the core finding has been of the quality of the 
defaultUK
default development programme, notwithstanding the fact that, a bit like the NHS, it has delivered very efficiently and is cheap relative to the outcomes
default. 
defaultI would be extremely disappointed if they say that has changed
default. 
defaultMy observation is that the quality of people we have brought in, the motivation, and the effectiveness and efficiency of those people is very high.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHugh defaultBayleydefault:default One of the things that your figures obscure, in a way, is that when you contract money out to a third party, they of course have administrative costs that do not get included in the total
default. 
defaultWould it be possible for you to produce an estimate of what the overall administrative cost is and maybe even for a few of the multilaterals
default? 
defaultYou would look at the World Bank; you would say your executive director and team in 
defaultWashington
default, and the team in 
defaultLondon
default, account for, should we say, 1% of a programme or 2% of the contribution that the 
defaultUK
default makes to the World Bank, but the World Bank’s administrative cost is 2%, 4% or whatever it is
default. 
defaultIt would give a more realistic view, especially when we use multilaterals, of what the total administrative overhead is, theirs including ours
default.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We have done that for some programmes
default. 
defaultTwo or three years ago, we had this discussion, you will remember, on the total overhead cost for delivering our health programme in 
defaultZimbabwe
default. 
defaultWe were doing some things
default and 
defaultthere were contractors and implementing organisations
default. 
defaultWe did look at the totality of that
default. 
defaultIt is quite expensive and time
default&#x2011;
defaultconsuming to do it
default, but 
defaultI am very happy to have a look at whether we have conducted more examples of that sort recently we can share with you
default. 
defaultFor the multilateral organisations, we absolutely expect them as organisations to have a good sense of their total operating costs and admin, and to be tracking that and driving it down
default. 
defaultI gave the example earlier of how the Global Fund has been doing that
default.
defaultRegarding the proportion of the cost of the World Bank, if you like, and whether that changes when you add in the cost of our supervision of our interest in the World Bank, that element of the cost is so small that it will not make any material difference to an organisation of 15,000 people or something
default. 
defaultI do not think that is going to move the dial.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We have a couple of questions to go, so that we can get to the end
default. 
defaultIt is really about recruitment, retention and promotion, and there are issues we have raised before
default. 
defaultOne is the turnover of staff and the other is their qualifications
default. 
defaultICAI rated the Burmese operation good because of its continuity
default. 
defaultI notice it has all changed since, of course
default. 
defaultWe also saw the value of having a Burmese
default&#x2011;
defaultspeaking
default Foreign Office official with us
default. 
defaultIt was quite important
default. 
defaultYou are operating in fragile states, and then we are told that people have difficulty working there
default. 
defaultGiven that is what the organisation does, should you not be recruiting people who expect to go there
default? 
defaultShould you not be encouraging more people to learn languages
default? 
defaultShould that not be part of the career development and promotional package
default? 
defaultWe have raised all these issues before, but we are still conscious of the fact that they are not as we would like them to be.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: Quickly, 1,300 of our staff have recorded language skills on the system
default. Fifty-six 
defaultlanguages other than English are spoken
default. 
defaultHalf of those people are fully proficient in another language, and we have been spending more money on language training over the last 12 months or so
default. 
defaultOne of the main reasons why we have our highly capable staff 
defaultappointed
default in-country is because of the language, cultural and contextual skills that they bring.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSir Tony Cunningham:default Could I just ask if that language training is done in-country?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It is a mixture, Sir Tony
default. 
defaultSir Tony Cunningham:default It is so important to do it in-country.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I completely agree with you
default. 
defaultOne thing that people often do is spend some time with a family or in a community
default. 
defaultYou are learning not just the language, but a whole bunch of other things as well
default.
defaultChair:default They might learn Nepalese and then you will send them to 
defaultZimbabwe
default.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: We need to be intelligent about that
default. 
defaultYou have raised before with us the issue, which is also in your question, about how we get continuity for a longer period or benefit from a longer period from people who spend a chunk of time, say, in Afghanistan but, for reasons I do not at all 
defaultresile
default from, we will not send to Afghanistan for years and years on end
default. 
defaultIncreasingly, we have cases where people have done a posting, come back and worked on Afghanistan and that region for two or three years in London, and maybe have gone back again
default. 
defaultWe have taken to heart the messages you have given to us on this
default. 
defaultWe will keep paying attention to that and I think we are getting a bit better at it.
defaultChair:default I think that is the case with the Burmese staff
default. 
defaultSome of them are still working on the Burmese programme, but they are doing it from here.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I do not know on 
defaultBurma
default, to be honest
default. 
defaultI would need to look into that
default. 
defaultThere may be one or two people, but I am not sure.
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: Could I just give two very quick examples on language training
default? 
defaultWe appointed a new head of DFID Mozambique last year and we had two Portuguese speakers to make the choice between, which was a good position to be in
default. 
defaultWe just appointed the new head for DRC for 2015, and we have done it a year early so that we can make absolutely sure that he has his language skills up to speed before he goes into that post.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Being what, French or local?
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: That is the French language.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default I was just going to ask if it is a requirement of all UK
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default staff who go overseas to learn the language once they are there, because that would seem to me to be an obvious requirement, as a matter of courtesy to the host country?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It is not a formal requirement for everybody to do that.
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default Should it not be?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I am reluctant to add to the number of formal requirements that there are for people to be posted to particular roles
default. 
defaultIn order to be an economist for us in Country X, you need to be a member of the 
defaultGovernment
default Economic Service, which has extremely stringent entry criteria
default. 
defaultYou need the right development background as well
default.
defaultJeremy defaultLefroydefault:default I am not saying you should have to speak the language before you go
default. 
defaultI am saying, once you are there, it should be part of your contract that you are expected to learn the local language as much as possible
default. 
defaultJoy defaultHutcheondefault: In most of the countries where we work, the business of 
defaultGovernment
default is conducted in English
default. 
defaultThere are some 
defaultLusophone
default and Francophone countries where we do expect people to have learned the language
default. 
defaultIn a number of countries, there is not a single local language and, actually, language is a deeply divisive issue
default. 
defaultIt is not immediately obvious, if you go to 
defaultZambia
default for example, which one of the multiple languages in 
defaultZambia
default you would learn
default. 
defaultI think all of our heads of office, in my experience, will make an effort to have a conversational level of language just to be able to deal with the local staff in their office, and to be polite and courteous and demonstrate that they are making an effort.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I would prefer that, to be honest
default. 
defaultIf we made a requirement, people will be paying people to do that as part of a job
default. 
defaultYou cannot make it a requirement and then ask them to do it in their free time
default. 
defaultLet me take it away and think about it again, but I think I would prefer to stick with the implicit expectation rather than formal requirement.
defaultChair:default I think we like what you are saying, but we would look for more results and we will monitor those
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default Chair, we are running out of time, so could I ask perhaps for this question to be responded to in writing
default? 
defaultIt really goes to Abercrombie House and the staff reductions there
default. 
defaultI have tried at several meetings to understand the process as operated
default. 
defaultThere was an announcement made
default—
defaultwe have been told that the reductions have been made
default. 
defaultPerhaps you could give us a note in writing about how many staff have gone, what grades they were in, what they actually did, what aspects of their jobs we no longer do and where the work has gone that still remains in the Department
default. 
defaultThere is a very strong concern that I have, and I have expressed to the Committee, that some of the basic admin jobs carried out in Abercrombie House have just been absorbed into higher
default&#x2011;
defaultgrade specifications, which means that we have people being paid big sums of money and who are meant to be delivering programmes—the jobs they have been recruited to—and their time is being spent on basic admin duties
default. 
defaultIf that detail could be supplied, I would be grateful
default. 
defaultChair:default That could be in writing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMr McCann:default Writing is fine, yes
default. 
defaultThe question that I have is this
default. 
defaultI know you have not given us a formal response to the 
defaultScotland
default report, but I personally was very concerned about a lack of interest, which appeared to me to be from senior management in East Kilbride, about the concept that the communications were not that good with both NGOs in 
defaultScotland
default and with press communications
default. 
defaultIt was summed up by the fact that a £9
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion budget, which we allow the Scottish 
defaultGovernment
default to spend, gets 
defaultmore publicity than the billions of pounds 
defaultwe spend on international aid
default. 
defaultCan you give us a little sneak preview of what your response will be
default? 
defaultWill you agree to our request for a bespoke communications unit being set up in 
defaultEast Kilbride
default?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: The 
defaultMinister
default is responding next month to the report.
defaultMr McCann:default Are you going to hold me in suspense?
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: I am really sorry, Mr McCann
default. 
defaultI am not sure what the 
defaultMinister
default will be deciding.
defaultChair:default It is a serious issue.
defaultMark defaultLowcockdefault: It is a serious issue, which is why I am not going to give you an off
default&#x2011;
defaultthe
default&#x2011;
defaultcuff
default reply.
defaultChair:default This is politics and it is right that 
defaultMinister
defaults should reply
default. 
defaultThe high profile of the Scottish 
defaultGovernment
default’s little budget is ridiculous
default. 
defaultThe budget is agreed with DFID, which they do not tell anybody
default. They 
defaultgive the impression it is a spontaneous act of their own
default. 
defaultIt is a huge DFID programme that most people in 
defaultScotland
default know nothing about
default. 
defaultThey will tell you all about how wonderful the Scottish 
defaultGovernment
default is in 
defaultMalawi
default and will know nothing about what the UK 
defaultGovernment
default does there
default.
defaultMr McCann:default One MSP told us that they spend 0.7% of the Scottish budget on international development.
defaultChair:default Can I also thank you for the changes that you have made to the report in light of the recommendations we had, which makes everything much more accessible
default? 
defaultThere were one or two other smaller points, which I do not think we have got time for, but I will put to you in writing, and obviously there are a few things that you have agreed to put back in writing
default. 
defaultAs always, it was a useful exchange—I hope from your point of view as well as from ours
default. 
defaultWe will obviously publish a report
default. 
defaultThank you for your answers
default. 
defaultClearly, you have had a huge increase in your budget
default. 
defaultYou have a huge task to deliver
default.
