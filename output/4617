defaultction and background
default1.01
default              
defaultThe academy 
defaultprogramme
default has provided a unique opportunity to establish publicly funded schools that offer the Steiner curriculum. We believe that the expansion of Steiner provision under the academies 
defaultprogramme
default would be a good thing. We have evidence of significant national demand from parents for the creation of further Steiner Academies. We also have emergent evidence that Steiner Academies are ‘narrowing the gap’ through an approach that starts formal learning later, yet enables their students to achieve excellent outcomes over a broad range of competencies.
default1.02
default              
defaultWhen Ministers agreed to establish a first Steiner academy in the very early days of the academy 
defaultprogramme
default, this represented a radical and progressive step. It came about as a result of our successful lobbying effort to find a way to publicly fund schools that offer a curriculum other than the national curriculum.
default&#xa0;
default It required Ministers to make several radical exceptions to the norm, in particular the 
defaultdisapplication
default of the national curriculum, but also exemption from KS1 SATs, QTS and teacher pay and conditions. Subsequently the removal of these requirements has become the norm, although this is now under review.  
defaultThese flexibilities remain key to allowing more diverse provision, 
defaultirrespective of whether flexibilities are achieved through deregulation or through effective systems for allowing for exceptions to a more regulated framework.
default1.03
default              
defaultSteiner academies are still a very small part of the academy 
defaultprogramme
default. The Steiner Academy Hereford (SAH) was the first publicly funded Steiner school in the UK. It was established in 2008as a conversion from an independent school.    It is an all-though academy to 16 with capacity for 330 pupils. From the outset about one third of pupils have been on the academy’s SEN register. Also from the outset demand has outstripped supply with the academy having to hold waiting lists for all its year groups.  In 2011 the Steiner Academy 
defaultFrome
default (SAF) was opened, with places for young children only, but with a plan to grow to become an all-through academy from 4-16 with 624 places by 2020. In Sept 2012 another Steiner academy opened in Exeter, with similar limited provision to begin with and a plan to grow to offer two-form entry from 4 - 16.  A fourth Steiner academy is due to open in Bristol next September. The level of parental demand for a place in the Steiner Academies is high and so far the evidence is that demand outstrips supply.  Demand data for Steiner Academies that are being proposed also are significantly 
defaulthigh.Given
default that there is concern that some approved Free Schools proposals are not able to match their demand survey with an ability to fill all their places when they open, 
defaultit should be noted that demand for Steiner education seems to translate into a new Steiner Academy being able to fill its places as soon as it opens. 
default1.04
default              
defaultThe supply of suitably qualified teachers and leaders is a challenge for us. We are working with higher education providers to develop new teacher training routes. 
defaultSAH is registered as a School Direct provider, partnered with Worcester University. Canterbury University offers a Masters in Steiner Education and the University of the West of England is now offering a Steiner education specialism within its existing B Ed degree course.

defaultThe effectiveness of 
defaultacademisation
default in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children 
default2.01
default              
defaultThe ‘
defaultacademisation
default’ of provision that previously was available only outside the mainstream clearly increases parental choice and makes available a different route to successful outcomes. 
defaultIn its recent OFSTED report (July 2013) the Steiner Academy Hereford (SAH)was deemed to be a good school, with the Inspector’s report stating:
default“
defaultThis is a good school
default”… “
defaultTeachers have excellent relationships with pupils
default”… “
defaultPupils are happy and have a great enjoyment of learning.
default”
default“Pupils achieve well throughout the school, reaching above the expected levels in English and mathematics and in the other subjects that they take in Year 11”
default“Pupils who have disabilities and those who have special educational needs also make good and sometimes outstanding progress
default.”
default“
defaultPupils’ artistic and practical achievements are impressive
default and are reflected in older students’ high grades in their GCSE work and their excellent singing and drama.”
default“Older students develop strong independent working and thinking skills… [and]… go on to successfully study and achieve wide ranging qualifications at GCE A level and beyond.”
default“Pupils develop a very high degree of regard for others and of self-awareness”
default“Older pupils look after each other and have great empathy for others’ points of view.”
defaultT
defaulthe latest GCSE results from SAH show 80% of the students gained the expected benchmark % GCSEs at 
defaultA* - C including English and 
defaultmaths
default) 
defaultwith over half doing so at Grades A/A*. These results are substantially above national averages (67%). Students in receipt of Pupil Premium did as well as their peers.
default2.02
default              
defaultEmergent 
defaultfindings
default,based
default on data from 
defaultSAH,show
default that the Steiner approach is successfully narrowing the gap for disadvantaged pupils.  Data show that pupils make significant improvements in their cognitive abilities between Year 7 – 9 as measured by CATs when compared to pupils in other schools. The improvements are similar to improvements achieved through specific 
defaultprogrammes
default which focus on cognitive acceleration and the development of thinking skills (such as CASE, P4C and others).  
defaultSEN pupils show a particular improvement and pupils in receipt of targeted funding (Pupil Premium) made progress equal to their peers
default. Also, when compared to pupils in other schools, SAH pupils, including those on the SEN register and FSM pupils, significantly exceed the CATs predictors of their GCSE performance.
default2.03
default              
defaultThere is evidence from other sources that the Steiner curriculum may support cognitive acceleration, including the following:  socially disadvantaged pupils in Steiner schools do better than comparable students in 
defaultneighbouring
default schools (
defaultSchieffer
default and 
defaultBusse
default, 2001, McDermott 1996, Byers et al 1996); non-gifted Steiner students showed characteristics of the creative 
defaultbehaviour
default of gifted students in other schools (
defaultHutchingson
default and Hutchingson,1993); scientific reasoning of Steiner school students was found to be superior to their mainstream counterparts (
defaultJelinek
default and Sun, 2003) 
default2.04
default              
defaultThe fact that demand for school transfer admissions is high indicates that parents 
defaultperceivethat
default the Steiner approach is able to reach
default children who are not flourishing in standard model schools. There is a 
defaulthigh volume of admission inquiries at SAH and SAF for school transfers throughout the school year from parents who say that they want their child to be educated at the Steiner Academy because their child is not flourishing in their current school. Hence the waiting lists for all year groups.
default2.05
default              
defaultWe believe that schools which are delivering an innovative or non-mainstream curriculum and educational practices should maximise the contribution that they make to the general raising of standards by participating in research, evaluation and sharing of practice, and that 
defaultthey should be supported in this by the 
defaultdevelopmentof
default appropriate national programmes for collaborative research and development
default.
default3.00
default              
defaultWhat further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a bigger contribution from the Steiner approach? 
default3.01
default              
defaultWe have evidence of significant national demand from parents for the creation of further Steiner Academies. We also have evidence of considerable interest and support for the development of the Steiner Academies from teachers and senior leadership staff currently working within mainstream 
defaulteducation.However
default, any expansion will rely on retaining and refining the flexibilities that we negotiated for the first Steiner Academy as listed in para 1.02 above.
default3.02
default              
defaultOther suggested steps to support expansion:
default4.00
default              
defaultThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors
default4.01
default              
defaultExisting independent Steiner schools have ended up in the private sector because historically there has been nowhere else for them to go.  They have struggled there and are not well resourced. However, with the investment of 
defaultproperresources
default, an existing Steiner school would have the potential to deliver immediate state-funded provision across a full range of year groups, rather than opening with only small range as is the case for most new Academies.  Also, Steiner schools historically have developed an extremely high level of commitment and engagement among parents. Bringing this culture of parental engagement and commitment into the state sector could have significant effects on pupil 
defaultachievement.
defaultWe
default would like to suggest more flexible prerequisites for cash-poor, experience-rich private schools wishing to convert to an academy
default4.03
default              
defaultThe Steiner Academies sector is still emerging and is developing its framework of policy and practice. To 
defaultdateSteiner
default Academies have been created by independent groups, working within an informal framework of quality assurance supported by the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship. The recognition that the resources of the SWSF (and other small charities) as a sponsor are very limited.  However, we want to develop a more consistent and transparent framework of standards and quality assurance for state-funded Steiner education
default.

default              
defaultThe functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level
default5.01
default              
defaultParents perceive Steiner academies as 
defaultofferinga
default caring and gentle environment that would be highly appropriate for children with SEN. As a result, Steiner Academies cannot meet the current level of demand that exists from parents who wish to name a Steiner Academy in a statement of SEN. 
defaultFor us, 
defaultakey
default point of interdependency with the LA that could be improved is the process for naming of 
defaulttheAcademy
default in a statement of SEN. As an Academy, the school has the right to challenge the naming of the school 
defaultwhere admitting the child would be incompatible with the provision of efficient education for other children and where no reasonable steps may be made to secure compatibility (Annex 3 of the FA).
defaultIf an Academy does not consent to be named on a Statement of SEN, and the LA disagrees, the LA should not go ahead and name the Academy regardless. However, this does not always happen. 
defaultSystems need to be tightened 
defaultupto
default prevent a LA naming an academy where the academy has not consented.
default5.02
default              
defaultIn a landscape of increasing diversity in educational provision, it might also be appropriate to consider a higher level of engagement between local authorities and individual schools, to map out the capacity and 
defaultspecialisms
default of schools across a local authority area in terms of fair access 
defaultandmeeting
default the needs of children with statements of SEN in a more coherent, ‘joined-up’ way.
default6.00
default              
defaultThe role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape
default6.01
default              
defaultWe believe that the Steiner academies have a valuable role to play in the new school landscape, and we feel that working together as a chain of schools could significantly improve our ability to deliver consistently excellent Steiner education. We have a vision for how the Steiner Academies might work together as a chain of schools to 
defaultprovidequality
default control, collective training, curriculum development, assessment systems, procurement, etc.  This will reinforce our common purpose and strengthen our capacity to contribute to the over-all education landscape and the sharing of best practice; it will also generate significant economies of scale, enabling a higher proportion of funding to be spent directly on education, helping to raise 
defaultstandards.
defaultThe
default availability of grant funding to support groups of existing academies in forming multi-academy trusts would help to roll out the benefits of collaboration and federation between academies more rapidly.
default6.02
default              
defaultWe 
defaulthave no objection in principle to these chains being accountable through an appropriate inspection regime. Where schools are working to innovative or non-standard 
defaultcurriculums,there
default could be significant benefits for both schools and those tasked with their inspection if such schools operated as chains within MATs or other models of federation, in that appropriate systems for assessing and evaluating pupil progress could be agreed with Ofsted and 
defaultDfE
default across the chain of schools. This would provide better accountability for non-standard schools on the delivery of their chosen outcomes.
default6.03
default              
defaultOur vision as a group of schools is for a relatively high level of delegation to individual schools, with an empowered and locally accountable governing body in each 
defaultschool.We
default feel that transparency and accountability at a local (
defaultie
default single school) level is essential for parental engagement and trust.

defaultThe appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply;
default&#xa0;
defaultand what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole
default7.01
default              
defaultSteiner academies so far are all-though schools and therefore include primary provision. Currently a proposal is being prepared for Primary Steiner Academy.  If this proposal is approved then we would hope to be able to provide positive evidence regarding a Steiner primary academy contribution to primary provision locally.
