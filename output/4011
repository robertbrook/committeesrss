default&#xa0;defaultRe: defaultFuture of the BBCdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC should be true to its origins and exist to inform, educate and entertain. 
defaultA series of platforms for c
defaultelebrating life through world class content
default,
default from investigative, impartial journalism
default,
default to the best drama arts and sports coverage in the world.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC should have the capacity to reach out to everyone across the 
defaultUK
default and the wider world and be a source of trust and excellence. 
defaultThere have been a number of high profile major issues which everyone is aware of and which have impacted on public confidence and reputation of the BBC. The organisation must learn from this and attempt to regain confidence and the worldwide respect that i
defaultt has enjoyed for decades. 
defaultThere have been many successes within the charter period also and the world has changed significantly within the period. The BBC still has 
defaulta wealth of creative talent in terms of artistry and innovation but other countries are c
defaultatching up.
defaultAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is still much to be done in terms of truly addressing equality issues within the BBC and within the BBC’s content. 
defaultThere needs to be much more done to address the diversity agenda across the board; Race, Col
defaultour, Gender, Age etc 
defaultThe above should be reflected more within the public purposes of the charter.
defaultThe relocation of a large part of the BBC to the North of England is having a positive effect on Film &amp;
default TV production which I witness first hand within my work and we must build on this momentum. The North has always produced good content but there feels to be a renewed 
defaultvigor
default and more opportunities for people with the right skills. There is still much work 
defaultto do in ensuring that future generations are equipped with the right skills and motivated and determined in order to succeed in the sector. 
defaultThere is also more to do in ensuring that the regions are represented. 
defaultThe Big Screen Network (Live Sites) establi
defaultshed mainly as part of 2012. One in every nation and region were abandoned by the BBC and LOCOG. This was a missed opportunity and could have been a lasting legacy from the London Olympics. It was not managed very well throughout and lessons should be take
defaultn from this. Many local authorities across the 
defaultUK
default feel 
defaultvery
default let down by the way this was handled. I say this from a position of authority as someone who has been involved in the Big Screen project since 2005.
defaultThere are increased opportunities for more hype
defaultr-local content across some of the platforms on the BBC. Links to community websites, events etc. 
defaultEncouraging more active citizenship through the use of technology.
defaultThe commitment that 50% of the network TV programming spend will be outside of 
defaultLondon
default is we
defaultlcomed
defaultLarge scale live events have had a really positive impact in recent years, most notably the Manchester Passion, Frankenstein’s Wedding and 
defaultBollywood
default Carmen Live and have provided brilliant opportunities for young people entering the industry to get 
defaultinvolved as well as stimulating the local economy (hotels, catering, logistics etc). More should be done to encourage these types of events to celebrate the true diverse of the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultThe BBC should be a 
defaultbeacon of excellence from the local to the regional, national and truly international. 
defaultAn institution that is the envy of the world.
default That gives a voice to the unknown as well as the super stars.
default It should be about discovering and developing new talent and 
defaultallowing that talent to grow alongside more established talent. 
defaultThe BBC’s output continues to diversify but perhaps not fast enough
default. There needs to
default be an opportunity for more risk taking, more ambitious projects. 
defaultEncouraging qual
defaultity but on a big picture scale.
default At the same time not to
default judge everything on ratings. Popular, doesn’t necessarily mean quality or meaningful to people (see You Tube).
default 
defaultThere should be a balance. But new organisations should continue to be encouraged.
default We need to continue to develop skills and provide 
defaultopportunities. 
defaultThe BBC has to be at the driving edge of technology innovation and should continue to actively encourage developments in this field as 
defaulta 
defaultstrength
default for the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultTo this end, more people should be encouraged to tell their stories using a range of methods and technologies from the humble paper and pen to interactive gaming. Give us a poem on National Poetry Day.
defaultI feel that 
defaultthere is still a need for a license fee but that where commercial opportunities exist (BBC Worldwide 
default/ BBC Sports 
defaultetc) they should be exploited fully
defaultDoes this 
defaultnot already happen to a degree with Chanel 4? Perhaps there could be a little more competition introduced b
defaultetween public service providers. 
defaultDue to the nature of my job I travel a lot and have contacts in over 40 cities around the world though the UNESCO Creative Cities Network. The BBC is still the ultimate name in terms of broadcasting in the view of many of these other 
defaultcities/ countries. I a
defaultm still surprised that many of the countries involved don’t have a national broadcaster or a national lottery that subsidises the arts.
defaultThe BBC Trust model works but 
defaultperhaps the tr
defaultust could have more visibility and 
defaultspend a little more time getting across the 
defaultUK
default and advocating on behalf of the sector.
defaultThe only thing that is constant throughout everything is 
defaultchange. 
defaultThe BBC has shown that it can be pioneering and adaptable 
defaultbut an organisation that size needs a sense of stability and this
default requires long term planning. A ten year agreement is reasonable as long as there are measures in place to ensure adaptability and delivery.
