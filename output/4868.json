"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Clive Walker [CT 05]&#xa0;Introduction1\n              \nThis paper responds to the call \non 23 July 2013 \nfor evidence from the \nHome Affairs\n Committee on \naspects of the ‘Pursue’ strand of the CONTEST strategy. This paper addresses just one element: ‘\nWhether the Charities Commission has reduced the ability of terrorists to obtain funding through charitable donations.\n’\n2\n              \nDiscussion in this paper derives from my research over many years into anti-terrorism laws and also, more recently, into \nregulatory action and litigation involving charities suspected of financing terrorism\n. For fuller details and arguments\n,\n see principally:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBackground3\n              \nA\nttention to the financing of terrorism has intensified \nsince \nthe attacks on September 11, 2001\n. \nUnderlying \ncharacteristics\n \nwith\nin charities which give rise to vulnerability include \nenhanced \npublic trust, diversity of financ\nial activities\n, cash intensiv\neness,\n \ncomplex multiple donor patterns, and the involvement of politically committed individuals.\n \n&#xa0;\n4\n              \nTh\ne \npotential \nlink between charities and terrorism finance\n was signalled \ninternationally \nby the Financial Action Task Force (‘FATF’)\n in October 2001\n,\n \nwhen it issued\n its Special Recommendation VIII\n on Terrorism Financing\n.\n \nThe FATF identifies three categories of charity abuse\n.\n The first concerns\n the use of bogus charities as front\ns\n for terrorists\n.\n The second is the \nfraudulent \n(or at least furtive) \ndiversion of properly raised funds\n \nwhich are subverted towards\n terrorist purposes. The third example involves \nbroad\ner\n \nexploitation\n of a charitable umbrella, such as \nthrough the recruitment \nand payment \nof \nextremists\n or for the propagation or glorification of a militant ideology\n. It is difficult to find clear examples \nin the United Kingdom \nwith\nin the first category. The second \ncategory \nwill typically \narouse\n suspicions about the humanitarian work abroad of cultural associations based within \nminority communities\n. \nThe third category also presents \nsome\n risk.\n&#xa0;\n5\n              \nThe \nrisk of charitable funding of \njihadi\n \nterrorism is viewed as \naffected\n by\n two further factors. One \nis\n the \nIslamic custom of \nzakat\n – the duty of \ndonating \npersonal\n wealth \nfor \ncharit\nable purposes\n. \nThe second factor \naffects\n \nt\nhose charities which are active in regions of conflict (such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestine, Somalia,\n \nand, hitherto, Sri Lanka\n)\n. They are\n \nthereby\n especially vulnerable\n to \nthe risks from \nworking alongside protagonists within the conflict\n and by the limits or costs of formal banking systems requiring reliance upon informal remittance systems\n.\n&#xa0;\n6\n              \nThese \ndepictions\n of\n \nthe \npolitical and legal salience\n of \ncontemporary \nter\nrorism \nfinance and the centrality of charities in its \noperation\n \nunderplay the personal \n(non-financial) \ncommitment which drives\n \nterrorism and \nthe personal integrity of \ncharity\n workers\n who view their independence from terrorism and government as crucial to their work\n.\n \nThe\n allegations\n \nof complicity i\nn terrorism \nalso \noverplay \nthe analogy to \ncriminal racketeering\n or more generally to rational choice theory\n.\n \nTerrorist operations are often inexpensive\n, especially for the late modern (dis)organisation of many \njihadi\n groups,\n and do not start with the motive of amassing personal wealth\n. \n&#xa0;\n7\n              \nSo\n far as the United Kingdom law is concerned, \nl\negislation against the funding of terrorism is \na core part of \n‘CONTEST’\n \nand is e\nxecuted by \nthe Terrorism Act 2000\n, P\nart\n III, \nas \nsupplemented by \nAnti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001\n, \nPart I\n, the \nCounter-Terrorism Act 2008\n, Part V\n, and the \nTerrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010\n.\n \nT\nh\nis\n \nsubmission\n \nwill first \nbriefly \nexplain the\nse\n policing mechanisms. The findings will lead into analysis of \nthe key questions: ‘do they work’ and, if so, 'who pays the price' of the policing and regulatory burdens?\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPolicing and regulatory mechanisms applied to charities8\n              \nWhether within\n the\n 'policing' or 'regulation'\n of charities\n, there are the following essential elements\n of activity\n: the specification of rules or stand\nards; \nthe monitoring of compliance\n;\n and the e\nstablishment of \nenforcement \ndevices\n.\n These elements \nare\n reflected at two policing levels\n:\n \n'\ninternal\n'\n and \n'\nexternal\n'\n. \n&#xa0;\nInternal policing9\n              \nI\nnternal \npolicing applied to charities\n demands that \nthey\n \nshould\n \nmonitor\n \ntheir\n own business and procedures to ensure that terrorism financing does not take place. \nA number of specialist measures \ncomprise\n this watchfulness \nagainst\n terrorism financing.\n&#xa0;\n10\n              \nFirst, \ntrustees of charities\n, like everyone else,\n \nmust \nnot to withhold information about terrorism, breach of which is a criminal offence\n (\nsection \n38B(2) of the \nTerrorism \nAct \n2000\n)\n. \nA more onerous duty along the same lines is imposed by\n section \n19(1) of\n the\n T\nerrorism \nA\nct \n2000\n. W\nhe\nn\n a person believes or suspects that another person has committed an offence under \neither\n of\n sections \n15 to 18 on the basis of information accruing in the course of a trade, profession, business, or employment, an offence is committed if the information is not disclosed to a police officer or member of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (\n'\nSOCA\n'\n) \nor even the Charity Commission \nas soon as reasonably practicable. \nIn the drafting of \nsection 19\n, t\nhe government emphasi\ns\ned the confinement of\n \nthe onerous duty\n to professionals.\n However, t\nhe reach of\n section \n19 has been \nsignificantly \nsupplemented by \nthe \nCounter-Terrorism Act 2008\n,\n section \n77\n, arising \nfrom allegations that charities \nwere\n being misused \nfor terrorism financing\n \nand that trustees d\nid\n not pay sufficient attention – thus, in 2006, just 48 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) were issued from the charitable sector, a dearth of suspicion which officialdom f\nound\n 'hard to explain'\n.\n \nSection 77 inserts\n,\n as\n section \n22A of the \nTerrorism Act 2000\n,\n a new definition of ‘employment’ which encompasses both paid and unpaid \nemployment and can even include voluntary work. In this way, unpaid volunteers who are the trustees of a charity must act with the same insight as professional forensic accountants.\n&#xa0;\n11\n              \nAn even stricter duty to disclose is imposed on the ‘regulated sector’\n by Sch\nedule\n 2, P\nar\nt III\n,\n of \nthe \nAnti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001\n. Under\n section \n21A (inserted into \nthe \nTerrorism Act 2000\n), a person in that sector commits an offence by knowing or suspecting or having reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person has attempted or committed an offence under \neither\n of\n sections \n15 to 18 (including with extra-territorial effect), unless that information is disclosed to a constable, officer of SOCA, or the employer’s nominated officer as soon as practicable. The duty is subject to a reasonable excuse not to disclose. The objective standard of liability, which can arise without subjective awareness of any suspicion, is justified by the ‘[g]reater awareness and higher standards of reporting in the financial sector’.\n \nCharities do not generally fall within th\ne\n 'regulated sector', but the financial institutions which handle their transactions certainly do so. \nFor instance, the\n Royal Bank of Scotland was fined £5.6m \n(including a 30% discount for \nearly\n settlement) \nby the Financial Services Authority in 2010 for \nfailing to ensure funds were not transferred to people or organisations on sanctions lists, leading to an \n'\nunacceptable risk\n'\n of facilitating terrorist financing.\n \nMore serious criticisms and r\negulatory penalties\n and \ncivil\n litigation ha\nve \nalso been encountered by \nUK \nfinancial institutions \nin the United States\n, arising from the alleged defaults of United Kingdom banks\n in respect of accounts held by charities\n.\n&#xa0;\nExternal policing12\n              \nExternal \npolicing\n is principally \nexerted\n by the Charit\ny\n Commission\n, \nunder \nPart II of the Charities Act 2011\n. \nIn the context of alleged links to terrorism, there may be two triggers for \ninvestigation\n. One is that the charity \nis\n overstepping the boundaries of its charitable status \nby supporting political purposes \nwhich are \nespoused by\n terrorist groups.\n This first potential problem has not been the prime \nissue\n.\n \nInstead, the allegation is \ncommonly \nthat money is being used to fund \nactivities\n which are in part political \nor\n social but also in part \nviolent\n.\n&#xa0;\n13\n              \nThe e\nnforcement powers \nof the Charity Commission\n, \nin\n section\ns\n \n76\n \nto 87 \nof the Charities Act \n2011\n, \nare\n sweeping\n \nb\nut \nrarely\n used\n and are\n in practice \ncircumscribed \nby two limitations. \nThe first is that \nwhile charities with a turnover above a specified amount (of £5,000) must register under \nsection 30 of the \nCharities Act \n2011\n, \nthere is no obligation to \nadopt the form of a charity\n by not-for-profit bodies\n.\n Some \ngroups\n are suspicious of \npotential\n \nmeddling\n or do not recognise any benefit in registration\n. \nFor example, despite the efforts of the Faith and Social Cohesion Unit set up in 2007, a minority of the estimated \n1\n,\n6\n72\n \nm\nosques\n in the United Kingdom\n are registered\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n14\n              \nThe second limitation is that policing and enforcement are \nsecondary\n in the \nconstitution\n \nand culture \nof the Charity Commission. \nT\nhe Mission of the Charity Commission i\nnvolve\ns\n ‘enabling’, ‘encouraging’, and ‘promoting’,\n while \nits\n \nstatutory objectives in section\n \n1\n4 of \nthe Charities Act \n2011\n comprise legal compliance \nby charity trustees with their legal obligations \nas \njust \none objective amongst several\n. Likewise, the 'general functions' of the Commission in section 15(1)(3), without mention of any punitive or prohibitory sanction, refer to '\nIdentifying and investigating apparent misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of charities and taking remedial or protective action in connection with misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of charities.\n'\n \nThe \n'\ngreen\n-\nlight\n'\n approach of the Charity Commission can be \nfurther \nevidenced by its six general duties in \nsection 16 of the Charities\n Act\n 2011\n. \nGeneral Duty 2\n states that \n'\nSo far as is reasonably practicable, the \nCharity Commission must act in a way which is compatible with the encouragement of (a) all forms of charitable giving, and (b) voluntary participation in charity work.\n'\n Furthermore, in performing all its functions, the Commission is required by General Duty 4 to \n'\nhave regard to the principles of best regulatory practice (including the principles under which regulatory activities should be proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed).\n'\n \nIn this way, the Commission constitutes a 'green-light' regulator rather than a 'red-light' regulator.\n Because of this approach, more formal policing agencies find it hard to take over investigations started by the Charity Commission.\n \nThe claim that the Charity Commission is hobbled, in part \nby the\n framing \nof\n law and in part \nas \na self-induced restrain\ning organisational culture\n, may be next tested by \nsome case studies\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe application of external policingRegulatory responses15\n              \nIf a charity becomes \ndesignated under \nthe \ninternational sanctions \nregime\ns, the need for regulatory action\n is palpable\n. But designation has only affected two charities operating in the \nU\nnited Kingdom\n jurisdiction. \nAssuming a charity \nis \nnot internationally designated, then regulatory action is much less straightforward. \nThe \nversion\n of 'green-light' regulation \nthesis \nadopted here is not that the Charity Commission \nwholly \nignores allegations of terrorism. \nI\nts\n caseload of 180 investigations in 2009-10\n included 11 which related to \nallegations or suspicions of terrorist-related activities.\n Rather, the \nissue is whether its resolve to deal with the allegations is sufficiently firm.\n \nT\nhree \ncases \nmight\n be highlighted\n. These are selected as \nmore recent than the notorious case of \nAbu Hamza\n’s involvement in \nthe North London Central Mosque \n(Finsbury Park)\n,\n more straightforward than the various inquiries into Interpal, the facts about which are disputed\n, and less affected by media pressures (as \napplied to the handling of \nViva Palestina)\n.\n&#xa0;\n16\n              \nOne \ncase \nconcerned the \nIkhlas Foundation, \nwhich was registered in 1997 and whose main work \ninvolved\n the \n'\nMuslim Prisoner Support Group\n'\n and especially related to \nprisoners \nimpugned for involvement in terrorism. \nThe group\n h\nad\n been of serial concern to the Charity Commission\n because of the activities of various trustees\n.\n \nIn 200\n7\n, Mohammed al-Ghabra\n, a trustee,\n w\nas removed after he was \ndesignated by the UN and \nby the HM\n Treasury in \nDecember \n2006\n.\n \nThe Charity Commission was apparently unaware of this designation until informed in July 2007\n; \nhe was \nremoved as a trustee in October 2007\n. However, \nno sanction \nwas imposed \non the remaining trustees even though \nthe Commission \nviewed them as inadequately recognising or managing the risks. \nInstead, the inquiry was closed on the commitment by remaining trustees to strengthen \ntheir \ngovernance within three months.\n \nThat \nundertaking by the \ntrustees\n did not \nbear\n \nfruit\n. \nA\n second\n \ninquiry began in 2008, when another \ntrustee, Abbas Taj, was \nsuspended \nby the Commission \n(and later resigned) \nfollowing his \narrest in 2008 and \nconviction in 2009 for conspiring in\n a\nn arson\n attack\n on a publisher\n. \nT\nhe Commission recorded that the trustee\ns\n had \nfailed to \ndeliver\n \non their \nprevious \ncommitment\ns\n.\n Despite this recurrently woeful record, the Commission concluded its second inquiry by issuing a direction under section 19A by which the trustees were \nset a further few months\n to regularise their meetings and membership\n,\n to conduct a risk assessment\n,\n and to mitigate risks. Given that the charity had a very modest income of around £5,000 per annum, the risk of terrorism financing should not be exaggerated. Nevertheless, \nthe patience of the Charity Commission \naccorded\n to\n this serially delinquent charity \nwas\n \nastonishing\n, though the Ikhlas Foundation has \nsince\n been removed from the Register of Charities.\n&#xa0;\n17\n              \nThe \nsecond\n case, Iqra, a bookshop and learning centre in Beeston\n,\n Leeds, registered as a charity in 2003. It\ns\n activities came to a\nn abrupt\n \nh\nalt in 2005,\n \nwhen it was confirmed that two of the July 7 bombers, Mohammed Siddique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, had \nacted as\n trustees. The police raid\ned\n \nits\n premises, as a result of which the remaining trustees claimed that the charity had become inoperative. \nAn\nother trustee, Khalid Kaliq was subsequently convicted of terrorist\n-\nrelated offences\n not directly related to Iqra\n.\n Yet, not until 2009 \ndid\n the Charity Commission decide to launch a formal inquiry, and even that step seems to have been prompted by media \nreports\n. In the event, the Commission found no evidence that Iqra's finances or premises had been used for the preparation of the July 7 attacks, and it can hardly be blamed for not detecting \nterrorist connections \nmore \nastutely\n than the police or security \nagencies. However, the Commission \nfound\n that extremist materials had been \npossessed\n and \nalso \nadmitted that \nno \naction had been taken over the fact that \nno reports or \naccounts had ever been filed\n by the trustees\n. Awakening from \nthis\n \nstupor\n after \nfurther \nprodding by the media\n, the Commission took steps to seize the remaining \ntrust \nmoney (£12,500).\n \n&#xa0;\n18\n              \nT\nhe \nthird example concerns the \nc\nharity, Sivayogam,\n an organisation which worked with Tamils both in London and in northern Sri Lanka. Concerns surfaced in 2005 when it became \npublic\n that the leading trustee, \nNagendram Seevaratnam\n, had professed \nLTTE \nsympathies. The Inquiry \ninstigated by the Charity Commission \nfound problems with the selection and monitoring of local partners in Sri Lanka, \nwith\n financial accounting, and \nwith the involvement of a trustee who remained openly supportive of the \nLTTE. In \nanother\n example of its \n'green-light'\n style, the Charity Commission imposed the sanction of removal \nof one\n trustee but otherwise sought to work with the impugned charity to improve its standards. Even the attempted removal was reversed by the \nFirst-Tier Tribunal (Charity)\n, which viewed the trustee's statements as merely \n'\nunwise and unguarded\n'\n \nand that \ncontact with the LTTE did not make it necessary or desirable to remove him\n.\n Furthermore, the Tribunal endorsed a \n'\ngreen\n-\nlight\n'\n regulatory approach:\n \n'\nIf there had remained any legitimate regulatory concerns following a proper examination of the evidence originally provided to it, the Tribunal concludes that it would have been appropriate for the Respondent to work with the charity to improve its processes before considering exercising its regulatory powers.\n'\n&#xa0;\nAssessment of responses19\n              \nT\nhis \ntrack \nrecord \nof the \nCharity \nCommission\n does not match the seriousness with which the threat of terrorism is \ndepicted\n in CONTEST. \nThat verdict is subject to two p\nrovisos\n. One is that \nfurther \nefforts have been \ninstituted\n since 2006 to \nimprove the relevant guidance\n.\n The second point is that there are competing public interests which may legitimately affect the degree and manner of intervention by regulators.\n These \ntwo \np\nrovisos\n will \nnow \nbe considered.\n&#xa0;\n20\n              \nIn response to the \nevident \nperils of terrorist abuse and infiltration of charities, \nthe Home Office and HM Treasury \nreviewed the \npolicing\n regime\n i\nn their \n2007 \nreport, \nReview of Safeguards to Protect the Charitable Sector (England and Wales) from Terrorist Abuse\n’.\n \nT\nhe\n government departments\n urge\nd\n the Charity Commission to reinforce \nits guidance\n, and it \nresponded \nin 2008 \nby \npublish\ning\n \nits\n \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy\n wherein it promised\n 'zero tolerance'.\n In pursuance of \nits\n strategy, various actions have been undertaken to improve trustee awareness, \nincluding \noversight through a Proactive Monitoring Unit, cooperation between enforcement agencies, and \ngreater \nintervention. \nPublished advice has been \nfurther \nelaborated through the issuance of an \nOperational Guidance\n \nand a \nCompliance Toolkit\n, setting out the Commission’s approach, and underlining the duties of vigilance and disclosure of trustees, illustrating the possible threats, \nand giving advice about the work of the Counter Terrorism Team which forms part of the Intensive Casework Unit in Compliance and Support.\n \nThe \nCompliance Toolkits\n w\nere\n \nimpressively\n expanded in 2013.\n&#xa0;\n21\n              \nDespite these \ndocumentary\n \nelaborations\n, \nthere has been no discernible change in the \n'\ngreen\n-\nlight\n'\n approach.\n The Home Office commented in its 2011 paper on \nPrevent Strategy\n \nas part of the 'Next Steps' agenda\n that '\nThe Charity Commission must be seen to be capable of taking robust and vigorous action against charities that are involved in terrorist activity or have links to terrorist organisations.\n' The accompanying independent survey by Lord Carlile is more candidly critical of the Commission.\n \nThis analysis of the \ncontinuing \nattitude and approach of the Charity Commission tallies with some recommendations \nin\n the report by Lo\nr\nd Hodgson in 2012, \nTrusted and independent: giving charity back to charities - review of the Charities Act 2006\n.\n Lord Hodgson not only calls for automatic trustee disqualification \nfollowing any conviction of a terrorism offence\n (which would not make much difference) but also that the Charity Commission should take ‘\na more robust approach to potentially failing organisations\n’ and ‘\nproactive as well as reactive steps\n’ in cases of abuse.\n \n&#xa0;\n22\n              \nMoving next to the \ncompeting public \ng\noods\n, \nthese \ncountervailing considerations are that \nBritish \nsociety \nshould not\n appear \nto be \nstone-hearted\n \nin the face of \nhumanitarian \ncrises\n in \nconflict zones\n,\n \nsuch as \nin \nPalestine, Somalia, and Sri Lanka\n. Such\n a stance \nmight even aggravate the situation by \nencourag\ning\n less regulated and \nless cooperative\n \nactivities\n, even resulting in \na strategic defeat\n.\n \nAn illustration of s\nuch upheaval \narises from \nthe United Nations listing of the Al Barakaat group in Somalia from 2001 to 2009\n.\n \nHowever, a\nnother public good is the punishment of wrongdoing\n which, in this case, may curtail the financing of terrorism and uphold the integrity of the charitable sector\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFuture regulation2\n3\n              \nT\nhe United Kingdom approach to charities assailed by the taint of terrorism funding has been one of considerate understanding if not\n,\n at times\n,\n \nexcessive\n \n'green-light' \nlenienc\ny\n. \nEqually\n, their\n bankers are\n \nrarely\n at risk \nexcept in \nUS civil courts. \nThus,\n worthy \nindividuals pay the \nhighest \nprice\n for \nrelief work at the margins of legality\n.\n \nT\nhe Charity Commission is wholly correct to be highly suspicious of self-serving allegations from the opponents of Palestinians, Tamils, and other oppressed peoples and to adopt a stance which is primarily encouraging of compliance with high standards of governance rather than a condemnatory approach.\n \nBut \nits \nserial indulgence of \npatent \nabuses does no\nt \naid\n the charitable sector\n.  \n&#xa0;\n2\n4\n              \nT\nwo \nfacile\n reactions should be avoided. One \nwould be\n to swing entirely towards criminal prosecution and asset forfeiture, a stance which\n would unduly ignore competing public goods\n.\n The second \nmistake \nwould be to \nseek to \nreinforce the \npunitive \nresolve of the Charity Commission. \nThe data from this \nchapter \nsuggests that \nthe Commission's\n \nweak \nstatutory remit and \nentrenched \n‘\nenabling\n’ \nculture\n cannot easily be nudged\n. \nA\n \nmore \npromising\n \nthird way is to \nemphasise\n the value of financial investigation \nto facilitate\n intelligence-gathering\n.
