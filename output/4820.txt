Effectiveness in this area is about leading internationally, engaging our staff, contacts and international partners to help deliver UK Government objectives.  For all staff it’s about understanding UK Government aims in the wider UK and international context and developing productive relationships with those external contacts and partners to help deliver UK objectives.  All staff are aware of cultural sensitivities in their area of responsibility. Staff build up negotiating expertise through the grades and champion and use language skills where appropriate to deepen impact. Senior leaders use the same behaviours but operate at higher levels of sensitivity and complexity. Managers have to lead and inspire teams in an international context.  Staff adapt their approach to reflect the very diverse teams they manage while still promoting UK values.

[[[Demonstrating Resilience ]]]This is about helping our people to build resilience in international roles, supporting their ability to adapt to working in difficult and varied international environments; and to bounce back from crises and setbacks in these contexts.  Individuals need to be aware of the impact they have on themselves and on others, and show support for others with a pragmatic attitude, perseverance and resolve.  Individuals should be able to manage in a wide variety of circumstances and locations and, with appropriate support, to recover from challenges and setbacks.  For leadership roles this competence would also include leading a culture of support, while promoting a proper regard for employee safety, health and well-being.
