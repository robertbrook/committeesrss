"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Roger Masterman (Durham Law School, Durham University) and Jo Murkens (Department of Law, London School of Economics and Political Science (CRJ 03)1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission addresses the constitutional role of the judiciary within the UK\n \nconstitution\n and the choices available to the courts – in their vindication of the rule of law – when fa\nced with ‘unconstitutional’ legislation. It \ndraws on arguments and analysis published \nin\n R. Masterman and J.E.K. Murkens, ‘Skirting Supremacy and Subordination: The Constitutional Authority of the United Kingdom Supreme Court’ [2013] \nPublic Law\n 800.\n \n  \n&#xa0;\nA:\n \nThe traditiona\nl subsidiary role of the courts\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn the absence of a codified constitution guaranteeing its status\n \nthe role\n and powers\n of the judiciary\n in \nthe\n UK\n constitution \nhave traditionally\n had to be inferred or induced from particular judicial decisions\n.\n  \n \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough in practice the system of checks and balances is akin to systems respecting a more formal separation of powers, Britain’s mixed model of government firmly subordinate\nd\n \nthe jud\niciary\n to the elected branches of government. The constitutional hierarchy, which stems from the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty\n,\n conceive\nd of\n the courts as \n‘modest underworkers’ and ‘handmaids to Parliament’s will’.\n \nCourts were\n to interpret the tex\nt and to declare the law\n,\n and they enjoyed only limited review powers over delegated authority by Parliament to subordinate bodies.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy adhering to\n plain meaning (literalist/formalist) approaches to statutory interpretation (which \navoid \nthe \ncharge \nthat \nthe judiciary might \nsubstitut\ne\n its \nown \nview of the law for that expressed by Parliamen\nt),\n \nthe judiciary acknowledge that democracy and public policy (i.e. most of effective law-making) \nare\n \ngenerally regarded as political matters to be determined in and by\n the legislature\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe impact \nof \nthis\n \nsubordination \non the constitutional status of the courts \nhas been\n enormous. Between 1842 and the UK’s accession to the European Community in January 1973, not a single case reached the House of Lords on the question \nof the absence of limitations of Parliament’s ultimate law-making authority.\n The period \nfrom World War II until the 1960s ‘marked the depths of the irrelevance of the courts in the development of the constitution\n.\n’\n \n&#xa0;\nB: \nThe Development of Powers of \nQuasi-Constitutional Review:\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelopments since the latter \ndecades \nof the twentieth century have prompted a re-evaluation of the constitutional position of the judiciary as necessarily \nsubservient. \nOver this period\n, and \nas a cumulative result of the statu\ntory\n \nconferral and arrogation of powers\n,\n \nthe apex court gradually developed a ‘pronounced public law profile’\n such that the United Kingdom Supreme Court \n(UKSC) \ncan now be seen to \ndischarge ‘some of the functions of a constitutional court’\n.\n In the absence\n of a documentary constitution, and in the light of the fact that the sovereignty of Parliament remains of fundamental importance to our understandings of the constitution, it is appropriate to classify these powers of review as quasi-constitutional. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nidentif\ny\n two types of powers of quasi-constitutional review. The first type, explicit powers, derives from statute.\n  \nThe \nUKSC\n \nhas been allocated powers of quasi-constitutional review under the European Communities Act 1972\n (ECA)\n, the Human Rights Act 1998\n \n(HRA)\n, and the UK\n’\ns devolution legislation. \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the context of EU law, Parliament’s competence is substantively limited in two ways: first, it may not legislate contrary to EU law (s.2(4) EC\nA\n 1972); and second, courts enjoy power to ‘disapply’ national la\nw to the extent that it is inconsistent with directly effective provisions of EU law.\n It is acting in this capacity that the \nUKSC\n \nmost clearly discharges functions akin to\n the\n strong form\n \njudicial review\n exercised by Supreme and Constitutional Courts else\nwhere\n.  \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHRA\n review gives rise to consequences of a slightly different order\n,\n \npermitting\n courts to interpret primary legislation in order to achieve compliance with the Convention Rights so far as it is possible to do so\n (s.3(1) HRA)\n,\n or in the alternative providing for the issue of a declaration of incompatibility\n (s.4 HRA)\n.\n \nThough neither option permits the court to mount a direct challenge to the legality of an Act of Parliament, the \nHRA\n nonetheless empowers the \ncourts\n \nto\n test prima\nry legislation\n,\n whenever enacted\n,\n for compliance with human rights standards\n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe \ncourts\n \nalso \nexercise power\n to determine legal disputes relating to ‘devolution issues’ \narising \nout of the \ntransfer of legal powers to \ndevolved bodies\n.\n The power of the \nUKSC\n \n– previously exercised by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council – is something of a departure from the traditional distinction placed by the constitution on the review of executive and legislative action, in the devolved context potentially subjectin\ng \nboth\n to judicial review. \n \n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0; \nSovereignty-respecting measures are evident in both the \nHRA \nand in the devolution legislation. The \nHRA \nstipulates that neither the interpretation of legislation under s.3(1) nor the issue of a declaration of incompatibility un\nder s.4 will affect the ‘validity, continuing operation or enforcement’ of the legislative provision(s) under review. The scheme of the devolution legislation, meanwhile, subjects only devolved legislation to potential review, and contains measures designe\nd to preserve the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament.\n \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0; \nIn addition to those powers of quasi-constitutional review allocated by statute, the expansion of the judicial review jurisdiction (and thereby of the constitutional powers of the courts exist\nent at common law) has seen the development of implied powers of quasi-constitutional review by the judges themselves.  At the most straightforward level, \na judicial belief in the \n‘\nsanctity\n’\n of statutory language has yielded ground to more generous and purposive techni\nques of construction\n.\n  Rather more fundamentally, the development of ideas associated with the ‘common law constitution’\n – including t\nhe \nincremental \ndevelopment of a body of ‘\nconstitutional rights’\n \nand the \nacknowledge\nment of a distinction \nbetween constitutional\n and non-constitutional\n \nstatutes\n – \nhave\n \nexposed the traditional positivist and sovereignty-driven explanation of the constitution as being \ninadequate.\n The effects of th\nis transition, which \nsaw common law standards\n (as opposed to the inferred intent of Parliament) as underpinning the courts’ regulatory function\n,\n have been described as ‘one of the most fundamental realignments of the constitutional order since the end of \nthe seventeenth century’.\n  \n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nThe high watermark of this line of \ncommon law \nreasoning\n remains\n Lord Hoffmann\n’s articulation of the ‘principle of legality’\n in \nR\n v. \nSecretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Simms\n.\n  Via the controlling mechanism of\n the common law, Hoffmann addresses one of the most controversial and divisive issues in contemporary public law discourse; the tension between the legal controls imposed by the rule of law and the theoretically limitless legal power\n of\n Parliament.  On the\n one hand,\n \nHoffmann is at pains to preserve the ability of Parliament to legislate contrary to fundamental individual rights.  On the other, \nhe asserts that \nthe constitutional function of the common law has \nexpanded \nso as to \nsubject primary legislation to \na degree of legal control.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0; \nWe conclude \nthat in certain clearly-\ndefined areas of law, the UKSC \nalready\n acts as a constitutional organ. It exercises quasi-constitutional powers in relation to the European Union and \nunder \nthe \nHRA\n \na\nnd acts as a quasi-federal court in \ndevolution cases. Hoffmann notes in \nSimms\n that the apex court in the UK is empowered to ‘\napply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is \nexpressly limited by a constitutional document\n.’\n This, however, overstates the point in relation to cases that fall outside the above areas of law.  Clear legislative \nintent remains \nof \nunquestionable \nauthority\n. The most the common law empowerment allows t\nhe judges to do is to require express or unambiguous words where Parliament wishes to override fundamental rights or the rule of law.\n&#xa0;\nC: \nThe power of review in constitutional cases\n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0; \nThat t\nhe rule of law is one of the twin fundamentals on which the consti\ntution rests\n,\n \nis acknowledged by scholars\n,\n \njudges\n and primary legislation\n and the sense that it is the role of the court to vindicate the rule of law has animated the incremental expansion of the judicial role since the mid-twentieth century.\n  Yet, as\n Hoffmann’s analysis reveals, it is the supremacy of Parliament that ranks first among these supposed equals. \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0; \nAny future determination of the respective constitutional role and function of the judiciary must then seek to address the tension between the s\novereignty of \nParliament and the rule of law\n by approaching them as equals\n.  \nA further formalisation of the relationship between Parliament and courts should examine how to make good the constitutional commitment to both democratic government and the rule of law.  \n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0; \nWe argue that the development of the constitutional function of th\ne courts has rendered the \ntraditional\n understanding of the \nnecessarily \nsubordinate role of the courts obsolete. Unquestioning acceptance by the courts of legislative direction – however Draconian – may no longer be taken for granted under this new constitu\ntional equilibrium\n:\n the ‘respect to be shown to the considered judgment of a democratic assembly’ is no longer a matter of assumption and ‘will vary according to the subject matter and the circumstances.’\n Equally, however, the argument that the \nUKSC \nshoul\nd extend its brief and assert the ability to strike down legislation would be a clear usurpation of the powers of the legislature.  \n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0; \nPossible judicial responses to Parliament doing the ‘unthinkable’\n \n– for instance, passing legislation that disenfranchise\nd a substantial proportion of the population on arbitrary grounds\n or insulated vast tranches of governmental activity from the scrutiny of the courts\n – \ntend to be couched in \nabstract \nterms and are\n often\n countered with a straightforward re-assertion of \nth\ne sovereignty of Parliament.\n \nWe argue that there are three legitimate judicial responses in constitutional cases, each occupying a position between uncritical, literal application of parliamentary intent and judicial enforcement of a substantive rule of l\naw.  \n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0; \nThe most robust course available to the court draws inspiration from the seminal decision in \nAnisminic\n v. \nForeign Compensation Commission\n.\n  In the exceptional case of a clash between constitutional fundamentals, the \nAnisminic\n decision might be depl\noyed in order to support the reinstatement of a jurisdiction apparently ousted by statute, or – read more broadly – prevent the attempted insulation by statute of otherwise \nultra\n \nvires\n activity from judicial review.  While falling short of US-style constit\nutional review, the possibility of this form of judicial disobedience to primary legislation remains the most potent weapon available to the UKSC in the event of a fundamental constitutional clash. \n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0; \nSitting below outright disobedience, in legal terms at l\neast, would be the judicial articulation of a ‘declaration of unconstitutionality.’  Drawing inspiration from declarations of incompatibility under the HRA 1998, David Jenkins has argued that the courts possess the inherent power to declare Acts of Parliam\nent to be unconstitutional ‘when Parliament legislates against legal norms or fundamental baselines for political behaviour deemed by courts of special significance within Britain’s unwritten constitution.’\n Such declarations, Jenkins argues, would respect\nful of sovereignty in two ways.  First, they would be ‘nonbinding and not affect the legal validity’ of the statute in respect of which they were made.\n  Second, ‘the declaration openly recognizes Parliament’s exercise of sovereign power within (or, one mi\nght say, against) an accepted constitutional context.’\n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0; \nJudicial disobedience would pose the most obvious threat to Parliament’s authority by rendering subsequent applications of the legislation contingent on the court’s disobedient response (though legis\nlative restoration, or refinement, of the disputed provision would remain a possibility). The consequences of the issue of a ‘declaration of unconstitutionality’ would not be so severe.  A legislative response to such a declaration might result from the po\nlitical damage caused by the interpretative authority attached to the judicial reading of the requirements of the \nconstitution, but would not be an inevitability.  The impugned statute would remain operable.  The declaration of unconstitutionality would, t\nherefore, better straddle the principle of judicial control and the principle of legislative supremacy, and offer greater respect to the political underpinnings of the UK constitution. \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0; \nFinally, the courts may in certain constitutional cases need to softe\nn the letter of the law in order to achieve fairness in individual cases\n and to vindicate the judicial presumption that \nParliament legislates ‘for a European liberal democracy’ in compliance with fundamental principles\n.\n Like equity, which ‘mitigates the r\nigour of the common law’,\n the rule of law ensures that \nthe formal legal doctrine of \nParliamentary sovereignty does not lose sight of constitutional principles that are of fundamental importance in individual circumstances. \n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0; \nThe rule of law requires court\ns to interpret an Act of Parliament \nwhile\n ensur\ning\n that its application does not result in unfairness in speciﬁc cases. Attempts to reconcile parliamentary intent with the requirements of the rule of law are a less dramatic and a more realistic and workabl\ne suggestion than the conferral of a general discretion on the courts to disapply unconstitutional and pernicious \nlegislation\n. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0; \nThe courts share in the task of policing the boundaries of a rights-based democracy with the legislature and executive\n;\n \ntheir role is complementary to that of Parliament, and of the executive. \n \nTo classify\n the\n quasi-\nconstitutional function\ns\n of the \ncourts \nas a step towards judicial supremacism is to deny the distinctive functions of the legislative and judicial branches: ‘[c\n]\nourts do not substitute Parliament in the making of policy decisions as they are limited by the principle of institutional integrity: “[t]here is a Rubicon which they may not cross.”’\n It also denies the crucial constitutional role of the courts in their \nhabitual recognition of Parliament as sovereign.\n The constitutional functions and authority of the courts, therefore, form the embodiment of the balanced constitution in its modern incarnation.  \n&#xa0;\n30 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n A.V.
