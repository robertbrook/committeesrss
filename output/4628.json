"&#xa0;\nAFS0059Written evidence submitted by Victoria Jaquiss&#xa0;\nThis would be alm\nost laughable if it weren’t so serious. The main problem is that schools have been incorrectly identified as the culprits in the disadvantage that children from areas of disadvantage suffer. And the one main saviour in the sorry state of these children’s l\nives: their local school, with their familiar and experienced teacher\ns – this actual saviour has\n been accused and even found guilty of neglect and incompetence. \n&#xa0;\nI have attended nearly all\n the Leeds consultation meetings for academisation. And the process in every case was, in my opinion, corrupt and totally lacking in academic rigour. In particular the situation at South Leeds \nHigh \nSchool was one of the most dishonest\n. This newly made school had only just \nrecovered from the merger of two very different schools [Merlyn Rees - very white ex-working class, and Matthew Murray, largely Asian], enduring at first some racial tensions\n. \nAfter some rocky early \nmoments, the Ofsted team in 200\n8\n [ish]\n said progress was being and that the last thing this school \nneeded \nwas any more change and in particular to be made into an academy. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is nothing educational about the creation of academies and the inevitable chains that follow. \nThey seem only to serve the interests of private industry. Motivated by money, or power, or winning league tables\n,\n they have lost the original intention of education [from the Latin \neducere\n, to lead out], which is to consider the individual child, and his or her needs. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNone at all. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFirstly I would question who says they are failing, and sadly it seems someone with a vested interested in rubbishing the, keeping teachers in a state of fear, and someone looking for a school to steal\n [and I do mean “steal”].\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is an irony that \nthe very process which was publicly heralded as intended as \ncuring the so-called failing schools has so much damage. Advice from teaching unions and other professionals was of\nfered and ignored. The private sector was itching to get its hands on education, and the government was itching to appease big business.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVictoria Jaquiss FRS\nA, BA hons, PGCE, teacher, writer, bandleader\nSteel pan development officer and Head of Steel pans for Leeds ArtForms\nMember of National Union of Teachers, Musicians Union, Anti-Academies Alliance. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n4\n&#xa0;\n"
