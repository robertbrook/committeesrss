[[[RECOMMENDATION]]]

[[[FIGURE]]]Damage to the BOAT Chalky Lane, Curridge in the parish of Chieveley, West Berks by mechanically propelled vehicles. Now repaired at a cost in the region of £20,000 - £30,000 paid for by council tax payers. A TRO is now needed to prevent repeat damage, but none has been put in place, or the path needs to be downgraded to restricted byway as proposed by GLEAM.&#xa0;&#xa0;23 August 2013&#xa0;
