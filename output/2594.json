"&#xa0;\nEquality and Human Rights Commission – Written evidence1.0               Introduction1.1\n              \nThe Draft Deregulation Bill contains a number of proposals to reduce \n              \nunnecessary bureaucracy and red tape which have an impact on equality and \n              \nhuman rights law and the functions of the Commission. \n1.2\n              \nThe Commission’s view is that there is fundamentally little or no conflict \n              \nbetween its goals and those of the Government in relation to the Draft Bill: the \n              \naims of equality and growth are often linked and mutually supportive. A more \n              \nequal society, in which people’s prospects \nare\n determined by merit rather than \n              \nby other considerations, is a more productive society. Likewise, as the \n              \neconomy improves, it will become easier to realise the aims of equality. \nThe \n              \nCommission\n \nis therefore fully supportive of the need to ensure economic \n              \ngrowth.\n1.3\n              \nThe Commission shares the aspirations behind the Bill, welcoming the \n              \nopportunity to review the way it operates to understand business needs, costs \n              \nand burdens better. We have\n no wish to impose needless costs on business\n; \n              \ni\nndeed, much of what we have done in the last two years has been \naimed at\n \n              \nenabling the private sector to redu\nce the costs of complying with e\nqualit\ny\n \n              \nrequirements, and working with business\nes to achieve that. \n1.4\n              \nHowever, our analysis of the proposals in the Draft Bill has shown up some \n              \nsignificant concerns to which we draw the Joint Committee’s attention. These \n              \nrequire further scrutiny and re-consideration by Government. In this response \n              \nto the Joint Committee's call for evidence, we have focused on those \n              \nproposals of most concern to the Commission, which are:\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nAlthough we have structured this response to address concerns about these   \n              \nclauses, rather than answering individual questions in the Joint Committee's \n              \ncall for evidence, our response is most relevant to questions 7 and 17 to 22, \n              \nand may also assist the Joint Committee’s deliberations on other questions.\n2.0              Summary of the Commission's overall analysis2.1 \n              \nThe Commission continues to \nstrongly disagree with the proposal to remove\n \n              \ne\nmployment \nt\nribunals\n’\n wider recommendation making powers\n. For reasons \n              \nexplained further below, it is too early to judge the effectiveness of the power \n              \nwhich has been in force only over the last three years. The available evidence \n              \nsuggests that the power has been used proportionately, and that there are \n              \nimportant clear benefits for all concerned (including employers and \n              \nemployees) in exercising the power to clarify necessary remedial action, and \n              \nthis helps to prevent further discrimination and to reduce litigation.\n2.2\n              \nAfter careful scrutiny, our analysis is that \nthere are very compelling\n&#xa0;\nreasons why the growth duty should not apply to the Commission\n. First, the Commission does not have many of the functions of a non-economic regulator that the growth duty proposals are intended to affect. Equality and human rights law is proposed by Government, determined by Parliament, interpreted by the courts and tribunals, so the\n              \nCommission does not set the relevant standards. In addition, there are formidable legal problems in applying the growth duty to the Commission in the way the Government intends. Parliament has already provided in the Equality Act 2006 that the Secretary of State must have regard to the desirability of subjecting the Commission to as few constraints as possible, and \nthis conflicts\n with the growth duty proposals. Finally, the application of the growth duty to the Commission undermines the requirement for the Commission to be independent from the Government in the respects required for compliance with the United Nations Paris Principles for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI). We believe the application of the growth duty to the Commission creates a real risk that our United Nations 'A' status NHRI accreditation will be lost. DCMS have made considerable effort to retain and protect this status, with the strong support of FCO. The ‘A’ status of EHRC as a NHRI is important to the exercise of British soft power. \n2.3\n              \nTaken individually or together, these concerns provide a compelling basis to \n              \nremove the Commission from the list of regulators to which the Government \n              \ncurrently proposes to apply the growth duty.  \n&#xa0;\n3.0              Removal of employment tribunals' power (in section 124 Equality                             Act 2010) to make wider recommendations in discrimination cases &#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe Commission has specific statutory duties and powers to enforce the \n              \nequality enactments and to work towards the elimination of unlawful \n              \ndiscrimination and harassment (under section 8 Equality Act 2006). \n3.2\n              \nOur approach to exercising our statutory functions is to enable duty-holders to \n              \ncomply with the legislation and take enforcement action only where it is \n              \nnecessary and proportionate to do so to ensure legal compliance in practice.\n3.3\n              \nThe Equality Act 2010 represents the main domestic equality enactment over \n              \nwhich the Commission has a guardianship role as a statutory enforcer. That \n              \nguardianship role can be exercised in part by issuing codes of practice and \n              \nguidance to improve understanding of rights and obligations and to support \n              \nlegal compliance. It also encompasses use of specific legal powers - such as \n              \nholding inquiries, carrying out investigations, or supporting litigation through \n              \ncourts and tribunals - to identify and challenge non-compliance. \n3.4\n              \nUK equality law has been proposed by Government, scrutinised and enacted \n              \nby Parliament and is interpreted by tribunals and courts. One of the general \n              \naims and principles underpinning the legislation is that prevention of \n              \ndiscrimination is preferable to remedy after the event, and this is supported by \n              \nsections 124 and 149 of the Equality Act 2010. That Act had broad cross-party \n              \npolitical support during its Parliamentary passage. \n3.5\n              \nTo complement the judicial system (without acting as a substitute for it), the \n              \nCommission carries out follow-up work to ensure tribunal recommendations \n              \nhave been carried out in practice. \n3.6\n              \nIn August 2012 the Commission responded to the Government's consultation, \n              \non proposals that included the removal of employment tribunals’ wider \n              \nrecommendations power. Our reasons for opposing the removal of this power \n              \nwere:\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nThe Commission still believes that the ability to make \"wider\" \n              \nrecommendations is an important one which should be retained. Its removal \n              \nwould limit the powers of tribunals to make recommendations to those cases \n              \nwhere the recommendations would alleviate the discrimination only for an \n              \nindividual claimant.\n So long as the current recommendations are followed, the \n              \nexercise of the power benefits:\n3.8\n              \nIn the period Oct 2010 to June 2012 the Commission \nconsidered \n372 \nemployment tribunal \ndecisions\n decided in favour of the claimant\n.\n Recommendations were made in 13\n of th\ne\nse cases. It is not always clear from the decisions \nwhich power has been exercised; h\nowever, th\ne recommendations in 8 of these cases appear to have been made under the wider power\n.\n \n3.9\n              \nThe relatively low number of recommendations might be explained by \n              \nc\nlaimants not be\ning\n aware that they can \nask\n tribunal\ns to\n make \nwider \n              \nrecommendations in their case. Neither the current ET1 form nor the \nguide to \n              \nmaking a claim\n refer\n to the possibility of \nsuch \nrecommendations being made.\n \n3.10\n              \nThe Commission analyses the employment tribunals’ decisions in which wider \n              \nrecommendations are made. In judgements without full written reasons it is \n              \ndifficult to assess the effectiveness and proportionality of the \n              \nrecommendations because the detailed facts of the case are not known. \n              \nHowever in cases where there is sufficient information, the Commission's view \n              \nis that tribunals generally do act proportionately, taking into account the size \n              \nand resources of an employer in making its recommendations. \n3.11\n              \nThe effectiveness of recommendations is harder to establish because there is \n              \nno automatic method for enforcing wider recommendations. The Commission \n              \nis aware that some tribunals include in their recommendations a requirement \n              \nthat the employer report back to the tribunal to confirm that steps have been \n              \ntaken. \n3.12\n              \nThe Commission also treats cases with a recommendation from an \n              \nemployment tribunal as a priority for follow up action. It is in contact with some \n              \nemployers to whom recommendations have been directed, both under the \n              \ncurrent and the previous recommendation making powers, in order to \n              \nascertain whether the employers have implemented the recommendations \n              \nfully. \n3.13\n              \nIt is not appropriate to discuss outcomes in specific cases, as this would \n              \nbreach confidentiality. However, the Commission's experience is that \n              \nemployers respond in different ways. Some employers accept the \n              \nrecommendations as a useful framework for addressing the problems \n              \nidentified by the employment tribunal.  Other employers seem unwilling, or in \n              \nsome cases lack the organisational capability, to implement the \n              \nrecommendations effectively. \n3.14\n              \nIn its consultation paper the Government stated that an employer has \"no way \n              \nof knowing how or when a tribunal may make [a wider] recommendations; or \n              \nwhether it is feasible or affordable for them to comply.\" \n  We do not agree with \n              \nthis view:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.15\n              \nThe Government's consultation noted that the British Chambers of Commerce \n              \nbelieves that the power is not required because employers often make \n              \nchanges to their policies anyway.\n The Commission agrees that in some cases \n              \nemployers take proactive steps to address the discrimination identified by the \n              \ntribunal. The tribunal is unlikely to make a recommendation where there is \n              \nevidence that an employer is already taking steps voluntarily\n.  For these \n              \nemployers the power to make recommendations is not likely to be an \n              \nadditional \"regulatory burden\".\n3.16\n              \nHowever, in the Commission’s experience some employers do not take action\n \nvoluntarily, as they do not accept that their policies or practices need to \nchange despite losing a discrimination case\n. The Commission's view is that it is appropriate that a proportionate \"regulatory burden\" should fall on these employers as a result of failing to adhere to the law.\n3.17\n              \nThe power to make wider recommendations has only been in force since \n              \nOctober 2010. The Commission's view is that this time period does not provide \n              \na sufficient evidence base to assess whether the power is being used \n              \neffectively and proportionately and whether it is a disproportionate burden on \n              \nbusiness. \n3.18\n              \nA better evidence base might also clarify whether\n removal of the power might \n              \nhave more of an impact on people with some protected characteristics und\ner \n              \nthe Equality Act 2010. An a\nnalysis\n of this\n would contribute to ensur\ning that the \n              \nSecretary of State\n \ngives ‘\ndue regard\n’ to the P\nublic Sector Equality Duty in \n              \ns.149 of the Equality Act 2010.\n3.19\n              \nWe urge the Joint Committee to seek clarification from the Government as to \n              \nwhether they have plans to carry out a review before any decisions are taken \n              \non whether this proposal should be included in the Bill. We believe that a \n              \nreview is necessary and \nreasonable because it would allow: \n&#xa0;4.0              Exercise of regulatory functions (the Growth Duty) clauses 58 to 61&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThis section of the paper analyses the implications for the \nCommission\n of\n imposing\n the proposed Growth Duty. We \nthen\n consider\n \na related voluntary measure, the Accountab\nility\n for Regulator Impact (ARI) Guidance\n,\n which came into operation in July 2013. \n&#xa0;\n4.2 \n              \nThe\n \nCommission\n is \nlisted \nin the Annex to the consultation response \namongst\n \n              \nthe organisations proposed to \nbe covered by the growth duty. \nThe lack of \n              \ndetail in the proposals (\nfor example \non the meaning of economic growth in \n              \npractice, or guidance on how to discharge the growth duty) creates problems \n              \nin fully predicting the legal position. \nHowever our\n assumption is that the \n              \nGovernment’s current intention is to include, by order, all the \nCommission\n’s \n              \n'regulatory' functions within scope of the growth duty. \nOur\n \nprincipal \nactivities \n              \nlikely to be captured by the duty \nare\n producing codes and guidance, \n              \nconducting inquiries, using enforcement powers and bringing, supporti\nng or \n              \nintervening in litigation. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nThere are \nthree distinct\n and individually \nexceptionally compelling\n \nreasons\n why \n              \nboth the growth duty and the ARI should not be applied to the Commission\n:\n&#xa0;\n4.4 \n              \nFirstly\n, \ndefinitional \nissues \nin the characterisation of \nCommission as a ‘regulator’ for the purposes of the growth duty. \nThe Commission do\nes\n not have most of the functions of a regulator \nof the sort \nthat\n \nthe growth duty proposals are intended to affect. We agree with the Government’s previously expressed view \n              \n(see para 4.10  below) that the Commission should not be treated in the same way as other regulators, which (unlike the Commission) typically have responsibility over a particular sector or activity, and the power to set standards and impose sanctions for that sector.\n&#xa0;\n4. 5 \n              \nSecondly\n, \nlegal concerns \nabout \nthe compatibility of these provi\nsions with \n              \nrelevant legislation. They raise a\n potential conflict with the \nCommission\n’s \n              \nstatutory duties\n \nand, crucially, \na\n conflict \nwith the statutory protection\n of \nits \n              \nindependence.\n \nTo help secure the \nCommission\n's independence, Parliament \n              \nprovided in the Equality Act 2006 that the Secretary of State must have regard \n              \nto the desirability of ensuring that \nit\n is subject to as few constraints as possible \n              \nin its activities, timetable and priorities. However, in its consultation response \n              \non the growth duty\n, the Government states its view that: ‘\nall non-economic \n              \nregulators and regulatory functions should be covered by this measure unless \n              \nthere is an exceptionally compelling case for their exclusion’\n. \nT\nhe \n              \nGovernment's approach to the application of the growth duty to the \n              \nCommission\n, as set out above, appears \nnot to have regard to the Equality Act \n              \n2006 duty set out in paragraph 4.21\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n4.6 \n              \nT\nhirdly \nthe proposed imposition of additional constraints on the Commission’s \n              \nindependence greatly threatens our ‘A’ status as a National Human Rights \n              \nInstitution (NHRI), to which the Government has repeatedly stated that it \n              \nattaches great value.\n&#xa0;\n4.7 \n              \nFor these reasons, and although \nwe are\n happy to work to realise the aims of \n              \nthese measures (e.g. \nby \ngreater consultation with businesses on \nany\n costs to \n              \nthem of \nthe Commission\n's activities), it would not be appropriate, legally sound \n              \nor politically beneficial for the Government to \nrequire\n \nthe Commission\n to \n              \ncomply with the requirements of the growth duty\n. Looking at each in more \n              \ndetail:\n&#xa0;\na) Definitional issues&#xa0;\n4.8\n              \nThe \nCommission\n is often described as a regulator; however, the \nCommission\n does not make regulations. We have no role in setting \nstandards\n, or in\n \npromulgating new regulations. In the UK, the relevant requirements, restrictions, conditions or standards \nfor \nequality and human rights issues \nare \n set\n by Parliament and\n \ninitiated by Government\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.9\n              \nConsequently, \nsince the Commission\n does not \ndetermine \nthe content of the \n              \nrequirements\n, it does not impose \ncosts on business through regulation, \nset  \n \n              \nrequirements \nwith which \nothers have to comply \nor determine their \ncosts \nin \n              \ndoing so. For example, the recent regulation on age discrimination in services \n              \nwas put forward by the GEO, and the \nCommission\n has no power to change its \n              \nterms. \n&#xa0;\n4.10\n              \nThe Government acknowledged the distinction between the \nCommission\n and \n              \ntypical regulators in its response to the consultation on reform of the \n              \nCommission\n.\n The Government decided against its original proposal in the \n              \nconsultation to amend section 8 of EA 2006 to define the \nCommission\n’s role \n              \nas an 'equality regulator', having concluded that it was unrealistic and \n              \nundesirable to expect the \nCommission\n to 'regulate' every part of society on \n              \nequality. It drew a clear distinction between the \nCommission\n and sector-\n              \nspecific regulators such as Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, and \n              \nstated that it was more appropriate to regard the \nCommission\n as a 'strategic \n              \nenforcer' than as a regulator.\n&#xa0;\n4.11\n              \nNevertheless, \nw\ne \nare\n currently included in the list of affected organisations in \n              \nAnnex A to the growth duty consultation response\n, alongside regulators such \n              \nas the Health and Safety Executive, \nthe \nC\nare \nQ\nuality \nC\nommission\n, \nthe \nFood \n              \nStandards Agency and Ofsted. We agree that we are fundamentally different \n              \nin character from regulators like these, which have responsibility for oversight \n              \nof defined sectors or fields of activity, and typically have the power to set \n              \nstandards and to enforce them through inspections and sanctions. We \n              \ntherefore believe that our distinctly different position and limited remit, in \n              \ncomparison to \nthese more typical \nregulators, strongly supports the argument \n              \nthat we should be removed from the list of organisations to which the duty \n              \napplies.\n&#xa0;\nb) Legal concerns&#xa0;\n4.12\n              \nSince the ARI guidance does not have legal force, this section on legal issues \n              \nfocuses principally (though not entirely) on the proposed statutory growth duty. \n              \nWe have identified a number of legal problems in the \nproposed \napplication of \n              \nthe growth duty to the \nCommission\n, which provide cogent and persuasive \n              \nreasons for not including the \nCommission\n within scope of the growth duty at \n              \nall. \n&#xa0;\n4.13\n              \nThe current breadth of coverage of the growth duty is problematic. It is a \n              \nparticularly critical omission \nthat \nthe \nproposed \nlegislation\n does not expressly \n              \nrender \nthe growth duty subject to other requirement\ns\n affecting the ex\nercise of \n              \nregulatory functions, since it is currently unclear how it interacts with other \n              \nlegal obligations or with the standards for better regulation.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.14\n              \nWe understand the Government’s intention is to define economic growth \nin \nrelation to specific businesses and economic sectors. There are constraints on the Secretary of State's powers to define growth\n,\n and \non \nwhat can be covered in the growth duty guidance, which limits the potential value and assistance offered through \n              \nthose sources. A definition of economic growth cannot include irrelevant considerations. The guidance on the meaning of economic growth cannot exclude \na\n matter relevant to economic growth from consideration, as the Secretary of State's approach appears to contemplate. Nor can it specify what must be taken as compliance with the growth duty, or purport to determine the performance of other legal duties. Even if the Government’s intention is tenable, we foresee considerable challenges ahead in this regard. For example, it may be said that the consequence of exercising regulatory \n              \nfunctions is that whilst growth is promoted for one business, \nthis \nis at the expense of \ngrowth for \nanother. \n&#xa0;\n4.15\n              \nOur firm view\n, based on legal advice,\n is that the growth duty cannot justify a failure to discharge the Commission’s statutory duties or its objectives (under \nthe Equality Act 2006 and Equality Act 2010), or justify acting in a way that is incompatible with European Union law and/or the Human Rights Act 1998. \n&#xa0;\n4.16\n              \nFor example, the \nCommission\n could not lawfully refuse to take enforcement \n              \naction where there is a breach of equality law or violation of human rights, \n              \nsimply on the basis that a failure to act will promote economic growth \n              \n(whatever that concept embraces). Consequently, we believe it is incorrect for \n              \nthe Government to state that the growth duty will provide the framework for \n              \nregulators (in which category the Government \nseeks to \ninclude the \n              \nCommission\n) explicitly to balance growth with their duties to protect. \n&#xa0;\n4.17\n              \nWhilst in general it is recognised that equality is good for business, individual cases might occur in which legal complexities arise from the need to balance growth and eq\nuality considerations\n. For example, would the \nCommission\n be justified in desisting from the promotion of equal treatment in respect of pay on the ground that it would damage economic growth by increasing costs to the detriment of competitiveness\n?\n&#xa0;\n4.\n18\n              \nOur analysis of the potential impact of the growth duty is that it appears to \n insert\n an incongruous consideration in\nto\n the exercise of the \nCommission\n's enforcement or litigation powers, and that \nthis \nmight also be the case in relation to exercising regulatory functions concerning inquiries and issuing codes of practice or guidance. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n19\n              \nWe also take the position that there is a \nfundamental incompatibility between the \ngrowth duty and the \nCommission\n's competence and functions in protecting and promoting human rights \nif \nthe promotion of economic growth \nwere considered paramount\n regardless of other considerations in every case. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n0\n              \nIn public law terms, the effect of the growth duty is that the promotion of economic growth (whatever that concept may embrace) \nwould have \nto be considered whenever the \nCommission\n is \ncontemplating the exercise of\n specified regulatory functions. Attempts to invalidate regulatory decisions \ncould \nsucceed on growth duty grounds on the basis that the \nCommission\n ha\nd \nfailed to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth or the Secretary of State's guidance, or that it ha\nd\n misdirected itself on the meaning of economic growth, or \nthat it had \nfailed to obtain the information necessary to determine reasonably what the effect \nof its actions \non the promotion of economic growth \nwas\n likely to be and/or reached irrational conclusions. Furthermore, the \nCommission\n would have to have cogent reasons for \ndeparting from the Secretary of State's guidance. The growth duty guidance \nwould be \nlikely to place additional requirements in practice upon regulators \nthat go \nbeyond the regulators\n’\n code.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n1 \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State is under a legal obligation (contained in Schedule 1, paragraph 42 (3) of the Equality Act 2006) to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that there are as few constraints as possible imposed upon the \nCommission\n in its activities, timetables and priorities\n. This obligation \nreflect\ns\n the need to preserve the \nCommission\n'\ns independence from Government, in relevant ways, \nwhose activities the \nCommission\n is empowered to scrutinise\n and \nis \nhighly \nrelevant \nto any consideration of \nwhether the \nCommission\n should be covered by the growt\nh duty. \nA failure to consider this factor properly \nwould potentially render a \nMinisterial decision \nto include\n some or all of the \nCommission\n’s functions \nin\n the growth duty\n unlawful\n. In our view, these legal problems constitute exceptionally compelling reason\ns for the growth duty not to be\n              \napplied to the \nCommission\n.\n&#xa0;\nc) Independence and NHRI status&#xa0;\n4.2\n2\n              \nA \nfurther exceptionally compelling reason why it would not be in the Government’s interests to impose the growth duty or ARI guidance on the \nCommission\n, is that it would present a significant further threat to \nthe Commission retaining\n \n'\nA\n' status \nas an NHRI.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n3\n \n              \nMinisters have repeatedly signalled their strong commitment to \nretention of\n 'A' status; for example, t\nhe 2 May 2013 letter\n to the \nCommission\n’s Chair from Helen Grant MP, Minister for Women and Equalities, stated that: ‘\nThe Government is committed to the \nCommission\n being a strong, effective and independent equalities and human rights body, and to retaining the \nCommission\n’s ‘A’-rated status as a National Human Rights Institution’\n.\n \nOther ministers, including Lord McNally and Baroness Stowell of Beeston, have echoed this commitment.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n4\n              \nT\nh\nat the UK has \nan 'A' status NHRI is a vital part of the Government’s human rights record at home\n,\n \nt\nhis issue has wider impact for Government, in particular in relation to \nits foreign policy priorities: \nwhich naturally affects its reputation at the UN and in its bilateral relations. For example, the Foreign Secretary and Baroness Warsi have given strong support to the UK’s \ncandidacy for election to the UN Human Rights Council, and we expect our NHRI status to be considered when votes are cast. Activities such as the recent high-profile launch of the Government’s action plan on business and human rights would also carry less credibility.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n5\n              \nDespite Government commitments, and recent improvements to the \n              \nFramework Agreement between \nCommission\n and \nthe \nG\novernment \nE\nqualities \n              \nO\nffice\n, the \nCommission\n’s 'A' status remains under scrutiny by the United \n              \nNations International Co-ordinating Committee Sub-Committee on \n              \nAccreditation (SCA). Our next five-yearly scheduled review by the SCA will be \n              \nin 2015, but we were added to the agenda of the SCA’s last meeting in May \n              \n2013, and were subsequently asked to provide further information on the \n              \napplication of spending controls, in advance of a likely further discussion on \n              \nour independence at the SCA’s next meeting in November of this year.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n26\n              \nThere is an incompatibility between the growth duty and the \nCommission\n's \n              \nobjectives, duties and competence as a National Human Rights Institution \n              \n(NHRI) under the United Nations Paris Principles. Our considered judgment is \n              \nthat there is a real risk that the SCA will perceive the imposition of the growth \n              \nduty as undermining the \nCommission\n’s independence from Government, \n              \nrisking removal of \nour\n UN accreditation as an ‘A’ status NHRI.\n&#xa0;\n5.0              Accountability for Regulator Impact&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nThe Accountability for Regulator Impact (ARI) Guidance\n \nsets out expectations for engagement with business by national non-economic regulators in respect of their regulatory policy and practice. It is expected regulators \nwill \npublicly commit to principles covering engagement with business \nby \npublishing draft impact assessments for comment and sharing evidence, and \nproviding \nmechanisms for businesses to complain \nthat\n they have not been properly engaged by regulators. In the event of disputes about regulatory assessments, the Government's Regulatory Policy Committee potentially becomes the final arbiter. The Government appears to believe that the ARI should be applied to the \nCommission\n’s work, although it recognises \nthe guidance’s voluntary nature\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nAs a matter of choice\n,\n and with the \nagreement \nof our Board, we would seek to adapt and evolve our approach to deliver the aims of the growth duty and the principles of ‘Accountability for Regulator Impact’\n, \nbut\n would\n do so in a way \nwhich \n \nis\n compatible with our statutory duties and which does not \nrisk \nthe UN downgrad\ning \nthe UK’s 'A' status as an NHRI. To this end, we would be happy to discuss and agree with GEO a protocol whereby \nthe Commission commits to implementing \nthe outcomes and approaches of the growth duty and ARI guidance - including engaging with business and assessing their costs - \nand to applying this \nproportionately to those areas of the \nCommission\n's work where it acts like a regulator.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.3\n              \nThe Accountability for Regulatory Impact (ARI) measure assumes \nthat the \n              \nregulators to whom it applies are accountable to Government departments for \n              \ntaking particular decisions. If a dispute arises as to the likely impact of change, \n              \na regulator is, in the final analysis, expected to accept and \nto \nact in \n              \naccordance with what\never\n the Government's Regulatory Policy Committee \n              \ndetermines to be correct. The ARI measure could, therefore, undermine the \n              \nCommission\n's independence in practice, resulting in loss of our NHRI 'A' \n              \nstatus.  \n&#xa0;\n6.0              Conclusion&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nThe \nCommission supports the aims of \ngrowth and better regulation, and \nis \n \n              \nprepared to agree \nto \ntaking\n \na voluntary approach which will meet these aims. \n              \nHowe\nver\n \nthe measures in the proposed legislation\n would\n:\n constrain our \n              \nfreedom to \nexercise our statutory duties;\n \nare\n not proportionate or \n              \nappropriate to the \nCommission\n’s functions; \ndo\n not accord with the relevant \n              \nlegislation; and would \nrestrict \nthe \nCommission's independence with \n              \nconsequences that we have outlined above. T\nhe\ny\n are exceptionally compelling \n              \nreasons to exclude \nEHRC \nfrom the scope of the proposed growth duty in \n              \nclauses 58 to 60 of the Draft Deregulation Bill.\n              \n6.2  \n              \nT\nhe\nre is a real risk that the imposition of the growth duty on the \n              \nCommission\n \n              \nwill breach domestic law (including Schedule 1, paragraph 42\n (3) of the \n              \nEquality Act 2006) and\n \nthat it \nwould place at risk the \nCommission\n's \n              \nindependence and UN accreditation as\n an 'A' status NHRI in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEquality and Human Rights Commission26 September 2013&#xa0;\n \nsee\n, for example, Fasuyi v. Greenwich [2000] UKEAT 1078_99_2010 at para 26\n. \n the \"reasonable steps\" defence is set out in s.109(4) Equality Act 2010\n The Commission receives copies of decisions in successful employment tribunals claims brought under the Equality Act 2010 (and under previous equality enactments). The Commission is dependent on tribunal offices to send these decisions to it, so the information provided in this submission should be regarded as the minimum number of cases in which wider recommendations have been made.  Tribunal offices may not yet have sent some decisions to the Commission.\n \nhttp://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/forms/tribunals/employment/forms/T420-making-claim-et.pdf\n Ministerial Foreword at p.3 of the Consultation Paper\n see, for a recent example of an unsuccessful appeal on this ground (under the pre-Equality act 2010 powers: \nLycee Francais Charles De Gaulle v Delambre (Age Discrimination) [2011] UKEAT 0563_10_0504\n Para 3.2 Consultation paper\n see for example the case of \nMichalak v Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust [2012] EqLR 186\n where the tribunal did not order that the respondent Trust write to the GMC \nto persuade \ni\nt not to proceed further with proceedings against the claimant because the Trust had agreed to send such a letter without the need of such a\n \nr\necommendation \n \nthe\n non-payment of employment tribunal awards is another indication of the reaction of some employers to losing a case a the employment tribunal.
