[normal]).  We have also highlighted our work in three areas
[normal]: 
[normal]extending regulation to other professional and occupational groups
[normal] (section

[normal])
[normal]; continuin
[normal]g fitness to practise (section four
[normal]); and 
[normal]building the eviden

[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]The HCPC was 
[normal]established by Parliament under 
[normal]the Health and Social Work 
[normal]Professions 
[normal]Order 2001
[normal]. 
[normal]Our predecessor,
[normal] the Council for Professions S
[normal]upplementary to Medicine (CPSM)
[normal],
[normal] was 
[normal]established in 1961.
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Our main objective is to safeguard the health and wellbeing of persons using or needing the services of our registran
[normal]ts
[normal] and w
[normal]e do this by
[normal]:
[normal]2.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]also 
[normal]protect professional titles, with all the professions having at least one protected title. It is a criminal o
[normal]ffenc
[normal]e for someone to claim to be registered when they are not, and 
[normal]we 
[normal]take action against those who do so. 
[normal]2.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]In order to carry out our regulato
[normal]ry functions effectively w
[normal]e work with 
[normal]relevant 
[normal]organisations
[normal], sharing 
[normal]appropriate 
[normal]information relating to registration and fitness to practise
[normal].  One way we do this is through 
[normal]memoranda of understanding
[normal] and 
[normal]such agreements
[normal] are 
[normal]in place with a range of organ
[normal]isations including the C
[normal]are 
[normal]Q
[normal]uality 
[normal]C
[normal]ommission (CQC)
[normal] and the 
[normal]regulators of social workers in
[normal] Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
[normal] 
[normal]The Register[bold]2.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]In 2012-13, we 
[normal]received 2,822
[normal] applications from international professionals and 
[normal]16,233 applications from 
[normal]individuals
[normal] 
[normal]completing
[normal] UK approved 
[normal]programmes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]The current renewal fee is £76
[normal]. At the time of this submission we had concluded a consultation to increase this to £80 from 
[normal]April 
[normal]2014
[normal].  
[normal]Even with this increase, we 
[normal]would 
[normal]continue to
[normal] have the lowest fee
[normal] of all 
[normal]the 
[normal]nine regulators overseen by the Professional Standards Authority
[normal] for Health and Social Care (PSA)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Fitness to Practise[bold]2.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]In 2012-13, we received
[normal] 
[normal]1
[normal],
[normal]657 
[normal]fitness to practise 
[normal]allegations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This amoun
[normal]ts to 0.53% of all registrants.
[normal] 248 cases were concluded at a final hearing
[normal] and 
[normal]panels 
[normal]imposed a 
[normal]striking-off order in 44 cases
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2.1
[normal]0
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]are always looking at ways to improve the efficiency of the fitness to practise process, whilst ensuring that the public continue to be protected. In
[normal] recent years this has included introducing the ability
[normal] for panels to agree the disposal
[normal] of suitable cases by consent
[normal] without the need for a contested hearing,
[normal] and the use of pre-hearing case management arrangements to ensure
[normal] the
[normal] timely
[normal] running of hearings
[normal]. In 2012-
[normal]13, the mean time taken from 
[normal]an allegation meeting our standard of acceptance
[normal] to consideration
[normal] by an Investigating Committee P
[normal]anel
[normal] (ICP)
[normal] was seven months. The mean time 
[normal]taken 
[normal]to conclusion at a final hearing was 16 months.
[normal]2.11
[normal]              
[normal]In its 2012-
[normal]13 performance review report, the PSA concluded that the HCPC was amongst those regulators 
[normal]‘
[normal]managing their caselo
[normal]ads effectively and efficiently’
[normal].
[normal]Education[bold]2.1
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]We approve programmes which lead to eligibility to apply to our Register. 
[normal]We approve 872
[normal] programmes at 147 education providers

[normal](figures correct as at
[normal] 25 November 2013

[normal]This ensures individuals completing approved programme
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]are fit to 
[normal]practise at 
[normal]the
[normal]ir
[normal] point of entry to the Register.  
[normal]Continued 
[normal]approval is 
[normal]subject to meeting our 
[normal]on-going 
[normal]monitoring requirements.
[normal]2.1
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]71 visi
[normal]ts to 167 programmes 
[normal]are 
[normal]scheduled in the 2013-14 academic year.
[normal]Professional and lay input[bold]2.1
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]W
[normal]e work with
[normal] 
[normal]a range of 
[normal]professional and lay 
[normal]individuals who provide expertise in our decision making for our govern
[normal]ance
[normal] and regulatory processes.
[normal]  
[normal]2.
[normal]16
[normal]              
[normal]We have 634
[normal] Partners
[normal],
[normal] with
[normal] lay
[normal] and professional
[normal] expertise
[normal],
[normal] who work across six 
[normal]regulatory functions
[normal]. This includes 
[normal]sittin
[normal]g on fitness to practise panels; visiting education 
[normal]programmes; 
[normal]assessing continuing professional 
[normal]development profiles; and reaching decisions about applica
[normal]tions
[normal] from international applicants
[normal].
[normal]3. Extending regulation to other professional and occupat[bold]ional groups[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]We have a track record of extending regulation to 
[normal]further 
[normal]professions. Since 
[normal]our Register opened in 2003
[normal], we have registe
[normal]red four additional professions. Most recently 
[normal]we opened our Register to social workers in 
[normal]England
[normal] fol
[normal]lowing the 
[normal]abolition of the General Social Care Council (GSCC)
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]In 2011, the Department of Health
[normal] committed that it
[normal] would explore the scope for the HCPC ‘to establish a voluntary register of [adult] social care workers [in England] by 2013’.
[normal]3.3
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]We have
[normal] 
[normal]care
[normal]fully 
[normal]considered this issue and concluded that there are significant shortcomings in a voluntary register being held by a statutory regulator. The
[normal]se
[normal] are
[normal] the lack of 
[normal]legal compulsion for individuals to be registered
[normal] and the inability of 
[normal]the regulator to demand information or 
[normal]to 
[normal]compel witnesses when investigating fitness to practise allegations
[normal].  Crucially, it also means that if someone 
[normal]was removed from a volu
[normal]ntary register they could 
[normal]continue to practis
[normal]e
[normal]. 
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]consider
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal]re 
[normal]is 
[normal]the 
[normal]po
[normal]tential for public confusion around the status of voluntary and statutory registers being held by the same organisation.
[normal] 
[normal]We have also concluded that
[normal] there would be considerable costs involved in establishing 
[normal]such 
[normal]a register 
[normal]and paying for its operating costs until 
[normal]it was 
[normal]self-fin
[normal]ancing
[normal].
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Recent estimates are that 
[normal]the adult social care workforce 
[normal]in England 
[normal]number
[normal]s
[normal] 1.63m jobs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This is a large, low paid and often transitory workforce with significant numbers of part time wor
[normal]kers. We have concluded that ‘full statutory regulation’ 
[normal]for this group 
[normal]is unlikely to be considered to be a
[normal] 
[normal]proportionate 
[normal]or 
[normal]cost-effecti
[normal]ve
[normal] response.
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]We have instead proposed a ‘negative registration scheme’ and statutory regulation of CQC registered 
[normal]managers. 
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]A negative registration
[normal] scheme 
[normal]would 
[normal]improve public protection because it would 
[normal]enable the regulator to deal effectively with the small 
[normal]number
[normal] of individuals who are unsuitable to work in adult social care
[normal] in England
[normal], without placing a disproportionate burden on the remainder of the workforce. 
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]This model would work as follows.
[normal]3.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]The ‘negative registration’ model draws upon a similar scheme which has been successfully operated by the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission for a number of year
[normal]s
[normal] and is due to be extended to other state
[normal]s
[normal] and territories.
[normal]3.10
[normal]              
[normal]All providers registered by the CQC must have a
[normal] registered manager for each of 
[normal]the ‘regulated activities’ they carry out.
[normal] Some of these individuals will be from statutory regulated backgrounds, others will not. We have proposed that these managers sho
[normal]uld become statutory regulated.  This will put them on the same footing as other regulated professions by having a binding code of conduct and ethics.
[normal]3.11
[normal]              
[normal]We consider that these proposals might be more effective than relying on purely voluntary or self-re
[normal]gulatory arrangements alone. They would provide an important ‘safety net’ whilst building on other sector-led initiatives focused on assuring and improving quality in this sector. 
[normal]3.12
[normal]              
[normal]We have submitted these proposals to Government. 
[normal]If the Government con
[normal]sidered that these proposals met its policy objectives
[normal], further
[normal] development
[normal] work would be required.
[normal]3
[normal].13
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, it is existing Government policy that we should in the future become responsible for the regulation of herbal medicine practitioners and 
[normal]‘
[normal]non-medical
[normal]’
[normal] public health specialists.
[normal]4. Continuing fitness to practise[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]This section outlines 
[normal]our rationale
[normal] and on-going work in the area of continuing fitness to practise. We use this term 
[normal](
[normal]in line with the approach taken in the PSA’s 2013 report 
[normal]on this topic
[normal])
[normal] to describe the steps taken by regulators (and others) to support fitness to practise beyond the point of initial registration. 
[normal]This term 
[normal]reflects our
[normal] outcomes-focus
[normal]ed
[normal] approach
[normal] and avoids ‘revalidation’ which is often poorly defined.
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Sin
[normal]ce 2003
[normal], 
[normal]we have required
[normal] registrants to renew their registration every two years. Since 2006, 
[normal]registrants have had a compulsory, statutory requirement to undertake continuing professional development
[normal] (CPD)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Our
[normal] standards for CPD 
[normal]are focused
[normal] on outcomes – the benefits of CPD to services users and quality of care.
[normal] These standards are 
[normal]linked to registration and 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]underpinned by random audits. We consider that auditing is a proportionate method of ensuring 
[normal]compliance
[normal]. We 
[normal]can and do
[normal] remove indi
[normal]viduals from the Register where our standards have not been met. We 
[normal]also have
[normal] in place requirements for those seeking to return to the Register after a period out of practice. 
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Analysis
[normal] 
[normal]of fitness to practise allegations
[normal] against registrants has shown t
[normal]hat t
[normal]he majority
[normal] of cases
[normal] 
[normal](72% in 2012-13)
[normal] 
[normal]are about conduct
[normal] and professionalism
[normal] with relatively few cases purely about lack of competence. 
[normal]We have been undertaking a programme of work and research to build 
[normal]the 
[normal]evidence base 
[normal]further 
[normal]and inform decisions ab
[normal]out how we approach the assessment 
[normal]of continuing fitness to practis
[normal]e. 
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]This has included or includes the following.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]We anticipate that the outcomes of these pieces of work will inform whether and in what ways we 
[normal]might
[normal] enhance our existing approach to 
[normal]assessing registran
[normal]ts continuing fitness to practis
[normal]e
[normal]. For example, we might consider requiring registrants to seek
[normal] 
[normal]service user
[normal] feedback to inform their learning and we 
[normal]might 
[normal]want to consider whether we have sufficient inf
[normal]ormation on risk such that we might consider targeting our audits towards ‘higher risk’ groups. We consider that it is important that any further developments in this area are evidence-based and proportionate.
[normal]5. Building the evidence base of regulation[bold]5.
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]We know that there is generally a lack of research and analysis on topics related or relevant to the regulation of the professions that we regulate.
[normal] 
[normal]In recent years, we have particularly sought to expand the research we commission in order to contribute 
[normal]to the 
[normal]evidence base of regulation.  Our work in this area is about helping us make better, more evidence-based decisions, as well as making a contribution to the wider regulatory agenda.
[normal] We invest resources in dissemination of research as well as commissi
[normal]oning research to ensure that it has an impact on practice. 
[normal]Every year we hold a series of events with our stakeholders to provide a mechanism for debate. 
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]Section four of this submission describes some of the pieces of work we have undertaken or 
[normal]commissioned in relation to con
[normal]tinuing fitness to practise. We have provided 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]further examples below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]Our research looking at 
[normal]professionalism
[normal] in particular
[normal] has been well recei
[normal]ved by our stakeholders (see 4.4
[normal]). It has made a valuable
[normal] contribution
[normal] to initiatives
[normal] on this topic
[normal] by 
[normal]both 
[normal]the Scottish Government and the Department of Health.
[normal] We have also published articles in
[normal] a
[normal] range o
[normal]f professional journals and the research has been used as the basis for discussion 
[normal]with registrants 
[normal]at seminars and presentations, 
[normal]via events
[normal] held throughout the UK and online
[normal]. We consider this 
[normal]to be
[normal] an important area of work
[normal], particularly in light of rece
[normal]nt well documented examples of failures in care
[normal] in hospitals and care homes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We 
[normal]have a strong commitment to 
[normal]e
[normal]ncouraging registrants to think about their profession
[normal]al behaviour and that of others, and to place 
[normal]as much emphasis on this 
[normal]important 
[normal]aspect of 
[normal]professional 
[normal]practice as
[normal] is already the case for competence.
