[[[Call for Evidence: EU action to tackle youth unemployment]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[1. Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am supportive of existing funding programmes which help entrepreneurs in our small and medium sized businesses to grow, such as the Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (COSME). &#xa0;The programme will run from 2014 to 2020, with a planned budget of €2.3bn. While funding can be slow and the procedures bureaucratic there are strong advantages of COSME in terms of growth and jobs and this is where I think the EU should focus its attention on funding for employment. &#xa0;However, this is a problem which Member States should be tackling themselves. Additional funding that has been carved out for tackling youth unemployment will mainly be going to countries with much higher unemployment than the UK so it’s debatable if this is a fair distribution of UK taxpayers’ money. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2. How do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment?]]]&#xa0;Youth unemployment is an important area, worthy of consideration at EU level and where we would like to see cross-border cooperation in highlighting this as a priority. However, EU action in this field can only be beneficial where it compliments action at Member State level. For example, it is hard to understand where the advantages of the European Youth Guarantee lie.&#xa0; &#xa0;The scheme is designed to guarantee that anyone under the age of 25 shall receive an offer for a job, an apprenticeship or further training within four months of unemployment or completed education, but which runs contrary to the existing "youth contract" in the UK.&#xa0;There are other actions that could be undertaken to realise more job creation. For example the services industry accounts for the largest part of the EU economy representing nearly 70 per cent of GDP and two-thirds of total employment in Europe. Full implementation of the Services Directive could result in economic gains of €60 - €140 billion and generate more than 600,000 jobs, which represents a growth potential of between 0.6 and 1.5 per cent of GDP. &#xa0;Rather than agreeing any additional legislation, Member States need to first better promote the investments they have already made due in the Services Directive so that businesses can be made aware of how much easier it is to sell cross border now and access a market of 500 million consumers than previously. All Member States should make the necessary adaptations and changes required including setting up the Points of Contact and this should be re-iterated constantly.&#xa0;There could be further liberalisation linked to regulated professions, where some Member States are disproportionately blocking access to professions. As a result, the European Commission should be pressed to ensure consistency between the peer review under the Services Directive and mutual evaluation under the Professional Qualifications directive. Getting qualifications recognised across Europe and getting our citizens more mobile to move for jobs available across the EU.&#xa0;In 2011, around 6 million people worked in another EU Member State than their own. The recently updated Directive on Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications aims to further enhance, simplify and speed up the mobility of highly qualified professionals across border, while ensuring safety checks are in place for health professionals. It was included in the Single Market Act as a top priority to boost jobs and growth.&#xa0;It is estimated that four million jobs are currently vacant throughout the EU due to a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the skills required for available jobs. Europe can play a role in reducing high levels of unemployment particularly youth unemployment by encouraging Member States to invest in human capital to address new skills needs, to support business start-ups and improve access to finance, by cutting red tape, and by encouraging young people to take full advantage of the single market.&#xa0;Enhancing the employability of young people and making sure they have the required skills which can be transferred to a working environment is essential in tackling unemployment. In this regard, businesses should be consulted and liaison between academic institutions and businesses should be stepped up. University-Business dialogue is a useful tool in helping to achieve this.&#xa0;Finally, there are some EU programmes such as Erasmus, for its educational and societal benefits and Creative Europe for helping to create opportunities for young people in the Cultural creative sectors. However, each national economy is different and matters to do with employment are largely for the Member States and we must be careful not to cede any more power in this important area.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3. Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance?]]]&#xa0;There are EU measures addressed at all of these issues but in my experience I have found that most of the measures focuses on higher education and not enough on further education or targeting NEETS specifically. But there is a move to recognise more vocational training going forward. However, I feel that a more important question here is identifying how and where the programmes proposed can add value to actions already being taken at a Member State level. With tightened budgets it is important that we focus funding on the programmes which add the most value to alleviating youth unemployment issues and less on costly programmes such as Jean Monet which is of little use to the average EU citizen. (The Jean Monet funds the College of Europe and training of European Institutional civil service i.e for a small elite.)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4. Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Previous Court of Auditors Reports on the effectiveness of EU funding have found that "controls" over 86 per cent of the EU budget were only "partially effective" and in many cases found that EU money did not hit its targets. At a time when national public spending is being cut, it is crucial that EU funding is spent more efficiently and in a targeted manner. &#xa0;It would be useful if the Court of Auditors Reports where published in a timely manner in order to have greater impact on the discussion between Member States and the European Commission, thus informing the process before programmes are automatically renewed. &#xa0;Enhancing performance and creating EU added value is of utmost importance when assessing the effectiveness of EU funding. The availability of up-to-date and reliable data is essential to monitor the achievement of objectives and the outcome of the measures of publicly-funded programmes, and that all Member states continue to comply with reporting obligations. The status quo is to believe everything has value and we need to continually add more money and more EU projects. There needs to be a stricter results driven assessment of EU investment to ensure its truly delivering on their objectives.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[5. How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent?]]]&#xa0;Primary responsibility for youth employment programmes rests with Member States, but over the years the European Social Fund has provided resources to supplement those programmes. The YEI should reinforce the resources available from the European social fund to address growth, employment and skills need and contribute to the EU2020 strategy.&#xa0;The ESF should raise employment and skills levels and complement Member States' domestic programmes to improve value for money. It should help to tackle poverty by targeting the most disadvantaged groups, according to labour market needs, in order to improve their employability and skills. Most importantly, Member States should have the flexibility to deliver ESF and YEI in a ways that is consistent with their employment and skills policies and systems. In England, Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) must be given adequate flexibility to identify how the money can best be used to tackle youth unemployment in their areas in a way that complements our existing policies such as the Work programme and Youth Contract. That will ensure that the youth employment initiative adds value to existing provision in the eligible areas. Most importantly the YEI must respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[6. Do you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered?]]]&#xa0;Generally I would say no. But as the youngest MEP for the UK I endeavour to represent their views in the committee. When I worked on the Erasmus + I was contacted by many organisations representing the civil society. I am often out speaking with young people in my constituency, organising events to meet them and to hear stories I can bring back to my work within the European Parliament. I also invite universities and schools to visit Brussels and the European Parliament. But it is true that generally youth policy is sculpted by old politicians and civil servants and we could do more at EU and Member State level to improve consultation. But the Youth Unemployment fund is the EU’s response to a youth problem so they want to be seen to have listened and responded. &#xa0;However, in order to get the maximum benefit from EU funding, it is important that our Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) engage with groups or parts of their area not currently represented on the Local Enterprise Partnership Board which may be relevant for some kinds of activity supported by the ESF and YEI (e.g. civil society, universities, schools  and youth organisations). There are existing networks that would be well placed to work in partnership with LEPs to ensure their EU investment strategies take into account the full potential of the local area.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[7. Should the EU and Member States take into account the positive and negative socio-economic impacts of youth migration due to unemployment when designing measures to tackle youth unemployment? How might any negative consequences be mitigated?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Youth migration is certainly an important issue, but we should be careful not to confuse different policy areas too much. EU Member States need to cooperate and exchange best practice when it comes to their different experiences with youth unemployment. Migration is certainly an element of this. However, while this is an important issue worthy of some cooperation, we must be vigilant that dealing with the consequences of youth migration lies primarily at a Member State level.&#xa0;However, migration of young people can open up valuable opportunities, it is important that we take the appropriate measures to ensure that migration leads to their human development as well as contributing to the development of both their home and host countries. Free movement of workers and peoples is a founding pillar of the EU and people should be encouraged to take advantage of the ability to move for work, however, we should always be mindful of problems of social inclusion and acceptance of migrant workers across Europe.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[8. How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment?]]]&#xa0;I believe we should encourage young people to take advantage of the Single Market of 500 million citizens by becoming entrepreneurs and setting up their own businesses. I am working on an EU level on cutting red tape for SMEs to enable them to start up, grow and create jobs. The promotion of the possibilities given with the Single Market and all the help out there for young people is important. E-commerce is also an area I have worked on helping businesses to trade cross-border within the EU but also globally.&#xa0;Another area I would like to raise is the knowledge triangle. We have often led calls for more use to be made of the knowledge triangle and for there to be a focus on using research, innovation and education policies together in order to generate jobs and growth. On this aspect, the creation of a well working mobility of researchers is vital. &#xa0;On sport, although only indirectly related to unemployment aspects, we have long argued that sport and exercise need to be given more careful consideration as a tool that can have an impact on local communities and help address societal challenges facing youth. This is one area, which when taken together with the broader youth strategy, can help tackle some of the longer term social issues related to low levels of employment and help create a healthy workforce both mentally and physically.&#xa0;25 October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Source: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/services/docs/services-dir/explanatory/economic_benefits_en.pdf
