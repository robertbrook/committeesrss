"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Lifeways (ACQ 05)&#xa0;Foreword by Paul Marriner\nAs Chief Executive of Lifeways, I submit our evidence to support the Committee’s work ahead of its accountability hearing with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) on Tuesday 22 October. \n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLifeways is a leading national provider of Supported Living and Learning Disabilities community care services – a space which is highly affected by the proposed reforms to the remit and regulatory responsibilities of the CQC and its inspection regime. We firmly take the view that inspection and regulatory oversight is critical to good care, and consider greater engagement should be undertaken with national providers to develop a robust inspection programme for the future. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall, efforts in the months preceding the session, particularly reforms of the CQC, such as increased and more intelligence scrutiny, are to be encouraged but there are nonetheless several challenges facing the sector which the regulator should help address. One of the most pressing concerns for Lifeways, and other providers no doubt, is that regulation is somewhat of a postcode lottery with each regulatory assessor having different expectations of what constitutes good care. Often CQC inspectors assess providers drawing disproportionately from their personal experience of other care, such as elderly care, to other very different settings, such as Learning Disabilities or Supported Living, which may not be necessarily appropriate. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt follows that inspectors should be appropriate for the area under review with specialist knowledge on the subject; however this is often not the case with inspectors having more of a generic approach to inspection. We are glad to see the steer in the direction of specialists, but in achieving this aim it is critical that the CQC have a quality stock of inspectors from a mental health and Learning Disabilities background to ensure that high quality inspections prevail in these areas. Moreover, a greater involvement of service users and their families is essential if the inspection regime is to put the patient and their wellbeing at the forefront of its focus.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt Lifeways, we are keen to see a return to a national lead official for larger providers to ensure providers with a national footprint have a consistent access point to information; this is critical to ensuring good standards across the country and hope that this is something the CQC may consider.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite notable efforts to progress reforms, the lack of visibility and clarity on future care standards and regulations is very concerning, especially given the ambitious timeline set for CQC and other regulators. We would urge the CQC to address this issue imminently. \nThe information above provides some background to the key questions enclosed below, which would we would be delighted if you can share with the Committee:\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
