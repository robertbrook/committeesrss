defaultAssociation of Personal Injury Lawyers – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultThe Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL) was formed by claimant lawyers with a view to representing the interests of personal injury victims. The association is dedicated to campaigning for improvements in the law to enable injured people to gain full access to justice, and promote their interests in all relevant political issues. Our members comprise principally practitioners who specialise in personal injury litigation and whose interests are predominantly on behalf of injured claimants. APIL currently has more than 4,100 members in the UK and abroad who represent hundreds of thousands of injured people a year.
default&#xa0;
defaultAPIL welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill, but as our remit only extends to personal injury law, including workplace safety, we have restricted our comments to clause 1, 
defaulthealth and safety at work: general duty of self-employed persons
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Health and Safety Executive has previously consulted on proposals to exempt self-employed people from health and safety regulation, and APIL responded to that consultation in October 2012. In our response we recommended that the proposals should not be implemented. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are disappointed, therefore, that the Government has decided to implement its proposals, and we remain of the view that the proposed changes should not go ahead. We therefore believe that clause 1 should be removed from the draft Bill for the reasons set out below.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important firstly to address the misconception that health and safety law is just “red-tape”, and imposes a burden to businesses, and especially to self-employed people. The explanatory notes accompanying the draft Bill state that the “Bill provides for the removal or reduction of burdens on businesses, civil society, individuals, public sector bodies and the taxpayer”. In fact, health and safety law is not a burden, but is vital to protect workers and members of the public. According to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there has been an 80 per cent decrease in workplace fatalities since the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 came into force, with the Health and Safety Executive estimating that half of this is as a result of health and safety legislation and enforcement
default. There is no reason why self-employed people should not be offered the same protection under health and safety law as everybody else.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder current law, employers and self-employed people only need to take appropriate steps to ensure that they comply with health and safety regulations. Regulation 3 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 states-
default&#xa0;
default(6) Where the employer employs five or more employees, he shall record-
default              
default(a) 
defaultthe
default significant findings of the assessment; and
default              
default(b) 
defaultany
default group of his employees identified by it as being especially at risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile Regulation 5 states-  
default&#xa0;
default“5(1) Every employer shall make and give effect to such arrangements as are appropriate, having regard to the nature of his activities and the size of his undertaking, for the effective planning, 
defaultorganisation
default, control, monitoring and review of the preventive and protective measures.
default&#xa0;
default(2) Where the employer employs five or more employees, he shall record the arrangements referred to in paragraph (1).
default 
defaultThe work that self-employed people have to undertake to ensure that they comply with health and safety law is therefore minimal, and is not a burden.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are particularly concerned that exempting self-employed people would have far wider consequences than what is possibly intended. If someone is exempt, he would presumably be exempt from having to carry out a risk assessment under Regulation 3 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (1993 and 1999) and Article 3(a) of the Framework Directive. Risk assessments, however, have now become a part of case law, as pointed out by Dame Janet Smith, in 
defaultThrelfall
default v Hull City Council. 
defaultWhile the proposed changes only seem to exempt self-employed people from the scope of statue, the proposed changes could go far wider and could also exempt self-employed people from the case law regarding health and safety law. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe draft Bill also fails to provide full details of which self-employed people will be affected by it. Current drafting states that the Bill will only apply a general duty to a self-employed person who “conducts a relevant undertaking”, and if that “relevant undertaking” is “of a prescribed description”. The explanatory notes explain that “such undertakings will be described by way of regulations made by the Secretary of State”.  It is vital, therefore, that if the clause is to remain in the draft Bill, the Government should publish a full list as soon as possible as to who will actually be exempt from health and safety law, so as to ensure that the full consequences of such a change can be determined.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe health and safety of self-employed people should not be put at risk just to satisfy a Government commitment to cut down on “red-tape”, and clause 1 should be removed from the draft Bill. The Health and Safety Executive has a clear duty to prevent people from being killed and injured at work, and this protection should be offered to everyone, including the self-employed. As health and safety laws do not impose a burden on self-employed people, why send out a message that health and safety is not important and should just be ignored?
default&#xa0;
defaultIf someone is injured and then unable to work, he may become reliant on the state, and the state should therefore do what it can to 
defaultminimise
default the risk of injury, regardless of someone’s employment status.
