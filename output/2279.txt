EIS 16

[[[Written evidence submitted by the Crown Estate]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Crown Estate welcomes the opportunity to respond to this inquiry on the extractive industries sector. The statements contained in this response are grounded in The Crown Estate’s interests, land ownership and as largest minerals landlord of the UK. The Crown Estate is a commercially-run, total return, active asset management business, overseeing a UK-wide portfolio of prime urban, rural, coastal and offshore property. In line with our core values, we actively manage these to deliver a commercial return, which is paid each year to the Treasury for the benefit of the nation. We are committed to careful stewardship of the assets we have been trusted to manage. The Crown Estate is governed by an Act of Parliament, The Crown Estate Act 1961. It has a public remit whilst at the same time being independent from Government – a statutory corporation, run on a commercial basis. We are committed to working with government departments, stakeholders and industry in helping to manage the coastal and marine environment, in line with our commercial remit.Our rural and marine assets comprise: As with Mines Royal, we are not involved in the physical process of mining, but we license such activity. In recent years we have invested in new operations with the purchase of mineral interests at Cauldon Low in Staffordshire and Nether Murthat in Scotland. Our responsibility for Mines Royal determines the need for our permission to remove Crown gold in any form. We currently have four Mines Royal production leases, including one active gold mine in Northern Ireland.With these interests combined, this makes The Crown Estate the largest minerals landlord in the UK. It is important to be clear that The Crown Estate has no rights over UK hydrocarbons, such as Shale Gas, which accrue to ‘the Crown’ but are vested in the Department for Energy and Climate Change. In this context we are no different to any other landowner. Having reviewed the questions posed in the inquiry, we have addressed only some of the specific questions with relevance to our role. We believe other organisations such as the Minerals Producers Association (MPA) and CBI Minerals Group are best placed to comment in other areas.&#xa0;

[[[  What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?]]]It is important at the outset to recognise the role and impact that terrestrial planning policy has on marine minerals. This is particularly true in areas where land based minerals are under local planning pressures which restricts supply, allowing marine minerals a greater market share. It is therefore very important to ensure that terrestrial planning policy specifically references consideration of marine minerals as way of maximising the potential of this indigenous resource.Whilst minerals guidance is set out under the National Planning Policy Framework, with local aggregates assessments undertaken by Local Authorities, consideration of other sources, such as marine minerals (which are outside of the spatial demarcation of a Local Authority) is needed as part of broader supply chain considerations. Clear policy guidance ensuring that marine minerals contribution continues, in the context of UK supply of minerals, this will maximise the overall benefit to the UK economy.A robust regulatory regime exists for marine aggregates, which is managed through the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) (England) and Natural Resources Wales (Wales).  There is currently no extraction in Scottish or Northern Irish waters. Operating businesses in this sector have a significant capital asset base to maintain, requiring security of mineral reserves, and it is important that the Marine Licence application procedure recognises the long term nature and scale of the associated investment profile without introducing an excessive burden on the industry.  The Crown Estate has introduced a procedure designed to optimise the use of the seabed whilst working within the guidelines introduced by the marine planning process that is currently being developed by the MMO. This procedure is also designed to provide a safeguarding protocol for key resources.The MPA recently commissioned a study to assess the contribution the mineral products sector (principally minerals extracted to supply the construction sector) makes to the UK economy and would be able to provide conclusions outlining the Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution the sector makes to the UK economy.Alongside the economic contribution minerals production makes to the UK, it is also important to recognise the need for a secure supply of minerals for the construction industry. Millions of tons of marine sand and gravel are used across the construction industry and for coastal management and land reclamation each year. The Crown Estate licenses nearly all marine seabed sand and gravel resources lying offshore around the UK; and has been licensing the activity for over 50 years. Extraction of about 20 million tonnes per annum of marine aggregates occurs off the coast of England and Wales.As set out in the Marine Policy Statement for the UK, marine mineral from UK seabed is viewed as a world class resource. It is an important source for security of supply and there is always the potential opportunity to export our dredged materials to other countries in Europe.As we adapt to climate change, large volumes of marine sand and gravels are used in beach replenishment schemes. Aggregates are pumped directly from dredgers onto beaches, providing coastal protection, enhancing the amenity value and providing security to the local economy, for example on the coast of Lincolnshire.In addition, marine sands are used in land reclamation schemes, infilling areas in ports and harbours to reclaim land from the sea. Recent examples of reclamation include the runway extension at Ronaldsway airport on The Isle of Man and the London Gateway port development. It is important to note here that sourcing of marine based minerals ensure that the schemes undertaken are economically viable and it is likely that without these vital resources, this would not be the case. Marine sourced mineral is unique in terms of the ability to import and place large quantities of mineral in a short space of time without the need for importation by road. The Crown Estate is also responsible for leasing extraction of minerals lying below the UK sea bed, including deposits of potash. Potash is a generic term for a variety of potassium bearing minerals; in particular it is Sylvinite that is currently mined in the UK. Around 90 per cent of UK potash is used in the production of fertiliser with the remainder being used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Approximately 60 per cent of all UK production is exported each year. The Boulby potash mine, situated on the North Yorkshire coast, is the UK's only commercial potash mine and the most important non-hydrocarbon mineral operation in Britain. The mine, which started production in 1973 and is currently managed by Cleveland Potash Ltd, employs around 1100 workers (another 200 workers have been recruited this year, some of which have come from closed coal mines). Mining operations extend around 8 km offshore and the mine is the second deepest in Europe (approximately 1km below sea level).Boulby mine produces in the order of 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) potash ore and refines this into 1mtpa potash mainly used in the fertiliser industry. Although the company produces enough potash to satisfy the UK demand, they supply about half of the UK market with the remainder being imported from overseas.  The rock salt also mined (in order to access the potash ore) is mostly sold to Local Authorities and the Highway Authorities (with production in the order of about 0.8 mtpa) as de-icing salt for roads. The Company contributes £225M per year of economic activity as measured by product sales.  They support many local small suppliers and service companies.  Half their sales are overseas with approximate foreign earnings of £100M per year.During 2011, York Potash signed an agreement with us for the rights to explore for polyhalite under the seabed to the south of Boulby and exploration is underway. York Potash has determined the existence of considerable reserves both under the land and under the seabed, and is in the process of carrying out research to support an application to North York Moors National Park for land based mining operations and associated surface workings.  A decision is expected in 2014. The MMO has already granted permission for the offshore element.

[[[  How do the UK-based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?]]]Whilst The Crown Estate has previously commissioned and published work related to the analysis of socio economic indicators of marine related activities in the UK economy (ISBN978-1-906410-01-8), the MPA have information available regarding the role the extractive industries more broadly play in supporting employment, as highlighted in our response to question 1. We estimate that there are approximately 3,000 people directly employed in the extraction and processing of marine minerals (marine aggregates and potash), with many more jobs involved indirectly through downstream and upstream activities.&#xa0;

[[[  Is there sufficient engagement between ]]]

[[[UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?]]]The Crown Estate has sought to further develop our relationships with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with respect to the activities that we lease and license. We feel that as our role has become more proactive in the development of our portfolios of activities and management of the estate, so too has the improvement in the relationship with relevant NGOs.The Crown Estate funds and supports the Seabed Users and Developers Group (SUDG). The SUDG is an informal grouping of industry sectors whose participants have a common interest in sustainable development within the UK’s marine environment. The Crown Estate works with SUDG to align seabed user groups across the UK to work positively with Government to prepare shared understanding and approaches to marine management. Organisations involved include sectors whose members require marine licenses for construction and operation include British Ports Association, United Kingdom Major Ports Association, British Marine Aggregates Producers Association (the minerals trade association), British Marine Federation, Oil &amp; Gas UK, Renewable Energy Association, Renewable UK, Subsea Cables UK and Carbon Capture and Storage Association. In October 2012, SUDG published a joint statement with the Marine Conservation Society, RSPB, The Wildlife Trusts and WWF to work collaboratively on marine conservation in relation to seabed uses. The SUDG positively engages with environmental NGOs through this forum.The Crown Estate also works very closely with BMAPA to develop best practice and enhance knowledge and understanding of the sector. We have commissioned studies in a number of areas, which have been published and placed in the public domain. An example of these joint initiatives is “The Area Involved” reports. These are published annually as a result of a March 1999 statement of intent between The Crown Estate and BMAPA committing to reviewing all dredging licences over a rolling five year period. Included was a commitment to surrender areas no longer containing useful resources of sand and gravel and to publish an annual report detailing the extent of dredging within the licensed areas. This year’s report which is to be published shortly is the 15th in the on-going series, and has drawn widespread acknowledgement for the level of information and transparency provided.Another example of work undertaken to highlight the sustainable credentials of the marine aggregates sector is our involvement in developing an industry protocol for the reporting of marine archaeology, and we provide annual analysis of the area of seabed affected by marine mineral extraction. Much of this information is available through our web site (http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/energy-infrastructure/research/).In many of these areas the marine aggregates sector is acknowledged as being a leader amongst the extractive industries and as a consequence recognises a significantly improved relationship with many NGOs.&#xa0;

[[[ What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?]]]The competitive landscape for the UK building materials industry has altered over the last decade following the acquisition of UK companies by global organisations for whom cement production is a core activity (e.g. – purchase of Hanson by Heidelberg Cement, RMC by Cemex, and Aggregate Industries by Holcim).&#xa0;This industry wide consolidation has led to greater integration of UK and European suppliers and competition for available capital investment. &#xa0;The low value of some minerals (e.g. aggregates) means that local markets remain a feature for most suppliers that do not have the ability to take advantage of rail or sea logistics. Marine minerals are in a position to take advantage of cross border trade, with around a third of marine aggregates and half of potash supplies being exported.We trust that you will find these comments helpful and constructive. We would be very willing to provide additional information on any of the points we have raised above and be very pleased to discuss these matters with you further. Through the Energy &amp; Infrastructure’s Minerals &amp; Infrastructure team, we are ready to engage in further discussions on these and other points relevant to our ownership or which our expertise may be brought to bear. All of this response may be put into the public domain and there is no part of it that should be treated as confidential.&#xa0;
