[[[Background]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; StreetGames is the national charity dedicated to developing sport in areas of high deprivation.  We specialise in bringing the benefits of sport to disadvantaged young people aged 14-25. 1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To effectively engage young women we run the Us Girls programme (which was originally lottery funded with a £2.3m award towards a project value of £3.9m). The Us Girls programme is the product of a successful bidding consortium that was made up of 60 organisations: together we secured the largest ever investment in disadvantaged young women. Us Girls won the National Lottery Award for Best Sport project 2013. http://youtu.be/Bl9X8Zf3jaE. Winners were selected by public vote.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our evidence focuses on the Us Girls’ target group: disadvantaged young women.  We are keen to ensure that this Inquiry considers how vitally important it is to provide these young women with sport and fitness opportunities in their local communities in a style that is attractive to them. Our Submission to the Inquiry includes learning and information from examples of work in the Us Girls programme that have been successful in engaging young women in sport.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The most recent data from Sport England’s Active People Survey 7 data shows that 49% of females aged 16-25 years from the 20% highest socio-economic groups take part in sport at least once a week while only 36% do so from the 20% lowest socio-economic groups.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Us Girls promotes ‘doorstep sport’ as a means of engaging disadvantaged young women – doorstep sport is sport delivered in deprived areas at ‘the right time, right place, right price and in the right style’ to attract females. Over the last two years Us Girls has engaged more than 34,481 young women (aged 16-25) in sport and an additional 8,800 under 16s/over 25s. Around 40% of the girls were not doing any sport or fitness before joining the Us Girls programme1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Around 80 neighbourhood projects make up the Us Girls network – these are locally owned, locally controlled and enjoy an enviable reach into disadvantaged communities. Our strapline is

[[[sport, for both girls and women ]]]

[[[at grassroots level]]]1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Young women who have limited or no previous sporting experience are unlikely to visit traditional sport settings/venues. Therefore, 

[[[providing activity in non-traditional sports ]]]

[[[venues]]] in the local community is likely to be more attractive to them.1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The environment must be inviting and safe and young women should able to exercise in comfort and at ease. Some women, often those from BME backgrounds prefer/must exercise in a 

[[[female exclusive ]]]

[[[environment]]]. This means an area with no male access or viewing, where windows and doors are closed off to the general public, participants and staff are all female. This is sometimes a challenge. 1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Having 

[[[clear, obvious signage]]] in the facilities so that women know exactly where to go when they arrive and ensuring that staff are welcoming and are informed of the session that is taking place are key to ensuring a positive participant experience. 1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Us Girls sessions are delivered in a variety of local community venues including both traditional and non-traditional sports facilities. The emphasis is on using local and familiar provision which is important to enable access and engage local people. The most popular types of facility used for sessions are indoor facilities. Only 14% of Us Girls sessions that took place over the last two years were at outdoor venues. Research and feedback from participants suggests that females from this age group and demographic prefer to be active indoors (whatever the weather). 1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Us Girls projects have encountered some challenges in gaining access to school sites and/or with facilities being too costly.&#xa0;

[[[Finance, including sponsorship and prize money]]]1.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For many young women, cost is one of the main barriers to participating in sport and physical activity. A lack of cash can have a significant influence on whether or not a young woman is active. For young women from disadvantaged communities, cost is a real barrier to participation in sport and physical activity. There is therefore a need for subsidised female targeted sports programmes to address the barrier of cost.By making sport and physical activity cheaper to do (with the help of subsidised female targeted programmes) and flexible payment options (pay and play activities are important), young women are more likely to take part.1.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Us Girls programme has uncovered many entrepreneurial females who have set up their own community interest companies/charities/businesses to deliver women and girls sports activities. More support for these types of women in the form of financial help, expert advice, grants and mentoring schemes would go a long way to strengthen the female workforce providing, facilitating and advocating women’s sport.&#xa0;

[[[Media coverage]]]

[[[ ]]]1.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It has long been acknowledged that there is significantly less media coverage of female sport. There are only a handful of sports journalists who are truly championing women in sport and the need to raise their profile, most notably Ashling O’Connor (The Times), Tanya Aldred (Telegraph / Guardian) and Shelley Alexander and Jessica Creighton (BBC). Our experience has shown that we have had to work hard to get national media coverage for Us Girls related work but the appointment of positions such as Shelley Alexander’s at the BBC is welcomed.1.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst national media interest has increased in last 12 months, in our experience the opportunities available to Us Girls in the media are restricted to women’s sections of the nationals, women’s lifestyle media and sports trade, in particular SportSister. The appetite for Us Girls related work within the mainstream national sports pages has been limited.  1.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The media interest in the programme is significantly higher when a high profile ambassador is involved. When Nicola Adams attended our 2 year Anniversary Celebration Event at the House of Commons in July, we were able to secure the attendance of national journalists and coverage in The Telegraph Women. Media were also interested in hearing our story and achievements, when Victoria Pendleton presented us with the Us Girls National Lottery Award win in August.  1.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Us Girls projects generally have had good media coverage locally but this varies by area. Local project managers often do not have the skills/know how to publicise the great work they are doing, therefore any additional support to help raise the profile of women and girls sporting activity locally would be welcomed.

[[[Reasons why participation in sport by women decreases]]]1.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; StreetGames has recently commissioned research work related to the concept of sporting capital, which is analogous to the theory of human capital and defined as the stock of physical, social and psychological attributes and competencies that support and motivate an individual to participate in sport and to sustain that participation over time'. The study investigated the relationship between an individual’s sporting capital (made up of 3 domains - social, physical and psychological) and the likelihood of participating in sport using data from Sport England APS6 survey. 1.19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The research indicated a clear relationship between sporting capital and the probability of participating in sport - so individuals with a high SC score were much likely to be participating than those with a low score. The research also highlighted structural inequalities - for example on average males had much higher scores than females as did those from higher socio- economic groups. In particular - women scored much lower than men in the psychological domain and questions relating to body confidence. Therefore, interventions aimed at engaging females are much more likely to succeed if they include elements aimed at raising confidence, self-esteem and body image as well as tacking physical barriers.1.20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As well as psychological barriers relating to participation in sport, traditional structures have made it hard for even the interested and motivated young woman living in a disadvantaged area to make their own way in sport. This is because the traditional sporting structures are often ‘out of reach’: &#xa0;1.21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Us Girls programme has shown that (non sporty) young women want sport that is less formal, relaxed and is based on friendship groups and fun. 1.22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The evidence and experience from the Us Girls programme suggests that increases in participation are possible through focused resources and efforts. Young women from disadvantaged communities generally need subsidised sporting activities that are delivered on their doorstep in a style that is:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; female only-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; focused on fun, fitness and building confidence-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; relaxed-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; convenient-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; safe, inclusive &amp; non-threatening-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; informal &amp; welcoming-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; sociable &amp; non pressured-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; includes a variety of activities to try-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; includes music-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; incentives and rewards-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; delivered by the right coach/leader-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; include links to health &amp; wellbeing activities.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.23&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Often sports sessions are not delivered in the style described above and therefore aren’t always attractive to the (non sporty/semi sporty) female market.1.24&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some quotes from Us Girls Participants showing why they like the sessions include: “I like the sessions because they are fun - we can play our own music and the workout is just girls” “There are a wide range of sporting activities that I enjoy taking part in and it opens my mind about different sports…. It’s comfortable, friendly and cheap, and it’s in a not-intimidating”.&#xa0;

[[[The variety of spo]]]

[[[rts on offer to girls at school]]]1.25&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Survey results from a recent StreetGames study with a sample of 14-16 year old girls from areas of high deprivation highlighted a number of key frustrations relating to taking part in sport at school. The girls in the study felt that:&#xa0;1.26&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The sports that the girls took part in most at school were team sports and individual sports, however when asked to select their favourite sports, and sports they would like to do in the future, sports such as swimming, gym, dance, classes and trampolining were ranked highest. For many, these sports are not on offer at school.1.27&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Engaging in sport outside of school was preferred as it was felt they had freedom to choose what they wanted to do, could take exercise more ‘seriously’, and would be more likely to have a coach who could ‘guide’ and ‘push’ them.1.28&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Previous experiences of sexism or not being taken seriously when taking part in sport inside and outside of school impacts upon the female samples’ perception of sport.1.29&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to ‘too much school work’ being a key barrier for girls to participate in sport, girls also selected barriers such as ‘not confident enough to take part’, ‘I don’t think I’m sporty’, and ‘no one to go with’. There is also a desire for single sex sessions. Key motivators to taking part in sport are being fit and healthy, having fun experiences, and improving performance.1.30&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is important that in order to engage girls, sport sessions at school are developed and promoted in a way that offers them choice in what they can do, but is within the selections of sports they would be interested in doing. It is important to allow for an environment where girls feel supported and motivated to learn new skills and challenge themselves – so that they feel the sessions are focused, and that they will have the opportunity to improve in a fun, secure environment.

This helped to grow the number of organisations delivering good sport for young women as part of Us Girls and helped us to sign up a number of ‘Us Girls Champions’ from Team GB to support this effort. This includes Nicola Adams - Us Girls President, Sophie Cox (GB Judo), Sarah Stevenson (GB Taekwondo) and Kate Grey (Paralympic swimmer and commentator), plus several others (see Us Girls website for more details).1.34&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst we have seen an increase in interest and activity since the Games, there is still a need for direct action and support in local areas to garner the enthusiasm of major sporting events in order to develop participation legacies.&#xa0;

[[[How StreetGames increase]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ female sports participation by providing activities that are delivered in an appropriate and effective way]]]1.35&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our successful track record helped StreetGames to secure a £3.38 million National Lottery award from Sport England in 2013 to set up over 300 Doorstep Sport Clubs (DSCs) in disadvantaged communities by March 2014.  1.36&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The initiative, which forms part of a wider DCMS/Sport England youth sport strategy aims to reduce the drop out in sport and help disadvantaged young people to develop a sporting habit for life. Our target is for 30% of the young people participating in the DSC programme to be female. We will use the Us Girls branding, the insight gained and the lessons learned from the Us Girls programme to help us achieve this target.1.37&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We will do this by providing a fun, exciting and vibrant place where teenage girls and young women play sports, at a low cost, right on their doorstep in a style that is attractive to them. Young women will be able to take part in a range of sports, which will include dance and fitness, non-traditional sports and adapted versions of games as well as more traditional sports. They will also be given the opportunity to take part in local sports festivals, get involved in volunteering, leadership or training should they wish to do so.  1.38&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; StreetGames will also support DSCs to create a vibrant and varied sporting offer all year round to encourage attendance and retention, e.g. via incentives, competitions, group trips, events and links to health and wellbeing activities.  1.39&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are confident that DSCs will attract thousands of young women to participate in sport – but are realistic: alone, this initiative cannot re-dress the current gender disparities that exist.  We are therefore, working with other partners in the women’s sport network to do this. This includes Women’s Sport Trust, Women’s Sport Net, WSFF, Sportsister and other influential females that champion women’s sport including journalists, presenters, business women and athletes.1.40&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many NGB programmes are not particularly geared towards the female market. We are working with NGBs to share the learning from the Us Girls programme but much more needs to be done. England Netball is a fantastic example of an NGB that has used research and insight to develop a participant centred approach to provide products and programmes that women want. There is a lot to be learnt from the success of netball in engaging a large number of females in sport.1.41&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Much more needs to be done and would welcome lobbying and support to drive this further.  We believe, that the industry has the ‘know how’ – it just needs resources to ‘turbo charge’ action.

[[[Us Girls Initiatives &amp; Programmes]]]1.42&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Us Girls has developed a number of initiatives and programmes to help achieve its aims and objectives:Our female only festival programme. Us Girls Rocks festivals give girls aged 14+ the opportunity to try traditional and non-traditional sports, along with a combination of other activities such as health and wellbeing information and beauty treatments. The festivals are fun, non-threatening and are held at a local and regional level. Gear4Girls is a new initiative which aims to raise money to supply sports equipment and clothing to young women and girls from disadvantage communities, people who want to get active but don’t have any gear!  As well as raising funds, a host of NGBs are donating equipment to the initiative which can then be distributed to where it’s needed. Us Girls launched its Gear4Girls Campaign on International Women’s Day, headed up by our president Nicola Adams.#GirlsTimeToMakeItHappen is a campaign to develop more opportunities for young women to take part in sport. We are keen to develop and grow the number of organisations delivering good sport for young women. We have also signed up Us Girls Champions from Team GB to support this effort. Nicola Adams has been signed up as Us Girls President. Other Us Girls Champions include Sophie Cox (GB Judo), Sarah Stevenson (GB Taekwondo) &amp; Kate Grey (Paralympic swimmer &amp; commentator), plus several others (see website for more details). Us Girls Alive, is a new strand of the existing Us Girls programme and supports young female volunteers to assist in the development of Us Girls Alive clubs (like an interactive magazine) and the signposting to local physical activity programmes across the country until September 2015. With £395,839 in funding from the Health and Social Care Volunteering Fund from the Department of Health, Us Girls Alive promotes volunteering as the key to health improvements for young women living in disadvantaged communities in 19 areas in England.

[[[Us Girls Tools &amp; Resources]]]1.43&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have also produced a number of tools and resources aimed to help projects and partners to increase and retain young women in sport. These include:

[[[&#xa0;]]]September 2013&#xa0;  Study undertaken by Diva Creative between Jan-April 2013 including an on-line survey with 360 young people and 6 focus groups with 14-16 year olds in areas of high deprivation.&#xa0;
