default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUK Green Building Coun
defaultcil (UK-GBC) is an independent, 
defaultmem
defaultbership-based
default 
defaultcharity
default committed to radically improving the sustainabil
defaultity of the built environment by 
defaulttransforming the way it is planned, designed, constr
defaultucted, maintained and operated. We have around 400 members from across the property and construction sector, including house builders, local authorities, Registered Providers and product manufacturers. UK-GBC was on the steering group for the Housing Standards Review technical committee.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is UK-GBC’s view that the time was right for a review and rationalisation of 
defaultthe current range of voluntary standards applied to new homes. 
defaultHowever, we have always maintained that the changes must support deliver

defaulthigh quality sustainability homes 
defaultthat are 
defaultfit for the future. W
defaultith the demise of the CSH and 
defaultomissions 
defaultin the Housing Standards Review consultation 
defaultaround issues like materials, we risk losing a momentum that has transformed the way homes have been built over the last seven years.

defaultUK-GBC 
defaultagrees 
defaultthat where appropriate, standards should be brought into Building Regulations
default. However, we believe that this process should happen
default as soon as possible, and we do not believe that th
defaulte government's self imposed 'o
defaultne in two out' rule is a valid excuse to delay action.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the key functions of the CSH was to set out the direction of travel for Building Regulations. In our view it has been helpful to have a sense of what best practice looks like that developers can and should aspire to, and in the absence of the CSH the onus will be on the industry to drive innovation and best practice. Some developers have embraced sustainability and are innovating and achieving impressive sustainability standards. For them, there are elements of the CSH that were deeply frustrating, because inevitably the CSH is prescriptive. However, the industry has a ‘long tail’, with many companies who are either not interested in sustainability, or not able to carry out the necessary research and development to innovate. We need a new kind of 
defaultsustainability framework which allows the leaders to keep pushing the boundaries, but also provides the guidance and drivers to act for the rest of the industry. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that suitable transitional arrangements must be put into place, and where 
defaultLocal Planning Authorities (
defaultLPAs
default)
default already have higher standards in place 
defaultwhich have been tested through due process and accepted as viable, 
defaultthey should be allowed to keep those higher requirements until the new regulations take over (e
default.
defaultg
default.
default Part L 2016). There is no sense in weakening requirements which are
default already
default being met, only to raise them again in 2-3 years.  
default&#xa0;defaultComments on specific issues:default&#xa0;
default3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnergydefault3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe strongly support the zero carbon 2016/2019 policies, and we agree that fabric energy efficiency standards are the domain of national standards and so we broadly support the approach outlined in the consultation document. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, t
defaulthere is always going to be an interplay between building regulations and planning on energy issues. Building regulations should take care of fabric efficiency, onsite carbon compliance and Allowable Solutions, but plann
defaulters
default should have input into the renewable energy strategy for the development. We agree that the rather blunt 'Merton rule' approach, whereby a percentage of renewable energy is required, is 
defaultusually not the right approach. However, we agree that where viable, 
defaultL
defaultP
defaultAs should be able to require developers to link up to
default low carbon or
default 
defaultrenewable energy 
defaultschemes where they exist,
default or will exist in the future,
default as part of a borough wide plan for low carbon and renewable energy.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthere are 
defaultenergy related issues
default 
defaultwhich are currently in the CSH, but not 
defaultin the proposed new standards. These include:
default&#xa0;
default3.3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDrying space – this is a key element to provide healthy internal environments in the context of increasing air tightness. The Code requires clothes drying provision within the bathroom and the space be mechanically ventilated 
defaultwith a humidistat control. This issue should be taken account of in 
defaultBuilding Regulations Part F.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnergy efficient white goods
default. Our 
defaultmembers’ 
defaultexperience is that the Code does 
defaultimpact on 
defaultthe 
defaultefficiency of the 
defaultwhite goods which are installed in dwellings.
default Low efficiency white goods are, unfortunately, still available
default.
default There is a role for tighter product regulation here.
default&#xa0;default4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndoordefault Environmental Standardsdefault4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe agree with the Challenge Panel's assertion that standards for daylight, sunlight and ventilation should be more thoroughly investigated.
default 
defaultDaylighting, sunlight and ventilation are all intertwined and must be considered as a whole. The tools for assessing these matters should also be reviewed. 
default 
default&#xa0;default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLinked to the above, the issue of overheating is a real concern as new homes become more airtight. The government’s response to the issue has so far been inadequate, despite the fact that private sector guidance exists on this issue - for example
default CIBSE Guide TM52 sets overheating standards. 
defaultUK-GBC believes that 
defaultSAP should
default be improved to better
default address this issue as a matter of urgency
default – as recommended by the Zero Carbon Hub
default 3 years ago.
default&#xa0;
default5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWaterdefault5.1default&#xa0; 
defaultSince the upper standard of 105 l/p/d + 5l external use is achievable at no/minimal extra cost, we think this should be the baseline standard for all new homes. Our members are meeting this standard on new homes as a matter of course, at no extra cost.
default Code level 5 (80 l/p/d) is usually not viable, apart from in exceptional circumstances. 
defaultIn future there could be scope for 'allowable solutions' type approaches for water, but that approach would need to be developed at a national level.
default&#xa0;default6.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMaterialsdefault6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe st
defaultrongly disagree with leaving considerations about m
defaultaterials to the market
default. While we recognise that EU policy is beginning to address these issues through standards like CEN TC350, we still feel that there’s a need for national driver to encourage the procurement of healthier and more sustainable construction materials
default. This is perhaps the biggest omission in the proposed new Housing Standards.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIssue
defaults such as
default responsible sourcing, toxicity, Ozone depleting potential, and off-gassing of materials in air-tight homes should be addressed as a matter of urgency through new guidance and
default through Building R
defaultegulation
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe HSR process was 
defaultinadequate when it came to considering materi
defaultals. 
defaultA materials expert group should be set up as soon as possible to advise on this matter and where best in the regulations these issues should be addressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther issuesdefault&#xa0;default7.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEcologydefault7.1default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is not clear from the consultation document what the proposals are for dealing with the ecology credits from the CSH. Indeed, the issue of ecology is not mentioned at all. We think the CSH has spurred developers into thinking more about ecology at the design stage, and would not want to see its importance downgraded with the demise of the CSH. We agree that ecology is a planning issue, and we think the government should make clear that in the absence of the CSH, all LPAs should have clear policies for improving the ecological value of land through development, as part of their local plan
