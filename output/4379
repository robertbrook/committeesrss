[normal]Written evidence from Ian Price (WRT 042)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sir for many years I have been involved in Motorsport and I am an RAC MSA Technical Official so I do understand Tyres.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Three Saturdays past I was driving near Tottington at 17-30 ish when we had a short sharp rain and hail shower. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The road became 
[normal]covered in ice (hail) and I slowed my 3 month old car to around 15 mph.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On a very slight curve the car lost all traction and started to slide / spin , this with a driver who has bee involved with events such as The Monte Carlo and 1000 Lakes Rally's. Snow
[normal] and ice driving is not an issue to 
[normal]me ,
[normal] but even I could not stop it. Luckily no collision of any kind happened.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What it did however was to lead me to investigate the O.E.M. tyres fitted to the car and others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the main manufacturers 
[normal]( car
[normal] and tyre) s
[normal]eem to focus on mpg,noise,and good wear miles. Non of which gives good 
[normal]grip !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Indeed the tyres fitted to my car and almost all the others I looked at were described by the tyre makers as 'SUMMER' 
[normal]tyres !
[normal] With many suggesting for 'Winter' you should fit 'W
[normal]inter' or 'All Weather / Season' tyres as the 'Summer' tyres performance falls off so sharply to a dangerous extent ( as I had found) in 'Winter' weather !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are many many graphs and tests that clearly demonstrate this on the internet. However in many
[normal] European countries it is not an issue because '
[normal]Winter
[normal] ' tyres are a legal requirement so the issue never arises. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Here we neither have that legislation or a real understanding of seasonal tyre construction, hence the very real danger all road users are i
[normal]n from these totally inappropriate / dangerous 
[normal]tyres !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I wonder how many people will die this winter in accidents that would not have happened had the car been fitted with the correct 
[normal]tyre ?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do car manufacturers ( who all recognize the need for 'Wint
[normal]er' tyres and try to sell them at around Â£1000 a set !) get away with selling cars on tyres that are in reality only 'safe' and 'fit for purpose' in the spring/summer/autumn months and in 'Winter' are as much use as a handbrake on a canoe ! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Should they n
[normal]ot fit 'All Weather' tyres that are safe 365 days of the 
[normal]year ,whatever
[normal] the weather !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I do hope you will see and understand the need for strong urgent action to challenge this extremely serious safety issue.
