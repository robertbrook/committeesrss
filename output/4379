defaultWritten evidence from Ian Price (WRT 042)
default&#xa0;
defaultSir for many years I have been involved in Motorsport and I am an RAC MSA Technical Official so I do understand Tyres.
default&#xa0;
defaultThree Saturdays past I was driving near Tottington at 17-30 ish when we had a short sharp rain and hail shower. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe road became 
defaultcovered in ice (hail) and I slowed my 3 month old car to around 15 mph.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn a very slight curve the car lost all traction and started to slide / spin , this with a driver who has bee involved with events such as The Monte Carlo and 1000 Lakes Rally's. Snow
default and ice driving is not an issue to 
defaultme ,
default but even I could not stop it. Luckily no collision of any kind happened.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat it did however was to lead me to investigate the O.E.M. tyres fitted to the car and others.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the main manufacturers 
default( car
default and tyre) s
defaulteem to focus on mpg,noise,and good wear miles. Non of which gives good 
defaultgrip !
default&#xa0;
defaultIndeed the tyres fitted to my car and almost all the others I looked at were described by the tyre makers as 'SUMMER' 
defaulttyres !
default With many suggesting for 'Winter' you should fit 'W
defaultinter' or 'All Weather / Season' tyres as the 'Summer' tyres performance falls off so sharply to a dangerous extent ( as I had found) in 'Winter' weather !
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are many many graphs and tests that clearly demonstrate this on the internet. However in many
default European countries it is not an issue because '
defaultWinter
default ' tyres are a legal requirement so the issue never arises. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHere we neither have that legislation or a real understanding of seasonal tyre construction, hence the very real danger all road users are i
defaultn from these totally inappropriate / dangerous 
defaulttyres !
default&#xa0;
defaultI wonder how many people will die this winter in accidents that would not have happened had the car been fitted with the correct 
defaulttyre ?
default&#xa0;
defaultHow do car manufacturers ( who all recognize the need for 'Wint
defaulter' tyres and try to sell them at around Â£1000 a set !) get away with selling cars on tyres that are in reality only 'safe' and 'fit for purpose' in the spring/summer/autumn months and in 'Winter' are as much use as a handbrake on a canoe ! 
default&#xa0;
defaultShould they n
defaultot fit 'All Weather' tyres that are safe 365 days of the 
defaultyear ,whatever
default the weather !
default&#xa0;
defaultI do hope you will see and understand the need for strong urgent action to challenge this extremely serious safety issue.
