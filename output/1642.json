"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the University of Cambridge (WSC034)Section 1: Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\nThere are many scholarly articles which address the issue of retention of women in scientific \nAcademia\n,\n,\n and further details can be found in these references. \n&#xa0;\nA summary of \nthe most commonly cite\nd\n reasons include:\n&#xa0;Culture\nImpact of caring responsibilities\nCareer development\n \n&#xa0;Section 2: When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their \nskills in different employment sectors?\n \n&#xa0;\nVitae\n, the national career development organisation for researchers, have\n published a series of reports on ‘What do Researcher\ns\n do?’\n \n \nbased on LDL\nH\nE \n(Longitudinal Destinations of Leavers in Higher Education) \ncohorts, as well as labour market information for doctoral researchers\n,\n \nbut a\n longer follow on\n for LDL\nH\nE \n (&gt;3 years post PhD), \nlarger cohorts\n \nand additional case studies would be useful.\nSystematic recording and monitoring \nof career destinations (particula\nrly of \nPhD students and \npostdoctoral researchers) is being implemented by \nsome\n departments in Cambridge as part of Athena SWAN submissions.\n This could be co-ordinated at a national level to permit more in-depth statistical analyses and identification of trends.\nThe investment in women’s training may be lost if routes are not found to enable them to re-enter the workforce after career breaks. \nMany take jobs which do not use their skills because this is all they can find.\nThe University is currently investigating the use of exit interviews/surveys to capture important information on reasons for leaving as well as destination data, particularly f\nor research staff.\n&#xa0;Section 3: \nWhat should univer\nsities and the higher education s\nector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;Universities must recognise that d\nifferent actions \nmay be \nneeded \nto address the specific issues identified at different career stages.  Many of the challenges highlighted in \nS\nection 1 \nof this document \nare\n addressed \nwithin universities \nunder \n5\n main themes\n below\n.\n Examples of initiatives \nunderway \nat the University o\nf Cambridge are \nreported\n.\n&#xa0;\nFamily considerations\n, particularly caring for young children, can often coincide with a critical stage for academic career development and is a key challenge for women as primary carers.  A lack of flexible working provision, long hours culture and difficulty in achieving a b\nalance between home/family and working lives can lead to many women leaving academic altogether.  \nThe \nUniversity of Cambridge\n has \nintroduced \na number of measures\n to support staff,\n \nparticularly women, \nincluding:\n&#xa0;\nInstitutions must ensure that women receive equal and respectful treatment in the workplace, particularly in disciplines where there is a majority of men and/or a culture that disadvantages women\n.\nThe University of Cambridge \nis implementing \na numb\ner of measures\n to reflect an inclusive and gender aware culture,\n including:\n&#xa0;\nThe provision of visible role models and development opportunities for women\n can help promote careers in academia.\nThe University of Cambridge has \nadopted \na number of measures\n to enable the personal and professional development of women \nstaff, including\n:\n&#xa0;\nIn order to achieve gender equality to is important to engage both men and women in the agenda, so that challenges are not seen as women’s issues and can be \naddressed by both sexes.\nThe University of Cambridge delivers \nannually \na \nwide ranging \nseries of \nengagement \nworkshops and seminars around relevant topics\n;\n for example \nthe myth of \nmeritocracy and unconscious bias\n,\n targeted at different groups of staff as well as mixed audiences\nIt is vital that institutions and individuals address sectoral\n and professional responsibilities in promoting science beyond their local environment.\nThe University of Cambridge \ncontributes\n to this important aspect of promoting women in the sciences\n in a number of ways\n,\n including:\nSection 4: What \nrole should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;For \nexample:\n2.
