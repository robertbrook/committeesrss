However\n,\n progress towards \nfull scale demonstration appears \nto be falling behind schedule\n.\n4.\n              \nDeploying CCS on a large\n scale\n will require \npolicy certainty \nthrough a combination of \ncarbon pricing, direct financial support \nfor research and development (particularly for more advanced capture technologies for gas and biomass power plants and for industrial applications)\n, manag\ning\n risk and liabil\nity, \nand appropriate regulation, \nsuch as \nmandatory \nrequirements for power plan\nts.\n5.\n              \nOverall,\n we support the view \nif the International Energy Agency \nthat CCS will be a critical component in a \nglobal \nportfolio of \nlow-\ncarbon energy technologies by \n2050\n.

Captured \ncarbon dioxide \nis then transported to se\nlected site\ns \nfor permanent storage. The three major stages involved in CCS technology are: a) \nc\napture; b) \nt\nransport; and c) \ns\ntorage\n.\n10.\n              \nCapture \nis the\n separation of \ncarbon dioxide\n from other gases produced at large industrial process facilities\n,\n \nsuch as \n(but not limited to) \ncoal and natural gas power plants, oil\n refineries, natural \ngas \nprocessing \nplants, steel mills and cement plants. Currently \nthis can be achieved with three alternative technologies\n: \np\nost-combustion; \np\nre-combustion\n, and\n \no\nxy-\ncombustion\n \n(\nf\nor further details see: \nFlorin &amp; Fennel, 2010\n; MacDowell et al.\n,\n \n2010\n)\n.\n11.\n              \nTransport\n \nis\n \nthe transfer\n \nof the \ncaptured \ncarbon dioxide\n \nfrom the CCS plant \nto a selected storage site\n, which \nmay\n \nbe located several miles apart\n. \nTransport can take place\n \nvia pipelines, either \no\nnshore \n(\nusing \na well-established technology \nalready developed\n \nfor enhanced oil recovery) or offshore (currently \nthe subject\n \nof further research); or\n \nvia \nshipping \n(\nbuilding on experience \nfrom the transport of\n \nliquefied natural gas\n)\n.\n1\n2.\n              \nStorage\n is the\n permanent \nsequestration of \ncarbon dioxide \naway from the atmosphere. \nCarbon dioxide \nis injected into porous rock, either aquifers containing salty water or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. \nIn the UK, storage capacity in oil and gas fields \ncould range from 7.4 to 9.\n9 \nbillion tonnes of carbon dioxide. T\nhe storage \npotential\n of saline fields is more uncertain, and could \nrange from\n 6.3 to 62.7 \nbillion tonnes of carbon dioxide\n (for f\nurther details \nsee:\n Blunt\n, \n2010\n; Senior CCS Solutions Ltd, 2010\n)\n.\n13.\n              \nCurrently there are about \n20\n CCS projects in operation\n across the world\n, \nof which only\n one is in Europe (the Sn\nø\nhvit capture and storage project in Norway). \nOnly eight of these projects\n have been developed at \nfull \ncommercial scale\n (EC, 2013)\n.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n              \nAn a\nnalysis by \nthe UK Energy Research Centre \n(2013) \nof\n \nlow-carbon \nelectricity\n potential review\ned\n \nnine \ndifferent scenarios \nwhich have been \ndeveloped by \na number of\n institutions (\ninclu\nding\n the Committee on Climate Change, \nthe Department of Energy and Climate Change \nand \nthe UK Energy Research Centre)\n \nto\n model\n \nways of meeting\n the UK \n2050 \ndecarbonisation \ntarget\n set out in the Climate Change Act 2008\n. \nThese scenarios \nvary greatly in terms\n of \nthe development of electricity generation capacity using CCS\n. Coal CCS \nranges\n from 0 to 38 \ngigawatts (GW)\n, gas CCS \nranges \nfrom 0 to 2.3 GW, co-\nfiring \nis \nup to 51 GW\n,\n and biomass CCS \nis \nup to 5 GW.\n Wh\nile the\n combination of CCS sources (gas, coal, co-fir\ning or biomass) varies \nsignificantly \nbetween\n scenario\ns\n, all \nof them \ninclude at least some CCS \ncapacity\n. \nThe scenario with the lowest CCS capacity\n \nestimates at least 12 GW will be in operation by 2050. The \nscenario with the \nhighest \ncapacity \nenvisages up to \n57 GW.\n Overall, CCS is expected to \nmeet \nbetween 12 \nand \n37 per cent of total electricity demand in 2050.\n15.\n              \nNevertheless, considerable work remains to demonstrate CCS at large scale and across \nall of its stages\n,\n both for power generation and for \napplication to \nother industrial sectors.\n \nW\nidespread deployment is unlikely \nbefore \n2020\n,\n \nb\ny \nwhich time capacity could\n range between 1.5 \nand\n \n5\n.0\n GW (LCICG, 2012)\n.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n              \nAccording to the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG, 2012)\n, the areas of\n innovation\n \nwhich could provide\n the biggest \npotential \nbenefit\ns\n to t\nhe UK are (i) deep sea storage \nand\n related monitoring;\n and (ii) advanced capture development (especially gas and biomass) and demonstration of integrated conversion-capture. There is also a case for broad support for leading ideas with \n‘\nbreakthrough\n’\n \npotential\n, such a\ns\n novel capture or com\npression concepts.\n17.\n              \nCCS development in the UK\n could be worth \nbetween \n4\n per cent and \n6 per cent\n share of the global CCS\n market\n,\n with potential cumulative gross \nadded value\n of b\netween £150\n billion\n \nand\n \n£\n750\n billion\n \nup to 2050, contributing \nbetween\n £3 \nbilli\non and\n \n£\n16\n billion\n to UK GDP \n(LCICG, 2012)\n.\n18.\n              \nInnovation \nalso \nhas \nthe potential to drive down the costs (\nexcluding\n fuel) of conversion with capture by \n15 per cent\n by 2025 and 40 per cent\n by 2050\n, \nand to \nreduce the long-run costs of trans\nport by around 50\n per cent\n and of storage by more than \n50 per cent\n. \nOverall, \ninnovation could reduce the costs to the UK of CCS deployment by \nbetween \n£10\n billion and £\n45\n billion up\nto 2050\n, and lead to \nmore than \n£100\n billion in\n systems savings\n, \nby reducing the need f\nor more\n expensive alternatives\n \n(LCICG, 2012)\n.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n              \nA number of obstacles currently hamper the\n scaling up of CCS. These are mostly associated \nwith the\n \neconomic costs of CCS and related research and development, liability issues associated with storage, policy uncertainty and public and political perception\ns\n.\n20.\n              \nCosts. \nA fundamental barrier to CCS \ndeployment is cost. Carbon dioxide capture\n \nis the most expensive phase\n, regardless of the process used\n (see \nFigure\n \n1)\n. \nFor\n state of the art technology, costs\n currently\n \nrange from £1.1 million per \nmegawatt\n \nto\n \n£3.6 million per \nmegawatt\n, with gas CCS at the l\now end, and biomass applications at the high end (LCICG, 2012)\n. C\nosts are generally high in the early stages of a new technology\n, and\n CCS is no different\n, b\nut they could \ndecrease with f\nurther development and refinement of existing technologies and \ninnovative breakthroughs\n. S\no far\n, however,\n the carbon price \nin the European Union Emissions Trading System \nhas been too low to stimulate \nsufficient \ninvestment in research\n,\n development and deployment.\nFigure 1. Estimated current costs of CCS per tonne of carbon dioxide&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSource: Costs of capture based on \nIEA (2012b); costs of storage and transportation \nbased \non \nZEP (\n2011)\n.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n              \nPolicy uncertainty and investors’ confidence. \nW\nhile w\ne welcome the progress that the Government is mak\ning, \nas \nset out in its CCS road\nmap\n (DECC, 2012), \nwe are concerned that, following the collapse of the Longannett  project, progress towards a fir\nst demonstration plant appears \nto be behind\n schedule\n. \nCurrently there are no commercial scale projects which\n can provide\n financiers \nwith \nconfidence in the CCS business model (CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce, 2013). Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty about CCS policy objectives and potential\nly unintended consequences from the interaction of different policies (for example, policy that accelerates CCS deployment could lower the price of carbon allowances in the \nEuropean Union Emissions Trading System (\nEU ETS). The level of financial and politi\ncal support for CCS in the medium to long term is also unclear.  Lack of clarity regarding safety regulations and liability issues, as well as national and international storage and transportation, also adds uncertainty to future investment decisions.\n \n22.\n              \nLiability issues. \nC\nommercial \nand technical \nliabilities associated \nwith \nthe \nCCS value chain\n create \nlarge \nrisk\ns\n for the storage providers\n. There is also \nlarge \nuncertainty \naround\n the extent of liability of the CCS installations and carbon dioxide storage in \ncase of accident and/or leakage. \nWhile insurance mechanisms can help \nto mitigate some \nof these risk\ns\n, s\nome liabilities are essentially \nuninsurable\n and would require some form of government guarantee\n (ClimateWise, 2012\n)\n.\n23.\n              \nPublic and political perception. CCS is viewed \nby some\n as being incompatible with key elements of \na \nlow-carbon economy, as it could lead to potential moral hazard, for example, if used as an excuse for continued investment in unabated fossil fuel infrastructure\n in the short term\n. It is a\nlso associated with centralised energy systems,\n which can be\n perceived as \nharmful\n \nto investment in smart grids and interconnection. \nU\nntil more is known about the operation of storage facilities, the risk of accidental leakage is likely to be perceived as \nhigh.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n              \nGiven the obstacles noted \nin previous sections\n, it \nis\n essential to provide a package of finance and regulation to \nadvance\n \nCCS\n from demonstration to deployment at scale. This includes a strong price signal through \nth\ne \nEuropean Union Emissions Trading System\n, as well as other compl\ne\nmentary policies.\n25.\n              \nFirst, fo\nr policies to be effective it will be\n crucial to \nunderstand where funding support is needed most, and therefore where funding resources should be prioritised.26.\n              \nArguably, funding should target the areas of research, development and deployment that can best deliver reduced costs. These should include next generation technologies that improve plant efficiency and reduce the cost of capture, such as post-combusti\non carbonate looping and chemical looping (Florin &amp; Fennel, 2010). \n27.\n              \nA prudent approach \nwould be to \nprioritise support for gas\n \nCCS, as opposed to coal\n \nCCS, \nsince\n the cost per\n \nkilowatt-hour \nof ‘clean’ electricity is expected\n to be cheaper (although this \nwill also depend on the relative price of coal and gas) and as lifecycle emissions of gas power plants are significantly lower than for coal (CCC, 2013\na\n). \nThis would also suit the UK ambition to exploit its shale gas resources, should \nthey prove to be\n comm\nercially viable and socially\n and environmentally\n acceptable.\n28.\n              \nBiomass \ne\nnergy with CCS (BECCS) \nis\n also an important area of research as \nit\n is one of the most mature ‘negative emissions technologies’ (see for example \nMcGlashan et al., 2012). BECCS should \nbe integrated within the general CCS strategy, and early demonstrations projects should be encouraged. An important potential constraint is the sustainability of the biomass chain, which needs to be thoroughly investigated, including direct and indirect im\npacts on land use change.\n29.\n              \nCCS funding, which so far has mostly \nbeen \nfocused on power plants, should also \nbe used to \naddress \nmore \nindustrial applications. CCS is currently the only technology available to achieve large scale reductions \nof carbon dioxide emissions \nin \nmuch of \nthe industrial sector. According to the International Energy Agency (2013), almost half of the \ncarbon dioxide \nthat would need to be captured via CCS between 2015 and 2050 \nwill be emitted\n from industrial applications. \nThere can be large \ngains in \nemissions reduction \nby\n applying CCS to large \nenergy\n intensive sectors, \nsuch as\n iron and steel\n and\n cement \nproduction \nand refineries. Some sectors, like ammonia production and natural gas processing, already routinely apply carbon\n dioxide separation, and in these cases the \nadditional \ncost of carbon capture could be half those of power plants. There is also scope for reducing operating costs in industries \nsuch as\n cement\n production\n, where waste heat could be \nused \nfor carbon dioxide c\napture \n(Brown et al., 2012).\n30.\n              \nI\nt \nis\n crucial to \nspeed up the\n map\nping, \nassessment\n \nand verification of \nstorage opportuni\nties\n, as well as\n broaden\ning\n \nthe\n \ncollection \nof data \nfrom \npotential \nsites, \nespecially\n in the North Sea. It \nw\nould\n \nbe sensible to prioritise demonstration \nwhen it comes to the\n \nlowest risk \noptions, such as storage in depleted gas fields (Senior CCS Solutions Ltd, 2010). Saline aquifers, especially in the southern North Sea and offshore Scotland \nmay\n \noffer large potential\n capacities,\n but there is a long lead time and significant risk \nin assuming their use\n as a specific storage option\n, so they\n should be investigated further.\n31.\n              \nSecond, o\nnce the key area\ns of investment are identified, \nappropriate funding sources and regulatory mechanisms should be sought and designed.\n32.\n              \nThere is a case for re-directing \nsubsidies currently allocated to fossil fuels \nin order to increase funding\n for \nCCS research, development and deployment\n. \nThe\n G20 countries \nhave\n \nalready agreed\n \nto \n“\nrationalize and\n \nphase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage\n \nwasteful consumption\n”\n. \nIn the UK\n,\n \nfossil fuels are mostly supported\n financially\n \nby the Government \nvia tax exemptions or reductions, especially \nthrough a \nreduction in\n \nthe value added tax\n \napplied to households’ fuel and power consumption. \nOverall\n, \nthis support is\n estimated to \nrepresent\n more than £4 billion in\n the UK in\n 2011\n (OECD, 2012\n).\n While the removal of households’\n subsidies \nwould \nbe politically challen\nging,\n \ndiverting some of these resources to support CCS\n \ncould\n make \ntheir reform\n less controversial, as funds \nw\nould\n \nultimately be re-allocated within the fossil fuel industry\n and \nwould \npotentially reduce the need for direct funding for \nlow-\ncarbon technologie\ns, which could otherwise result in higher energy \nunit costs\n.\n33.\n              \nFurthermore\n, \nconsistent\n guidance or targets\n applied across the European Union would be helpful\n. For instance, Littlecott \net al\n.\n (2013) suggest the introduction of a European Union CCS milestone target or, should this prove to be to contentious, \nan adjustment of\n the current \ntarget for\n renewable energy target to allow it to be \nat least partly \nmet through CCS.\n34.\n              \nIt would also be he\nlpful to consider the potential \nfor adjusting\n \nEuropean \nstate-aid rules affecting CCS deployment. \nThe issue of how to ensure c\nompliance with state-aid rules\n was raised many times\n during the preparation for the CCS commercialisation competition in the UK, an\nd \ncould\n \nhave significant impact on investment decisions.\n35.\n              \nThe \ncost\n of demonstration projects can be \nreduced by \ncommercial \nsale \nof\n captured\n carbon dioxide\n, \nparticularly\n for Enhan\nced Oil \nR\necovery (EOR)\n. The prices paid in the United States for \ncarbon \ndioxide for use in\n EOR\n are in the range of $15-30 per tonne (Brown et al., 2012). Some research projects are already \nunderway\n \n(e.g. the EOR Joint Industry project in the North Sea, funded by the Scottish \nG\novernment \nand some private companies\n), and similar\n initiatives could be explored \nat\n \nother sites. The timing \nof\n \nEOR \nis\n important because\n there is only a \nspecific\n \nwindow of opportunity \nduring\n \nthe lifetime of an oil field when EOR can be implemented efficiently. Missing the window could \nmean\n \nthat \na\n \nCCS \nproject\n \nlose\ns\n \nits potential for\n \nprofitability. There are also a number of emerging technologies \nthat\n \ncould utilise and permanently store carbon dioxide, such as for chemical uses, concrete and plastic production or algae fertilisation (IEA, 2013). \nWhile th\ne amounts of \ncarbon dioxide\n which could be stored via utilisation are orders of magnitude lower than that released, these technologies could have \nimportant\n applications. \nFurther research is necessary to determine if a business case can be made \nfor\n \nnew comm\nercial applications of captured carbon dioxide - including scoping\n studies of\n lifecycle emissions, storage time, cost and total market\n potential\n.\n36.\n              \nThird\n, \nregulatory measures should be carefully designed to address the issue of liability. This, in turn, \nc\nould\n \nhelp improve public perception and understanding of CCS risks and potential.\n \nWe welcome the progress that the Government has been making in this area and the emphasis that DECC plac\nes\n \nin \nits\n CCS roadmap \non developing the regulatory regime \n(DECC, 2012\n).\n37.\n              \nStorage management and property rights should be clarified, as well as the role of \ng\novernment\n in storage exploration, appraisal and development. Monitoring should be appropriately regulated, as \na \nfailure to do so could \ndamage\n public trust \nin\n storage\n facilities and operators.\n38.\n              \nSome liability issues could be addressed with new forms of ‘innovative’ finance, for example where traditional insurance products are modified to transfer, u\nsing\n tightly defined criteria, a subset of the \nrisk of \ncarbon dioxide leakage during the injection phase (for a full description see ClimateWise, 2012). Some risks, however, will remain uninsurable. Ultimately, neither insurers no\nr\n storage operators will be able to bear unlimited liabilities. In these cases, r\nisk sharing with \nthe Government\n will be required. \nLearning from t\nhe experience of nuclear waste \ncould also help to\n defin\ne\n the responsibilit\nies\n of \nthe G\novernment and private companies \nfor\n liabilities \nthat \nare not limited in size.\n39.\n              \nI\nt will be also importa\nnt to clarify the role of CCS in balancing an electricity system with\n an\n increasing \ncapacity of \nintermittent renewables, in reducing emissions in carbon\n-\nintensive industrial production, and in \ncreating\n ‘negative emissions’ when applied to biomass. On this \nlatter point, there is evidence that \nimplementing\n BECCS \ncould potentially\n reduce ‘NIMBY’ complaints (for example\n,\n see Wallquist et al., 2012).\n40.\n              \nFinally, it should also be \nnoted\n that \nthe\n \nimplementation\n of CCS\n, together with other \nlow-\ncarbon energy \ntechnologies\n,\n will \nultimately \nlead to an increase in the \nunit \nprice of electricity and industrial output. \nThe distributional impacts of expected price increases should be carefully assessed and possible flanking measures should be investigated, for example\n to offset high energy prices \nfor\n \npoor households\n.&#xa0;\n41.\n              \nThe main elements of CCS technology – capture, transport and storage – have already been developed and are being applied in several industrial sectors. \nCapture technologies are at an advanced stage of industrial development. \nIn the UK\n,\n methane is already r\noutinely transported at higher pressures than those required \nto transport \ncarbon dioxide (7.39 megapascal\ns\n). \nI\nn several countries\n,\n c\narbon dioxide is already transported via pipelines, ship and road tanker, \nin \nsome cases in relatively large amounts\n,\n \nprimari\nly for use in the food industry or for oil and gas recovery. For example\n,\n enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects in the Permian Basin in Texas \neach year\n \nprocess, transport and re-inject around 23 million tonnes of recycled carbon dioxide\n, \nwith \nmore than\n \n2,20\n0 miles of high \npressure\n (10-15 MPa\n) \npipelines\n. As\n for storage, four large-scale CCS projects have carried out sufficient monitoring to provide confidence that injected carbon dioxide \ncan\n \nbe permanently retained. Collectively they have stored about 50 \nmillion tonnes of carbon dioxide to date (IEA, 2013)\n.\n&#xa0;\n42.\n              \nAccording to the International \nEnergy \nAgency (2012a), f\nailure\n to develop CC\nS will increase \nby 40 per cent \nthe cap\nital costs of reducing power secto\nr emissions \nto \na \nlevel consistent with \navoiding a rise of more than\n 2°C \nin global \naverage \ntemperature\n \ncompared with pre-industrial levels\n (IEA, 2012a).\n43.\n              \nIn the UK, a \n‘No CCS’\n scenario \nfor 2030 produced \nby the Committee on Climate Change (2013\nb\n)\n \nindicates \nthat\n \nthe \ncarbon intensity \nof the \nUK \npower system would only \nfall to \n100g\n, instead of\n \na desired \n50g\n,\n \nof carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour \nby 2030.\n \nE\nven this \nc\nould\n only be \nachiev\ned\n \nwith significant components\n of \nnuclear and offshore wind\n \npower\n \n(around 15 GW and 25\n \nGW respectively).\n44.\n              \nT\nhe UK w\nould\n \nalso \nfail to exploit a likely lucrative export market\n \nfor CCS \n(see section 4 above). Some of the major technology providers \nare \nalready \nkeen to open \nup \nthis market\n and \nexploit\n \n‘\nfirst mover\n’\n advantage\ns.\n&#xa0;\n45.\n              \nAs the \nSelect \nCommittee ha\ns\n \nrecognised, CCS has the potential to play a major role in the global effort to combat climate change. In \nits\n low\n-\ncarbon energy scenario (2 Degrees case)\n,\n the \nInternational Energy Agency\n \n(2012a) \nshow\ns\n CCS as the technology with the greatest potential for \nre\nducing carbon dioxide emissions\n. CCS \nwould \naccount for 22 per cent\n of \nreductions,\n \nor 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (equivalent to m\nore than two\n-\nthi\nrds of Europe’s emissions today)\n. This makes CCS a genuinely strategic option for global climate \nchang\ne \nmitigation.\n46.\n              \nAlthough the \nviability of the \ncomponent technologies ha\ns\n been demonstrated\n,\n there are many uncertainties, as described above, about \nthe\n technical and commercial implementation\n \nof CCS at a \nlarge scale\n. The UK still has significant advantages in terms of well\n-\nunderstood offshore reservoirs where \ncarbon dioxide\n could be stored, a strong oil and gas sector with relevant expertise, and \na capable engineering and research base.
