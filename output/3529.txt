[[[Written Evidence from the Sussex Police Crime Commissioner [CST0014]]]]&#xa0;Interpretation of the counting rules is subject to much meaningful debate locally, regionally and nationally.  We have therefore six apparently simple questions that require technically complex decisions.  As the force crime registrar for Sussex I attend regional and national meetings where issues are discussed with a view to providing clarification by means of examples for inclusion in the counting rules.&#xa0;Each incident has to be judged on its own merits hence my response therefore is global, rather than local, in an attempt to highlight the daily debates/issues that impact on recorded crime figures.   &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]An interesting opening question as nothing is ever straight forward particularly given the subjective judgements when interpreting the counting rules.  Influencing factors, in no particular order include, but are not restricted to:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The raison d’être of NCRS is to promote greater consistency between police forces in the recording of crime and to ensure a more victim focused approach.  Interpretation of NCRS and the counting rules is however subjective and the topic of much debate and discussion nationally on many occasions.&#xa0;The general principles of the NCRS rightly focus on a victim centric crime recording process.  In other words if a victim makes an allegation that amounts to an offence in law which is contained within the notifiable crime series, then such a crime should be recorded unless there is evidence to contradict that which is alleged.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In the current financial climate, the cost of any “back office” support function has to be balanced against operational requirements.&#xa0;The guiding principal is compliance with national standards however internal checks and balances vary between forces and a consequence of Performance Targets is the adoption of a innovative approaches to crime recording together with an element of manipulation / manoeuvring of crime statistics.  Within Sussex risk based NSIR/NCRS auditing enable early remedial intervention, where necessary, to ensure practices and procedures are fit for purpose. &#xa0;An outside audit pressure enhances the focus on the integrity of crime recording.  HMIC do a valuable job in this respect and the upcoming audit plan seems to focus on meaningful reviews including outcomes.  It would be of benefit for the numbers of records audited to be increased to allow a 'substantial' benchmark for future audits.  The current numbers do not allow a reasonable conclusion to be drawn on the figures provided, nor by their own understanding, legitimate comparison between forces.&#xa0;The advent of the PCCs has also had a positive impact in this area.  As they are electable positions and therefore accountable for the pledges they have made there is a keener sense that the crime data should be more ethical and correct.  It is more significant when a force shows a reduction in crime, and they are audited by an external agency. &#xa0;&#xa0;The victim based approach means evaluation of whether to record as a crime or not should be based on the initial information provided.  We are often being reminded that HOCR and NCRS is fit for purpose but there are always numerous 'slight' changes being made and various offences being moved between sections.  This will make any future comparisons difficult if not impossible.  Next year will see a huge change in the way that forces record outcomes which may well add, inadvertently, another performance indicator between forces.  To ensure that crime data will be appropriately comparable over the foreseeable future and allow forces to go forward in the knowledge that the playing field will not be changed there should (in my view) be no further large scale changes to HOCR.&#xa0;Sussex Police has moved a long way from red/green targets to developing performance products that really help to understand the business.  This contributes to achieving ethical recording.&#xa0;&#xa0;Whilst it is clear that all forces have issues around the same sort of incidents (ABH v Common Assault, Criminal Damage v Burglary and mobile phone theft) I still feel that a reasonable amount of confidence can remain in the crime statistics.  &#xa0;&#xa0;No, there should be National Statistics.  The results of the HMIC inspection of all forces will provide an indication as to whether or not the recorded crime statistics can be accredited - however that will be indicative for the future of the audit.&#xa0;The move to the ONS seemed a step forward and will allow the data to be maintained by a department that is free from any internal or external pressures.  &#xa0;Combination with the British Crime Survey results should provide the desired information.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
