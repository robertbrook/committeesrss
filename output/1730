defaultThis 
defaultsubmission
default covers the potential analytical measurement issues which need to be considered for carbon dioxide
default (CO
default2
default)
default 
defaultstreams intended for geological storage. There 
defaultis
default a wide range of 
defaultpotential contaminants and other trace compounds in these CO

default streams, arising from different sources of CO
default2
default. These constituents/components 
defaultare capable of promoting different physico-chemical effects during introduction

default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough the major risks associated with
default carbon capture and storage (
defaultCCS
default)
default are from leakage of the stored CO
default2
default, and accidents arising from the injection of CO
default2
default under pressure into the geological storage site, there may be other ri
defaultsks arising from the nature and concentration of contaminants in the CO
default2
default stream, although these have been much less widely reported or studied. The technology applied to CCS is relatively young, and the volume of information relating to measurements of con
defaulttaminants in CO
default2
default streams and problems arising from these contaminants is limited. There have been limited developments on CCS in the United Kingdom.

defaultSources of 
defaultContaminants in CO
default2
default streams
default&#xa0;
defaultThe identity and quantity of contaminants in CO
default2
default streams destined
default for geological storage depends on the source of the CO
default2
default. Different industrial processes give rise to a different contaminant profile. 
defaultThe majority of current and projected applications of CCS technology relate to emissions from power stations which burn 
defaultfossil fuels. Other industrial processes which could be considered amenable to CCS technology include:

defaultCement and Lime production
default•

defaultFermentation to produce ethanol
default•
default              
defaultIron and steel production
default•

defaultEffects of Contamination
default&#xa0;
defaultCCS technology therefore needs to guard against levels of one or more of these contaminants which could adversely affect the integrity of the storage site o
defaultr the relevant transport infrastructure (corrosion and impact on fluid characteristics), which do not pose a significant risk to the environment and human health, and do not breach applicable UK or EU legislation. This would normally be achieved by clean-u
defaultp of the CO
default2
default stream prior to injection into geological storage. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, the presence of water in the CO
default2
default stream at an elevated level can produce acidic conditions CO
default2
default which could cause corrosion of the pipe through which the stream is 
defaulttravelling. 
defaultA 
defaultlimit of 500 ppm water 
defaulthas been
default recommended as postulated in the Dynamis project (EU 6th Framework Project, 019672).
default&#xa0;
defaultHydrogen 
defaultsulphide (H
default2
defaultS)
default can also present problems in storage, particularly in acidic conditions, even mildly acidic conditions. In such si
defaulttuations, iron can be removed as iron sulfide from rocks, which may influence the integrity of the storage area.
default&#xa0;
defaultContaminants in CO
default2
default streams can also have an effect on the physico-chemical properties of the stream, including density, viscosity and interfa
defaultcial tension. Variations in these properties can affect the interaction between the CO
default2
default stream and the reservoir boundaries. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exact identity and concentration of impurities in CO
default2
default streams is dependent on the individual emission source. Compositions va
defaultry both within generic source types, and can be affected by factors such as the fuel or other process material, the process and the processing plant. Therefore, although the type of facility producing the emission can indicate the generic composition of th
defaulte stream, and the likely impurities, only analysis of the stream can give the detailed information necessary to fully understand the potential effects on the integrity of the storage.
defaultCarbon capture and sequestration is in its relative infancy, and few pro
defaultjects have been undertaken to capture and store carbon dioxide in geological storage. A number of contaminants have been identified which can be found in these streams, depending on their source. The potential problems which undesirable levels of these con
defaulttaminants, particularly water, can cause are also well understood.
defaultThere does not appear to be any specific analytical methods recommended for determining these impurities in 
defaultCO
default2
default streams
default, although chromatographic methods for separating and measuring 
defaultgaseous impurities can be used, and absorption of trace metal impurities for subsequent determination by techniques such as ICP-MS and ICP-OES, or direct determination in flowing gas streams, are also feasible.
