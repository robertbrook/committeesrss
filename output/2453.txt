[[[Overview]]]&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK – ‘the residence test’b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners – ‘prison law’c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed – ‘judicial review’, andd)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success – ‘borderline cases’&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ence test]]]Overview &#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Lawful’ – determining whether a person is lawfully resident may in itself require access to the courts. Legal aid, however, would not be available to resolve a dispute as to the lawfulness of residence.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Residence’ – British children resident abroad could be precluded from obtaining legal aid to bring a claim in the Family Court that they should be returned to the UK. It would also preclude persons wrongly removed from the UK from being eligible for legal aid to pursue their claim for damages and/or lawful return.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Continuously’ – a person who resided in the UK for six months and then left the UK for periods amounting to more than 30 days could not rely on the previous period of six months to accumulate the qualifying 12 month period. d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘12 month period’ – a British citizen or European Economic Area (EEA) national who has lived abroad for a substantial period may be unable to establish 12&#xa0;months residence in the UK as holders of British and EEA passports do not have their passports stamped on entry to the UK &#xa0;&#xa0;Implications for human rights &#xa0;“Habeas corpus protection is often expressed as limited to British subjects. Is it really limited to British nationals? Suffice it to say that the case law has given an emphatic ‘no’ to the question. Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws...He who is subject to English law is entitled to its protection.” &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Disproportionate impact &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Respondents in 1980 Hague Convention cases who have ‘fled’ to this jurisdiction or moved here with no sufficient connection to the UKb)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Applicants in states not signatory to the 1980 Hague Convention seeking a return of children there in wardship proceedingsc)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Stranded spouses who have been here for less than 12 monthsd)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Applicants for contact on an application made pursuant to Article 12 of the 1980 Hague Conventione)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Applicants for recognition made pursuant to the provisions of Brussels II (revised), andf)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Applicants for recognition and enforcement of a foreign order under the 1980 Hague Convention. &#xa0;Unintended consequences&#xa0;&#xa0;              Conclusion&#xa0;

[[[Judicial review]]]Overview &#xa0;Implications for human rights&#xa0;“Where an infringement of an individual's human rights has occurred, the concern will usually be to bring the infringement to an end and any question of compensation will be of secondary, if any, importance. This is reflected in the fact that, when it is necessary to resort to the courts to uphold and protect human rights

[[[, the remedies that are most frequently sought are the orders which are the descendants of the historic prerogative orders or declaratory judgments]]]. The orders enable the court to order a public body to refrain from or to take action, or to quash an offending administrative decision of a public body.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Disproportionate impact&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An application for permission carries a relatively high risk of initial failure. Even where a claim is meritorious it is often necessary to persist to an oral hearing or further to obtain permission. For example, while Wood v Commissioner of Police is now a leading case on privacy and police records, permission for judicial review was only granted on appeal.  b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Judicial review claims are “front loaded” in that most of the work from the claimant’s perspective must be done at the stage of bringing the claim. Practitioners therefore have to invest a large amount of time, cost and effort for which they may not get paid. This is increased still further if they have to proceed to an oral hearing or appeal. c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Applications for permission are difficult to predict and there is much variability among judges, andd)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many cases settle on beneficial terms after issue but before permission. It is not possible to tell how these are reflected in the statistics. Under the proposals these cases would not be paid for except on a discretionary basis.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Unintended consequences&#xa0;Conclusion&#xa0;

[[[Borderline cases ]]]Overview &#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cases which involve the prospect of a loss of a person’s home – engaging the human right to respect for the home (‘housing’ cases),

See also R (Evans) v Lord Chancellor [2012] 1 WLR 838, paragraph 25 (Laws LJ): “For the state to inhibit litigation by the denial of legal aid because the court’s judgement might be unwelcome or apparently damaging would constitute an attempt to influence the incidence of judicial decisions in the interests of government.
