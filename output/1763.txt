[[[ (RaD0019)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0; It is clear that many of the other world economies are protecting or increasing their investment in research for just such reasons.

[[[ ]]] Major international businesses have to date invested in UK research because it is recognised as amongst the best in the world. However, other countries are becoming increasingly competitive and UK industry now has more choice than ever before.  Many Governments, for example Singapore and Germany, are investing heavily to develop their research capability and provide attractive incentives for Companies to move their R&amp;D efforts.  It should be noted that much of this investment is based on a long-term national ‘vision’ that stretches well beyond a ten-year horizon.5.2&#xa0;&#xa0; We welcome the steps taken by government on UK research and development funding to link industry sector strategy and academic collaboration to support for research and technology. This creates coherence and also supports bridging the gap between research and bringing innovation to market in particular in growth industries.5.3&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent announcement of the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) is an example of how government investment supports a strategy for growth. Government worked with industry in the Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP) to set out a national ‘vision’ and define the strategy for securing long-term success of the industry. Both sides entered into a multi-year commitment to co-invest, which provides essential continuity, and to do so at research and technology funding levels which will enable UK’s aerospace research, advanced manufacturing and future products to remain world leading.5.4&#xa0;&#xa0; In this context we recognise that through the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) the government has developed efficient mechanisms for supporting joint collaborative research with universities. The scope of funding available through the TSB should be looked at in the context of pulling through early stage research to validated technology. We believe that the funding available to the TSB is too low to deliver all the early opportunities created in the UK.5.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Further, we believe that EPSRC remains an effective body for funding research at universities. While there is some merit in recent calls for streamlining the research councils, we are concerned that this should not lead to over-rationalisation into a single research council. Such a step would hurt diversity of research among various industries and hinder the adaptation of the individual council to the major drivers in the different research arenas.6.1&#xa0;&#xa0; As the National Audit Office (NAO) report notes, these funds are managed through a number of government departments that are not always well coordinated. Establishment of a government focal point would be a starting point to provide a stronger UK presence and influence at European level.6.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Universities are disinclined to pursue European funds because of the relatively unattractive overhead recovery structure of the grants. They need mechanisms by which the UK funding bodies can incentivise and support participation in EU programmes, thus recovering more of the UK taxpayers' contribution.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The regional agenda of funding collaborative R&amp;D appears to have been lost with the disbanding of the regional development agencies (RDAs), making it much harder to get SMEs involved. A strong basis for economic growth is rooted in a sound understanding of a locality’s economic advantage and how R&amp;D funding affects it.7.1&#xa0;&#xa0; We look forward to more information on how the new LEPs will be able to support larger businesses in the UK. We remain sceptical that the granularity of the LEPs is too fine to be effective in coordinating university activity to support local needs. Most LEPs will contain only one (many none) first class, research intensive university. The granularity of the 39 LEPs means that aligning multiple agencies across multiple universities to address major technical challenges will be no small task. It is essential that Government retain an oversight capability to avoid duplication of activity and missed opportunity.7.2&#xa0;&#xa0; No matter how ‘locality’ is defined; individual universities, industries, regions and even countries must target those areas of technology or expertise where a leading position exists, or where emerging technologies in which the UK has the business infrastructure and skill-base to become world leading exist. This implies focus on those institutions with a proven track record of excellence and delivering impact.  It also means that some difficult decisions must be taken to not support some activities in the ‘locality’, however defined.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In looking at universities, we acknowledge the difficulty of mapping excellent research to most sectors of the Industrial Strategy, and maps based on academic classifications may not do justice to centres that excel in applied research in particular.  Whilst we can offer no simple solution, there is extensive knowledge in major industries of those with whom successful collaborations are underway– this is likely to be a good proxy for those centres that carry out work having a tangible impact on business. It is highly unlikely that successful businesses will engage long-term with organisations that fail to deliver results.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would welcome discussion on additional metrics that recognise successful university-business interaction, and link continued funding aimed at UK growth to those metrics.  We make it clear that we do not advocate that current, traditional measures of research excellence be simply replaced, and there is no question that the quality of research and training in the UK must remain internationally competitive.  However, it should be recognised that the traditional outcomes of research are not the only measure of success, especially when considering exploitation for the benefit of the UK.  We have yet to see how the ‘Impact metric’ introduced for the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) will affect the outcome.  In calling for Universities to help “write the plan” for investing ESI funds, there is a risk that they will do so to support (only) more traditional measures.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, we should not overlook the potential synergies between sectors.  It is quite likely that for example Aerospace and Automotive will draw on similar skills and capabilities.  In examining heat maps and other indicators of expertise, where we see overlaps in capability, opportunities to more effectively channel R&amp;D funds may become apparent.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Annual report of Rolls-Royce Group Holdings, http://www.rolls-royce.com/investors/financial_reporting/annual_report/index.jsp  Ingenious Britain, a report by Sir James Dyson, March 2010 Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration: Final Report, HM Treasury, December 2003 http://www.ref.ac.uk/
