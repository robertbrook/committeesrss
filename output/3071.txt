[[[Q. ]]]

[[[How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?]]]

[[[A. Government policies will only be effective if the Highways Agency adheres to them]]]

[[[.  ]]]

[[[Reasoning]]]1. The 

[[[DfT]]]

[[[ Strategic Roads Network Performance]]] 

[[[Specification 2013-2015]]] sets out performance expectations for the strategic road network and Highways Agency for the period 2013 to 2015.

[[[Efficiency]]]

[[[) ]]]

[[[states]]]

[[[:]]]

[[[  ]]]The network operator should manage its business in an efficient and effective way and ensure investment offers strong value for money.The network operator should also report the percentage of appraised major project spend which is assessed as good or very good value for money as this is currently a Department for Transport Business Plan indicator.The network operator should demonstrate the benefits realised through major schemes delivered during the specification period as part of the post opening project evaluation process (POPE). The network operator should also review how it is learning from the findings of the POPEs and disseminating this information.&#xa0;

[[[3. Proposed New A14 scheme – initial public consultation Sep-Oct 2013]]]The Highways Agency is currently consulting on its proposed new A14 ‘improvement’ scheme – see scheme brochure and technical report attached. This scheme is almost identical to that cancelled in October 2010.  Estimated costs have now risen to £1.5 billion (one and a half thousand million pounds) for a 25-mile scheme – ie 

[[[£30 million pounds per mile]]]

[[[.  ]]]Comment: Does the Treasury consider this to be ‘strong value for money’?

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[4. Environment  - Output 11]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[states:]]]

[[[ ]]]The network operator should reduce the negative environmental impacts of its activities.Comment: This should be a critical component of any transport scheme (rail/road/ coastal/river) initial design and selection process not merely an ex-post scheme evaluation (POPE).

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Noise Pollution]]]

[[[- Health risks]]]The network operator (HA) should also maintain the practice of taking noise measurements where necessary in the locations of road improvement schemes

[[[.  ]]]

[[[              ]]]Comment: Noise pollution is recognised as not merely a nuisance but also as a health hazard – particularly for those suffering from cardiac conditions.&#xa0;

[[[Air Pollution]]]

[[[-Health risks]]]The network operator (HA) should work with partners to achieve its commitments on air quality, and fulfil its role as statutory consultee to the local air quality management process.              Comment:  Our greatest concern is for the health of our children.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Proposed New A14 scheme]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[– initial public consultation Sep-Oct 2013]]]Environmental Impact Assessments were not available for the consultation and proposals are still at an early stage though the scheme appears almost identical to that cancelled in 2010.  At a HA presentation on 16 Oct 2013 in Brampton– the village worst affected by the HA proposals – Brampton A14 Campaign Group (BCG) also presented their alternative scheme which had previously been submitted to the HA prior to the 2010 Public Inquiry (BCG scheme outline at 

[[[Annex A]]]

[[[)]]]

[[[.]]] An illustration of the impact of the 2010 HA scheme at Brampton is at 

[[[Annex B]]]

[[[.]]] At the Pre-Inquiry Meeting in May 2010, the Inspector asked the HA to develop and assess all alternative proposals submitted (including the BCG scheme) and prepare them for public consultation. Nothing further was heard from the HA and their scheme was cancelled in October 2010.  BCG also submitted suggestions to the ‘A14 challenge’ in 2011, including a Park &amp; Ride at Brampton Racecourse to reduce car traffic on the A14.  This could be linked with the guided bus route (currently ends at Huntingdon rail station).  A new local shuttle bus service between  the Park &amp; Ride, Brampton village, the rail station and Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Huntingdon was also proposed to relieve peak hour car traffic on local roads. This also seems to have disappeared without trace.              Comment: Under Treasury rules the Highways Agency is supposed to evaluate alternative proposals but has failed to do so.&#xa0;

[[[Pollution – Supreme Court Judgement May 2013]]]The previous A14 scheme (2010) was originally conceived in 2001.  There is no evidence that 

[[[current]]] EU and UK transport, environment and health legislation/ policy on air pollution, or UK government commitments to WHO goals relating to the environment and children’s health, have been taken into account in this 2013 version of the scheme. The Gauderman report (

[[[Annex C)]]] highlighted the impact of road traffic pollution on children’s lung development and should also have been taken into account.              Significantly, environment and health lawyers Client Earth won a landmark judgement on 1st May 2013 against the UK government for its failure to protect the public from the harmful effects of air pollution 

[[[(Annex]]]

[[[ D]]]

[[[)]]] which should also be taken into account.               Comment:  The UK government is in breach of EU air pollution laws in  relation to public health.  Health Impact Assessments (HIA) should be introduced urgently to ensure that UK transport policy is compliant with current EU and UK environment and health laws. A HIA should also be conducted at an early stage in the selection and development process of proposed transport schemes (all modes) to ensure legal compliance and  minimise the risk of nugatory expenditure.&#xa0;

[[[cheme]]]The detailed BCG alternative scheme was submitted to the Highways Agency (HA) in 2009 prior to the Public Inquiry in 2010.  A broad outline of key points is shown below with current 

[[[updates in red.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There is no rational justification for removing the viaduct and reducing trunk road capacity when the A14 problem is identified as 

[[[congestion]]].  The rail viaduct can be rebuilt/repaired at much less cost than building a new road - ask the railway industry.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Costs of rebuilding/repairing the  viaduct would be offset by no need to build a complex local road system in and around Huntingdon. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; New junction on A1198 also not required. 

[[[(submitted to A14 challenge)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Extend Guided Bus to Park &amp; Rise site&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Provide a new local shuttle bus service from Brampton Park &amp; Ride to Brampton village, Huntingdon Railway Station &amp; Hinchingbrooke Hospital &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This would ease traffic congestion on local roads and parking problems (and costs) at the station and the hospital

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A421 upgrade now under construction 

[[[(now completed)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A428 upgrade partially completed (ends at Caxton Gibbet). &#xa0;

[[[Build a NEW ROAD ]]]from Caxton Gibbet direct to the A1 Black Cat roundabout &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Build a NEW INTERCHANGE ]]]at the Black Cat roundabout with a grade separated flyover for the A428/A421 route.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[RETAIN the existing A428 ]]]from Caxton Gibbet to the A1 as a local road.

[[[ triumph in the Supreme Court]]]Wednesday 1st May 2013 was a good day for air quality. A legal battle which began in 2011 has resulted in a formal ruling from the highest court in the land that the Government is failing in its legal duty to protect people from the harmful effects of air pollution.Some of the complex legal questions will be referred to the European Court of Justice to inform the Supreme Court’s decision on a course of action. This will inevitably cause some delay, but going to the European Court means that any decision will then have implications for all EU Member States. The declaration also means that ‘the way is open to immediate enforcement action at national or European level’. See the summary and full judgment for more detail.It’s also provided an interesting opportunity to examine Defra’s tendency to stick their fingers in their ears over this problem. Even on the same day that the Supreme Court made their declaration, a Government source was widely quoted in the media as saying: “Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades and almost all of the UK meets EU air quality limits for all pollutants.” That’s government terminology for “la la la not listening”, surely?Alan Andrews, ClientEarth lawyer, said: “It’s misleading to say that almost all of the UK meets EU air quality limits. Much of the UK land mass has a low population. Air pollution is a problem in cities where most people live. If you’re on holiday in the Highlands you’re at a low risk. If you grow up in an inner city it could do you irreversible and life threatening damage. If we’re going to solve this problem the first thing the Government needs to do is be honest about air pollution’s scale and impact.”We’ll be working through the full implications of this landmark decision by the Supreme Court and particularly how this might help local communities to get traction on the issue in the short term.
