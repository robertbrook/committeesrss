[[[Benefit processing times]]]&#xa0;Between April and September 2013, 92% of JSA claims were cleared within 16 days, with an average clearance time of 9 days.&#xa0;So the vast majority of claims are being processed in much less than the 15 weeks suggested in the evidence session.&#xa0;

[[[Intergenerational worklessness]]]&#xa0;It is difficult to assess the scale of the problem of families experiencing multiple generations of worklessness. Research has shown a link between worklessness of parents and their children, so tackling worklessness today may also benefit the next generation. Data limitations mean there is less evidence on whether the link holds across multiple generations.&#xa0;Specifically, research shows that sons are more than twice as likely to experience workless spells themselves if their father was out of work throughout their childhood.[Johnson, P., and Reed, H. (1996). Intergenerational mobility among the rich and the poor: Results from the National Child Development Survey, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 7, 127-42.]&#xa0;Further research by the Centre for Analysis of Youth Transitions has found that parental worklessness was significantly associated with the likelihood and duration of their children being NEET (not in education, employment or training) in late adolescence.[Institute of Education &amp; National Centre for Social Research (2012). Intergenerational transmission of worklessness: Evidence from the Millennium Cohort and the Longitudinal Study of Young People In England]&#xa0;

[[[Evidence for a 4 month guarantee]]]&#xa0;Although we know that over 80 per cent of 18-24 year olds flow off of Jobseekers’ Allowance within 6 months, we do not have evidence on what these rates are for other countries. Differences in the structure of unemployment benefits, for example time limiting, make meaningful comparison of off-flow rates difficult. Therefore it is unclear what the ‘right’ length of time for a guarantee would be. UK government would argue that the concept of a guarantee is not necessarily helpful – it is more useful to find an appropriate opportunity for the individual at a time that is right for them, depending on their specific situation and needs rather than offering a blanket guarantee at a fixed point in time.

[[[Engagement of young people in policy-making]]]&#xa0;DWP policies are subject to extensive consultation before being implemented. Young people’s organisations frequently provide useful and insightful responses to our calls for evidence.&#xa0;Young people are frequently employed as ambassadors by Jobcentre Plus or linked voluntary sector organisations to help increase awareness. Good examples of this are the Princes Trust young ambassadors who are based at many Jobcentre Plus offices nationwide. A team of these recently visited policy officials within DWP’s headquarters to discuss the impact of policy.&#xa0;&#xa0;The Youth Policy Team and the Youth Parliament:&#xa0;A primary objective for the Cabinet Office Youth Policy team is to support young people to have a voice – and feel heard - both in the democratic process and in their local communities.A vital element of this work is the Youth Voice initiative funded by Cabinet Office and run by the British Youth Council. The initiative includes the UK Youth Parliament (UKYP), with democratically elected members aged between 11 – 18 representing and campaigning on the views and concerns of their young constituents.Each year a national ballot is held for young people to vote on the key issues they want the UKYP to focus on, and this year over 478 thousand young people, more than ever before, have had their say, voting for youth unemployment among their top five issues. UKYP will democratically select one of these top five to become the focus of their campaign for the forthcoming year.The Youth Voice initiative also provides multiple other youth-led opportunities for young people to influence decision makers and feed-into policy making, including through Focus Groups, the annual Youth Select Committee inquiry and the National Scrutiny Group, where young people scrutinise policy making and delivery.&#xa0;

[[[Traineeships]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]What is a traineeship?:&#xa0;In the context of the EU proposal for a Quality Framework for Traineeships, the term is used to cover a range of different models of work experience. The Commission has identified five main types of traineeship:i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; traineeships during educationii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; traineeships as part of mandatory professional trainingiii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; traineeships as part of active labour market policiesiv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; traineeships on the open marketv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; transnational traineeships&#xa0;The Commission have indicated that their proposal is likely to focus on open market traineeships (similar what we tend to refer to as “internships”) and transnational traineeships (defined by the Commission as simply those traineeships where the company hires a trainee from abroad).&#xa0;&#xa0;Traineeships in England: &#xa0;In England, “traineeship” specifically refers to the new pre-employment scheme for 16-23 year olds, which was introduced in August 2013. There are similar scheme in the Devolved Administrations. This scheme will support young people to develop the skills they need to secure and succeed in employment, including apprenticeships.&#xa0;The new Traineeships programme in England began in August 2013. This is a skills and work experience programme which is intended to support young people aged 16-23 towards jobs, including Apprenticeships. The core components are work preparation training, English and maths (for those without a Level 2 qualification in those subjects) and work experience.&#xa0;Further information is available here:https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-quality-of-further-education-and-skills-training/supporting-pages/traineeships&#xa0;&#xa0;Internships in the UK:&#xa0;In the UK there is no legal definition of an “internship” and so an “intern” is considered in the same way as everyone else with regards to employment law. For example, with respect to minimum wage legislation, if an internship meets the legal definition of a worker, then they are subject to minimum wage legislation and must be paid at least the minimum wage from the start.  An employer can only take on an intern on an unpaid or “expenses only” basis where the intern is undertaking work on a voluntary basis or where some other exemption applies.&#xa0;On the 11th November 2013, Employment Relations Minister Jo Swinson unveiled guidance produced by BIS in collaboration with 4Talent. The new video and posters will clearly explain to people leaving education and making their first step on the career ladder what their rights are in relation to being paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW), where to go for more information and what action they can take if they feel they have been exploited. Information available to young people will also be boosted online and through social media.&#xa0;With support from BIS, an updated code of best practice for employers was published in October 2013. The code, produced by a voluntary forum of professional bodies and organisations, describes the core elements of a high-quality internship and explains how to maximise the benefits both for employers and for interns.  &#xa0;The BIS funded Graduate Talent Pool website aims to encourage employers, especially small and medium enterprises, to offer quality internships to recent graduates. Over 57,000 vacancies have been advertised since 2009, and following the introduction of quality assurance for vacancies, around 98% are for paid internships.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Careers advice for young people and the National Careers Service]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In September 2012 a new legal duty for schools to provide access to independent, impartial careers guidance to pupils in years 9 – 11 began, supported by statutory guidance.  From September 2013 the duty was extended to years 8 and 12 -13 in schools and colleges. In September 2013 Ofsted’s published a Thematic Review of the provision in schools in response to the new duty. In response to this and the National Careers Council's first independent report published in June 2013 the Government published, the Inspiration Vision and an Action Plan. &#xa0;These documents set out a new direction for careers advice in England, to inspire and motivate young people to reach their full potential. The Inspiration Vision sets out the need for schools and colleges to deliver guidance in new and inspiring ways, with strong focus on making connections with businesses that can help raise young people’s ambitions and encourage them to realise their potential.  Employers can help pupils gain a ‘real world’ view of work and help them understand the breadth of opportunities industry can offer.  The National Careers Service will work with schools, colleges and employers to take forward the new agenda.As part of the Youth Contract the National Careers Service provides a careers advice session to any 18-24 year old within the first 3 months of them registering as unemployed with Jobcentre Plus. From April 2012 to March 2013, the first year of the Service, over 182,000 unemployed 18-24 were provided careers guidance, around a third of these were seen within their first three months.

[[[OECD and Eurofound evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The OECD jointly hosted a seminar (with IZA) entitled “Reforming European Labour Markets: Stimulating Job Creation and Better Outcomes for Youth” on 3rd-4th July 2013. This was attended by Bill Wells from BIS. The seminar discussed a range of topics including Youth Guarantees, Apprenticeships and potential policies for the future. Although there is not yet a published output from this event, our assessment based on the content of the seminar is that much of the OECD’s seminal work remains relevant to the current policy discussion. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Background to the OECD and Eurofound:&#xa0;The mission of the OECD is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. They work with governments to understand what drives economic, social and environmental change. &#xa0;Drawing on facts and real-life experience, the OECD recommend policies designed to make the lives of ordinary people better. The OECD works with business, workers/individuals (via the Trade Union Advisory Committee) as well as other civil society organisations. The common thread of the work of its contributors is a shared commitment to market economies backed by democratic institutions and focused on the wellbeing of all citizens. &#xa0;Eurofound (The European Foundation for the improvement of Living and Working Conditions) is a tripartite EU agency that provides information and advice on living and working conditions and industrial relations in Europe. Eurofound’s work often focuses on topics such as collective wage bargaining which is more prevalent in other European countries than in the UK.
