[[[ (PCD 02)]]]&#xa0;1.After ten years of widespread discussion on the reform of war powers, several select committee inquiries, a Government consultation and White Paper in 2007-2008, and the present Foreign Secretary’s commitment to enshrine in law the duty to consult Parliament, progress towards that reform appears to have stalled.&#xa0;2. The House of Lords Constitution Committee, having produced an outstanding in depth report in July 2006 proposing regulating the war powers by way of a detailed convention, now opposes ‘formalisation’. The Brown administration produced a detailed resolution but failed to implement it. William Hague’s commitment to enshrine in law Parliament’s role has come to nothing presumably due to the opposition or indifference of his cabinet colleagues. &#xa0;3. The Constitution Committee’s recent report Constitutional arrangements for the use of armed force (July 2013) states that, “Neither primary legislation nor a resolution should be introduced as a means of formalising the role of Parliament in approving deployment decisions” (paragraph 61). The Committee goes on to say, “It seems that much of the impetus for formalising Parliament’s role is to make a political statement about where decisions should be taken, rather than to correct deficiencies in the legal or military process.” (paragraph 63). They conclude that the existing convention is the best solution.&#xa0;4. The Constitution Committee was persuaded by its witnesses that the nature of modern warfare had fundamentally changed and that had created a scenario inimical to detailed regulation. The Committee also assumed that there exists a convention of sufficient clarity to satisfy the conditions of a modern democracy and to enable the House of Commons “to exercise political control over, and confer legitimacy upon, such (deployment) decisions” (paragraph 64).&#xa0;5. I disagree with both the underlying premises and the conclusions of the recent Constitution Committee report. Changes to modern warfare make it more necessary not less that Parliament’s role should be clear. The ability to kill people in new ways or destroy enemy infrastructure by use of cyber warfare does not negate the fundamental constitutional question of the legitimacy of deployment decisions. Mission creep has always existed as have civil wars with broader geo-political consequences. I do not believe that there exists a convention of sufficient detail. Indeed, the complexity of modern warfare must have increased the uncertainty of whatever germ of a convention that does exist.&#xa0;6. My preferred solution would be a detailed resolution regulating Parliament’s ‘role and responsibility’. This needs to be underpinned by a Standing Order of the House. My understanding is that a resolution is technically not binding on the Government therefore a Standing Order would help embed the obligations. A good starting point for the detailed resolution is the one proposed by the Government of the day in the Governance of Britain White Paper. The resolution was not perfect. It gave very wide discretion to the Prime Minister as to when to consult Parliament and there were exclusions relating to Special Forces, emergencies and security related factors. Clearly a Prime Minister will need discretionary powers so the exact wording of a resolution is a matter for further discussion. &#xa0;&#xa0;7. Some, perhaps all, members of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee favour statutory regulation of the war powers. The attractions are clear, namely, that the government of the day would be affixed with an absolute set of legal obligation enforceable as a last resort in the courts. My reservation with regard to this is the question of dragging the courts in to this field. It should be possible to draft an Act in a way that grants legal immunity to individual soldiers even if the deployment order turned out to be legally invalid. What I think is unavoidable is that courts would be obliged to consider the lawfulness of deployment decisions where a claim is made for an injunction or a declaration. Given that the judiciary face persistent, and in my view ill informed attacks from some politicians and newspapers, with regard to applying the Human Rights Act, it would merely add to the rhetoric that the judiciary are usurping their role. If it were necessary for the judiciary to exercise such a supervisory role, then of course, such disobliging rhetoric about the judiciary could and should be ignored. In my view, the appropriate institutional parties, at least for the time being, are Parliament and the Executive. Were there to be a written constitution in the future different considerations would apply to the role of the courts.&#xa0;11 October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
