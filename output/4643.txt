[[[The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student ]]]

[[[outcomes;]]]&#xa0;The Government claims that the 2012 GCSE results show that sponsored academies were improving at five times the rate of non-academies.  However,&#xa0;Ways in which academies can narrow the gap for disadvantaged children include:&#xa0;

[[[Use of Technology In Academies]]]&#xa0;One in ten children between the ages of one and 15 has a mental health disorder and 61,570 children in state-funded schools who are recorded as having some kind of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD).  These two figures alone are terrifying and it is vital that support is given to these young people in education or they will have a higher chance of ending up on the NEETs register.  Indeed, only 15% of adults with autism in the UK are in full-time paid employment.  &#xa0;As attending school is much harder for a vulnerable young person due to wellbeing, health or bullying issues, the use of online and blended learning can be adapted to the mainstream environment to allow these young people to focus on learning without being bogged down by external influences, which they may struggle to deal with.  In addition, it can help to promote best practice as any academy involved in the project can pass this information on electronically to others increasing understanding and standards overall.&#xa0;The Nisai Virtual Academy (NVA) – created by the Nisai Group delivers the National Curriculum together with some Vocational Qualifications and is completely interactive, allowing students to engage in live lessons with teachers and other students as well as move around the online campus, whilst using the same frameworks as a student would receive in a traditional school.  &#xa0;In addition young people using the Nisai Virtual Academy have an entire virtual support team around them including their subject tutors and a specially assigned tutor to deal with their personal wellbeing.  This has proved to be a very successful route for vulnerable young people, and can help them get the support they need to deal better with their mainstream lessons.  &#xa0;

[[[Reduction of Exclusions]]]&#xa0;There needs to be a rethink regarding the recommendation made by PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding “a system for monitoring exclusions in Academies … and provide support to Academies, similar to that provided through Local Authority Behaviour Support Teams… to reduce the disproportionate number of exclusions in some Academies”.  This will help to make sure that disadvantaged students are not being unfairly excluded and that students are given the help and education they need if they are excluded for example, through the use of online and blended learning tools.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/19715 http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1008038/Unleashing-greatness.pdf Statistical First Release: Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions From Schools and Exclusion Appeals in England, 2009/10, Department for Education, 2011 The Office for National Statistics Mental health in children and young people in Great Britain, 2005 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2118804/Autism-Number-schoolchildren-classified-autistic-soars-56-years.html Redman, S et al (2009).
