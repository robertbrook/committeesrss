[normal]Written Evidence from Stephen Guy [CST0029][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]My family and I have for over 4 years not long after they moved in suffered at the hands of a Criminal family who live next door to us and are Tenants of Knowsley Housing Trust.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have gone through every known channel available to us from the Police, Knowsley Housing Trust Knowsley Council and other agencies all to no avail
[normal]As each and every time they deem it to be a Neighbourly dispute and Anti Social behaviour IE a Non Crime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When did Threats, Intimidation, Criminal damage, Foul and abusive language
[normal]Become ASB. In mine and the World of a 
[normal]Lot
[normal] of other Decent Hardworking Law Abiding people it is 
[normal]Criminal Behaviour[bold] and should be treated as Such with the Police and the other Agencies taking appropriate Action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I having worked in Local Government for Nearly 40 Years put my Faith in a System I was once part and to say we have been let down is an Understatement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of the many examples of the type of Family I am referring too is 
[normal]earlier this Year the Mother and Daughter of this Family were found Guilty of Perjury and we were assured by the Police that this would be enough to Go for eviction Proceedings against them. Six Months later they are still there.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You are our last hope for a Positive Outcome
[normal] and to give my Family and I backÂ  our Human right to a Peaceful existence.
