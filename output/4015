defaultWritten Evidence from Stephen Guy [CST0029]default&#xa0;
defaultMy family and I have for over 4 years not long after they moved in suffered at the hands of a Criminal family who live next door to us and are Tenants of Knowsley Housing Trust.

default&#xa0;
defaultWe have gone through every known channel available to us from the Police, Knowsley Housing Trust Knowsley Council and other agencies all to no avail
defaultAs each and every time they deem it to be a Neighbourly dispute and Anti Social behaviour IE a Non Crime.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen did Threats, Intimidation, Criminal damage, Foul and abusive language
defaultBecome ASB. In mine and the World of a 
defaultLot
default of other Decent Hardworking Law Abiding people it is 
defaultCriminal Behaviourdefault and should be treated as Such with the Police and the other Agencies taking appropriate Action.
default&#xa0;
defaultI having worked in Local Government for Nearly 40 Years put my Faith in a System I was once part and to say we have been let down is an Understatement.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the many examples of the type of Family I am referring too is 
defaultearlier this Year the Mother and Daughter of this Family were found Guilty of Perjury and we were assured by the Police that this would be enough to Go for eviction Proceedings against them. Six Months later they are still there.

defaultYou are our last hope for a Positive Outcome
default and to give my Family and I backÂ  our Human right to a Peaceful existence.
