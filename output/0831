Written evidence from the defaultRdefaultoyal defaultCdefaultollege of defaultNdefaultursing (LTC 81)default&#xa0;default1.0 default              defaultIntroduction default&#xa0;default1.1 
default              
defaultWith a membership of over 410,000 registered nurses, midwives, health visitors, nursing students and health care assistants, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the voice of nursing across the UK and the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world.
default 
defaultRCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promotes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the Government, the UK parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations.
default1.2
default              
defaultNursing staff play a key role in coo
defaultrdinating care between services. T
defaulthe RCN has played a significant role in the debate on the management of long term conditions as well as the integration of health and social care services in this context. The RCN welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to Health Committee on this important topic.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.0default default              defaultExecutive Summary default&#xa0;
default2.1
default 
default              
defaultThe RCN supports efforts to achieve integrated care and has previously participated in the Government’s work in this area
default, most recently
default through the NHS Future Forum’s consultation
default. We welcome the Secretary of State’s prioritisation of long term conditions as a priority area within the NHS Mandate. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultMany RCN members, particularly
default those working
default in the community, work at the interface of health and social care and implement integration at a local level. Nursing staff are, therefore, well-placed to offer advice and information on best practice in this area.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultIn view of this inquiry, the RCN supports the following measures to achieve better integrated care for people l
defaultiving with long term conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default3.0default default              defaultThe scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectivenessdefault&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultNurses working in the community can play a key role as community champions and ambassadors engaging with people about their health. To ensure improved integrated care and to help stop the ‘revolving door’ of hospital readmissions following discharge, community 
defaultnursing services must be invested in. There is an increasing need for community nursing expertise if health services are to effectively meet the emerging challenges of long term conditions. These challenges include
default;
default a growing number of older people and other vulnerable groups requiring nursing at home
default;
default the associated drive to prevent hospital admissions for those with long term conditions
default;
default and to ensure end of life care can be delivered in the home. Unfortunately, rather than being supported to rise to these challenges
default,
default the RCN 
defaultFrontline First 
defaultcampaign has highlighted that the community nursing workforce has actually contracted
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultIncreased self care brings many benefits, not only for the individual, but for clinicians, 
defaultcommissioners, 
defaultthe NHS, Government and society as a whole
default. Self care empowers individuals to take ownership of their condition and some aspects of their treatment
default, 
defaultsuch as managing their medication and making changes to their lifestyle.
default 
defaultNurses play an essential role in this process, encouraging and teaching patients how to manage their condition themselves. It is often specialist nurses
default,
default whose knowledge and expertise is specific to a particular condition
default,
default who are best able to carry out this role. However, specialist nurses’ jobs are under threat, they are often senior nurses meaning they can appear as an expensive outlay to an employer, the full benefit they bring to the care system and to the patient is also often underestimated. In times of financial constraint specialist nurses are often the first to be cut or redeployed to inappropriate settings.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultWhen considering long term conditions it is also important to include health prevention as part of the conversation. Many long term conditions, such as diabetes, can be managed better by initial prevention and prevention of deterioration. The RCN is concerned that the budget available for prevention work
default,
default in terms of public health services commissioned by local authorities
default,
default is relatively small. The need for local authorities to show immediate progress against public health outcomes framework measures will divert resources from long term prevention measures. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultEven with the budget for public health ring fenced, the RCN has real concerns over the future funding of preventative services as local authorities position themselves to provide these services during a period of great financial constraint. Much of their budget will be spent on demand led services, such as sexual health services and substance misuse services, leaving little left for prevention work on issues such as obesity and smoking. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultHealth prevention must be considered equally alongside intervention by commissioners.
default&#xa0;
default4.0default              defaultThe readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the communitydefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultHealth and care services in the community have a duty to provide those with long term conditions with continuous care across all services including acute, community and welfare. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultNurses are ideally placed to provide this continuity and often act as the single point for all care needs. As care coordinators, nursing staff play a key role in working to ensure that patients do not notice where one service starts and another ends. Their broad clinical expertise gives them a unique insight into a patient’s needs, enabling them to anticipate gaps in the system and to ensure that services are in place throughout the patient’s journey. Nursing care is a fundamental tool in enabling a seamless, joined up patient experience. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default 
default              
defaultIt is worth noting that people with learning or physical disabilities also 
defaultfrequently
default live with long term conditions. These patient pathways are often less well managed because of the complexity of multiple services required and the lack of integration between them. The RCN would like to see the skills of disability nurses used effectively to work collaboratively with GPs and other professionals, to inform and advise
default,
default on the best care pathways for those people. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultThe RCN is confident that professionals in the community have the necessary skills to manage the needs of those with long term conditions. However, in order to achieve the readiness desired to achieve
default integration and seamless care
default,
default 
defaulta genuine commitment to move services from acute settings to the community
default,
default must be made
default. Resources must be reallocated so that there is sufficient capacity to deal with the
default number
default of people who live with long term conditions as well as the increasing amount of care taking place in the home. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultIn order to deal with the changing needs of the population, we must see a real shift of resources and expertises from acute settings to the community.
default T
defaulthe latest official statistics show that 
defaultin the last ten years 
defaultthe nursing workforce has not shifted from the acute to the community sector to help meet this significant challenge.
defaultIn terms of resources and expertise in treating those with long term conditions, what is proven to be beneficial to community nursing staff is t
defaulthe support of specialist nurses. They 
defaultcan support community staff to better improve care for their patients. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
defaultThe RCN report 
defaultSpecialist nurses: Changing lives, saving money
default, 
defaultidentifies 
defaultthe crucial role that specialist nurses play in managing long term conditions. They provide direct patient care and educate patients on how best to manage their symptoms, as well as offering important support following diagnosis. In many cases the involvement of a specialist nurse can prevent patients being re-hospitalised or presenting at primary and emergency care settings. In a joint document with Parkinson’s Disease Society, Multiple Sclerosis Society and the RCN, 
defaultDeveloping integrated health and social care services for long term conditions
default,
default 
defaultthe role of specialist nurses and community matrons was highlighted 
defaultas being central to good management of long term conditions. 
default&#xa0;default5.0default              defaultThe practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long term conditionsdefault&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultClinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are still in their infancy, it is, therefore, somewhat too early to tell the effectiveness of the practical assistance
default available
default to commissioners 
defaultin the new commissioning system
default. However, given the role that nurses’ play in managing the care of those with long term conditions and the expertise that they hold, it is vital that CCGs draw upon this expertise at board level to ensure the best possible commissioning decisions are made. 
default&#xa0;default5.2
default              
defaultThere is some confusion around which services will be commissioned through CCGs and which will be 
defaultcommissioned
default 
defaulton a broader, national basis 
defaultthrough specialist commissioning. This is particularly concerning in the context of long term conditions. For example, it appears that neurological services will be provided through specialist commissioning, meaning that there will be an overlap of commissioning systems for the services required by the patient. The RCN would like to see clarity on the remit of CCGs and specialist commissioning and a commitment to a joined-up approach to ensure seamless provision of services. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultThe RCN has raised concerns throughout the pa
defaultssage of the NHS (Procurement, Patient Choice and C
defaultompetition) 
defaultRegulations, relating to 
defaultsection 75 
defaultof 
defaultthe Health and Social Care Act
default 2012
default. The RCN is concerned at the delay of the Government and Monitor in issuing robust guidance which sets out clearly when and how commissioners will need to use competition when allocating contracts to providers. The RCN has made it clear that commissioners must not be forced in to using competition based solely on financial reasoning or where they believe it is not beneficial for the patient. Financial incentives for the provision of integrated care should not be the only incentives. Integration of services must be patient-led and have commitment from all health and care professionals. 
default&#xa0;
default6.0default              defaultThe ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the default              defaultpatient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditionsdefault&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultA measuring tool for integrated care is often the successful implementation of a single point of care, where all services are provided throu
defaultgh one assessment
default which is controlled, funded and provided through one source. Whilst this is not unheard of, it is certainly uncommon. The RCN supports the notion of a single point of care and although we know many nurses unofficially fulfil this role, we would like to see steps taken to formally imbed this in patient care.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultA single point of care can provide the continuity and flexibility required to manage the care of people living with long term conditions. Long term conditions are constantly fluctuating, therefore
default,
default the provision of services must be flexible and responsive to altering conditions which can deteriorate or improve rapidly. A single point of care can be beneficial in effectively monitoring and assessing a person’s condition and what services are required at any given time. 
default&#xa0;
default7.0default              defaultObesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addresseddefault&#xa0;default7.1
default              
defaultCauses and contributing factors of long term conditions, such as obesity, can be addressed through effective public health interventions, education, public health training for community nurses and support for local services. The integration and communication between local public services such as local government, schools, and health and care services is vital in educating young people about the risks of developing long term conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultHealth and Wellbeing B
defaultoards (HWBs) have the potential to play a very significant role in promoting integration of services, providing multidisciplinary oversight for long term condition services and promoting public health across services. We welcome the duty on
default HWBs
default to encourage integrated working between all health and care providers and commissioners, for example, encouraging the use of pooled budgets and integrated provision of services.
default 
defaultHowever, the RCN is concerned that if HWBs are not granted adequate financial autonomy from local authorities, who will fund HWBs to varying levels, the impartiality of HWBs will be called in to question. Without this autonomy they will struggle to act independently of the local authority, or to work in meaningful partnership with representatives from other organisations. In addition to this, there needs to be a correct skill and knowledge mix on the HWB boards to effectively target local population needs. 
default&#xa0;default8.0default              defaultCurrent examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long term conditions default&#xa0;default8.1
default              
defaultThe RCN has identified a number of different nurse-led and innovative 
defaultworking practices and processes
default which facilitate the delivery of integrated care for individuals accessing the health and care systems. These include examples of utilising single entry points and single assessments, multidisciplinary teams, early intervention and regular needs reassessments and discharge planning. Two recent examples are 
defaultdetailed 
defaultbelow. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default              
defaultStroke assessment services at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trustdefault 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultMid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust has implemented a round-the-clock stroke assessment nurse service. The service provides stroke assessment nurses 24 hours a day, seven days a week for staff to refer patients to. Through its access to stroke assessment nurses, the service facilitates rapid assessment, delivery of 
defaultthrombolyisis
default and ensures stroke patients are admitted directly to the 
defaultHyperacute
default Stroke Unit, where appropriate. Early commencement of rehabilitation
default, drawing on a number of services, 
defaultprovides multi-faceted and integrated treatment for patients from diagnosis through to recovery.

default, Matthew 
defaultHodson
default, a Clinical Nurse Specialist at 
defaultHomerton
default University Hospital in East London, set up a clinic with colleagues for people with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recognising that there was little support for patients with COPD, Matt launched the 
defaultBreathing Space
default clinic in 2011. The clinic is a multi-disciplinary, inter-organisational hospice based pilot to support the holistic needs of COPD patients. The clinic helps patients better manage their illness, control symptoms, improve their outlook and plan for their future. A multi-professional and integrated approach is used for all patients with care from a palliative care consultant, a COPD nurse consultant and a palliative care physiotherapist to manage the symptoms of COPD and improve quality of life. 
default&#xa0;
default9.0default              defaultThe implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demand default&#xa0;
default9.1
default              
defaultAn ageing population, an increasing rate of lifestyle related illnesses, and patients suffering complex long term conditions are all contributing to a significant rising demand on the NHS and wider care services. Alongside this, the current financial situation that the UK finds itself in has led to huge pressure upon public spending and services. 
default&#xa0;
default9.2
default              
defaultAlthough the Department of Health and NHS has escaped budget cuts like those seen in other Government departments, it is still required to make efficiency savings of at least £20 billion by 2015 and it is widely expected that this figure is likely to rise. Cuts to other 
defaultpublic services
default, such as local government, are having a knock on effect on the NHS. For example, local authority funding restrictions have affected local social care provision and other supportive services. These cuts increase demand for health services creating a bottle neck of activity and pressure on the NHS.
default 
default&#xa0;
default9.3
default              
defaultThe RCN has frequently highlighted its concern about the need to properly address the way in which we care for the increasing number of older people, who have complex and demanding needs. In the RCN document
default,
default 
defaultSafe staffing for older people’s wards
default,
default 
defaultwe stress the importance of ensuring the correct staffing levels and skill mix to properly care for the increasing numbers of older people in hospitals. 
default&#xa0;
default9.4
default              
defaultIn addition to the increasing ageing population
default,
default it is important to note the significant number o
defaultf younger people who have multi-
defaultmorbidities and have additional needs in terms of accessing work, education and housing services. Integration
default,
default in this sense
default,
default requires cross-departmental working from the Department of Health, Department of Work and Pensions, Department for Communities and Local Government and Department for Education to effectively provide for those with long term conditions so that they can lead fulfilling and healthier lives, both mentally and physically. 
default&#xa0;
default10.0default              defaultThe interaction between mental health conditions and long term physical health conditions default&#xa0;
default10.1
default              
defaultThe RCN supports efforts to achieve integrated care between mental and physical health. Much of what has already been said above is relevant to this particular point. A single point of contact for those with mental health conditions and long ter
defaultm conditions can be beneficial
default in providing seamless care between services. Additionally, patient held records and clear care pathways managed by an integrated team can also be used to improve 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration of services. 
default&#xa0;
default10.2
default              
defaultFor those with long term and mental health conditions, access to primary care services is vitally important in diag
defaultnosing and continually assessing
default often fluctuating conditions. The flexibility and sensitivity of primary care services is crucial to being able to manage mental health 
defaultconditions. For example, the length of appointments at GP surgeries with doctors or nurses must be long enough to properly assess the physical 
defaultand
default mental condition of a patient. 
default&#xa0;
default10.3
default              
defaultPatients must feel able to disclose information about their mental health and seek care and support for all physical and mental conditions. For this to happen, health and care professionals must be appropriately trained and educated to deal with both mental and health conditions, this is not often the case and patients experience different 
defaultlevels of 
defaultcare from different people. The RCN encourages a
defaultpproaches to train and educate
default nursing staff to manage both the mental and physical health of patients so that a more integrated approach could be achieved.
default&#xa0;
default10.4
default              
defaultOften the simple reason for disjointed services is the geographical location of professionals and resources. To achieve a more integrated approach, the RCN would like to see mental health professionals and resources located in primary care settings, resulting in a co-location of mental and physical services. 
default&#xa0;
default10.5
default              
defaultSocial isolation is often a factor for those living with long term conditions. Variables such as employment and education are known to have an impact on mental health and effective integration of local public services can be beneficial to the overall whole-person health outcomes. 
default&#xa0;
default11.0default              defaultThe extent to which patients are being offered personalised services (including evidence of their contribution to better outcomes)default&#xa0;
default11.1
default              
defaultThe RCN strongly supports the delivery of personalised care, with 88 percent of respondents to an RCN member 
defaultsurvey on 
defaultsocial care stating that individuals should be able to tailor their care to their own preferences and needs.
default Members also stated that personalised services and care are crucial to preventing health and care needs from developing or deteriorating, and hence represent an invest to save approach. Members identified personalised care plans, support to help make choices and regular reviews of care needs from appropriately trained staff, as critical to an individual’s experience and outcomes.
default&#xa0;
default11.2
default              
defaultPersonal health budgets (PHBs) are one tool which can help deliver personalised care for some patients. In the same RCN survey, 58 percent of respondents agreed that PHBs improve choice and control. Almost the same percentages were reflected in members’ responses to whether everyone should be entitled to a personal health budget with 57 percent concurring that PHBs improve choice and control. 
default&#xa0;
default11.3
default              
defaultHowever, e
defaultven with appropriate resourcing and safeguarding in place, the RCN does not believe that PHBs will be an appropriate way to deliver personalised care for 
defaultall 
defaultpatient groups and individuals.
default 
defaultDifferent methods to personalise care will be required.
default 
defaultTherefore, the RCN believes that PHBs must be optional. To maximise choice and personalisation, the Government will have to look how it will resource and deliver existing ‘traditional’ services alongside additional services that personal budget-holders commission.
