Written evidence submitted by defaultJ R Welch, B.Sc. default(FSS032)default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultI welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to th
defaultis inquiry. 
default I was one of those made redundant from the London Laboratory of FSS Ltd in July 2010.  I now work as a self-employed consultant in forensic document examination. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDoes the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice? default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultIt is not apparent that the government has 
defaultanydefault strategy
default for forensic science.  There is perhaps a vague hope that “market forces will provide”
default but that ignores the fact that
default market forces always choose the shortest-term option whi
defaultl
defaultst human lifetimes and activities operate in the medium term.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultDid the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget ? default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultThe costs of transition and closure should be available from government figures.  The process was certainly not smooth.  The 
defaultinitial 
defaultclosure of three laboratories was intended to reduce costs and allow those remaining to continue operating
default.
default  
defaultJust one difficulty
default was that t
defaultoxicology expertise had previously been 
defaultconcentrated in the Chorley laboratory
default.  When the decision to close that laboratory was taken senior management seemed surprised that none of the toxicologists were willing to 
defaulttransfer to London (which would have entailed 
defaultsell
defaulting
default their houses in Chorley and enter
defaulting
default the London housing market at three times the price
default)
default.  The few remaining toxicologists elsewhere in the FSS were under considerable stress from then on. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultThe relatively small department in which I worked in the London Laboratory was scheduled for closure at the end of July 2010.  At short notice the closure was brought forward by three weeks precipitating a scramble to finish work-in-hand and preventing an orderly run-down to closure.  Then, one of us was required to remain at work, effectively at “stand-by”, for some further months.  This lack of consistency seemed to typify the gross incom
defaultpetence displayed by some in the
default management
default of FSS Ltd.
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained ? default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultIn the criminal justice system the forensic sciences are being used in investigations much less than they were before the closure of FSS Ltd.  Submissions of case items to the major suppliers used by constabularies (LGC Forensics, Key Forensics, and Cellmark) have declined year on year.  None of those companies is 
defaultgetting as much work or 
defaultmaking as much profit as its owners would like; arguably, none of those companies is making enough money to ensure its continued operation.  
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultTwo recent cases in which I was engaged by defending solicitors provide concrete examples.  
default              default(a).default 
defaultThe first concerned the allegation, made long after the event, of sexual abuse of a very young school-girl.  The prosecution introduced a handwritten note supposedly written by the victim close to the time of the alleged events.  The prosecution had not sought evidence from forensic document examination to confirm (i) that the note was written by the alleged victim nor (ii) that it was contemporaneous with the alleged events.  
default              default(b).default 
defaultThe se
defaultcond case involved alleged drug-
defaultdealing by
default someone who used a residence occupied by several individuals.  Documents found at the property were alleged to be the accused person’s “dealing lists”.  No forensic science evidence was sought by the prosecution to show that they were written by the accused.  Informal conversation with the investigating officer revealed that he had wanted to seek such evidence but had been prevented from doing so by the “forensic budget holder”.  
defaultAlso, the documents were not searched for indented impressions which would have had the potential to widen the investigation. 
default 
default              
defaultIn each of these cases the police investigation was limited by insufficient use of forensic document examination. 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultThe constabularies cannot afford to use external suppliers greatly and will look to use cheaper in-house resources wherever they exist.  It is likely that the police use of in-house resources is costed in a way different from that used for external forensic science.  Constabularies have always had direct responsibility for scene-of-crime examination and for developing and comparing fingerprints.  
defaultThe temptation for departments to stretch the boundaries of their work beyond their expertise is considerable.  Fingerprint staff searching documents for indentations and scenes-of-crime staff investigating suspicious fires are examples of work likely to be undertaken in a manner less than expert. 
default&#xa0;
default7
default.
default              defaultForensic science research in England is much reduced.  The view is that research may lead to knowledge but not profit, at least not in the short term, so why should private industry fund it ?  The most recent volume of the UK forensic science journal (“Science and Justice”,
default 
defaultVol
default 52,
default Issue
default 4, December 2012) contains eight peer-reviewed papers.  Only two originate in England; two are from the United States, one comes from each of Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand, 
defaultand one is an international collaboration i
defaultnvolving one English participant.  While this shows that the UK journal is held in high
default regard internationally it suggests
default that UK forensic science is now insufficient to support the UK forensic science journal.  
default&#xa0;
default8
default.
default              defaultThe quality of forensic science in the UK is generally high because 
defaultacademic 
defaultscience is about discovery
default 
defaultof the truth 
defaultand operates within a moral code
default. 
default 
defaultQ
defaultualified scientists
default, in the main,
default are dedicated people willing to work altruistically.  A difficulty now is that forensic scientists are no longer isolated from the commercial pressures which encourage hurried work and cutting corners.  Indeed,
default “product charging”
default,
default “performance pay”
default,
default and “bonus payments” 
defaultpositively 
defaultencourage such activities
default.  
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultAccreditation is largely irrelevant apart from it increasing overhead costs by enormous amounts.  For at least half of my career formal accreditation did not exist; in my direct experience standards were just as high then as they were after formal accreditation systems were introduced.  Prior to formal accreditation there occurred the occasional calamity – the “Birmingham Bombs Case” and the “Preece Case”.  After accreditation there occurred the occasional calamity – t
defaulth
defaulte “Damilola Taylor Case” and the case which gave rise to the appeal court judgement in “R v T”.  I do not minimise the concerns raised by such cases
default; I point out that accreditation has not eliminated them. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator ?  default&#xa0;
default10
default.
default              
defaultIn the forensic sciences and in a number of other industries the appointment of a regulator is proof positive that a truly competitive market does not exist.  The 
defaultforensic science 
defaultregulator has attached himself to the accreditation bandwagon – a juggernaut which has no need of extra resource.  
defaultSatisfying the requirements of the forensic regulator, of the “National Forensic Framework”
default,
default and of “ISO17025”
default requires many tens of thousands of pounds and is beyond the financial resources of any but the largest forensic organisations.  T
defaulthe 
defaultregulator 
defaultseems to have restricted his attentions to the major providers – those who tender for the police forensic science contracts.  He seems to have ignored completely the smaller-scale forensic science
default laboratories
default; those
default with perhaps just one or two 
defaultself-em
defaultp
defaultloyed 
defaultpractitioners who generally provide expertise to defending solicitors in criminal matters and to those engaged in civil disputes.  Some of 
defaultthose
default self-employed forensic scientists have technical and ethical standards every bit as high as 
defaultthose of the larger operations
default; so
defaultme
default are 
defaultunqualified 
defaultcharlatans.  T
defaulthe regulator
default should
default be concerned with 
defaultidentifying which is which.
default  
default&#xa0;
default11
default.
default              
defaultThe regulator should be more involved with the commercial and financial aspects of the forensic science industry.  How does he view the “Association of Forensic 
defaultService 
defaultProviders” ?  It sounds like a price cartel, how can he ensure that it doesn’t operate as a price cartel ?  How wou
defaultld he prevent other anti-competi
defaultti
defaultve actions such as
default informal
default “no poaching-of-staff agreements” ?
default 
default 
default&#xa0;

default.
default              
default 
defaultThe single practitioner and small partnership forensic laboratories are largely dependent on fees paid by the Legal Services Commission
default but channelled through the instructing solicitors
default.  
defaultSolicitors generally regard such payments as a means of augmenting their cash-flow and hold them for as long as possible.  Is there any reason why Legal Service Commission payments for forensic consultants cannot be paid directly to the consultants ?  The regulator should be concerned with such matters.  An active group of forensic consultants avai
defaultlable to review and challenge
default work 
defaultundertaken by larger laboratories is a force for quality assurance at least as effective as, and possibly much more effective than, cumbersome systems of accreditation.  
defaultHowever, if the consultants do not receive payment for work undertaken they will not be active for
default very
default long.  
defaultA defending solicitor seeking to use forensic science must obtain quotes for the work
default from a number of consultants and, in general, use the consultant offering the lowest quote.  There is no “quality threshold”; the lowest quo
defaultte may well be from the least
default qualified.
default  
defaultThe regulator should be concerned with such matters.  
defaultThe regulator should ensure that he and the Legal Services Commission can distinguish forensic document examiners from graphologists. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it ? default&#xa0;
default1
default3
default.
default              
defaultOverall the size of the “forensics market” is unknown and unknowable.  It depends on so many variables it cannot be regarded as stable.  In forensic document examination the decline in the use of clearing-bank cheques reduced the amount of a particular type of work; at roughly the same time the increasing use of various printing systems attached to home computers introduced a whole new area of work.  
defaultThe introduction of DNA profiling increased work in some areas and reduced work in others.  
defaultThe field of “Computer F
defaultorensics” has grown from nothing 
defaultto become a major specialism
default 
defaultduring the second half of my working life.  
defaultChanges in the law relating to drinking and driving have eliminated whole laboratory departments; changes in the law relating to drugs and driving may require new ones.  
defaultAgain, forty years ago forensic science was much used to investigate domestic burglary via the analysis and comparison of paint-flakes, glass fragments and shoe-marks.  Now, such inve
defaultstigations have almost disappeared
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default4
default.
default              
defaultIn practice, the size of the “forensic market” is determined by the amount of money that is devoted to it.  The changes referr
defaulted to in paragraph thirteen
default reflect changes in police priorities
default and changes in police budgets
default as much as changes in society.
default  The more money that is available for forensic s
defaultcience the more forensic science
default will be used and that is
default 
defaultirrespective of the money originating in a direct civil-service budget or as a sub-set of the police budget.  
default&#xa0;
default1
default5
default.
default              
defaultIt is essential to 
defaultfocus on the fact that forensic science is science applied to the law.  It is best undertaken by qualified scientists
default who are able
default to apply
default expertise appropriate to whatever p
defaultroblems
default arise
default.  The current fashion for production-line proce
defaults
defaultses operated by staff with a specific
default vocational training is drive
defaultn
default by accountants seeking financial efficiency.  In some ways that is a laudable aim but it 
defaultlacks flexibility and cannot serve all the
default varied needs of criminal and civil justice.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHow are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved ? default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultProcurement 
defaultof forensic science 
defaultby police is a complicated and expensive tendering process providing employment for procurement teams, sales teams, account managers, customer relations teams and accounts clerks all of whom are unproductive of forensic science.  This maintains a fiction of being a competitive process but with three 
defaultmain 
defaultsuppliers and, maybe, five groups of purchasers there can be no real competition.  Indeed, one object of real competition is to drive out of business the less efficient competitors so that the resulting lack of competition enables higher prices to be charged by the surviving monopoly supplier.  Can Parliament or the police contemplate with equanimity such a truly competitive environment 
defaultfor the forensic sciences 
default? 
default&#xa0;
defaultHas the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK? default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultYes.default  
defaultThe department in which I worked in London employed six scientists; one now works in Australia and two have left forensic science.  Three are employed or self-employed in forensic science in a less than full-time capacity.  
defaultProfessional colleagues in the Huntingdon and Wetherby laboratories were approximately twelve in number and I am aware of only two 
defaultwho are now 
defaultworking in forensic science. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAre current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved ? default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultI have had only a little contact with this.  The arrangements seem adequate.
