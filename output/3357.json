I struggle with shoes and frequently have to ask friends, colleagues, family and even people on the street to rescue my shoes and put them back on when they fall off.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAmy, on what social care enables her to do:\n&#xa0;\n“It’s about being able to have the same aspirations as others.
