"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by CoalImp (CCS20)&#xa0;\nThis submission \nto\n the \nCall for Evidence on \nCarbon Capture and Storage\n (CCS)\n \nis \non behalf of CoalImp \n– the Ass\nociation\n of UK Coal Importers.\n \n&#xa0;\nCoalImp represents major coal users (including \nmost\n of the coal-fired generators in the UK), rail companies, ports and other infrastructure operators in the coal supply chain. The \ntwenty\n members\n (listed \non the Coal\nImp \nwebsite\n) account for the handling, transportation and use of the majority of imported supplies into the country, \nin turn representing the majority of all coal supplied to the electricity industry\n&#xa0;\nIndividual CoalImp members \nwith a strong interest in CCS \n(and with appropriate levels of technical knowledge and expertise) \nwill be submitting detailed \nevidence\n, answering the complete list of questions posed.\n \nThis \nevidence\n concentrates in more general ter\nms on the case for CCS based on the UK and international background\n.\nSummary&#xa0;\nCoal resources are super abundant and are spread across all continents. Proven world coal reserves amount to around 1,000 billion tonnes, equivalent to 130 years supply at curren\nt rates of usage, with the largest reserves in the USA and China, which are also the largest users.\n&#xa0;\nCoal is the world’s fastest growing fuel reflecting its affordability as well as its abundant supply across all continents. It is the cheapest fuel general\nly available worldwide and consumption is expected to catch up with oil before the end of the decade. The world has 1.3 billion people with no access to electricity – resolving fuel poverty will rely heavily on coal.\n&#xa0;\nClimate change is a global phenomenon \nand requires a global solution. The UK accounts for less than 2% of global emissions, and the EU only 11%.  The largest emitters are the largest coal users with the largest reserves – there is no solution to climate change which does not include a solution\n for coal.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK still has an opportunity to take a leadership role with CCS, and DECC’s own analysis shows it will be economic alongside other low-carbon technologies.\nGovernment must now press ahead with its CCS demonstration programme on coal, without\n any further slippage, as well as using the mechanisms in the Energy Bill to enable more coal CCS projects to come to fruition. This would mean that the UK can continue to benefit from the world’s most abundant and low cost fuel at the same time as leading\n the way to a future where coal is utilised in a clean and fully sustainable manner.\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoal resources are super abundant and are spread across all continents. Proven world coal reserves amount to around 1,000 billion tonnes, equivalent to 130 \nyears supply at current rates of usage\n, with the largest reserves in the USA and China, which are also the largest users.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK currently relies on coal for around 40% of its electricity\n – up to 50% at peak times. Coal-fired electricity is the most secu\nre and flexible low-cost capacity on the system; and with coal less than half the price of gas it is a key element in managing energy bills, fuel poverty and UK energy competitiveness.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK coal resources amount to around 4½ billion tonnes\n, and the UK has g\nood access to imported supplies through well-developed port and rail infrastructure. Over 10,000 people are directly employed in the coal sector, including production, utilisation and infrastructure, with a similar number in jobs dependent on the sector. I\nnternational coal supply complements indigenous supply with the security, flexibility and quality attributes of a highly liquid and diverse international market.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoal is the world’s fastest growing fuel reflecting its affordability as well\n as its abundant supply across all continents. Coal accounted for almost half the increase in global energy use over the past decade\n and in 2012 had the largest share of primary energy demand since 1970\n. It is the cheapest fuel generally available worldw\nide and\n consumption\n is expected to catch up with oil before the end of the decade\n. The world has 1.3 billion people with no access to electricity\n – resolving fuel poverty will rely heavily on coal.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK consumers have been protected from the full impact of\n high prices of gas-fired electricity by the diversity of our power generation system, which can still benefit from the reliability, flexibility and relatively low cost of coal, the world’s most abundant fuel. \nAs electricity customers become increasingly \nconcerned about their bills, the affordability of coal is a key factor in keeping energy costs under control.\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe potential availability of shale gas may provide the UK with another important indigenous source of energy, but is unlikely to have the dramati\nc impact on prices seen in the USA. The Energy and Climate Change Committee has said that shale gas production in the UK could enhance our energy security and boost tax revenues, but it is too early to say whether it will reduce energy prices\n.\n Energy and \nClimate Change Secretary Ed Davey’s has similarly warned that development of UK shale gas resources will not lead to an era of cheap gas\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClimate change is a global phenomenon and requires a global solution. The UK accounts \nfor less than 2% of global emissions, and the EU only 11%\n.  The largest emitters are the largest coal users with the largest reserves – there is no solution to climate change which does not include a solution for coal.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch a solution exists in the form o\nf Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), which must therefore be a key mitigation technology. According to the IEA, without CCS, limiting a rise in global temperature to 2°C will be that much more difficult, and up to 70% more costly\n.\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarbon savings from unila\nteral UK action (such as the Carbon Price Floor) can be illusory. High electricity prices will damage the UK economy despite so-called ‘green growth’ and will export carbon emissions and jobs. Imported goods from China and elsewhere rely on coal-fired elec\ntricity. The Committee on Climate Change estimates that, whereas r\neductions of around 20% in production emissions over the last two decades has limited growth in the UK’s carbon footprint, taking into account imported goods,\n the UK’s carbon footprint has a\nctually increased by 10% or more\n.\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK still has an opportunity to take a leadership role with CCS, and DECC’s own analysis shows it will be economic alongside other low-carbon technologies\n. CCS is not only a key technology for carbon mitigation; it \nalso provides an export opportunity for companies with an early-mover advantage.  Proximity to huge CO\n2\n storage potential under the North Sea also makes the UK an ideal place to develop this technology.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is vital tha\nt we develop the technologies to ensure coal is used in a clean and fully sustainable manner as part of a secure and diverse energy portfolio.  By providing low cost, reliable electricity, coal can already address several of the most pressing issues facing\n the UK energy sector. CCS will mean it can also be low carbon. \nGovernment should give a clear statement of longer-term ambition for coal with CCS, with commitment to appropriate support mechanisms.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoalImp welcomed the Government’s decision to move forwar\nd with two CCS projects in the UK including t\nhe coal-fired \nWhite Rose Project in North Yorkshire\n. T\nhis decision represents a positive step forward for CCS development in the UK. It is important that the infrastructure supporting these demonstration projec\nts, for example the pipeline, is designed to have the capacity and functionality to allow the development of other projects as part of a cluster.  \nPolicy and financial support will also be needed in due course for CO\n2\n infrastructure based on other CCS clus\nters.\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA recent DECC report has predicted that CCS has the potential to compete effectively with other low-carbon forms of energy by the 2020s\n. This report underlines the importance in demonstrating coal with CCS, and the potential to secure a role for \ncoal in th\ne future low-carbon energy mix.\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlongside the directly funded demonstration projects, further CCS projects should be developed under the UK’s Electricity Market Reform, as well as nuclear and renewables technologies.\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment must now press ahe\nad with its CCS demonstration programme on coal, without any further slippage, as well as using the mechanisms in the Energy Bill to enable more coal CCS projects to come to fruition. This would mean that the UK can continue to benefit from the world’s mos\nt abundant and low cost fuel at the same time as leading the way to a future where coal is utilised in a clean and fully sustainable manner.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;\n \nIEA – Coal Information 201\n3\n \nDECC Energy Statistics\n \nCoalpro/Coal Authority\n \nIEA – World Energy Outlook 2012\n \nBP Statistical Review 2013\n \nIEA \n– \nMedium-Term Coal Market Report 2012\n \nIEA – World Energy Outlook 2012\n \nEnergy and Climate Change Committee – \nThe Impact of Shale Gas on \nEnergy Markets\n \nEd Davey – Guardian Intervie\nw November 2012\n \nIEA – CO2 E\nmissions from Fuel Combustion 2012\n \nIEA – Technology Roadmap: Carbon Capture and Storage\n \nCommittee on Climate Change - \nReducing the UK’s Carbon Footprint and Managing Competitiveness Risks\n \nCCS Cost Reduction Taskforce – Final Report\n \nDECC -\n \nPreferred Bidders Announced in UK’s £1bn CCS Competition\n \n \nCCS Cost Reduction Taskforce – Final Report\n"
