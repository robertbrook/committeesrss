defaultBACKGROUND TO SUBMISSION
defaultFirstly, I would like to thank the Government for giving me the opportunity to provide this submission to the Committee.
defaultI am 33 years old and am happily ma
defaultrried to my wife; of whom we have 2 children aged 7 and 5.  I am writing therefore in my capacity as a father with some experience, as well as with feelings for all fathers and mothers of children throughout the UK and across the globe.  As a parent I am a
defaultcutely aware of the many potential 
defaultthreats to our children’s safety, of which the internet is an ever present and increasing one; hence the reason for this submission.
defaultWhil
defaultst
default I
default am 
defaultnot a professional or seasoned campaigner
default, 
defaultI can honestly say that the follo
defaultwing information is given in good faith and is believed to be correct.  Any data provided was taken from Ofcom reports
default.
defaultPERSONAL EXPERIENCES AS FATHER OF A YOUNG FAMILY
defaultComputers and the internet are a fundamental part of life for our children, as they are
default for any children in the UK today. In a way that we adults did not, they are growing up with computer technology all around them.  Indeed, it is astounding how quickly
default—
defaultalmost naturally
default—
defaultthey pick it up.  My daughter has just turned 5 and cannot yet read
default, but even she can navigate with remarkable speed 
defaultthrough 
defaultwebsites 
defaultshe knows 
defaultto find the part she wants, simply by memorizing the position of the links and buttons!  It is abundantly clear and proven that the internet appeals to a child’s inquisitive natur
defaulte and their exploratory learning style; certainly that has been our experience, and it won’t be long before they are better at it than us.  
defaultThere is no doubt that the internet can be useful for children, particularly we have found it helpful for improving
default parts of our older child’s education.  But we are 
defaultvery
default thankful for the strong filters we have in place which allows 
defaultaccess to approved sites only.  This gives my wife and 
defaultI
default opportunity to check the content of sites carefully before allowing them to be vi
defaultsited by our children.  Even so, our children are only allowed to access the internet for timed, monitored periods and we certainly wouldn’t leave them alone during this time.   I know and they know
default—
defaultas we have taught them
default—
defaultthat the internet has hidden d
defaultangers that they are not able to cope with.  
defaultIn addition, too much computer activity tends to make 
defaultour 
defaultchildren less interested in outdoor activities and other necessary skills like writing and drawing.
default&#xa0;
defaultTHE NATIONAL SITUATION REGARDING ONLINE SAFETY
defaultThe 
defaultCommittee will no doubt be aware of the many statistics published by Ofcom on the subject of children and safety online.  Therefore it is not necessary for me to go into too much detail regarding the national situation
default; however I must point out that it is 
defaultvery clear from data gathered that many parents in the UK, unlike myself and my wife, are relatively unaware of how 
defaultpotent
default the hidden dangers of the internet are.  While most parents acknowledge that there should be some form of parental control, many do n
defaultot view the potential dangers as particularly serious so are not pro-active in controlling their children’s use; therefore they allow their children to spend long periods online alone without supervision and without controlling software.  This key fact cou
defaultld have a serious negative impact on UK society in the future if it is not properly addressed now.  This is of great
default concern to me.  A few key Ofcom findings bear this out:
defaultWHY ONLINE SAFETY FOR CHILDREN IS AN ISSUE WHICH NEEDS ACTION
defaultIt is undoubtedly a necessity that children are kept 
defaultsafe from harm wherever they are, and th
defaultis
default must include when they are on the internet.  The proliferation of social networking, video sharing, personal smartphones etc has made it even more vital that this issue is viewed seriously.  The reality is that pr
defaultactically every UK child is using the internet, and 80% of 12-15 year olds in the UK have an online profile.  Therefore children must be actively protected from the following
default (among others)
default:
defaultIt seems from 
defaultOfcom
default data that the issue is twofold:
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile most parents know that the internet has dangers, many do not consider them to be serious enough to pose a significant
default risk to their children.  Therefore there is a 
defaultlack of awareness
default.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis has meant that 
defaultparental control software
default, which is essential to maintain safety for children on all online devices, is not used nearly as widely as it needs to be.
default&#xa0;
defaultSUGGESTIONS OF ACTIO
defaultNS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO IMPROVE ONLINE SAFETY
defaultAs is the case for the care of children generally, the ultimate 
defaultresponsibility for ensuring children stay
default safe online lies with the
defaultir
default parents.  Parents need to speak to their children about online safety, imp
defaultose restrictions and controls, and maintain supervision at all times.  
defaultHowever, there are 2 things that I feel Government must do 
defaultfulfil their part in
default address
defaulting
default the issue of Online Safety for children:
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncrease parental awareness
default 
default—
default the dangers of the inte
defaultrnet do often seem remote and hypothetical, whereas they are in fact very real and present.  Government can use its considerable influence to help parents across the UK to realize this.   Parents need to be helped to understand that it is a basic responsib
defaultility to protect their children online,
default as
default much as it is basic to teach them how to cross the road safely.
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInsist on parental control 
defaultsoftware 
default 
default—
default  r
defaultather than leaving parents to investigate and install some kind of control software, Government must insist t
defaulthat ev
defaultery online device sold in the UK
default for personal use must come with parental control software pre-installed.  Ofcom’s findings absolutely support this suggestion.  They found that the primary reasons given for parental controls not being used were as fo
defaultllows:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to this, Ofcom
default reports that “when parents were asked whether they would install parental controls if the process was made very easy, almost all parents said they would do so.”
defaultI look forward to hearing the results of the Committee’s inquiry, and look forward to hearing 
defaultabout the Government action which is sure to follow. 
defaultMany thanks again for the opportunity to provide this submission.
