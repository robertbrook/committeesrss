[normal]Q39 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Welcome 
[normal]to 
[normal]everyone here this morning. Thank you very much for coming. The subject of our inquiry has 
[normal]coincidentally
[normal] captured some media
[normal] attention, with a piece on 
[normal]regional BBC news the night before last
[normal] and
[normal] on the BBC 
[normal]“
[normal]Inside Out
[normal]” programme on TB
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]n London
[normal],
[normal] and today the Wellcome Trust on Radio 4 
[normal]was 
[normal]talking about antimicrobial
[normal] resistance as well. F
[normal]rom discussions we have had with Dame Sally Davies
[normal],
[normal] we realise that t
[normal]his is an area of some 
[normal]concern, so w
[normal]e want to cover a 
[normal]number of aspects 
[normal]this morning
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]J
[normal]ust for the record
[normal],
[normal] I would be grateful if the four of you would introduce yourselves very briefly.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]I am Professor Anthony 
[normal]Kessel
[normal]. I am director of public health strategy and the responsible officer at Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal]. I also have a chair at
[normal] the London School of
[normal] Hygiene and
[normal] Tropical Medicine.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]I am Michael Moore
[normal]. I am a general practitioner. 
[normal]I have been a GP in 
[normal]Salisbury
[normal] for 26 years. I al
[normal]so hold a research post at the U
[normal]niversity of Southampton. I am here today as I am representing the Royal College of General Practitioners. I am their national clinical champion for antimicrobial stewardship.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: I am Alison Holmes. I am 
[normal]professor of i
[normal]nfectious diseases at Imperial C
[normal]ollege London
[normal],
[normal] and I am also a director of infection prevention and control within the NHS.
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]My name is Susan Hopkins and I am a consultant in infectious diseases and 
[normal]microbiology at the Royal Free H
[normal]ospital in London. I also work with Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal] as a healthcare epidemiologist. I am here today representing the Royal College of Physicians as chair of their HCAI working group.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q40 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair: [bold]Thank you very much. First of all
[normal], a straightforward question: w
[normal]ho is currently accountable for ensuring adherence to the Department of Health policies for reducing antimicrobial resistance? 
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: At an NHS level—
[normal]from the p
[normal]oint of view within the NHS—
[normal]the Health and Social Care Act 2008
[normal],
[normal] updated in 2011
[normal],
[normal] clearly gives responsibility for health
[normal] 
[normal]care
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]associated
[normal] infections, antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship to the chief responsible officer, the chief executive of those organisations. There is also a personal responsibility within 
[normal]the
[normal] Health and Social Care Act for everyone working in health
[normal] 
[normal]care to prevent infection spreading from one patient to the other and to make sure that they use antibiotics as prudently as possible.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]Within acute care and acute hospitals, the structure is such that the chief executive is responsible for the delivery of that
[normal],
[normal] but there is a director of infec
[normal]tion prevention and control who
[normal] reports directly to the chief executive
[normal],
[normal] with the responsibility of addressing infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship within that trust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q41 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]We hear of clinician
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]focused
[normal] initiatives like 
[normal]“Start Smart—Then F
[normal]ocus
[normal]”
[normal]. How effective are initiatives like that in dealing with issues like antimicrobial resistance?
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]We welcome 
[normal]such 
[normal]initiatives
[normal].
[normal]. I particularly welcome initiatives such as that
[normal],
[normal] because it actually focuses on the principles of good prescribing rather than the kind of technical expertise of which drug, what type of organism
[normal]; 
[normal]it 
[normal]actually 
[normal]focuses on safe and best practice
[normal],
[normal] which means that it is much more amenable to all of t
[normal]hose involved in 
[normal]prescribing
[normal] antibiotics,
[normal] administering antibiotics or caring for patients on antibiotics. That type of approach is extremely welcome, but we must remi
[normal]nd ourselves that it is not a policy;
[normal] it is a guideline
[normal]. I
[normal]t is a framework that can be adopted to promote best practice within acute care. I 
[normal]welcome the fact that it emphasises best practice and p
[normal]rinciples of good prescribing. 
[normal]We have used it locally to promote multi
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]professional
[normal] engagement, so it is not just for doctors who prescribe; it is for nurses who look after
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]it is 
[normal]for pharmacists who are involved in the managing of drugs. 
[normal]I
[normal]t has been a useful external reinforcement. 
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: O
[normal]ne of the key things is ensuring that we get the best agent to the patient up
[normal] 
[normal]front to reduce morbidity and mortality from sepsis, so we often start broadly. One of the key things in 
[normal]“Start Smart—Then F
[normal]ocus
[normal]”
[normal] is focusing down after two to three days of treatment into a n
[normal]arrow agent that has less 
[normal]impact on both the microbiology in the individual patient 
[normal]and
[normal] the microbiology in the environment of the hospital that can then 
[normal]lead to
[normal] onward transmission events within hospitals. One of the things about 
[normal]“Start S
[normal]mart
[normal]—Then F
[normal]ocus
[normal]”
[normal] is that it focuses the need for good microbiology and diagnostics up
[normal] 
[normal]front and requires people to think about
[normal] what they need at the start. It requires
[normal] education and train
[normal]ing of individuals to know 
[normal]the right tests to do when a
[normal]n unwell
[normal] pa
[normal]tient comes into hospital
[normal]. 
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]It is altering the message slightly, which I think is really important. This is not all about control of antibiotics; it is access to effective antibiotics
[normal], so 
[normal]starting sma
[normal]rt is a critical component
[normal]. What we need, though, is teeth around these things. This is a 
[normal]very useful 
[normal]guideline
[normal], 
[normal]but it would be useful to have a little bit more regulation
[normal].
[normal] I am speaking for acute trusts
[normal],
[normal] and my collea
[normal]gue can talk about primary care,
[normal] but in terms of acute trusts it would be quite useful if we started to look at process indicators and best practice
[normal], and got a 
[normal]bit more teeth around what is good pra
[normal]ctice. A
[normal]t the end of 
[normal]“Start Smart” there i
[normal]s a variety of guidelines, but it would be useful if we could tell trusts that they need to deliver on this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q42 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] I
[normal]s the message the same
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]n primary care?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]It is complicated in primary care because you are talking about individual practitioners who are self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed
[normal]. T
[normal]hey sit in their office
[normal],
[normal] and they are the people controlling the prescription pad, as it were. They are much more distant from these kinds of 
[normal]initiatives and regulation. I
[normal]t is much more difficult to influence them. We have obviously made attempts with the 
[normal]TARGET
[normal] website, which is a collection of educational tools for GPs to teach them about more rational prescribing, but we cannot force people to do these things and we cannot force them to change. It is much more difficult to influence individual GPs
[normal],
[normal] and at the moment there are not
[normal] any regulatory approaches that
[normal] do that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q43 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Have 
[normal]the new structures that have been e
[normal]stablished in the NHS 
[normal]helped or hindered this process?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: I
[normal]t has disrupted continuity and it is less clear now 
[normal]on 
[normal]the mechanisms for influence than it was before. I am sure things will sort themselves out with time, but when there were PCTs there were prescribing advisers within the
[normal]m
[normal] and they communicated with the GPs in their patch, whereas 
[normal]now 
[normal]they have b
[normal]een made homeless; they are 
[normal]finding themselves, I think, back in Public Health England. A big organisational change is disruptive, so I do not think at the moment we are quite clear how to influence GPs. They are contracted through the area teams, which is NHS England work
[normal]ing through the area teams. 
[normal]I anticipate that in time they will be looking at things like antimicrobial stewardship
[normal],
[normal] but at the moment that is not at the top of their priority list.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q44 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Who has the responsibility overall to pull that together?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]I guess that resides with NHS England
[normal], which then contract 
[normal]GPs through the area teams.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q45 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Do you think that current undergraduate medical courses focus enough on antimicrobial resistance
[normal], and,
[normal] if not, what should be done about it, please?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal] first thing to say is that 
[normal]undergraduate medical courses are at the moment both regulated and have standards applied by the General Medical Council. I reviewed the curricula for those courses recently
[normal],
[normal] and what the GMC says is that they should have some training in microbiology, and microbiology obviously includes looking at micro
[normal]-
[normal]organisms and resistance. It also mentions that it is important to understand the principles of infection prevention and control
[normal],
[normal] and antibiotic prescribing. 
[normal]W
[normal]e know that there is variability in the 
[normal]number 
[normal]of hours of training that are given to medical students across the country. It is an area that has had various amounts of attention
[normal],
[normal] depending on the s
[normal]kills that the university set. 
[normal]Potentially there is an opportunity now with the AMR strategy to bring this to the fore, both with the General Medical Council and with Health Education England
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]talk to them about strengthening that area of their curriculum. Obviously every area of the curriculum fights for its support and i
[normal]ts necessary niche, but 
[normal]it i
[normal]s an area that cross
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]cuts
[normal] all
[normal] the delivery of medicine
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in that
[normal] we know that every individual who works as a doctor will prescribe an antibiotic du
[normal]ring their day
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]to
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]day life. I
[normal]t could be 
[normal]strengthened, but it is 
[normal]in the curriculum at 
[normal]present
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q46 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Who 
[normal]d
[normal]o you think should be responsible for the curriculum content of medical degrees?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]The General Medical Council is a very good place to start with the curriculum content
[normal],
[normal] as they are responsible for doctors and for their revalidation in the future. Health Education England
[normal]’
[normal]s new role of delivering an effective work
[normal] 
[normal]force has to start to develop what it wants undergraduate curricula to look like across the board for health work
[normal] 
[normal]force delivery. 
[normal]The GMC set the standards and review
[normal] the universities
[normal]—attend universities and review whether
[normal] they are meeting the minimum standards that are required
[normal]—
[normal]but the question is whether those standards need to be enhanced at the moment to make sure that we bring this
[normal],
[normal] as an area of patient safety
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]across the board and improve i
[normal]t for undergraduate health
[normal] 
[normal]care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q47 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Much of the Government
[normal]’
[normal]s antimicrobial resistance strategy, perhaps naturally
[normal], focused on increasing supply—
[normal]looking at new ways of finding antibiotics and looking at encouraging
[normal] drug companies to produce them.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ould you agree that we should be looking at reducing demand much more and looking at some of the other options that are currently available, perhaps not tested as much as other drugs, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine and possi
[normal]bly hom
[normal]eopathic medicine, which is used widely outside this country? What do you think 
[normal]about reducing demand through looking at other options
[normal],
[normal] and should more research money be spent on these topics?
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: One of the good opportunities in
[normal] the new strategy is co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordination around professional education and public awareness. That goes not just for doctors, both undergraduate and postgraduate
[normal]—
[normal]we have only talked about undergraduate medicine here
[normal]—
[normal]but across other health
[normal] 
[normal]care professionals who are all involved in antimicro
[normal]bial resistance and play a part.
[normal] Public Health England will play a big role in 
[normal]the 
[normal]co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordination of that improved professional education. In relation to your question about other ways of reducing demand, I think, yes, one of those includes greater public awareness
[normal], so that the public—patients—
[normal]make 
[normal]fewer
[normal] unnecessary demands, or inappropriate demands, for antibiotics. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is important in terms of what is prov
[normal]ided that it is evidence based—
[normal]that you are providing treatment or interventions that are evidence based. Some of the things that are encouraged in the strategy around alternatives to antibiotics include vaccines against bacteria and more work on diagnostics that can assist 
[normal]in 
[normal]appropriate prescribing and those kinds of things.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]Could I pick up on the education questions and expand 
[normal]on what my colleague was saying?
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he GMC is responsible
[normal],
[normal] but the universities can deliver that in a 
[normal]variety
[normal] of ways
[normal],
[normal] and some UKCRC
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]funded
[normal] work has just demonstrated the enormous variability in the education provided in our medical schools, from a range of five hours to over 240 hours in 
[normal]this domain. I
[normal]t is there, 
[normal]but 
[normal]there is a huge amount of variability
[normal],
[normal] and this 
[normal]is
[normal] looking at antibi
[normal]otic safety and antibiotic use 
[normal]as a kind of core aspect of training that
[normal] maybe goes across 
[normal]all people involved in health
[normal] 
[normal]care. We are talking about medical students here, but we should also be talking about our pharmacists and nurses as well
[normal],
[normal] perhaps having some kind of core principles
[normal],
[normal] and then, on top of that, different types of education depending on the profession a
[normal]nd the type of development the 
[normal]individual needs. There is enormous variability, but we can do a lot more 
[normal]to
[normal] improve it
[normal],
[normal] and look at innovation and how we teach as well.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]want
[normal] to come back to the alternative treatments for symptoms. Most antibiotics in this country are prescribed in primary care
[normal]—
[normal]80% is the estimated amount
[normal]—
[normal]and most of those are for respiratory tract infections
[normal],
[normal] which are self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]limiting. It has been shown that antibiotics make very little difference to th
[normal]e outcome from those infections. P
[normal]eople still go 
[normal]to see their doctor 
[normal]because they 
[normal]are very uncomfortable and 
[normal]have distressing symptoms
[normal],
[normal] which last two or three weeks
[normal], and a
[normal]t the moment the 
[normal]doctor’s 
[normal]dominant strategy is to issue 
[normal]a prescription. Around 80% to 
[normal]90% of the time
[normal],
[normal] a prescription for antibiotics is still issued. 
[normal]O
[normal]bviously there are alternative things that we have looked at
[normal],
[normal] li
[normal]ke using delayed prescriptions, 
[normal]but another potential strategy is to offer somethi
[normal]ng for symptom relief. T
[normal]here is an urgent need to look for alternative ways of providing symptom relief. People go to their do
[normal]ctor with symptoms and they anticipate
[normal] 
[normal]getting 
[normal]something to help them. At the moment there is not much in the cupboard and people go to antibiotics, although we really are pretty sure that t
[normal]hey do not make any difference—
[normal]or 
[normal]very little difference—
[normal]to the duration of symptoms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q48 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] 
[normal]Just to make sure I understood it correctly, the most common use of them, you said, is for respiratory infections.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]Yes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q49 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] 
[normal]Everybody knows, apparently, that they do not work, so who is prescribing them?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]They are being prescribed by GPs in their surgeries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q50 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] 
[normal]Are they not aware of what everybody else knows?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]It is a complicated interaction and at the mo
[normal]ment there are few alternatives.
[normal] 
[normal]You might 
[normal]say, 
[normal]“
[normal]Why do
[normal]n’t people just
[normal] stop prescribing them?
[normal]”
[normal], but that does not happen
[normal],
[normal] so we have to find other ways of helping that hap
[normal]pen. You can do it by saying, “T
[normal]here is a d
[normal]ifferent way. Wait a few days. W
[normal]e a
[normal]re using a delayed prescription.” W
[normal]e can use near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]patient
[normal] tests
[normal],
[normal] which per
[normal]haps focus on the people who 
[normal]need antibiotics
[normal],
[normal] and we can find alternative symptom r
[normal]elievers. 
[normal]One of the things people worry about 
[normal]is complications;
[normal] I think there wa
[normal]s something in the paper today about 
[normal]somebody who did not get antibiotics and then died as a result of pneumonia. 
[normal]When people
[normal] go to the doctor
[normal] with a bad cough,
[normal] feeling pretty terrible
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]they are worried
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]they 
[normal]are 
[normal]going to get pneumonia. The doctor really does not know if they are going to get pneumonia or not. It is the same if you have a very bad sore throat: are you going to get an abscess in your throat? 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of the drivers of that continued prescribing is being risk averse, worryin
[normal]g about potential complications, so, “
[normal]I will give you these antibiotics because I do not want you to get one of those bad complications.
[normal]” W
[normal]e need to get much more sophisticated about sp
[normal]otting the people who really 
[normal]need the antibiotics and the majority who simply do not need them. 
[normal]A
[normal]nother focus for research 
[normal]is 
[normal]to try and do that, but it is difficult. It is not as easy as you might think to spot those people.
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: It is appropriate versus 
[normal]inappropriate antibiotic prescribing
[normal]; 
[normal]we talk about this a lot. It is very easy in retrospect to describe inappropriate prescribing
[normal],
[normal] because you have seen how the patient
[normal] has gone over a few days. I
[normal]n a way, managing antibiotics in hospital comes under that measure
[normal],
[normal] because we monitor the patient daily for a few days. That is why 
[normal]“Start Smart—Then F
[normal]ocus
[normal]”
[normal] works
[normal];
[normal] at two days
[normal],
[normal] you can make that intervention. Where the majority of antibiotics are prescribed
[normal],
[normal] in general practice
[normal],
[normal] you have a 10
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]minute interaction
[normal],
[normal] you will not see the patient again and they can potentially get much worse. It is about understanding
[normal],
[normal] first of all
[normal],
[normal] which patients are likely to get worse and, 
[normal]secondly
[normal], delivering strategies that are acceptable to patients. Patient acceptability is quite important in all of this as well
[normal]. The aspect
[normal] where we need research
[normal], 
[normal]ou
[normal]tside of development of new drugs, is 
[normal]point
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]care
[normal] tests that are acceptable to patients that will help us diagnose a virus from a bacteria
[normal],
[normal] because you cannot do that simply by looking at a patient. We know that 80
[normal]% to 
[normal]90% are viruses, but we do not know the 10
[normal]% to 
[normal]20% that are not
[normal],
[normal] when the patient is in front of us.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q51 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] 
[normal]Is part of it to retain the confidence of the patient? They
[normal] expect to get a prescription and 
[normal]they get a prescription
[normal],
[normal] even though it is medically dubious.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]Not all of them are expecting a prescription. In fact, one of the things you can do is to explore the expectations of the patient
[normal],
[normal] and we have shown that training in communication skills is one way of reduc
[normal]ing antibiotic prescribing. T
[normal]here are ways of dealing with that but you have to get people to pick up and implement these things at practice level. 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]We are going to come back to this theme in a moment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q52 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Briefly
[normal],
[normal] just to go back to my suggestion that we should be looking at other options m
[normal]ore thoroughly, according to a
[normal] briefing we have received, 
[normal]“
[normal]P
[normal]rimary
[normal] C
[normal]are
[normal] R
[normal]esearch
[normal] P
[normal]rojects on
[normal] H
[normal]erbal
[normal] M
[normal]edicine in
[normal] I
[normal]nfectious
[normal] D
[normal]isease
[normal],
[normal]”
[normal] already 
[normal]“
[normal]A number of research projects with implications for AMR, particularly around herbal treatment, are in progress at the National School for Primary Care Research.
[normal]”
[normal] These include one on a herb called 
[normal]Uva
[normal] 
[normal]ursi
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] acute urinary tract infection and another relating to 
[normal]probiotics
[normal] and vitamin D and infections. Do you not think
[normal] this is the big clue 
[normal]that we should be spending more money on looking at remedies that have been with us for thousands of years
[normal],
[normal] rather than spending so much money looking at new treatments? They are staring us in the face
[normal],
[normal] so why do
[normal]n’t we 
[normal]do more research on treatments that have been available for thousands of years?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]I am the chief investigator of the 
[normal]Uva
[normal] 
[normal]ursi
[normal] study, so you are 
[normal]trying to convince
[normal] the wrong person really. I lead that research. 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So you are very much
[normal] involved
[normal], well recently obviously
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]Yes.
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you very much. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q53 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Before we move
[normal] on, can I 
[normal]ask how involved is Health Education England in respect of the medical curric
[normal]ulum as far as AMR is concerned, a
[normal]nd
[normal],
[normal] at the opposite end of the spectrum
[normal],
[normal] are doctors coming into the NHS from other countries sufficiently well versed in dealing with our approach to AMR?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]I will take the second 
[normal]part 
[normal]first
[normal],
[normal] as it is easier in my day
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]to
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]day job to understand what we do. When doctors come into the UK
[normal],
[normal] they register with the General Medical Council showing that they have standard competencies to achieve that registration. Once they are within the system
[normal],
[normal] every doctor starting within the NHS system in health
[normal] 
[normal]care
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]hospit
[normal]als or in a training programme—
[normal]that includes GP training programmes or any train
[normal]ing programme within hospitals—has
[normal] a minimum
[normal],
[normal] mandatory day that they have to cover
[normal]; i
[normal]t includes infection prevention and control
[normal] and
[normal] antimicrobial stewardship as a basic minimum on the day they start. The curricula for all hospital doctors 
[normal]all 
[normal]include basic requirements on microbiology infection control and antimicrobials stewardship
[normal],
[normal] and it is required that they have this knowledge and awareness as they are progressing t
[normal]hrough the system. All the post
[normal]graduate 
[normal]exams have some aspect of this
[normal]. 
[normal]Could it be strengthened? Of course. I am speaking as an infectious diseases physician; I obviously believe it should have gr
[normal]eat priority on all the post
[normal]graduate curricula
[normal]. W
[normal]e push for that as the Royal College of Physicians
[normal],
[normal] a
[normal]nd have pushed to strengthen i
[normal]t throughout all of the curricula at the Royal Colleg
[normal]e of Physicians. It is there;
[normal] it is present. I would never say it 
[normal]was
[normal] enough
[normal],
[normal] but that is coming from the area that I am in. 
[normal]Now
[normal] is an opportunity to make sure that we have raised awareness again with people who are not specialists in this area
[normal],
[normal] to ensure that they understand why they should not prescribe, what are the unnecessary consequences and, in particular, to think about it as 
[normal]a whole-
[normal]population approach
[normal] 
[normal]rather 
[normal]than 
[normal]just the individual sitting in front of them. As doctors, we very much think about the individual in 
[normal]front of us
[normal]; 
[normal]antimicrobial resistance really focuses us to think about the population and the impact 
[normal]a
[normal] prescription may ha
[normal]ve on somebody down the line. 
[normal]With respect to Health Education England, as a new organisation they have been very much focusing on postgraduate training across 
[normal]the health care work force,
[normal] as their remit is the NHS work
[normal] 
[normal]force. 
[normal]T
[normal]hey are there to help
[normal] to develop 
[normal]the undergraduate curricula
[normal],
[normal] and I look forward to their impact in this area.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]The education of professionals is complex and 
[normal]multifactorial
[normal]. On top of 
[normal]the 
[normal]educational packages for doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others involved, there are
[normal]—
[normal]and the new strategy has provided
[normal]—
[normal]a range of other educational material
[normal]s
[normal] being developed already
[normal]. I
[normal]n Public Health England
[normal],
[normal] we are preparing prescribing quality guidelines for primary and secondary care. NICE
[normal], 
[normal]the National Institute for Health and 
[normal]Care
[normal] Excellence
[normal], 
[normal]along with Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal],
[normal] are already preparing new good practice guidance, clinical guidance and public healt
[normal]h guidance—three sets of guidance—on
[normal] antimi
[normal]crobial resistance. T
[normal]he strategy has enabled us to ramp up the priority attention that has been given to antimicrobial resistance
[normal], and 
[normal]provides us w
[normal]ith an excellent opportunity. 
[normal]In terms of Health 
[normal]Education England and its role on 
[normal]the professional educat
[normal]ion strand of the new strategy, 
[normal]the overall co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordination is falling to Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal].
[normal] I am the policy lead for Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal],
[normal] so 
[normal]I chair the co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordination group, and
[normal] Health Education England 
[normal]is
[normal] on that group. Just 
[normal]as
[normal] the strategy is only relatively new
[normal]—
[normal]a few months
[normal]—
[normal]Health Education England and indeed ourselves are relatively new
[normal],
[normal] so we are settling down
[normal],
[normal] but we
[normal],
[normal] Public Health England
[normal],
[normal] are absolutely dependent on working with partners like Health Education England to e
[normal]nsure further improvements in
[normal] prescribing education.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]Could I expand on the perspective from the acute NHS trust side of things? Echoing what Susan says, acute hospitals have a framework
[normal], so i
[normal]t does not matter w
[normal]here doctors join them from;
[normal] they should have an infrastructure and a framework that actually supports, encourages and drives good prescribing around the principles of good prescribing. The other thing is that prescribers and doctors are not doing this in iso
[normal]lation. 
[normal]There is a mu
[normal]ltidisciplinary programme for
[normal] how we look after antibiotics, monitor 
[normal]them and
[normal] ensure that best practice is there. 
[normal]I
[normal]f the systems are there
[normal]—
[normal]the trusts should have these systems in place
[normal]—
[normal]it really should not matter where doctors come from.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q54 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]Dr Moore, you talked about the distance between initiatives and GPs. Is one way of narrowing that distance through the use of continued professional development
[normal]—
[normal]CPD
[normal]—
[normal]and how much control is there over what is studied as part of your continuous professional development
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal]ould antimicrobial resis
[normal]tance form a greater part of i
[normal]t?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: That is the way forward. 
[normal]GPs are mandated to continue professional education. They have an annual appraisal process at which their educational attainments are discussed with an appraiser, but at the moment they are independent contractors and they choose, or choose with their appraiser, what their development needs are. I do not think at the moment that antimicrobial resistance and rational prescribing are high on the agenda. There are lots of other new thi
[normal]ngs, huge pressures and 
[normal]a massive curriculum for GPs to try and keep up with
[normal],
[normal] and they are probably pretty comfortable with their day
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]to
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]day stuff. They have been in practice for 20 
[normal]years prescribing antibiotics; 
[normal]people do not come back because they 
[normal]get better.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hey are not really thinking about looking in a critical way at their prescribing practice and 
[normal]doing educational activities. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of the difficulties
[normal] is 
[normal]that there will be 
[normal]100
[normal] other things 
[normal]GPs will be 
[normal]asked to look at
[normal],
[normal] and they will not be critically looking at their 
[normal]antibiotic prescribing. 
[normal]Dame Sally Davies
[normal]’s
[normal] annual report highlighting antimicrobial resistance is really helpful and the strategy is helpful, but these are words on paper in Government offices and they do not 
[normal]really filter down 
[normal]to the man or woman behind the desk with the prescribing pad.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q55 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] How do you change that—b
[normal]y the assessor making it more of a priority? 
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: The mechanism for change would be 
[normal]somehow 
[normal]to 
[normal]raise the priority level so that it is discussed in the ap
[normal]praisal process and people 
[normal]take up educational initiatives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q56 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]Who is responsible for raising that priority?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]I do not know the mechanism, but you have someone 
[normal]here 
[normal]who knows the answer to that.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: O
[normal]ne of the points being made is 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have, I believe, an ambitious and very important strategy, but we must not underestimate the enormity of the challenge of implementing 
[normal]it,
[normal] and making the changes required nationally and internationally for what is a very significant problem. 
[normal]W
[normal]hat Dr Moore has also highlighted is the gap between the strategy and its ambitions and the greater opportunity with implementation 
[normal]at ground level. 
[normal]I echo some of that as a former GP 
[normal]mys
[normal]elf. 
[normal]T
[normal]he new system of revalidat
[normal]ion
[normal] for doctors in this country that the General Medical Council introduced earlier this year
[normal]—
[normal]which 
[normal]in 
[normal]the responsible officer part of my role I am responsib
[normal]le for in Public Health England—
[normal]provide
[normal]s 
[normal]a really good opportunity
[normal] 
[normal]to strengthen the appraisal process. A significant part of that
[normal]—
[normal]I am already seeing it through in the new style of appraisals that are required annually for every consultant, specialist and GP
[normal]—
[normal]is greater attention to continue
[normal]d professional development. But,
[normal] to my knowledge at the moment, there is not a way of specifying, 
[normal]whichever specialty you are in—
[normal]public health ph
[normal]ysician or general practitioner—
[normal]what should be in the CPD, what you should be doing. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is an opportunity. The 
[normal]Royal C
[normal]olleges and the Faculty of Public Health have a part
[normal] to play in that, and I think i
[normal]t is an interesting idea.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q57 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]By mandating it, by making it obligatory.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]Of influencing, yes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q58 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] R
[normal]evalidation, the appraisal system as it stands at the moment, will be different depending on who is carrying out that appraisal. It does not contain the same
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]Yes and no. The appraisal process, whichever specialty of medic
[normal]ine you are in—
[normal]whether you are a microbiologist, a general practitioner or 
[normal]a public health physician—
[normal]covers the same domains of medical practice and areas of importance
[normal]. 
[normal]When you go into the details of it with your appraiser, you will focus on the area
[normal] relevant to your specialty. 
[normal]A
[normal]ntimicrobial resistance is obviously important whether you are a paediatrician, a public health physician, 
[normal]or 
[normal]a GP and so forth.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: T
[normal]here are enormous opportunities to use the appraisal and revalidation process
[normal]es
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]e are 
[normal]talking just about medics here, 
[normal]but 
[normal]I think 
[normal]we can look at 
[normal]the roles of all health professionals
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]this
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]ne opportunity is also framing this in terms of patient safety and the quality of care. 
[normal]I
[normal]t does not need to be a technical
[normal],
[normal] s
[normal]eparate little bit of expertise. I
[normal]t can be about the overall delivery of quality of care and patient safety
[normal],
[normal] and you can frame that bit of the appraisal to fit in addressing antimicrobial resistance as an aspect of patient safety and quality of care
[normal]. Y
[normal]ou can use that
[normal], and 
[normal]I think t
[normal]here are enormous opportunities.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n fact
[normal],
[normal] that addresses one of the issues about stakeholder engagement, which is not just all about stakeholder engagement with the public
[normal], but 
[normal]stakeholder engagement with other health
[normal] 
[normal]care professionals
[normal]. T
[normal]he appraisal and CPD mechanism may be a great opportunity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q59 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you for that. I take it, therefore, from your answers that there is at the moment no effective way of monitoring the use of ant
[normal]imicrobials within GP practices.
[normal] There is no national monitoring going on.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]To some extent
[normal],
[normal] there has been a policy to reduce the presc
[normal]ribing of some antibiotics that
[normal] are associated with 
[normal]C. 
[normal]diff infections
[normal]—
[normal]quinolones
[normal] and 
[normal]cephalosporins
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]hose things have been m
[normal]onitored and fed back to practic
[normal]es and there has been quite a dramatic change in 
[normal]the 
[normal]prescribing 
[normal]of those antibiotics 
[normal]in primary care. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is possible to specifically focus on an antibiotic and to deliver that through the quality mechanisms for primary care
[normal],
[normal] and to implement change
[normal]. I
[normal]t is not entirely true that there is no mechanism. It is simply that general antimicrobial stewardship has not been part of one of those approaches.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q60 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] It works on individual specified drugs at the moment, rather than taking a wider view of use generally.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]Yes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q61 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]With the examples you used 
[normal]for
[normal] C. diff, were 
[normal]there 
[normal]or are there any consequences if you discovered that someone was continually overprescribing that particular antimicrobial?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]The feedb
[normal]ack takes the form of a traffic-
[normal]light chart
[normal],
[normal] and you are green, amber or red. I guess it is up to your professional standards
[normal],
[normal] if you are persistently showing red on the traffic light
[normal],
[normal] to change your behaviour or not, but there are n
[normal]ot any sanctions for people who
[normal] do not change their behaviour.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q62 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]Do you think there should be?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: T
[normal]he new mechanisms with CCGs are an opportunity
[normal],
[normal] because they are slightly more grounded in practice
[normal],
[normal] and I think that there will be greater pressures brought to bear as 
[normal]a result of being in a CCG rather than a PCT
[normal].
[normal] I am not a great fan of regulatory big
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]stick
[normal] approaches
[normal],
[normal] but there may be a case for some kind of sanction for people 
[normal]who
[normal] persistently do that. 
[normal]P
[normal]eople will always say
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]I did it in this instance
[normal],”
[normal] and you do not know
[normal] what the drivers are; 
[normal]you are not the clinician in the consultation
[normal], and
[normal] I think it is a mistake to have absolutes.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: I
[normal]t is a complex picture that you get in primary care
[normal]—
[normal]the same goes for secondary care
[normal], to get a picture for us—
[normal]on the amount of antimicrobial resistance
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e will want to look at antibiotic prescribing
[normal],
[normal] but also antibiotic usage
[normal],
[normal] which might not be the same as prescribing
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]lso the real end result, th
[normal]e amount of resistance 
[normal]in infections in primary care
[normal],
[normal] which will be different from secondary care
[normal],
[normal] is equally important. Again, we do not have at the moment all those surveillance systems set up optimally, but the strategy provides us with the opportunity to work towards those
[normal],
[normal] and we are. My experience has been that, thankfully, in this country we are not at a standing start in terms of our general surveillance systems for health
[normal] 
[normal]care
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]associated
[normal] infectio
[normal]ns and antimicrobial resistance. W
[normal]e have one of the best sets of systems in the world
[normal], and my experience, 
[normal]travelling to other countries, is 
[normal]that 
[normal]often we are the envy. But we are thinking about ways that we can share good practice. I was recently with the chief medical officer at the World Innovation Summit for Health conference. We were talking about ways that different countries could share their good practices, fo
[normal]r instance around surveillance—
[normal]both high i
[normal]ncome and low income countries—
[normal]which is I think something we have to do.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: I want to raise an
[normal] issue about the critical role of pharmacists
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ith some of the changes
[normal],
[normal] it is not quite so clear what their roles are now in primary care. Within secondary care
[normal],
[normal] the role of our pharmacists is absolutely critical in working in a multidisciplinary way to address this issue
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]looking at prescribing, 
[normal]monitoring prescribing
[normal] and 
[normal]being involved in the f
[normal]eedback within the organisation
[normal] so 
[normal]that 
[normal]prescribing can be performance
[normal]-
[normal]monitored at the level 
[normal]of directorate, division, unit and
[normal] individual
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e completely rely on our pharmacists to work with us in this
[normal], and with the changes that
[normal] will become clear in primary care. 
[normal]The other thing that is going to be important 
[normal]for us 
[normal]is that we address this as a whole health
[normal] 
[normal]care economy
[normal], so that
[normal] we are not addressing it in acute care and primary care but really bring
[normal]ing
[normal] it together
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is completely artific
[normal]ial and 
[normal]nonsense to do it 
[normal]completely 
[normal]separately.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q63 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]Dr Moore, you mentioned the horror story of someone contracting pneumonia after not being prescribed antibiotics
[normal],
[normal] and we know about the effect resistance is having on TB
[normal], 
[normal]here in 
[normal]London
[normal], and gonorrhoea—
[normal]the two that we talk about. Are there other examples? Are these just horror stori
[normal]es? I am thinking of my family. 
[normal]I am sure everyone in this room was 
[normal]either 
[normal]ill or had a family member who was ill over the Christmas break
[normal],
[normal] and many were running to the doctor. As a result of this inquiry, I spent a lot of time persuading my family members that they did not need to go to the doctor, and
[normal] I even had a pharmacist
[normal] trying to tell me to go to the doctor and get an antibiotic. 
[normal]A
[normal]re these horror stories
[normal],
[normal] or could you give us a better understanding of what the dangers are of not prescribing antibiotics?
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: I
[normal]f you compare areas with high and low antibiotic prescribing in England
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the evidence shows 
[normal]that if you move to a lower prescribing area there are more episodes of infection 
[normal]such as
[normal] quinsy, which is a throat infection 
[normal]that
[normal] is a complication of a sore throat. 
[normal]T
[normal]hey are very rare complications
[normal], but if you prescribe less 
[normal]you will se
[normal]e more of those complications. 
[normal]The same applies to prescribing for chesty coughs or bronchitis. If you do less 
[normal]prescribing, there will be a few more cases of pn
[normal]eumonia seen as a result. T
[normal]hose complications are rare and are usually treatable rather than untrea
[normal]table. I
[normal]f you move to 
[normal]a lower prescribing environment, 
[normal]y
[normal]ou will see, as a result
[normal], a small increase in more serious infections
[normal]. T
[normal]hat will be a k
[normal]ind of consequence
[normal] of that public health strategy. The positive side is that you are going to reduce antimicrobial resistance in the future
[normal], and t
[normal]he future we might be looking at in 20 years
[normal]’
[normal] time is that
[normal],
[normal] if you develop pneumonia
[normal],
[normal] you will have an untreatable infection
[normal],
[normal] and that may be fatal
[normal]. T
[normal]here is a kind of a pay
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]off
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]but it
[normal] is a difficult place to be
[normal],
[normal] to say, 
[normal]“
[normal]If we do this globally now, there will be a few more cases of pneumonia and serious infections
[normal],
[normal] but in the future we will have antibiotics which still work
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]f we just prescribe indiscriminately now, we will prevent a few of those infections
[normal],
[normal] but in the future we
[normal] won’t
[normal] be able to treat people.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e need to be honest about that in the public debate about antibiotic prescribing
[normal],
[normal] and we need to be smarter about spotting
[normal] the people who really need 
[normal]antibiotics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q64 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] S
[normal]o
[normal] so
[normal]me of this could be mitigated with better
[normal] or alternative treatments.
[normal] 
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]There are various approaches to doing that
[normal],
[normal] and one of them, as I mentioned before, is the delayed prescription
[normal],
[normal] where you say to somebody, 
[normal]“
[normal]You do not need an antibiotic now, but
[normal],
[normal] if you do not get better in four or five days
[normal]’
[normal] time, you do not have to come back and see me but you can take this prescription at that point.
[normal]”
[normal] That reduces prescribing in sore throats, say, from 90% down to about 40%. 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou get much less antibiotic uptake by using that. You ne
[normal]ed to use strategies where you have what we call a 
[normal]safety ne
[normal]t,
[normal] which is 
[normal]that 
[normal]you say to people, 
[normal]“
[normal]You do not need an antibiotic now, but these are the things that you need to look out for and I would want you to re
[normal]-
[normal]consult for.
[normal]”
[normal] In other words, if people are deteriorating or getting worse
[normal],
[normal] they 
[normal]should 
[normal]seek further medical advice. Another strategy is to use near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]patient
[normal] tests
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]or instance, in people 
[normal]who present 
[normal]with chest infections, there i
[normal]s a near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]patient
[normal] test available that
[normal] moderately increases your ability to detect or determine who does and does not need antibiotics, although the
[normal]re is a grey area in the middle; p
[normal]eople with very high scores almost certainly do need antibiotics and people with very low scores almos
[normal]t certainly do not, but there are
[normal] still a number of pe
[normal]ople in the middle, o
[normal]n whom you are uncertain. 
[normal]W
[normal]e can get smarter and 
[normal]we can 
[normal]use delayed prescribing, we can use effective safety net advice and we can use near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]patient
[normal] tests. 
[normal]W
[normal]ith all of these things complications are rare but they are serious
[normal],
[normal] and that is one of t
[normal]he things that worries
[normal] the prescriber and the patient 
[normal]with
[normal] bad symptoms 
[normal]who is 
[normal]seeing the doctor.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: M
[normal]oving fro
[normal]m primary care into acute care—
[normal]I am sure
[normal] Susan will support me on this—
[normal]this is not something way in the future; it is something we are seeing now. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is really important that we start shifting the public debate away from MRSA 
[normal]bacter
[normal]a
[normal]emias
[normal] and 
[normal]C.difficile
[normal] to looking at how we address antimicrobial resistance in our hospitals
[normal], 
[normal]particularly the rise in 
[normal]E.c
[normal]oli
[normal] infections and some of the
[normal] other gram negative infections and the resistance rate
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]e need to 
[normal]shift
[normal] that so that we can actually start addressing this within our health
[normal] 
[normal]care services and have a whole
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]systems
[normal] approach 
[normal]a
[normal]rou
[normal]nd it, but we really 
[normal]need to move from looking at those two to looking at antimicrobial resistance in a more comprehensive way.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]That is absolutely right. Working in public health, we are constantly having to weigh up 
[normal]that balance 
[normal]between what might be in the population
[normal]’s
[normal] health
[normal] interests—
[normal]nationally 
[normal]but also the global population—
[normal]which is undoubtedly to reduce antimicrobial resistance, which will involve reducing antibiotic prescribing and certainly reducing 
[normal]inappr
[normal]opriate antibiotic prescribing, 
[normal]against the individual person
[normal]’
[normal]s interests. Arguably, on an individual person basis, actually not receiving an antibiotic which is of no use to you is probably a good thing anyway, but there will be cases where that does not happen, albeit thankfully rare. The near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]point
[normal] diagnostics 
[normal]that could tell you in the doctor
[normal]’
[normal]s surgery whether the infection the patient next to you 
[normal]has 
[normal]is viral and will not benefit from an antibiotic
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]is 
[normal]bacterial and will
[normal], will
[normal] be i
[normal]nvaluable, hence the importance—
[normal]it is mentioned, I think, in the 
[normal]strategy and in our submission—
[normal]of more research around that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q65 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] I
[normal]n a hospital environment is there not a tension between the clinical desire to deal with every patient as an individual and the big corporate view that
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]We must n
[normal]ot have our statistics look bad”
[normal]?
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]That is spot on. That is why we need these processes, structures and leadership within trusts to understand the
[normal] risks and that tension, but i
[normal]t is also why
[normal]—as we were discussing earlier—
[normal]we should not be talking just about antibiotic control. It is about access to effective antibiotics, so we need to make sure that our sick patients get antibiotics im
[normal]mediately when they need them. 
[normal]There can be no blocks to that. But then we have the opportunity to review, step down, narrow the spectrum, stop, IV to oral, all those things, and they need to be part of the process. Earlier on
[normal],
[normal] we were talking about the risk at the individual level in terms of antibiotic resistance and the risk at the societal level of antibiotic resistance.
[normal]The other issue for us within hospita
[normal]ls of course is 
[normal]C.difficile
[normal]—antibiotics driving 
[normal]C.diff
[normal]—and 
[normal]the risk
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]benefit
[normal]. W
[normal]e have a variety of ways of making sure that we minimise the amount of antibiotics we expose people to. B
[normal]ut you are absolutely right; that is a tension and i
[normal]t is managed every day in complex patients. It is something that has to be thought through. 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou cannot walk away and think, 
[normal]“
[normal]Actually, what I
[normal]’ll
[normal] do is just leave this person on 
[normal]so many antibiotics that I 
[normal]cover everything. It does
[normal]n’t
[normal] matter that we
[normal]’ll
[normal] drive resistance, give the patien
[normal]t 
[normal]C.diff
[normal] and when they next have an infection we w
[normal]on’t
[normal] be able to treat it.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou have to weigh 
[normal]up all of that 
[normal]at the time you are treating the patient
[normal],
[normal] with the possible collateral damage you will do to that patient then and in the future
[normal],
[normal] as well as 
[normal]to 
[normal]the society and people around the
[normal]m.
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: T
[normal]here is an important role for pharmacists, nurses and infection specialist
[normal]s in hospitals. You help
[normal] to arbitrate the individual clinician who is responsible for the patient into lo
[normal]oking at the big picture and 
[normal]basically say, 
[normal]“Y
[normal]es, I understand that you have treated this patient aggressively
[normal], but now it’
[normal]s two days later, they are doing fine
[normal],
[normal] and we could do this.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]It is about being able to have 
[normal]structures in a hospital that help to bring down antimicrobial prescribing into the narrower spectrum that will treat the patient effectively
[normal],
[normal] using the
[normal] epidemiology that we know 
[normal]is occurring in the hospital and the best for the patient. 
[normal]I
[normal]t
[normal] is about having those external-
[normal]internal pe
[normal]ople, if you like, who do not, potentially,
[normal] have the same doctor
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]patient
[normal] relationship but are looking a
[normal]t the best for that patient and 
[normal]also the best for the population.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q66 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]In the evidence that we have received so far, and indeed you mentioned it this 
[normal]morning, there is variation 
[normal]across England in terms of doctors prescribing antibiotics. Could you give us an idea of how much
[normal]—
[normal]what is the ra
[normal]nge of that variation—and,
[normal] if any of you know
[normal], whether
[normal] that variation exists across the United Kingdom as well, not just England?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]I will take a little bit of this, if that is okay. I have recently taken over the oversight group looking at the English surveillance programme for ant
[normal]imicrobial use and resistance. 
[normal]As part of that, we have been gathering information at a CCG level from primary care and also from hospitals, but as a larger grouping of hospitals together, to understand what is happening in ecological levels across the country. 
[normal]W
[normal]e can see 
[normal]that
[normal] there is about a fivefold variation in prescribing across practices. Some of that can be explained by the age structure of the populations
[normal],
[normal] but some of it cannot. What we are looking at is trying to understand this information better: what particular antibiotics are being prescribed across the country? Is it related to deprivation? 
[normal]T
[normal]here is some evidence that the more deprived populations have higher prescribing levels
[normal],
[normal] and that may be related to their co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]mo
[normal]rbidities
[normal] and smoking and so on. 
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]also 
[normal]know that we can help drive down prescribing if we are
[normal] open and transparent about the
[normal] 
[normal]data. We need to understand it at Public Health England 
[normal]and
[normal] at
[normal] prescribing levels across the country
[normal],
[normal] and then we need to feed that back
[normal],
[normal] to explain to people, 
[normal]“I
[normal]f one practice can do this
[normal],
[normal] can we look and see what that practice is doing to drive down prescriptions?
[normal]”
[normal] Very much part of our aim at Public Health England is to 
[normal]be open and transparent in
[normal] looking at antimicrobial prescribing data across CCGs and across hospitals over the next year
[normal],
[normal] and the AMR strategy is helping to drive that.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: T
[normal]he funding that has been made available to look at some of these interesting aspects
[normal] in the strategy—
[normal]particularly 
[normal]to 
[normal]develop applied 
[normal]research—
[normal]will drive some of the research and address some of these important questions. The creation of health protection research units in this area will also help
[normal] to
[normal] address some of these questions.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: It is a
[normal]cross different countries
[normal]. W
[normal]e are obviously not the only country that sees this kind of variation in practice
[normal].
[normal] Public Health England
[normal]’
[normal]s c
[normal]ounterpart in America, the CDC—
[normal]the 
[normal]Centers
[normal] for Dis
[normal]ease Control and Prevention—
[normal]produced their report on antimicrobial resistance late last year, 
[normal]in 
[normal]autumn 2013, and one of the quite striking maps shows almost double the problem of antimicrobial resistance antibio
[normal]tic prescribing 
[normal]between states in south
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]east United States and the west coast and California. There are various reasons discus
[normal]sed, but again you see 
[normal]a variation in practice and in seriousness
[normal],
[normal] which reminds us that the factors that influence prescribing and antimicrobial r
[normal]esistance are complex. T
[normal]hey are professional factors about doctors and their prescr
[normal]ibing and lots of other factors, 
[normal]but also public awareness. I think we touched on it in the previous qu
[normal]estion. I believe there is 
[normal]a responsibility on 
[normal]the 
[normal]public around demands for antibiotics
[normal],
[normal] and we experience this in the general practice room where you have a very short consultation and can be pressed on receiving an antibiotic. That is a real ground
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]level
[normal] issue, hence 
[normal]again the importance 
[normal]in the strategy of greater improving 
[normal]of 
[normal]awareness and understanding among the public of antimicrobial resistance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q67 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]Professor, you just touched on my next point. We have discussed the variation in prescrip
[normal]tion and the fact that in 
[normal]areas with more prescription there is some increased infection, but the Society of Biology has given us evidence that resistance is still increasing across the country
[normal]. I
[normal]s there variation in resistance
[normal],
[normal] and do we have enough information yet to say that 
[normal]in 
[normal]areas where prescribing antibiotics has been curtailed resistance 
[normal]is 
[normal]receding
[normal],
[normal] or is it still continuing to rise at the same rate?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]The first thing to say is that
[normal],
[normal] predominantly in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and in 
[normal]England
[normal] over the last 10 years, 
[normal]we have monitored bacter
[normal]a
[normal]emi
[normal]a surveillance, which is the tip of the iceberg, and 
[normal]b
[normal]acter
[normal]a
[normal]emias
[normal] do not occur in primary care. By and large, if somebody is sick with a blood culture infection or sepsis, the
[normal]y are in hospital. 
[normal]M
[normal]ore recently
[normal],
[normal] over the last couple of years
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]we have 
[normal]developed a surveillance system to look at all microbiology samples from microbiology laboratories
[normal],
[normal] and we have now almost achieved a 60% uptake of laboratories across the country reporting centrally to Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal]. That is from samples such as urine, which are a really good marker for what is happening in the community
[normal],
[normal] and sputum samples as well. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is the surveillance system that will help give us the early warning signals. In some areas, such as the west midlands
[normal],
[normal] 100% of the laboratory data 
[normal]are 
[normal]being reported, so we know exactly what is ha
[normal]ppening in that. In other areas,
[normal] there are resources being put in by Publi
[normal]c Health 
[normal]England
[normal] to improve 
[normal]surveillance
[normal].
[normal]U
[normal]ntil we have robust surveillance systems collecting laboratory data
[normal],
[normal] we do not know where our gaps are. Our priority over the next year is to improve that
[normal],
[normal] to make sure 
[normal]that 
[normal]60% of lab
[normal]s
[normal] are reporting
[normal] and
[normal] to get that to 70% to 80%
[normal], so that we know we have 
[normal]good coverage and that we have developed our early warning systems. But with that
[normal],
[normal] we need hospitals and laboratories to work with us to make sure that they can give us the data
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e need hospital laboratory systems to be updated to modern IT so that they can transmit the message
[normal] to us
[normal]. 
[normal]We cannot have outdated systems; i
[normal]f we have old IT systems
[normal],
[normal] they will not communi
[normal]cate with more modern ones. I
[normal]t is everyone working together
[normal],
[normal] so 
[normal]that 
[normal]Public Health England can develop a surveillance sy
[normal]stem. H
[normal]ospitals need to help us engage with that so 
[normal]that 
[normal]we know what is happening at the ground level.
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you. That is important.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]In primary care there is not a history of sampling. 
[normal]For
[normal] most people who come
[normal],
[normal] we do not take microbiological samples. When you do take samples
[normal],
[normal] it is when there are complicated cases, 
[normal]where 
[normal]people have 
[normal]had a course of antibiotics, 
[normal]the infection has not improved and they have come back with a urine in
[normal]fection, say, for a third time, 
[normal]and you send a sample off at that stage. 
[normal]The routine samples that
[normal] come from primary care are not representative of the global picture. One of the 
[normal]missing 
[normal]pieces of the jigsaw is a systematic sampling of all routine cases
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I think that is something 
[normal]we could develop for the future so that you used a number of sites across the UK to routinely sample everybody who presented with particular conditions
[normal],
[normal] which would give you a much better idea of the rates of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria isolated in the general population, whereas at the m
[normal]oment your sample is from 
[normal]complicated cases
[normal],
[normal] so you will not get a true picture of the ant
[normal]imicrobial resistance. T
[normal]ha
[normal]t is a gap that could be filled.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: M
[normal]easuring the amount of antimicrobial resistance in primary and secondary care
[normal] 
[normal]is complex. There are definitely gaps
[normal],
[normal] and Dr Moor
[normal]e has highlighted one. F
[normal]rom an already good start in terms of our surveillance in this country, I am confident, because we 
[normal]have already made a significant
[normal] start in Public Hea
[normal]lth England, that in 
[normal]a r
[normal]elatively short period of time—a few years—
[normal]we will have even stronger systems in place. They will not necessarily have answered all the questions, and this particular one may take longer, but 
[normal]there will be 
[normal]even stronger surveillance systems
[normal],
[normal] so we can speak even more clearly about the amount of the problem in this country. I do not know about the Society of Biology
[normal]’
[normal]s re
[normal]port, but if you could share i
[normal]t with us we could respond in a written manner to the Committee because I do not know what they are referring to.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q68 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]I think there is someone in the room who might be able to do that. Just before I move on to my last point, Professor 
[normal]Kessel
[normal], you mentioned the 
[normal]US
[normal]. T
[normal]here was evidence that
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]where 
[normal]there was a variation in areas where antibiotics, the prescription, had been curtailed
[normal],
[normal] there was a reduction in resistance. Is that correct?
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]There is almost a twofold difference between states in the amount of the problem of antimicrobial resistance and prescribing practice between states in the south
[normal]-
[normal]east.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q69 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] But those 
[normal]two
[normal] figures 
[normal]correla
[normal]te. The data where resistance exists correlate
[normal] with prescribing.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]That is right. I have that here 
[normal]i
[normal]n my pile of supporting material
[normal], and I am happy to share i
[normal]t or send the report through afterwards. It came out as the CDC
[normal]’
[normal]s publication came out in the autumn 
[normal]of 
[normal]last year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q70 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] My final point 
[normal]cover
[normal]s
[normal] the fact that there is variation across the world, as we have touched on, in antibiotics
[normal]; 
[normal]indeed
[normal],
[normal] in many countries we can buy them over the counter.
[normal] How will that affect us
[normal] in the United Kingdom
[normal], and how significantly will i
[normal]t undermine our efforts here in the UK?
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]The scope of the problem internationally is absolutely huge. 
[normal]It is not only our own strategy; o
[normal]ne of the things
[normal] 
[normal]the work of the chief medical officer over the last three or f
[normal]our years has done, 
[normal]wh
[normal]ich has been hugely influential,
[normal] has been to dramatically raise the profile of antimicrobial resistance as an issue internationally. Last year at the World Health Assembly
[normal],
[normal] which I attended
[normal],
[normal] there was a session on AMR that there had not been before. There is planned to be a new resolution at the World Health Assembly next May. There is a whole range of other international activities going on. We are doing a lot of work with Public Health England
[normal] and 
[normal]the CMO and her team with the Commonwealth about twinning countries
[normal]—
[normal]higher income, lower income countries
[normal]—
[normal]around laboratory and antimicrobial resistance issu
[normal]es. There is a huge amount of attention that
[normal] did not exist to the degree it 
[normal]does
[normal] 
[normal]now 
[normal]just three or four years 
[normal]ago, 
[normal]even when I started at the Health Protection Agency. That attention internationally was not there.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q71 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]On the BBC programme on regional television the night before last that I referred
[normal] to in my introductory remarks,
[normal] a clinician was arguing in favour of screening for the resistant form of TB from certain populations. Do you think that is a serious proposition
[normal]—
[normal]people moving into the country from particular countries
[normal]?
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]I might ask a colleague on that. I realise I did not quite answ
[normal]er your question about over-the-
[normal]c
[normal]ounter medicines; we know that i
[normal]t is a significant
[normal] issue in a number of countries—s
[normal]ome of the high popul
[normal]ation, lower resource countries.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n 
[normal]India
[normal],
[normal] they have been doi
[normal]ng a lot of work to change over-the-
[normal]counter provision of medicines
[normal], but of course i
[normal]t is a problem. If you can just go and get an antibiotic over the counter, it may well be an antibiotic that is not necessary. One of the huge challenges there is 
[normal]that 
[normal]in those kinds of 
[normal]settings that might be your only way to get a valuable treatment. So the work that needs to be done has to be done in conjunction with improving primary care infrastructure and so forth, but there is a huge amount of work going on 
[normal]internationally to raise that in
[normal] the agenda, which is incredibly valuable. 
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]Could I just say one other thing about over the counter
[normal], and then talk about screening, b
[normal]ut bring it to the scr
[normal]eening of antibiotic resistance
[normal] particularly in bact
[normal]erial infections rather than TB?
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]irst
[normal],
[normal] in the 
[normal]UK
[normal],
[normal] we have v
[normal]ery tight regulation about over- the-
[normal]counter prescribing
[normal],
[normal] but your question was 
[normal]on the impact of over-the-
[normal]counter prescribing around the wor
[normal]ld when it is a global problem. W
[normal]e are
[normal] talking locally and nationally
[normal] but it is a global problem. There has been a huge amount of work done on this, particularly in 
[normal]India
[normal] with the Chennai D
[normal]eclaration. Their first proposal for antibiotic control was 
[normal]unpragmatic
[normal] and not deliverable
[normal],
[normal] because of the is
[normal]sue about tight control of over-the-
[normal]counter antibiotics. When we actually talk about access to antibiotics, that might be the only place people can access antibiotics
[normal], s
[normal]o the more pragmatic approach was a step
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]wise
[normal] progression of the antibiotics that had to be regulated and the ones that were still over the counter
[normal],
[normal] and that has now been introduced. I think it was introduced in August. 
[normal]T
[normal]he work in Ind
[normal]ia has been quite extraordinary.
[normal]I
[normal]n terms of the question about screening
[normal], 
[normal]we are particularly concerned about severe antibiotic resistance being brought in
[normal];
[normal] indeed there is a document that has been released
[normal] recently 
[normal]advising hospitals what best to do about screening. We are ve
[normal]ry conscious of the issue 
[normal]when patients come in from intensive care units from other places, from hospitals from other places, or even 
[normal]when they are just 
[normal]involved in health
[normal] 
[normal]care in other places
[normal], and the need to screen 
[normal]is being recommended, but Susan may want to say a bit more about the policy.
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]Yes. Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal] has generated screen
[normal]ing guidelines for 
[normal]carbapenem
[normal] resistance
[normal],
[normal] which is really important for people coming from overseas
[normal], 
[normal]seeking health
[normal] 
[normal]care 
[normal]here, 
[normal]or after having health
[normal] 
[normal]care abroad 
[normal]in
[normal] one form or another
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Those 
[normal]are the patients 
[normal]who 
[normal]can transmit
[normal] and cause an epidemic of multi
[normal]drug resistant bacteria within a hospital setting
[normal],
[normal] and that is where we have been focusing 
[normal]a 
[normal]lot of our attention
[normal],
[normal] because obviously that would be a new transmission event and a very dangerous form of in
[normal]fection—gram negative infections—
[normal]within hospitals
[normal],
[normal] rapidly developing resistance to, essentially, all first, second and third
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]line
[normal] available 
[normal]antibiotics, leaving us with old and
[normal] poor available drugs. 
[normal]You also mentioned TB. 
[normal]I think tuberculosis has had a long history in 
[normal]the UK of slow, simmering rates,
[normal] and higher rates in London where there are higher populations from overseas, so we have about 3,500 cases 
[normal]a year 
[normal]in London
[normal],
[normal] and about 
[normal]1.5% to 1.7% of those are multi
[normal]drug resistant, so resistant to two of our major first
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]line
[normal] drugs. That has not changed that much over
[normal] the last 10 years actually; 
[normal]we have had a slow, steady rate
[normal],
[normal] between 1% and 2%
[normal],
[normal] of drug resistance. It is important that we ensure that patients with symptoms are screened as necessary
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Port health screening 
[normal]is organised for individuals who have symptoms of TB coming 
[normal]in
[normal]to the 
[normal]UK, and there is a questionnaire for those from 
[normal]countries that are
[normal] high risk.
[normal] It is important that we have good microbiology services
[normal],
[normal] so that if people present
[normal] we diagnose multi
[normal]drug resistant TB fast and accurately
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is available through Public Health England
[normal]’
[normal]s tuberculos
[normal]is national reference lab
[normal] to any laboratory in the country
[normal],
[normal] so any laboratory can request that test for a fast turnaround on any patient 
[normal]with 
[normal]suspected
[normal] 
[normal]tuberculosis.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]We are running a tad behind time, so can colleagues speed things up a bit?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q72 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David Morris:[bold] 
[normal]I think a lot of what you have already said has probably answered 
[normal]this, but, in relation to 
[normal]antimicrobial resistance, are existing diagnostics tests used effectively across the NHS? If not, why not? Do you think t
[normal]hat the diagnostic tests used for
[normal] looking into diseases are actually pertinent to what we are doing to dish out antibiotics
[normal], or do you 
[normal]think we are 
[normal]not 
[normal]doing a good enough job of the diagnostics in the first place?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]There are two elements of diagnostics. Once a sample gets to th
[normal]e microbiology department, 
[normal]we can say that the microbiology departments are accredited to p
[normal]erform the microbiology tests. 
[normal]They have minimum standards 
[normal]so 
[normal]that they can do it
[normal]. If they are unsure about the 
[normal]resu
[normal]lt
[normal], they can send it to a national reference laboratory. The question is if there is no sample
[normal] sent; as we have heard
[normal] already, 80% of prescribing happens in primary care where the majority of patients have no samples performed at all
[normal],
[normal] and actually even if they did have a sample sent it would have little impact on that patient
[normal]’
[normal]s antibiotic prescription because the result would take three to five days to get back to the general practitioner. 
[normal]There needs to be new development of easier
[normal] point
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]care
[normal] testing—testing 
[normal]that will give rapid results. Some of that is happening to diagnose viral infections. For example, we know that there are now tests that we can use
[normal] where we 
[normal]take a nose swab and see if someone has a virus
[normal], and if they have a virus 
[normal]you can say that they do not ne
[normal]ed an antibiotic. 
[normal]We need to develop it such that the GP can do that quite easily
[normal],
[normal] at a cheap cost that is not goin
[normal]g to massively influence health care costs across this country,
[normal] and deliver that at a p
[normal]rimary care level. A lot of development work is required on that. F
[normal]rom a hospital level, once the sample gets into the laboratory, and it is an approved, accredited
[normal] laboratory in a hospital, 
[normal]we can be pretty sure that that laboratory is performing the right tests.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q73 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David Morris:[bold] 
[normal]Is there a central database that these tests can be fed into
[normal],
[normal] to give you a mapping of where and when antibiotics should be used, or certain treatments?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: A
[normal]ntibiotics are used according to the clini
[normal]cal syndrome about the patient—
[normal]when the patient presents
[normal],
[normal] what signs and symptoms they have. The microbiology helps focus our treatments down to narrow treatments
[normal],
[normal] or widen them as necessary, so it helps us in 
[normal]“Start Smart—Then Fo
[normal]cus
[normal],”
[normal] but it does not change what
[normal] happens to the patient and the
[normal] patient
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]doctor
[normal] interaction on the front line.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]The issue about the point of care is not just one for primary care. With the centralisation of microbiology laboratories
[normal],
[normal] it is becoming more and more important sometimes that we get the diagnosis at the point of care, particularly in intensive care. 
[normal]P
[normal]oint of care is very important in acute care as well as primary care
[normal],
[normal] so that we can get the results fast, rapidly, where we are looki
[normal]ng after the patient. I
[normal]nvesting in research in this technology is absolutely critical. 
[normal]It shapes how we treat patients and
[normal] improves outcome
[normal]s,
[normal] and there is a lot more we could do there. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q74 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]Most of the focus 
[normal]so far has been on the clinical and
[normal] on the professional side
[normal], but Professor Holmes, you 
[normal]mention
[normal]ed
[normal] there was a need for public debate. Do you, as a panel, think that 
[normal]UK
[normal] patients understand the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance and how their own actions contribute towards it?
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]I think some of them do. 
[normal]W
[normal]e have touched on some of the issues
[normal],
[normal] and perhaps we need to consider the issue about heal
[normal]th literacy and be a little 
[normal]more analytical about that in its broader sense, not just about the antimicrobial resistance issue. I mentioned before that there is a lot of work 
[normal]a
[normal]round public engagement. We may need to look more critically at how we measure whether it is effective enough, but I also think we need to look at not just public engagement but engagement across everybody who is involved in delivering health
[normal] 
[normal]care. 
[normal]We still need to work on 
[normal]engagement within health
[normal] 
[normal]care
[normal],
[normal] as well as looking at
[normal] public engagement. 
[normal]I think we are looking more and more in
[normal]to
[normal] aspects of qualitative research and social science
[normal] and so on,
[normal] to get the messages right and
[normal] to calibrate them a little 
[normal]more effectively
[normal]. T
[normal]hat is taking place now.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q75 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]Whenever anyone says
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]We need to look at doing this,
[normal]” 
[normal]I ask more spe
[normal]cifically what needs to be done.
[normal]Professor Holmes[bold]: 
[normal]I will start with what I was saying about people within h
[normal]ealth care. We need to make sure as technical experts
[normal] that we are not just talking to each other. We need to engage with our clinical 
[normal]and
[normal] professional colleag
[normal]ues. I
[normal]t is really important
[normal] that we recognise the effect of
[normal] the power of hierarchies within specialities, 
[normal]and 
[normal]work with leaders
[normal] across a range of specialities and
[normal] work with our professional bodies. We must include nurses here. There needs to be much more talk about the role of nurses in the delivery of antibiotic safety. There needs to be much more talk about the critical role of pharmacists
[normal]; 
[normal]quite a bit of wo
[normal]rk has been done already with 
[normal]the development of a 
[normal]masters
[normal] pro
[normal]gramme for pharmacists
[normal]. I think Anthony might be able to say a bit more about the work that is being done critically and academically looking at behavioural change strategies and
[normal] getting the message right. T
[normal]here is investment in research to do this
[normal],
[normal] but there is also a programme of work that Public Health England is involved in.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q76 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]It is the public awareness side of things that I am particularly interested in.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: 
[normal]I think the answer is yes
[normal]; in my view,
[normal] there is a need for fur
[normal]ther 
[normal]public engagement or public awareness. Again it is not straightforward
[normal]: how do you raise public awareness?
[normal] One could say we will run an awareness
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]raising
[normal] campaign
[normal],
[normal] but it is very important, in so doing, that you run something that is effe
[normal]ctive. They cost a lot of money and
[normal] they take time. One does not want to do something that is not effective in terms of raising the public
[normal]’
[normal]s knowledge, understanding
[normal],
[normal] or even, most importantly, their behaviours in terms of going to a GP and asking for antibiotics. 
[normal]We in Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal] have from 
[normal]1 
[normal]April this year taken from the Department of Health the team responsible for running those kinds of campaigns
[normal],
[normal] and I and my team have been asked to look at whether we can run a broader public health campaign around antimicrobial re
[normal]sistance in this country. W
[normal]e have started to look at how we can do that in a targeted way that is effective and cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]effective
[normal]. T
[normal]he research
[normal] 
[normal]draws on some of the work that the World Health 
[normal]Organisation has done, called 
[normal]TAB, which is about targeting app
[normal]ropriate antimicrobial resistance
[normal] strategies around, first of all, doing some qualitative work to find out where such a ca
[normal]mpaign might be most effective—
[normal]which 
[normal]groups, so it could be age groups;
[normal] which sectors
[normal], whether it is schools or 
[normal]residential
[normal] sectors, and those kind of things—
[normal]and then 
[normal]running a tailored campaign accordingly. 
[normal]You ask what should be looked at, and t
[normal]hat is something we are looking at
[normal],
[normal] b
[normal]ut we have just started doing i
[normal]t
[normal]. T
[normal]hat is very much part of the s
[normal]trategy in terms of raising the
[normal] level of discussion and debate. 
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: This is a
[normal]n important release, I think, to start us ha
[normal]ving those conversations
[normal]. 
[normal]Eurobarometer
[normal], which is a European
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]wide
[normal] survey, has just released the results of the 2013 survey
[normal],
[normal] which focused on antimicrobial resistance because obviously this is a big attent
[normal]ion area throughout Europe. That survey 
[normal]showed that one in three people in the UK, and roughly the same across Europe, had an awareness of some antibiotic cam
[normal]paign in the previous year. T
[normal]here are campaigns out there that people are becoming aware of. Interestingly, one in two people in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] knew that antibiotic
[normal]s were not right for colds, flu
[normal] and viruses
[normal],
[normal] but that means 50% do not, so we still have a lot of work 
[normal]to do 
[normal]out there to convince people that viruses do not need antibiotics. 
[normal]W
[normal]hat I thought was really important in those results was to know t
[normal]hat actually the main place where
[normal] people seek advice and where they will get advice that they believe in is from health professionals. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat comes back to the engagement of health professionals
[normal],
[normal] and look
[normal]ing
[normal] at health professional strategies rather than just looking at all
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]encompassing
[normal] campaigns. 
[normal]W
[normal]hen people are ill and seek health advice
[normal], that
[normal] is the moment whe
[normal]n 
[normal]they will listen to the important piece of advice that can change their behaviour, not only for this episode but potentially for the next episode and the one thereafter. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is about resources
[normal],
[normal] education campaigns and interventions that can be rolled out across GP practices that can change those behaviours in the future, not just for now.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q77 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]We 
[normal]have 
[normal]focused on the prescribing of medicines. It is also important that once a member of the 
[normal]public has these medicines 
[normal]the
[normal]y complete the course and use them
[normal] properly. How can medical p
[normal]rofessionals make sure that 
[normal]patients actually complete the course they are given
[normal]? People go to the doctor
[normal], get given the antibiotics and then that is the end of the story as far as that connection with the GP is concerned. How can you make sure t
[normal]hat the link continues and 
[normal]they complete the course?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]There are two things that are quite important. The first thing is that a lot of the research about the length of course happened a long time ago
[normal]; 
[normal]often 
[normal]it 
[normal]w
[normal]as
[normal] predefined 30, 40 or 50 years ago. Actually we need research about what i
[normal]s the shortest length of course.
[normal] Can we let the courses be shorter so that people do not take antibiotics on day 7 when they are better
[normal],
[normal] because they do not need them? 
[normal]We also know that
[normal],
[normal] if people do not have an infection in the first place
[normal],
[normal] they do not need antibi
[normal]otics. If they were in hospital,
[normal] they would have stopped antibiotics on day 2 when we decided they did not have an infection, so perhaps we need to reinvent this a bit and get better at understanding when patients do not need them
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is about stopping the prescriptions in the first place
[normal],
[normal] but it is als
[normal]o about trying to see if 
[normal]we 
[normal]can 
[normal]come up with a way that we can shorten the durations of courses so that they do not take them
[normal] for such a long time. I
[normal]f they are feeling
[normal] better after two days, and it wa
[normal]s thought 
[normal]to
[normal] be a virus at the beginning 
[normal]but
[normal] it was a delayed prescription, perhaps they should stop it at that point. I would like to turn that on its head a bit
[normal]; 
[normal]we need to look at that in the future in a different way
[normal],
[normal] because the more antibiotics people tak
[normal]e, the more the microbiology 
[normal]inside their body will change.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: I
[normal]f a patient ultimately decides when they have a five
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]day treatment that they are feeling better after three or four days and they want to throw the rest in the bin or not continue, it is quite 
[normal]hard
[normal] to influence that
[normal]. The way we do i
[normal]t is by awareness raising, public debate
[normal],
[normal] discussion with the public
[normal],
[normal] but also with professionals about how they convey the importance of those messages. I
[normal] was just 
[normal]reminded by a note about a very good educational material called e
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]Bug
[normal], electronic bug, which is an online tool that we developed in the Health Protection Agency
[normal]—
[normal]now Public Health England
[normal]—
[normal]which has
[normal] won awards and is used multiply
[normal] in schools across this country
[normal]. I
[normal]ndeed
[normal], it
[normal] has been used in a number of countries overseas, having been tran
[normal]slated into different languages.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t covers areas pertaining to that understanding
[normal]—
[normal]which bugs respond to antibiotics, why antibiotics should be used and for what duration and so forth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q78 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] 
[normal]I think all of you have made reference during the course of the morning to the 
[normal]differences and 
[normal]discrepancies
[normal], or 
[normal]the different ways matters are treated in
[normal] 
[normal]secondary as opposed to primary care. I want to look briefl
[normal]y at the antimicrobial resistance
[normal] 
[normal]strategy, the five
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]year plan for 2013-
[normal]18. It has been criticised from a number of quarters for being far too concerned with the cl
[normal]inical environment, principally
[normal] the secondary acute sector, at the expense 
[normal]of 
[normal]primary care
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] not mentioning 
[normal]t
[normal]he environment in nursing homes
[normal] at all. I wo
[normal]nder 
[normal]if any of yo
[normal]u would care to respond to that.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: 
[normal]I can talk to that. I have recently done some work looking at antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes
[normal]; it
[normal] is not yet published
[normal],
[normal] but it shows that if you take into
[normal] account the other co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]morbidities
[normal]—
[normal]the othe
[normal]r illnesses that people have—
[normal]the rate of antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes is around double what you would expect for that population. 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a problem with antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes and it is, I think, often misdirected
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his 
[normal]is 
[normal]a high
[normal]-
[normal]risk population
[normal];
[normal] these are very frail, elderly people usually
[normal],
[normal] who are at high risk of bacterial infections and serious infections
[normal]. M
[normal]anaging that risk in primary care is difficult because you are worried that people may h
[normal]ave more serious infections, b
[normal]ut there is still overtreatment
[normal].
[normal]M
[normal]y particular focus has been on urinary infections
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is very common for people in nursing homes to carry bacteria in their urine. Probably about a third of people, if you do a random sample, would have bacteria in their urine
[normal];
[normal] there is a kind of a paradigm
[normal],
[normal] where somebody becomes more unwell and then somebody 
[normal]else 
[normal]will dip their urine and show that there is protein and blood in it
[normal],
[normal] which suggests an infection
[normal],
[normal] and then they will get an antibiotic, but actually the link between the bacteria in the urine and the illness is very tenuous
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is one of the driver
[normal]s of antibiotic prescribing, so i
[normal]t is an area that I have been looking at and will be focusing on to try and intervene and get better targeting. Again, it is about identifying the people that really need the antibiotics
[normal],
[normal] but we are talking about a high
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]risk environment with the frail elderly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q79 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] Y
[normal]our 
[normal]view would be that the resistance
[normal] strategy is seriously deficient in this area.
[normal]Dr Moore[bold]: I
[normal]t is an area which warrants more attention
[normal],
[normal] and I thi
[normal]nk it has not been an area that
[normal] has been looked at. There are high levels of prescribing, probably greater than you would expect even for the frail elderly population who are in there
[normal],
[normal] and I think more work needs to be done, yes.
[normal]Professor [bold]Kessel[bold]: A
[normal]s I mentioned earlier, I think this is an amb
[normal]itious and important strategy; i
[normal]t 
[normal]is an overarching strategy. W
[normal]e talked earlier about the enormity of the challenge and the fact that implementation at ground
[normal] level has other elements, 
[normal]which cannot be, and would not be, covered in an overarching strategy. The issue around community settings is vitally important for all the reasons that have been mentioned. I cannot recall whether that i
[normal]s specifically mentioned,
[normal] but I can be absolutely sure that it does not stop Public Health England, as part of our work on surveillance and our r
[normal]oles and responsibilities there—
[normal]roles on sur
[normal]veillance, education and practice—
[normal]from attending to co
[normal]mmunity settings, nursing homes and
[normal] residential homes. In fact only last year
[normal]—
[normal]Dr Hopkins might correct me if I get the date wrong, but I think it was last year or the year before
[normal]—
[normal]we produced an important pack 
[normal]on 
[normal]community nursing home
[normal]s
[normal], residential care settings and advice for practitioners on health
[normal] 
[normal]care
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]associated
[normal] infections an
[normal]d antimicrobial resistance. I
[normal]t is an area that is already being addressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q80 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] 
[normal]But the huge increase in recent years in 
[normal]resistance, and attention
[normal] 
[normal]given to 
[normal]resistance
[normal],
[normal] has been in the community rather than in clinical environments. The position in hospitals, 
[normal]in 
[normal]the acute sector, has not really changed that much over
[normal] time. 
[normal]Infection levels are effectively under control and now reducing, but the huge explosion in this has taken place in the community sector. Should that not be where the attention is being placed?
[normal]Dr Hopkins[bold]: 
[normal]We can say that we have seen a rise
[normal] in 
[normal]E.coli
[normal] 
[normal]bacter
[normal]a
[normal]emia across the country. We know that you are more likely to have resistance if you have had a health
[normal] 
[normal]care setting intervention in
[normal] the previous three months. T
[normal]he infection may start in the community
[normal],
[normal] but it is more likely to have been related to your previous health
[normal] 
[normal]care event. 
[normal]N
[normal]ursing homes are really important. There are more than 30,000 nursing and residential homes across England
[normal],
[normal] and they have a very vulnerable population. I do not think they are excluded from the strategy
[normal],
[normal] because the strategy encompasses the whole health
[normal] 
[normal]care economy and primary and secondary care
[normal],
[normal] and nursing home residents are involved
[normal]. T
[normal]he delivery of their care 
[normal]is 
[normal]via primary care
[normal], so 
[normal]thei
[normal]r prescriptions that we gather—
[normal]the resistance that we g
[normal]ather—are
[normal] being gathered by the same mechanisms a
[normal]s everything else. A
[normal]s something that could be strengthened
[normal],
[normal] explicitly stating what is requir
[normal]ed in long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term care facilities would be beneficial. L
[normal]ong
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term facilities are also covered by the Health and Social Care Act. They are also regulated by 
[normal]the 
[normal]CQC. 
[normal]T
[normal]hey fall under everything else that we have talked about in primary and secondary care as well, so they are not excluded by any means by what it says in the strategy, though it does not, I agree, explicitly state
[normal], “This applies to long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term care,” but 
[normal]primary and secondary care physicians and nurses
[normal] 
[normal]are the same people who deliver care in long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term care facilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Chair:[bold] That was
[normal] an extremely informative session. We are extremely grateful for the contributions you have made. I realise there will be one
[normal] or two follow
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]up documents—
[normal]the ones yo
[normal]u referred to, Professor 
[normal]Kessel
[normal].
[normal] Dr Moore, if you are able to flesh out a little more about the paper you are about to publish
[normal]—
[normal]I recognise the sensitivity of that in the science environment
[normal]—
[normal]that would be helpful
[normal], and a
[normal]lso
[normal] 
[normal]if there are any further bits of information the rest of you would like to add as well. Thank you very much for your attendance this morning.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q81 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you very much for attending this morning. It would be helpful if you could introduce yourselves.
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]I am Doris
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]Ann
[normal] Williams. I am chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, the industry association representing manufacturers and distributors of diagnostic products in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]I am George 
[normal]Lewith
[normal]. I am a professor in the department of primary care. I work very closely with Mike Moore on a number of studies
[normal],
[normal] which David 
[normal]Tredinnick
[normal] just mentioned. I am a GP and a consultant physician. I have 30 years of experience in researching herbal medicines and hold a variety of roles. One of the things I have been involved with
[normal] very recently is getting the 
[normal]National Sc
[normal]hool for Primary Care Research—part of the NIHR—
[normal]to develop a really powerful working group looking at alternatives to antibiotic prescribing both in care homes and in primary care
[normal],
[normal] using a variety of nutritional and herbal approaches, particularly in relation to urinary and lower respiratory tract infections. I do not re
[normal]present anybody other than the U
[normal]niversity of Southampton and the NIHR.
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]I am David McIntosh. I am a paediatric infectious disease specialist. I am also an honorary clinic
[normal]al senior lecturer at Imperial C
[normal]ollege in London. I act as the global scienti
[normal]fic affairs senior expert for Novartis V
[normal]accines
[normal],
[normal] and I teach at a number of universities around the world.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]I am John 
[normal]Hardcastle
[normal]. I am the chief executive of 
[normal]Novolytics
[normal], which is a
[normal]n SME company in 
[normal]Daresbury
[normal]; 
[normal]we research into 
[normal]bacteriophage
[normal] therapeutics. Prior to that, most of my career has been spent in the venture capital industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q82 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]In different ways
[normal],
[normal] you all propose alternatives to antibiotics. Could you each 
[normal]outline what your approach is? 
[normal]Let us go down the line again.
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]The diagnostics industry sees the tools that our products produce as a way of appropriately differentiating patients
[normal]’
[normal] treatment. 
[normal]I
[normal]n primary care the
[normal]re are simple tests, as we 
[normal]heard in the last session, which are in common use in the Nordic countries, Germany and Switzerland and also in the USA, to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections
[normal],
[normal] and allow a debate or a discussion between the primary care physician and the patient as to whether an antibiotic is appropriate
[normal] for that condition or not. I
[normal]n secondary care
[normal],
[normal] it is a way of targeting antibiotic therapy to make sure that the correct antibiotic is used for the correct infection. Increasingly, there are products available 
[normal]that
[normal] will look at more than one parameter in one sample type
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]they 
[normal]are reducing the length of time to get the results. 
[normal]In
[normal] the trad
[normal]itional microbiology lab, 
[normal]it would take five to 14 day
[normal]s to culture up micro
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]organisms;
[normal] you can now 
[normal]do it within five hours using 
[normal]molecular technology.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]My background is as a clinician, a GP, so I can add to some of the comments made by Dr Moore and I can certainly expand any that may be relevant to this part of the meeting. As a primary care physician, you a
[normal]re in a very difficult position;
[normal] you are in a one
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]to
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]one situation with a patient who may 
[normal]want or demand
[normal] an antibiotic. Education works 
[normal]to a point
[normal], and we 
[normal]discussed the strategies in the previous part of the meeting, but GPs very much feel they need alternatives. The evidence we have from the research is that they would look at things like herbal and nutritional medicines if they were t
[normal]houghtfully evidence based. W
[normal]ithin the EU, particularly in Germany, 20
[normal]% of the 
[normal]OTC prescriptions are for herbal medicines. There is a real good track record of herbal medicines 
[normal]being
[normal] better produced and us getting better quality herbal medicines in the 
[normal]UK
[normal],
[normal] and better herbal practitioners, particularly since the 2001 House of Lords report. 
[normal]My main approach would be to try and see how we can use these kinds of approaches
[normal],
[normal] looking at good science but perhaps understanding that we are not after a magic single chemical. Herbals work differently. They work synergistically and often through several different 
[normal]i
[normal]mmuno
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]modifying
[normal] mechanisms. O
[normal]ne herbal, which may have 40 or 50 different biologically active chemicals, may be working through several different systems
[normal],
[normal] and nutritionals may be as well. They modify many different systems in the body, so it is a different kind of approach
[normal],
[normal] which requires a slightly different understanding of science. I think we can use those approaches to manage symptoms and mitigate antibiotic prescribing in primary care very effectively when we know that there is good preliminary evidence and we do not need to make many of the antibiotic prescriptions that we are making. 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you. We are go
[normal]ing to pursue that a little 
[normal]further later on.
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]Antibiotics are used for treatment generally
[normal],
[normal] and vaccines are used for prevention. We have had a golden age of antibiotic development
[normal],
[normal] and I believe that golden age is coming to an end. I believe we are at the beginning of a golden age of vaccination and discovery of vaccines. Vaccination has the potential to prevent patients 
[normal]from 
[normal]being admitted to hospital, thereby preventing their exposure to organisms in the hospital. Vaccination also has the potential to preven
[normal]t disease in the community; 
[normal]in fact
[normal],
[normal] vaccination can prevent large epidemics. Vaccination can prevent the long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term consequences and 
[normal]sequelae
[normal] of infections. I believe that vaccination is now the best approach for looking at organisms, both resistant and multi
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]resistant
[normal] and susceptible in that fashion, by targeting multiple targets on these organisms. Antibiotics just target one aspect of the organism. Vaccines have the potential to target multiple targets on the organism. I also believe that with effective vaccines against community and healthcare
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]associated
[normal] pathogens, 
[normal]and 
[normal]effective implementation, we have the potential to reduce antibiotic resistance by up to 50%.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]We are trying to develop 
[normal]bacteriophage
[normal] therapeutics. 
[normal]Phages
[normal] are viruses that kill bacteria
[normal],
[normal] and you will be drinking them as you drink your water. They have been around for longer than bacteria. They are used regularly in the eastern bloc
[normal],
[normal] but they are not used here yet because we have not done clinical trials that are to western standards. Our belief is that they will form a complementary approach to the use of antibiotics
[normal]. T
[normal]hey are very narrow spectrum. Typically, any one phage will only kill a number of strains withi
[normal]n a bacterial species, s
[normal]o you need to know what bug you are dealing with before they are effective.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q83 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]That response, from your point of view, answers one o
[normal]f my next questions: a
[normal]re other countries ahead in your particular fields and are the procedures for adopting alternatives in the NHS easy ones to deal with?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]With vaccination
[normal],
[normal] the United Kingdom has set an extraordinary example over many years of introducing new, innovative vaccines. We 
[normal]have now 
[normal]not completely 
[normal]conquered, 
[normal]but are getting towards conquering
[normal],
[normal] the great killers of the 20th century
[normal],
[normal] and before that. We now face somewhat rarer infections in the community
[normal],
[normal] such as meningococcal infecti
[normal]on, and in the hospital, such as S
[normal]taph and 
[normal]E.coli
[normal]. With 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]extraordinary 
[normal]track record of vaccinati
[normal]on, 
[normal]the United Kingdom is in fact right at the sharp end of being able to develop new vaccines. Of course, other countries are using variou
[normal]s vaccines, and t
[normal]he United Kingdom is using those and other vaccines, so it does depend somewhat, but my point is that the United Kingdom is really very advanced with the implementation of most vaccines.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: My response
[normal] is that you need all of us in a co
[normal]-
[normal]ordinated way. You need 
[normal]phages
[normal] when you have rea
[normal]lly bad infections in hospital. You need 
[normal]vaccinations for prevention
[normal]. You need 
[normal]simple primary care approaches that stop over
[normal]-
[normal]prescription and you need near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]patient
[normal] testing
[normal],
[normal] so you need the technology. You need to implement the near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]patient
[normal] testing by making private contractors in general practice do it so that it is feasible
[normal],
[normal] so 
[normal]that 
[normal]they do not lose money. At the moment
[normal],
[normal] they would be paying for the tests themselves out of their own wages. You need better research for symptom
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]relieving
[normal] remedies
[normal],
[normal] and we need a better structure to manage that research within the NIHR. We need the vaccinations prevent
[normal]at
[normal]ively
[normal],
[normal] and we need better strategies when we have serious overwhelming infections in secondary and tertiary care environments. 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou cannot have one of us without the other. I am sorry I am in the middle. I am the GP, you see, 
[normal]and 
[normal]I am always in the middle.
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: I 
[normal]agree that we are not talking about one of our approaches against all of them. There is room for everything to fit into the health
[normal] 
[normal]care pictu
[normal]re. One of the problems, 
[normal]which George just alluded to
[normal],
[normal] was the cost of doing testing in primary care. It is an added cost, but there are ways around it. Outside of antimicrobial infection, GPs have started doing simple tests
[normal],
[normal] which stop referring to secondary care
[normal],
[normal] and the money is recouped in other ways. Companies are quite innovative at doing risk
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]sharing
[normal] projects on costing
[normal],
[normal] so I do not think that is beyond the wit of us to do. Much 
[normal]more important, I think, is 
[normal]awareness among GPs of what tests
[normal] are available commonly and
[normal] are being used in northern Europe and in the US.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q84 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]I wanted to discuss vaccinati
[normal]ons in particular, so I guess this
[normal] is 
[normal]mainly aimed at Dr McIntosh
[normal], but if anyone has any comments, please add in. In your initial answer
[normal], you 
[normal]cover
[normal]ed the broad areas and
[normal] I want to be a bit more specific. We 
[normal]have had recent news 
[normal]in the London press abo
[normal]ut TB and the incidence, or 
[normal]rates
[normal],
[normal] of TB in London in particular. The current TB vaccinations that we all ha
[normal]d
[normal] as teenagers are 70 years old now. I think you said that we are entering a golden age of vaccination. How can that be so when the vaccines are so old?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]Of course, we have had an unfortunate failure of the developmen
[normal]t of a new tuberculosis vaccine
[normal] from the Jenner Institute
[normal],
[normal] and this was sad because we do need to replace the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis. The approach that has been used for
[normal] the 
[normal]Bexsero
[normal] meningococcal 
[normal]sero
[normal]group
[normal] B vaccine is called reverse 
[normal]vaccinology
[normal],
[normal] and this is what I mean by a new golden age of vaccine development. By looking at the genetics of the organism
[normal],
[normal] we now have the pot
[normal]ential to identify targets that
[normal] ca
[normal]n be used for vaccine. The 
[normal]serogroup
[normal] B meningococcal vaccine—the Novartis 
[normal]Bexsero
[normal] vaccine—
[normal]was developed along those lines. For the 
[normal]nosocomi
[normal]al
[normal] infections—to be specific, S
[normal]taphylococcus 
[normal]aureu
[normal]s
[normal]—
[normal]t
[normal]here has also been a failure, or two failures, of vaccines.
[normal] 
[normal]E.coli
[normal], 
[normal]Acinetobacter
[normal], 
[normal]Enteroba
[normal]cteriaceae
[normal], 
[normal]Klebsiella
[normal] and so on:
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]e need to use this new sort of technology to
[normal] develop specific vaccines for Staph, 
[normal]E.coli
[normal], Staph 
[normal]epi
[normal] and so on. W
[normal]hen I 
[normal]say 
[normal]golden age, we are going to have great difficulties in developing new antibiotics unless the
[normal]re are some miracles. But we 
[normal]have the potential now to 
[normal]use genetics, looking at these very resistant organisms, to develop vaccines, not necessarily to use them throughout the whole community
[normal] for 
[normal]everyone, like we generally do
[normal], 
[normal]but 
[normal]to use these new vaccines 
[normal]in a more targeted approach, especially 
[normal]for 
[normal]people going into hospitals, people who are at risk of these serious infections.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q85 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] Is one of the problems 
[normal]y
[normal]ou face—going back to the BCG—
[normal]that it only protects against certain 
[normal]strains of the TB virus, or 
[normal]bacteria? Is there a problem that
[normal],
[normal] if you are just vaccinati
[normal]ng against certain strains, 
[normal]actually you can encourage the other strains to develop?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]The beauty of this new approach is that one can attack or prevent as many potential strains as possible, and again I refer to the meningococcal 
[normal]serogroup
[normal] B. Until
[normal] now we have had a vaccine in 
[normal]C
[normal]ó
[normal]rdoba, a vaccine in Normandy
[normal] and
[normal] a vaccine in New Zealand
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]because that is where there have
[normal] been particular strain
[normal]s
[normal] of this organism. But in fact there are hundreds of different strains of this organism around the world, the meningococcal B, and now we have the potential to have a vaccine which can cover the majority of
[normal] those strains. Similarly with S
[normal]taph, similarly with tuberculosis
[normal]; 
[normal]in fact
[normal],
[normal] what I would also like to mention
[normal]—
[normal]this might come as a surprise to you
[normal]—
[normal]is the role of viral vaccines in preventing antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance. For example, influenza may result in secondary super
[normal]-
[normal]infection, bacterial infection, and this is why the influenza vaccine has the potential to prevent antibiot
[normal]ic usage. 
[normal]I think we should be talking about bacterial vaccines
[normal] and
[normal] about viral vaccines as well.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q86 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]Why is vaccine development so much behind an
[normal]tibiotic development? Again with TB, 
[normal]it is 70 years since it was developed. There must be some sort of failure in the system.
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: With 
[normal]vaccine devel
[normal]opment we have been using, let’s call them,
[normal] old
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]fashioned approaches, 
[normal]mushing
[normal] up the organism or breaking up the organism, using bits of the organism
[normal],
[normal] intuitively trying them out. Now we have the potential to look at the genetics of the organism, do various tests after that
[normal], using bio
[normal]info
[normal]r
[normal]matics and computer systems
[normal],
[normal] and reall
[normal]y identify the targets that 
[normal]will be successful vaccine targets. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q87 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]Why has
[normal]n’t that 
[normal]come along in the past? Is it a technology thing or is it because of the market situation
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]rugs companies have a vaccine on the market, it does 90% of the job
[normal],
[normal] so, hey, it is not really worth the
[normal]ir
[normal] econom
[normal]ically developing a new vaccine.
[normal] Is that the case
[normal]?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]No.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q88 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Mosley:[bold] 
[normal]Why has it taken 70 years?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]It is a long process to develop a new antibiotic. It is also a long process to develop a new vaccine. It is very expensive. Once you have done that particular process of discovery of an antibiotic or a vaccine, then you have to run it through human clinical trials, 
[normal]you 
[normal]h
[normal]ave to get it approved and so on
[normal], so it is very costly. I think that the process of reverse 
[normal]vaccinology
[normal] will reduce the costs of developing new vaccines. I do not see any new techniques available for developing new antibiotics. I think the discovery process there is fixed. 
[normal]W
[normal]e now have a flexible, new approach to developing n
[normal]ew vaccines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q89 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David Morris:[bold] M
[normal]s Williams, you said you wanted Government action to ensure existing diagnoses were taken up more widely in the NHS. Is there ready evidence that this would be cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]effective?
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]There is some
[normal] evidence. T
[normal]here ar
[normal]e studies done on certain tests. There are international audits;
[normal] there is an audit on a C
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]reactive
[normal] protein, which is a test to show 
[normal]rise in infection. T
[normal]here are some studies
[normal],
[normal] with co
[normal]st
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]effectiveness
[normal] related,
[normal] ava
[normal]ilable from a global study
[normal]. Cost savings within the NHS are hard. There is never a bag of cas
[normal]h that is released. W
[normal]ith diagnostics, 
[normal]it is more 
[normal]that you are shifting resources to be used elsewhere
[normal],
[normal] or releasing capacity
[normal],
[normal] much more than actually turning up with money at the chief executive
[normal]’
[normal]s door
[normal],
[normal] and it is quite hard to track that through the s
[normal]ystem. It is not quite as clear; it is not as simple 
[normal]as taking a pill and someone gets better
[normal], or they don’t,
[normal] and they release a bed. Diagnostic tests produce information which is used
[normal],
[normal] but it is
[normal] only one step in the pathway. I
[normal]t is quite complex. 
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]If we use a CRP, which is C
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]r
[normal]eactive
[normal] protein, you can use i
[normal]t as a near
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]bedside
[normal] test. That is what GPs can use. It is reasonably effective at differentiating between viruses and bacteria. It is something that is used outside the 
[normal]UK
[normal] quite widely. We do not use it here, as I 
[normal]said, because it costs the GPs three 
[normal]quid each time they do it
[normal],
[normal] and t
[normal]hey might be spending a lot of three 
[normal]quids
[normal] in a
[normal] winter. We are about to pilot a large study in Southampton
[normal]—
[normal]Mike Moore is running that
[normal]. It will be piloted through our 
[normal]clerk and we will look at the cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]effectiveness
[normal] of offering that remuneratio
[normal]n within primary care. T
[normal]hat is a process that is in the planning stages at the moment. It is a very good question
[normal],
[normal] and it is one we need to answer for the NHS
[normal], but w
[normal]e need rigorous evidence
[normal],
[normal] which we do not have yet.
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: T
[normal]her
[normal]e is 
[normal]great potential for synergy between diagnostics and vaccination
[normal]. I 
[normal]refer to the previous session in terms of the fear of medical practitioners that the patient could have some underlying serious infection
[normal],
[normal] and therefore 
[normal]the wish
[normal] to prescribe antibiotics. With diagnostics and successful vaccination
[normal], we can reduce the fear level—
[normal]not only in the medical practitioners b
[normal]ut also in the public—that the
[normal] patient w
[normal]ill have a severe infection. 
[normal]I think there is a great potential for synergy between diagnostics and vaccination. 
[normal]We 
[normal]mentioned influenza diagnostics. We should mention the great success of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
[normal],
[normal] which has really reduced the fear of people having pneumonia
[normal],
[normal] because it has reduced pneumococcal pneumonia
[normal],
[normal] and the great success obviously of measles, mumps 
[normal]and 
[normal]rubella, measles being associated with pneumonia as well. 
[normal]T
[normal]he synergy between effective diagnostics and effective vaccination can certainly impact on compliance, 
[normal]the 
[normal]number of prescriptions, 
[normal]the 
[normal]fear of patients that there is a serious infection and also 
[normal]on
[normal] this public debate about whether or not antibiotics should be used.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]David, I agree with you that it could impact, but it is not
[normal],
[normal] because it is not getting into primary care. It is not happening. The science is right, but the dissemination and the activity 
[normal]are
[normal] not happening from the GP
[normal]’
[normal]s seat. 
[normal]We have real issues—
[normal]Mike Moore and some of the ot
[normal]her guys were talking about it this morning—
[normal]about a co
[normal]-
[normal]ordinated process of making this happen in primary care where the prescriptions are happening.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q90 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David Morris:[bold] 
[normal]Presumably information on the incidence of infection and resistance would be useful to companies producing diagnostic tools. Should these companies be doing more to facilitate gathering the information
[normal],
[normal] to aid their product
[normal]’
[normal]s production?
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]Access to that sort of information is quite tricky. As an industry
[normal],
[normal] we are small with limited resources
[normal],
[normal] and it is a bit of a vicious circle to drive production of a product when you have limited resources to pay for the data and the information. But companies are quite happy to work in combination with the NHS wherever possible to produce that sort of data.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q91 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] T
[normal]his is really to Mr 
[normal]Hardcastle
[normal] and Professor 
[normal]Lewith
[normal] first and foremost
[normal]. What advantages 
[normal]do your approaches have over other tradit
[normal]ional antimicrobials
[normal]?
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]The thing that gets me about this discussion is 
[normal]that 
[normal]there is lots of talk about 
[normal]“
[normal]potential
[normal]”,
[normal] and the thing that Dame Sally Davies keeps emphasising is that we are running out of time. 
[normal]T
[normal]he critical thing for us i
[normal]s that we know that 
[normal]phages
[normal] work; i
[normal]t is just that we cannot make them available in this country. The reason we cannot make them available in this country is 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have more rigorous regulatory standards. 
[normal]First, 
[normal]we know 
[normal]that 
[normal]there is evidence that they work. 
[normal]S
[normal]econd
[normal]ly,
[normal] they are harml
[normal]ess in man and they are inert; t
[normal]herefore, the rate at which you can bring them through the regulatory regime should be quicker. 
[normal]T
[normal]hird
[normal]ly,
[normal] there are lots of them. One of the issues that the antibiotic development arena has is that there are lots of possible candidates and very few of them actually get thro
[normal]ugh to being useful drugs. F
[normal]rom our perspective, we have a lot of good putative candidates already.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]I think that the nutritional and herbal approaches have some preliminary eviden
[normal]ce behind them. We need 
[normal]some further investment in research, so we need some harder studies to demonstrate that they really do control symptoms, 
[normal]and 
[normal]that they can be prescribed by GPs
[normal],
[normal] or over the counter and made available by pharmacists, so that the GPs can feel they are doing something. It is very difficult when somebody comes to ask you for help
[normal] to say,
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]Go away and put up with it for five days.
[normal]”
[normal] We do not have that kind of culture.
[normal]We need to be able to do something that is safe and does not actually load up antimicrobial resistance for the future. There is huge potential with herbal remedies, but I think we need to move away a little bit from the drug
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]mining
[normal] element of herbal remedies, where we are looking for the wonderful chemical in the way they lo
[normal]oked for the new malarial with A
[normal]rtemisia. We need to see them in a slightly different context
[normal],
[normal] as more complex mixtures of chemicals. We need to understand much more about herbal safety, because herbs generally are much safer than conventional medicines
[normal]—
[normal]the evidence is pretty overwhelming around that
[normal]—
[normal]and we need to have thoughtful levels of regulation with t
[normal]he MHRA. 
[normal]I share with John that we need a better process within our regulatory and safety processes
[normal],
[normal] to take account of things which are not standard pharmaceutical agents
[normal],
[normal] and a process which allows us to have
[normal] good, critical and 
[normal]thoughtful scientific review 
[normal]that
[normal] is relevant to the disciplines
[normal], so
[normal] that these new and old medications may be reviewed properly and scientifically.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]Our dealings with the MHRA have been pretty good
[normal],
[normal] but
[normal],
[normal] as far as I am aware, we are the only company on the planet that has regulatory approval in the way we make our product
[normal],
[normal] and that is where most of
[normal] our money has gone to date. I
[normal]t is not that the 
[normal]MHRA are difficult
[normal],
[normal] or the FDA or any of the rest of them for that matter, but the mentality makes it very difficult to bring new antimicrobials through quickly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q92 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]The UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance St
[normal]rategy 2013 to 2018 states that 
[normal]the development of novel therapies is an important element of the mult
[normal]ifaceted approach to tackling 
[normal]AR
[normal]M
[normal]. Do you then feel that more resources should be dedicated to your work
[normal],
[normal] and that this falls into the category so described here?
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]It certainly falls into that category. I get very nervous about suggesting that more money from Government should be placed behind our company or our initiative, but what you should think about is changing the landscape so that both big 
[normal]pharma
[normal] and the venture capital community will put private money behind potential new antimicrobials.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]The answer to that, I would add, 
[normal]is 
[normal]that t
[normal]he MHRA has been really helpful,
[normal] but they are surroun
[normal]ded by a regulatory system that
[normal] makes it sometimes difficult for them. 
[normal]T
[normal]he situation with herbals is very difficult because herbals are not easily patentable
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]also 
[normal]many nutritionals, which may equally be effective
[normal]. W
[normal]e have a big trial that is in debate at the moment about using nu
[normal]tritionals in care homes—
[normal]vitamin D and 
[normal]probiotics
[normal]—
[normal]to diminish or cause antibiotic prescribing. 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou have talked about care homes
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]i
[normal]t could have a big impact if we could 
[normal]do 
[normal]that. They 
[normal]are 
[normal]very simple, cheap supplements, but they are not
[normal] patentable, so it is very difficult for us to 
[normal]combine with industry to do that
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e need to do that with Government
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]funded
[normal] research boards
[normal],
[normal] and that is difficult with the present structure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q93 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] D
[normal]eveloping this theme for a second, accor
[normal]ding to a submission from the Chinese Medical Institute, 
[normal]research in China tells us that the 
[normal]“
[normal]immunomodulatory
[normal] actions of 
[normal]traditional Chinese medicine formulations have a stimulatory effect on immune cells, immune organs,
[normal] cytokine production
[normal] as well as inhibitory effect on in
[normal]flammations, allergies and auto
[normal]immune diseases. Studies on acupuncture have shown that this treatment can increas
[normal]e the release of endogen 
[normal]opioid
[normal] peptides—”
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: Endog
[normal]e
[normal]n
[normal]ous opiates.
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] Thank you, Professor. “—t
[normal]hat affect the immune system. Indeed, acupuncture can strengthen the immune system
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he effect can 
[normal]be 
[normal]further enhanced with acupuncture when combined with Chinese herbal medicine
[normal]”—and w
[normal]estern medicine.
[normal] 
[normal]Is this not something that we should be looking at more carefully? They have a body of knowledge there that has been developed over thousands of years. 
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]We are. First, we are looking at it. Secondly, that is a bit of a claim, and I will just leave it at that. Thirdly, you are unlikely to go to your GP in 
[normal]London
[normal] and get acupuncture for your chest infection. That is not going to be cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]effective. That is not a reasonable thing to expect the NHS to pay for. But, for instance, we are currently doing a study in 
[normal]Southampton
[normal] on recurrent urinary tract infections in older women
[normal],
[normal] which is a big problem for a significant minority of older women
[normal],
[normal] in which we are using Chinese herbal medicines instead of antibiotics. We think that they act in several ways. Interestingly, they act to block the cell membrane pumping the antibiotic out
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of the ways that the body becomes resistant to antibiotics is that 
[normal]it
[normal] get
[normal]s
[normal] rid of 
[normal]them
[normal] from the bacterial cells very quickly
[normal]; 
[normal]synergistically
[normal],
[normal] the herbs appear to stop that membrane transport pump
[normal],
[normal] so the antibiotics can stay in the cells for longer. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of the actions of the particular concoction of herbal medicines we are using does that. It also has direct 
[normal]antibacterial effects. The whole point of this process is 
[normal]that we can do this, 
[normal]and 
[normal]we can do it very scientifically
[normal] and very thoughtfully, b
[normal]ut we cannot do it in an easily patentable way
[normal],
[normal] and commercialisation is difficult.
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: O
[normal]ne needs to remember that there is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence in favour of immunisation and vaccination
[normal],
[normal] and that immunisa
[normal]tion and vaccination is preventa
[normal]tive. 
[normal]T
[normal]o crystallise your point, do you want to go down the path of treatment or do you want to go down the path of prevention? I think prevention is, ultimately, in the short term and the long term
[normal],
[normal] going to be the way to combat antibiotic resistance.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]I am a big fan of vaccines, but all I would point out again is the time line. Traditionally, vaccines work better against viruses than bacteria
[normal],
[normal] and I am not sure it makes commercial sense to develop vaccines against all bacteria that cause problems, simply because not everyone gets infected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q94 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] I have j
[normal]ust one more question. I think I am right in saying that none of you a
[normal]re qualified as homeopaths, but,
[normal] Professor 
[normal]Lewith
[normal], 
[normal]I think 
[normal]your submissi
[normal]on was in conjunction with Dr Peter Fisher
[normal], who is the Queen
[normal]’
[normal]s physician
[normal].
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]He is.
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] He
[normal] also runs the 
[normal]London h
[normal]ospital for integrated 
[normal]medicine
[normal]. He draws attention in your submission
[normal]—
[normal]I assume it is him
[normal]—
[normal]to a health technology a
[normal]ssessment commissioned by the Swiss Federal G
[normal]overnment which found that 
[normal]“29 clinical trials of hom
[normal]eopathy for upper respiratory tract
[normal] infection or allergies found 29 clinical studies
[normal] of which 24 were positive for
[normal] hom
[normal]eopathy.
[normal]”
[normal] He also refers to a study supported by the Indian Minis
[normal]try of Health, which “involved 
[normal]collaboration between conventional ear, nose and throat specialists and homeopathic doctors in a randomised control
[normal]led trial of hom
[normal]eopathy versus conventional treatment in acute 
[normal]otitis
[normal] media
[normal].”
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t suggests that the numbers of antibiotic presc
[normal]riptions in the 
[normal]homeopathically
[normal] 
[normal]treated group were much lower. Although this is not particularly your field, would it not be sensible for us to make further investigations in this field to establish whether its usage is effective?
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]There are two things. First, I agree that vaccinations are very important preventatively
[normal],
[normal] but you are not going to stop every virus or bacteria with vaccinations. We need some interventions. Secondly, as far as homeopathy is concerned, this Committee has been around the corner very publicly with homeopathy previously and I do not want to get involved in that. The biggest impact a general practitioner has in a consultation is the consultation
[normal]. W
[normal]hen you consider that we 
[normal]have
[normal] an ageing population with multi
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]morbidity
[normal], pain, arthritis, hypertension, irritable bowel, headaches and all sorts of things, 
[normal]for 
[normal]the vast majority of those chronic illnesses, except perhaps hypertension, the biggest response is 
[normal]to 
[normal]the consultation, not the medicine. If you go to a GP and get a homeopathic medicine, it may well be a placebo
[normal],
[normal] but you may go away without using your antibiotics. That happens quite a lot in 
[normal]France
[normal] and it seems to be quite an effective way of minimising antibiotic prescribing. If you wanted to know whether homeopathy really worked for these infections, then you would need to do more clinical trials
[normal],
[normal] because the trials are promising but small. T
[normal]here are about 80,000 medically qualified hom
[normal]eopaths, mainly in France and Germany, who use homeopathy 
[normal]in this situation quite regularly
[normal],
[normal] and the evidence is that they use many fewer antibiotics. Whether that is all placebo or real effect, we do not know yet.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q95 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] B
[normal]efore we move on, to help my understanding, could micro
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]organisms develop resistance to either the 
[normal]bacteriophage
[normal] approach or indeed the herbal approach?
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]Resistance in micro
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]organisms is very interesting. If you go back to the genome of the micro
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]organism
[normal],
[normal] you note that they evolved with fungi. Most of our antibiotics a
[normal]re fungi. There is 
[normal]an interesting theory that quite a lot of the current antimicrobial resistance is the reawakening of old evolutionary genes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]f you remember Fleming
[normal]’
[normal]s experiment 
[normal]in 
[normal]St Mary
[normal]’
[normal]s, the fungi flew in from the window, sat on his plate and the penicillin 
[normal]fungus killed the bacteria. O
[normal]ur antibiotics largely come from fungi 
[normal]that
[normal] have co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]evolved
[normal] with bacteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q96 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]So the answer to my question is yes.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]Yes. The argument here around vaccination and stimulating the immune system becomes ve
[normal]ry powerfully preventative
[normal] if you look at the evolutionary context of antimicrobial resistance.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]Just for a bit of background, 
[normal]phages
[normal] have been around for about 3 billion years an
[normal]d bacteria just afterwards. T
[normal]here has been, for want of a better expression, an arms race going on between the pair of them for a long time. Every day about a quarter of all bact
[normal]eria are killed by 
[normal]phages
[normal] world
[normal]wide. 
[normal]T
[normal]o be clear, the way they apply them is as a cocktail
[normal],
[normal] so that you do not get that concern practically.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q97 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]Further research seems to be key to finding future developments. Who should be the main funders
[normal],
[normal] or who are the main funders of the various types of research that are going on?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]T
[normal]his is obviously relevant to a
[normal] big question for vaccination
[normal],
[normal] because vaccine
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]developing
[normal] companies invest hundreds of millions of dollars and pounds in developing new vaccines.
[normal] Universities and 
[normal]biotechs
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]often involved
[normal] at very early stages
[normal],
[normal] but then you get to the very expensive part of doing the big clinical trials, which we have all referred to
[normal]. T
[normal]o get these products approved one has to do clinical trials. The question then comes on to the val
[normal]ue that the particular product—
[normal]the phage
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]homeopathic
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]vaccine
[normal],
[normal] obviously, or 
[normal]the antibiotic for that matter—
[normal]will have to the NHS in reducing cost. The balance is the amount of i
[normal]nvestment being put in and the cost-benefit to the national health service that will come out—
[normal]the reduction in antibiotic prescriptions, the reduction in antibiotic resistance. My quick answer really is that in appraising vaccines
[normal]—
[normal]I am not going 
[normal]to comment on the 
[normal]phages
[normal] or hom
[normal]eopathy
[normal]—
[normal]we now need new ways of appraising using health technology assessment to assess the cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]effectiveness
[normal] of vaccines, not only in the community but also within the hospital setting.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]Stephen, did you mean as in who should be picking up the tab for the development of new antimicrobials?
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]No, non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]chemical
[normal] antibiotics. Who is funding the research that is going on at the moment?
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]I would say that any antimicrobial
[normal]—
[normal]it does not really matter whether it is a vaccine, a phage or a new drug
[normal]—
[normal]for the most part should be funded by the private sector. The reason I say that is that you need to ensure that everyone is appropriately incentivised. The reason there are few new antibiotics coming along is that it is not worth big 
[normal]pharma
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] while to put their effort there. That is why
[normal],
[normal] if you look at the top selling drugs, they are antidepressants, cholesterol reducers and the like. 
[normal]W
[normal]hat you need to do is change the landscape to encourage those with very deep pockets to take advantage of the good work that is done in academic centres already. It is not an issue about a lack of good ideas. The real issue is when it gets expensive and you have to make it 
[normal]worth
[normal] 
[normal]while
[normal] for those with deep pockets to make a turn.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: I 
[normal]agree with that completely.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q98 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]I was just going to use you as an example of why you may not agree with that.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: Thank you. W
[normal]e can always turn the arguments round the other way. I think what John is saying is 
[normal]that 
[normal]we need different kind
[normal]s
[normal] of processes to incentivise companies. There are 
[normal]lots of 
[normal]big herbal companies
[normal] in Europe—
[normal]unfortunately not in this country because we seem to be in the process of destroyi
[normal]ng that industry at the moment—that
[normal] produce very good quality products and want to work with us
[normal],
[normal] and we need to make that easier and more feasible
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e need to understand tha
[normal]t if they are going to invest 
[normal]£1 million in a clinical trial they need to have something out of that
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat then comes back to the process of patenting and how we manage that insti
[normal]tutionally. People are willing; 
[normal]we 
[normal]just 
[normal]need to create the right environment for that to happen.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q99 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]That was my point. You were saying how difficult it was to patent herbs. 
[normal]C
[normal]an you give us some direction that we should go in
[normal],
[normal] to try and resolve this
[normal],
[normal] rather than saying 
[normal]“This is the problem”
[normal]? We can all see that. What is the resolution to that problem?
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]The resolution is to have commitment from both public and private joint ventures
[normal] that 
[normal]wo
[normal]rk well, because if you incentivise
[normal] people they work harder and they do not sit on their bums and expect the Government to pay. I think that is really important. The other thing is 
[normal]that 
[normal]we 
[normal]can 
[normal]create
[normal] 
[normal]patented remedies around two or three herbals 
[normal]that
[normal] might do this
[normal],
[normal] and they might be very effective mechanisms of symptom control
[normal]; 
[normal]some of the big Chinese companie
[normal]s are really interested in this
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]e need to reach out to them
[normal] and
[normal] get our MHRA inspectors going 
[normal]in
[normal]to 
[normal]China
[normal] to make sure that these products are produced to good manufacturing practice. We need to be more open in our universities and incentivise 
[normal]them
[normal] to set up joint ventures
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]we need 
[normal]to have facilities within the MHRA so that they
[normal] can understand and facilitate—not drop standards—
[normal]and bring in the skilled people who understand these processes and can let us work. I think if we can do that
[normal], it is not expensive: it needs legislation 
[normal]and a few people.
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]Could I give you a concrete example of why big 
[normal]pharma
[normal] might not want to invest in antibiotics or vaccines? The concrete example is the vaccine I referred to before, 
[normal]Bexsero
[normal], the meningococcal B vaccine
[normal],
[normal] which has had a huge amount of investment and approval in 
[normal]Europe
[normal] but rec
[normal]ently got knocked back by the 
[normal]JCBI. Now of course the JCBI is reviewing that decision and putting some new inputs into their model, but for big 
[normal]pharma
[normal], let us say, the investment that one has to make in a vaccine such as 
[normal]Bexsero
[normal], or a vaccine for S
[normal]taphylococcus 
[normal]aureus
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]E.coli
[normal] or 
[normal]Acinetobacter
[normal],
[normal] is huge
[normal],
[normal] and the tools we have for measuring the potential benefit for the NHS and the health system in general are not the best tools
[normal]. That is a concrete example
[normal] 
[normal]where I think 
[normal]a big 
[normal]pharma
[normal] company may think twice about investing huge amounts of money in any intervention if there is not more of an as
[normal]surance of it being recommended—
[normal]whether it be a phage, homeopathy or a vaccine such as 
[normal]Bexsero
[normal], which is now available to prevent the most common cause of childh
[normal]ood infectious death in the UK
[normal]. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne thinks
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“T
[normal]his is a huge investment, but is this product or vaccine going to be recommended?
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q100 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] It strikes me that
[normal] barriers to the resear
[normal]ch are the regulatory framework and
[normal] the tools that are used to work out that cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]benefit
[normal] analysis. Funding is an issue because of some of that. Are there any other barriers to people investing? The will? Is there a will to research?
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]There may not be a will to research certain things 
[normal]like 
[normal]phages
[normal] or herbal medicines; t
[normal]here may not be enough investme
[normal]nt academically to do that. S
[normal]etting up one or two centres of excellence would be really helpful and can be done relatively cheaply in joint ventures with specific universities 
[normal]that
[normal] express interest. 
[normal]S
[normal]mall amounts of money can be used to seed things. 
[normal]I
[normal]f you get the academic interest and get people on side
[normal], in
[normal] the clinical professions, you can begin to make things change.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: My experience on this has been that
[normal] we have had to go outside the UK to tie up with centres of excellence in our business, but really there are three things you need to think about. 
[normal]First, you 
[normal]need to think about changing when the patent time starts ticking
[normal]. R
[normal]ather than 
[normal]it being 
[normal]when you apply for a patent, you need to tie it to whe
[normal]n you can sell the medicine. S
[normal]econd
[normal]ly,
[normal] you need to think about why 
[normal]it 
[normal]is that those folk who set the drug tariffs believe it is worse to die of cancer
[normal] than it is to die of pneumonia,
[normal] because right now you can get a heck of a lot more mon
[normal]ey for a new drug against, let’
[normal]s say, bowel cancer than you can against a new antibiotic or antimicrobial. 
[normal]T
[normal]hird
[normal]ly,
[normal] you might think about supercharging 
[normal]E
[normal]IS relief
[normal],
[normal] which should be relatively straightforward. You are not going to be able to pick winners
[normal],
[normal] so what you should be thinking about is saying 
[normal]that 
[normal]those folk who are prepared to back companies in our situation need to be encouraged to divert more of their spare cash 
[normal]away from, let’s say, a bricks and 
[normal]mortar deal or a software development company into antimicrobials.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q101 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]Thank 
[normal]you. There is a proposal for a D
[normal]iagno
[normal]stics and Stratified Medicine Catapult C
[normal]entre. Do you think that is the right approach
[normal],
[normal] or do you think we should have one that specialises in antibiotics research and things associated with that
[normal]—
[normal]diagnostics?
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]We were delighted in the diagnostics industry that the TSB recogni
[normal]sed the importance of having a C
[normal]atapult to get diagnostics used
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] that
[normal] stratified medicine is 
[normal]across the whole heal
[normal]th care continuum, 
[normal]diagnosing, ruling out, monitoring and managing disease as well. I would be highly in favour of that continuing along the plans that they have got going at the moment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q102 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Stephen Metcalfe:[bold] 
[normal]Does anyone else have a comment on that?
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]It would probably be no bad thing to align those 
[normal]kinds of initiatives with the 
[normal]import 
[normal]that Dame Sally gives, b
[normal]ut I would say 
[normal]that 
[normal]the diagnostic aspect is absolutely critical.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q103 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]You have covered quite extensively the barriers to research in the UK. Could you tell us a bit more about barriers to introducing new techniques to the market
[normal],
[normal] apart from research?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]First, I will make a broad comment,
[normal] not necessarily about vaccines.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e do value more, I think, interventions for the elderly end
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]life
[normal] type of approaches which may extend life perhaps by a few months or improve quality of life in older people and the elderly
[normal],
[normal] and there is nothing wrong with that at all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q104 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]I am sorry, Dr McIntosh, when you say 
[normal]“
[normal]we
[normal]”,
[normal] who are you referring to?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]I am saying 
[normal]“
[normal]broadly speaking
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]Are you making a comment about the age of politicians now?
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]I am speaking as a paediatrician
[normal];
[normal] we could spend more investment and resources at the beginning
[normal],
[normal] in
[normal] childhood, in paediatrics. 
[normal]I am speaking, I guess, as a paediatrician more than anything, again not devaluing what is done for elderly 
[normal]people 
[normal]and 
[normal]older people, but 
[normal]I think we could perhaps start to transfer the focus to earlier times i
[normal]n life, childhood, paediatrics and 
[normal]even neonato
[normal]logy, with vaccines coming in for
[normal] that area as well
[normal],
[normal] where we can really improve not only the quality of life but the length of life by preventing childhood infections. Secondly, preventing childho
[normal]od infections with vaccines has
[normal] been shown to have a benefit for adult and elderly population
[normal]s as well;
[normal] the pneumococcal and influenza vaccination programmes are cases in point where an intervention in childhood has an extreme benefit in the a
[normal]dult and elderly population. 
[normal]I think we can start to link up a little bit the beginning
[normal] of life
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of life.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q105 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]I would be quite interes
[normal]ted to hear, M
[normal]s Williams, about the barriers that BIVDA feel are prevalent in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], particularly within the NHS.
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]One of the barriers is the financial flows around the NHS systems in both 
[normal]England
[normal] and the developed nations. Pathology generally has a budget to provide the testing 
[normal]for all of the hospital care and 
[normal]local community care as well
[normal],
[normal] and that means that there is a restriction on the amount of testing that can be done.
[normal] O
[normal]ne of the things we would like to see
[normal],
[normal] wherever tests ar
[normal]e specific to a patient pathway, is
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]the relevant department actually 
[normal]picks up the costs of that
[normal],
[normal] because, as we have said, the cost of a diagnostic test is relatively cheap on the whole and the value it provides is much higher. But if you
[normal] have a restricted silo budget for 
[normal]numerous tests on respiratory infections
[normal]—
[normal]respiratory infections are the second of the main 
[normal]causes of admission to hospital—and 
[normal]if you have an old
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]fashioned microbiology lab
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which
[normal] will very effectively pick
[normal] up the cause of the infection but 
[normal]will take t
[normal]ime to culture those plates up,
[normal] it is very difficult to 
[normal]introduce a new technology that
[normal] will be slightly more expensive
[normal] but 
[normal]means that the patient could get the right antibiotic therapy within five hours of being admitted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q106 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] I know we are running short of
[normal] time, but I am interested in everyone
[normal]’
[normal]s view 
[normal]on this, particularly yours:
[normal] do you think that the new structure
[normal]s within NHS England are
[normal] going to be a help or a hindrance to getting new techniques through?
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]At the moment
[normal],
[normal] it does not look like the situation for us has changed significantly. Maybe it will and commissioning may help in that, but one of our problems is the lack of awareness as well
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]we need 
[normal]to make physicians aware 
[normal]of the tests that are available.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e have talked about CRP, but there are simple swab tests that could be used in primary care 
[normal]that
[normal] are routinely used el
[normal]sewhere, which just give a colour-
[normal]change reaction in the same 
[normal]way
[normal] as a pre
[normal]gnancy kit. They take seconds to do and 
[normal]co
[normal]st
[normal] maybe £1 or £2
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e have to find a way of financing that, but it is 
[normal]about 
[normal]educating GPs. I even thought that having a biomedical scientist working in the c
[normal]ommunity would be a way to support 
[normal]GP
[normal]s’ workload
[normal] for that sort of point
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]care
[normal] testing.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]We have a uniquely refined primary care research structure in the UK which is probably the best in the world
[normal],
[normal] and it is really well funded. It has not been dramatically affected by the NHS changes
[normal],
[normal] becaus
[normal]e it is mainly an academic and
[normal] NIHR
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]funded
[normal] structure
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a huge amoun
[normal]t that we could do if we took 
[normal]co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordinated and
[normal] thoughtful action on this. I
[normal]t is very attractive to large 
[normal]pharma
[normal] to do that kind of work in the UK
[normal],
[normal] because they know it will be hig
[normal]h quality. W
[normal]e could do a lot of these things here
[normal],
[normal] within the community
[normal],
[normal] very ef
[normal]fectively and earn money from them
[normal].
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]You asked about the barriers
[normal], a
[normal]s I understood it, in relation to the NHS. The issue for us is cultural. There is a real familiarity with using antibiotics to sort out infectious disease
[normal],
[normal] and it is not necessarily easy for cli
[normal]nicians to have to deal with a
[normal] number of different approaches to killing a troublesome bug
[normal],
[normal] so there is going to be a cultural issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q107 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Pamela Nash:[bold] 
[normal]When you say a 
[normal]“
[normal]cultural issue
[normal]”
[normal], who is this affecting? 
[normal]I
[normal]t is the same with what you 
[normal]were saying about 
[normal]BIVDA
[normal]; 
[normal]there is a high recognition within this place, for 
[normal]instance, about what BIVDA does.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]Say, for example, 
[normal]that 
[normal]someone comes in and they have an infection, the typical response would be a broad spectrum antibiotic, initially. If you have rapid diagnostics and you know exactly which version of a bug is causing you difficulty, you could apply a narrow spectrum treatment
[normal],
[normal] which would give you a better outcome
[normal],
[normal] but it would require a different approach by the clinicians treating the patient.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]The medical culture, not the culture in the House of Commons.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q108 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Can we pin this down a bit more? There is a UK antim
[normal]icrobial resistance strategy 
[normal]2013
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]18. Does that strategy encompass fully the approaches that each of you 
[normal]is
[normal] adopting? If not, what amendments would you recommend
[normal]?
[normal] I will just go down the table and ask that.
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]I know 
[normal]phages
[normal] are mentioned on page 18, so yes is the short answer. The key issue is the funding.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Dr McIntosh? 
[normal]Dr McIntosh[bold]: 
[normal]The strategy is a good document but it does not explicitly or implicitly state that vaccination has had a role in reducing 
[normal]antibiotic 
[normal]c
[normal]onsumption or
[normal] antibiotic resistance
[normal],
[normal] and does not implicitly or explicitly state that in the future vaccination has a role in reducing antibiotic resistance.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Can we leave Professor 
[normal]Lewith
[normal] till last
[normal]?
[normal]Doris-Ann Williams[bold]: 
[normal]I think the strategy is excellent. It does mention diagnostics. I was quite surprised in the earlier session to hear that GPs are not considering prescription of antibiotics. When you think that must be the most common prescription they write, you would think they would look for a tool and that that would still be at the forefront of their mind.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q109 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]The reason I left you 
[normal]till
[normal] last, Professor 
[normal]Lewith
[normal], is that I want to split the answer in two from you, one in respect of what you said about herbal and the other in response to David 
[normal]Tredinnick
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] question, your response on hom
[normal]eopathy
[normal],
[normal] because I guess there mu
[normal]st be two separate answers
[normal].
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: 
[normal]Yes, there are.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q110 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Professor Davies is on record to this Committee and talking to the Lords as saying that 
[normal]“
[normal]outwith
[normal] the placebo effect
[normal], hom
[normal]eopathy has no impact
[normal].
[normal] I am very concerned when homeopathic practitioners try 
[normal]and
[normal] peddle this way of life to prevent malaria or other infectious diseases. I am quite clear 
[normal]about where 
[normal]I believe the evidence is.
[normal]” 
[normal]I am presuming you might have two separate answers.
[normal]Professor [bold]Lewith[bold]: Let’
[normal]s answer the difficult one first. I do not t
[normal]hink you should be using hom
[normal]eopathy with malaria; I think that is outrageous. In dealing with acute infections, the actual evidence, if you look at it, is unclear 
[normal]as to 
[normal]whether it is a placebo or not. With the greatest respect, I do not think Dame Sally Davies has perhaps studied that evidence in any detail, but I think the jury is very much out on that. I do not think it is conclusive. I would support that by saying that you can look at 
[normal]the same data in two separate 
[normal]Lancet
[normal] systematic reviews about hom
[normal]eopathy and come to entirely opposing conclusions
[normal],
[normal] which, to me, me
[normal]ans there is not enough data. 
[normal]As to t
[normal]he second
[normal],
[normal] in terms of herbal medicine, I agree that the policy is a great policy. I have read it and I think it covers most of the issues. I think that the issues around herbal medicine are around regulatory issues and facilitating expertise in the 
[normal]UK
[normal],
[normal] and within that context, with 
[normal]very small changes, we could do some quite interesting things in the same way as they are doing in continental 
[normal]Europe
[normal].
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I thank the panel for their presentations this morning
[normal].
[normal] It has been a very interesting morning all round. If you have any additional information you would like to submit, please feel free.

[normal]Q111 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Dowd:[bold] 
[normal]I have one brief question, if I may, Chair. If 
[normal]phages
[normal] are killing a quarter of all the bacteria in the world every day, how come there is still so much of it about?
[normal]John [bold]Hardcastle[bold]: 
[normal]It is those pesky bacteria
[normal] that go and
[normal] breed the next day.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]On that point, thank you very much for your attendance.
