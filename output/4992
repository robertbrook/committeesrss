defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWelcome 
defaultto 
defaulteveryone here this morning. Thank you very much for coming. The subject of our inquiry has 
defaultcoincidentally
default captured some media
default attention, with a piece on 
defaultregional BBC news the night before last
default and
default on the BBC 
default“
defaultInside Out
default” programme on TB
default 
defaulti
defaultn London
default,
default and today the Wellcome Trust on Radio 4 
defaultwas 
defaulttalking about antimicrobial
default resistance as well. F
defaultrom discussions we have had with Dame Sally Davies
default,
default we realise that t
defaulthis is an area of some 
defaultconcern, so w
defaulte want to cover a 
defaultnumber of aspects 
defaultthis morning
default.
default 
defaultJ
defaultust for the record
default,
default I would be grateful if the four of you would introduce yourselves very briefly.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultI am Professor Anthony 
defaultKessel
default. I am director of public health strategy and the responsible officer at Public Health 
defaultEngland
default. I also have a chair at
default the London School of
default Hygiene and
default Tropical Medicine.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultI am Michael Moore
default. I am a general practitioner. 
defaultI have been a GP in 
defaultSalisbury
default for 26 years. I al
defaultso hold a research post at the U
defaultniversity of Southampton. I am here today as I am representing the Royal College of General Practitioners. I am their national clinical champion for antimicrobial stewardship.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: I am Alison Holmes. I am 
defaultprofessor of i
defaultnfectious diseases at Imperial C
defaultollege London
default,
default and I am also a director of infection prevention and control within the NHS.
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultMy name is Susan Hopkins and I am a consultant in infectious diseases and 
defaultmicrobiology at the Royal Free H
defaultospital in London. I also work with Public Health 
defaultEngland
default as a healthcare epidemiologist. I am here today representing the Royal College of Physicians as chair of their HCAI working group.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultThank you very much. First of all
default, a straightforward question: w
defaultho is currently accountable for ensuring adherence to the Department of Health policies for reducing antimicrobial resistance? 
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: At an NHS level—
defaultfrom the p
defaultoint of view within the NHS—
defaultthe Health and Social Care Act 2008
default,
default updated in 2011
default,
default clearly gives responsibility for health
default 
defaultcare
default&#x2011;
defaultassociated
default infections, antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship to the chief responsible officer, the chief executive of those organisations. There is also a personal responsibility within 
defaultthe
default Health and Social Care Act for everyone working in health
default 
defaultcare to prevent infection spreading from one patient to the other and to make sure that they use antibiotics as prudently as possible.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultWithin acute care and acute hospitals, the structure is such that the chief executive is responsible for the delivery of that
default,
default but there is a director of infec
defaulttion prevention and control who
default reports directly to the chief executive
default,
default with the responsibility of addressing infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship within that trust.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe hear of clinician
default&#x2011;
defaultfocused
default initiatives like 
default“Start Smart—Then F
defaultocus
default”
default. How effective are initiatives like that in dealing with issues like antimicrobial resistance?
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultWe welcome 
defaultsuch 
defaultinitiatives
default.
default. I particularly welcome initiatives such as that
default,
default because it actually focuses on the principles of good prescribing rather than the kind of technical expertise of which drug, what type of organism
default; 
defaultit 
defaultactually 
defaultfocuses on safe and best practice
default,
default which means that it is much more amenable to all of t
defaulthose involved in 
defaultprescribing
default antibiotics,
default administering antibiotics or caring for patients on antibiotics. That type of approach is extremely welcome, but we must remi
defaultnd ourselves that it is not a policy;
default it is a guideline
default. I
defaultt is a framework that can be adopted to promote best practice within acute care. I 
defaultwelcome the fact that it emphasises best practice and p
defaultrinciples of good prescribing. 
defaultWe have used it locally to promote multi
default&#x2011;
defaultprofessional
default engagement, so it is not just for doctors who prescribe; it is for nurses who look after
default,
default and 
defaultit is 
defaultfor pharmacists who are involved in the managing of drugs. 
defaultI
defaultt has been a useful external reinforcement. 
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: O
defaultne of the key things is ensuring that we get the best agent to the patient up
default 
defaultfront to reduce morbidity and mortality from sepsis, so we often start broadly. One of the key things in 
default“Start Smart—Then F
defaultocus
default”
default is focusing down after two to three days of treatment into a n
defaultarrow agent that has less 
defaultimpact on both the microbiology in the individual patient 
defaultand
default the microbiology in the environment of the hospital that can then 
defaultlead to
default onward transmission events within hospitals. One of the things about 
default“Start S
defaultmart
default—Then F
defaultocus
default”
default is that it focuses the need for good microbiology and diagnostics up
default 
defaultfront and requires people to think about
default what they need at the start. It requires
default education and train
defaulting of individuals to know 
defaultthe right tests to do when a
defaultn unwell
default pa
defaulttient comes into hospital
default. 
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultIt is altering the message slightly, which I think is really important. This is not all about control of antibiotics; it is access to effective antibiotics
default, so 
defaultstarting sma
defaultrt is a critical component
default. What we need, though, is teeth around these things. This is a 
defaultvery useful 
defaultguideline
default, 
defaultbut it would be useful to have a little bit more regulation
default.
default I am speaking for acute trusts
default,
default and my collea
defaultgue can talk about primary care,
default but in terms of acute trusts it would be quite useful if we started to look at process indicators and best practice
default, and got a 
defaultbit more teeth around what is good pra
defaultctice. A
defaultt the end of 
default“Start Smart” there i
defaults a variety of guidelines, but it would be useful if we could tell trusts that they need to deliver on this.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I
defaults the message the same
default 
defaulti
defaultn primary care?
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultIt is complicated in primary care because you are talking about individual practitioners who are self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed
default. T
defaulthey sit in their office
default,
default and they are the people controlling the prescription pad, as it were. They are much more distant from these kinds of 
defaultinitiatives and regulation. I
defaultt is much more difficult to influence them. We have obviously made attempts with the 
defaultTARGET
default website, which is a collection of educational tools for GPs to teach them about more rational prescribing, but we cannot force people to do these things and we cannot force them to change. It is much more difficult to influence individual GPs
default,
default and at the moment there are not
default any regulatory approaches that
default do that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Have 
defaultthe new structures that have been e
defaultstablished in the NHS 
defaulthelped or hindered this process?
defaultDr Mooredefault: I
defaultt has disrupted continuity and it is less clear now 
defaulton 
defaultthe mechanisms for influence than it was before. I am sure things will sort themselves out with time, but when there were PCTs there were prescribing advisers within the
defaultm
default and they communicated with the GPs in their patch, whereas 
defaultnow 
defaultthey have b
defaulteen made homeless; they are 
defaultfinding themselves, I think, back in Public Health England. A big organisational change is disruptive, so I do not think at the moment we are quite clear how to influence GPs. They are contracted through the area teams, which is NHS England work
defaulting through the area teams. 
defaultI anticipate that in time they will be looking at things like antimicrobial stewardship
default,
default but at the moment that is not at the top of their priority list.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWho has the responsibility overall to pull that together?
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultI guess that resides with NHS England
default, which then contract 
defaultGPs through the area teams.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultDo you think that current undergraduate medical courses focus enough on antimicrobial resistance
default, and,
default if not, what should be done about it, please?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultThe
default first thing to say is that 
defaultundergraduate medical courses are at the moment both regulated and have standards applied by the General Medical Council. I reviewed the curricula for those courses recently
default,
default and what the GMC says is that they should have some training in microbiology, and microbiology obviously includes looking at micro
default-
defaultorganisms and resistance. It also mentions that it is important to understand the principles of infection prevention and control
default,
default and antibiotic prescribing. 
defaultW
defaulte know that there is variability in the 
defaultnumber 
defaultof hours of training that are given to medical students across the country. It is an area that has had various amounts of attention
default,
default depending on the s
defaultkills that the university set. 
defaultPotentially there is an opportunity now with the AMR strategy to bring this to the fore, both with the General Medical Council and with Health Education England
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaulttalk to them about strengthening that area of their curriculum. Obviously every area of the curriculum fights for its support and i
defaultts necessary niche, but 
defaultit i
defaults an area that cross
default&#x2011;
defaultcuts
default all
default the delivery of medicine
default,
default 
defaultin that
default we know that every individual who works as a doctor will prescribe an antibiotic du
defaultring their day
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultday life. I
defaultt could be 
defaultstrengthened, but it is 
defaultin the curriculum at 
defaultpresent
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWho 
defaultd
defaulto you think should be responsible for the curriculum content of medical degrees?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultThe General Medical Council is a very good place to start with the curriculum content
default,
default as they are responsible for doctors and for their revalidation in the future. Health Education England
default’
defaults new role of delivering an effective work
default 
defaultforce has to start to develop what it wants undergraduate curricula to look like across the board for health work
default 
defaultforce delivery. 
defaultThe GMC set the standards and review
default the universities
default—attend universities and review whether
default they are meeting the minimum standards that are required
default—
defaultbut the question is whether those standards need to be enhanced at the moment to make sure that we bring this
default,
default as an area of patient safety
default,
default 
defaultacross the board and improve i
defaultt for undergraduate health
default 
defaultcare.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultMuch of the Government
default’
defaults antimicrobial resistance strategy, perhaps naturally
default, focused on increasing supply—
defaultlooking at new ways of finding antibiotics and looking at encouraging
default drug companies to produce them.
default 
defaultW
defaultould you agree that we should be looking at reducing demand much more and looking at some of the other options that are currently available, perhaps not tested as much as other drugs, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine and possi
defaultbly hom
defaulteopathic medicine, which is used widely outside this country? What do you think 
defaultabout reducing demand through looking at other options
default,
default and should more research money be spent on these topics?
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: One of the good opportunities in
default the new strategy is co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination around professional education and public awareness. That goes not just for doctors, both undergraduate and postgraduate
default—
defaultwe have only talked about undergraduate medicine here
default—
defaultbut across other health
default 
defaultcare professionals who are all involved in antimicro
defaultbial resistance and play a part.
default Public Health England will play a big role in 
defaultthe 
defaultco
default&#x2011;
defaultordination of that improved professional education. In relation to your question about other ways of reducing demand, I think, yes, one of those includes greater public awareness
default, so that the public—patients—
defaultmake 
defaultfewer
default unnecessary demands, or inappropriate demands, for antibiotics. 
defaultI
defaultt is important in terms of what is prov
defaultided that it is evidence based—
defaultthat you are providing treatment or interventions that are evidence based. Some of the things that are encouraged in the strategy around alternatives to antibiotics include vaccines against bacteria and more work on diagnostics that can assist 
defaultin 
defaultappropriate prescribing and those kinds of things.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultCould I pick up on the education questions and expand 
defaulton what my colleague was saying?
default 
defaultT
defaulthe GMC is responsible
default,
default but the universities can deliver that in a 
defaultvariety
default of ways
default,
default and some UKCRC
default&#x2011;
defaultfunded
default work has just demonstrated the enormous variability in the education provided in our medical schools, from a range of five hours to over 240 hours in 
defaultthis domain. I
defaultt is there, 
defaultbut 
defaultthere is a huge amount of variability
default,
default and this 
defaultis
default looking at antibi
defaultotic safety and antibiotic use 
defaultas a kind of core aspect of training that
default maybe goes across 
defaultall people involved in health
default 
defaultcare. We are talking about medical students here, but we should also be talking about our pharmacists and nurses as well
default,
default perhaps having some kind of core principles
default,
default and then, on top of that, different types of education depending on the profession a
defaultnd the type of development the 
defaultindividual needs. There is enormous variability, but we can do a lot more 
defaultto
default improve it
default,
default and look at innovation and how we teach as well.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwant
default to come back to the alternative treatments for symptoms. Most antibiotics in this country are prescribed in primary care
default—
default80% is the estimated amount
default—
defaultand most of those are for respiratory tract infections
default,
default which are self
default&#x2011;
defaultlimiting. It has been shown that antibiotics make very little difference to th
defaulte outcome from those infections. P
defaulteople still go 
defaultto see their doctor 
defaultbecause they 
defaultare very uncomfortable and 
defaulthave distressing symptoms
default,
default which last two or three weeks
default, and a
defaultt the moment the 
defaultdoctor’s 
defaultdominant strategy is to issue 
defaulta prescription. Around 80% to 
default90% of the time
default,
default a prescription for antibiotics is still issued. 
defaultO
defaultbviously there are alternative things that we have looked at
default,
default li
defaultke using delayed prescriptions, 
defaultbut another potential strategy is to offer somethi
defaultng for symptom relief. T
defaulthere is an urgent need to look for alternative ways of providing symptom relief. People go to their do
defaultctor with symptoms and they anticipate
default 
defaultgetting 
defaultsomething to help them. At the moment there is not much in the cupboard and people go to antibiotics, although we really are pretty sure that t
defaulthey do not make any difference—
defaultor 
defaultvery little difference—
defaultto the duration of symptoms.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default 
defaultJust to make sure I understood it correctly, the most common use of them, you said, is for respiratory infections.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultYes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default 
defaultEverybody knows, apparently, that they do not work, so who is prescribing them?
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultThey are being prescribed by GPs in their surgeries.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default 
defaultAre they not aware of what everybody else knows?
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultIt is a complicated interaction and at the mo
defaultment there are few alternatives.
default 
defaultYou might 
defaultsay, 
default“
defaultWhy do
defaultn’t people just
default stop prescribing them?
default”
default, but that does not happen
default,
default so we have to find other ways of helping that hap
defaultpen. You can do it by saying, “T
defaulthere is a d
defaultifferent way. Wait a few days. W
defaulte a
defaultre using a delayed prescription.” W
defaulte can use near
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient
default tests
default,
default which per
defaulthaps focus on the people who 
defaultneed antibiotics
default,
default and we can find alternative symptom r
defaultelievers. 
defaultOne of the things people worry about 
defaultis complications;
default I think there wa
defaults something in the paper today about 
defaultsomebody who did not get antibiotics and then died as a result of pneumonia. 
defaultWhen people
default go to the doctor
default with a bad cough,
default feeling pretty terrible
default,
default 
defaultthey are worried
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthey 
defaultare 
defaultgoing to get pneumonia. The doctor really does not know if they are going to get pneumonia or not. It is the same if you have a very bad sore throat: are you going to get an abscess in your throat? 
defaultO
defaultne of the drivers of that continued prescribing is being risk averse, worryin
defaultg about potential complications, so, “
defaultI will give you these antibiotics because I do not want you to get one of those bad complications.
default” W
defaulte need to get much more sophisticated about sp
defaultotting the people who really 
defaultneed the antibiotics and the majority who simply do not need them. 
defaultA
defaultnother focus for research 
defaultis 
defaultto try and do that, but it is difficult. It is not as easy as you might think to spot those people.
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: It is appropriate versus 
defaultinappropriate antibiotic prescribing
default; 
defaultwe talk about this a lot. It is very easy in retrospect to describe inappropriate prescribing
default,
default because you have seen how the patient
default has gone over a few days. I
defaultn a way, managing antibiotics in hospital comes under that measure
default,
default because we monitor the patient daily for a few days. That is why 
default“Start Smart—Then F
defaultocus
default”
default works
default;
default at two days
default,
default you can make that intervention. Where the majority of antibiotics are prescribed
default,
default in general practice
default,
default you have a 10
default&#x2011;
defaultminute interaction
default,
default you will not see the patient again and they can potentially get much worse. It is about understanding
default,
default first of all
default,
default which patients are likely to get worse and, 
defaultsecondly
default, delivering strategies that are acceptable to patients. Patient acceptability is quite important in all of this as well
default. The aspect
default where we need research
default, 
defaultou
defaulttside of development of new drugs, is 
defaultpoint
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaultcare
default tests that are acceptable to patients that will help us diagnose a virus from a bacteria
default,
default because you cannot do that simply by looking at a patient. We know that 80
default% to 
default90% are viruses, but we do not know the 10
default% to 
default20% that are not
default,
default when the patient is in front of us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default 
defaultIs part of it to retain the confidence of the patient? They
default expect to get a prescription and 
defaultthey get a prescription
default,
default even though it is medically dubious.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultNot all of them are expecting a prescription. In fact, one of the things you can do is to explore the expectations of the patient
default,
default and we have shown that training in communication skills is one way of reduc
defaulting antibiotic prescribing. T
defaulthere are ways of dealing with that but you have to get people to pick up and implement these things at practice level. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe are going to come back to this theme in a moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultBriefly
default,
default just to go back to my suggestion that we should be looking at other options m
defaultore thoroughly, according to a
default briefing we have received, 
default“

default”
default already 
default“
defaultA number of research projects with implications for AMR, particularly around herbal treatment, are in progress at the National School for Primary Care Research.
default”
default These include one on a herb called 
defaultUva
default 
defaultursi
default 
defaultfor
default acute urinary tract infection and another relating to 
defaultprobiotics
default and vitamin D and infections. Do you not think
default this is the big clue 
defaultthat we should be spending more money on looking at remedies that have been with us for thousands of years
default,
default rather than spending so much money looking at new treatments? They are staring us in the face
default,
default so why do
defaultn’t we 
defaultdo more research on treatments that have been available for thousands of years?
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultI am the chief investigator of the 
defaultUva
default 
defaultursi
default study, so you are 
defaulttrying to convince
default the wrong person really. I lead that research. 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultSo you are very much
default involved
default, well recently obviously
default—
default 
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you very much. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBefore we move
default on, can I 
defaultask how involved is Health Education England in respect of the medical curric
defaultulum as far as AMR is concerned, a
defaultnd
default,
default at the opposite end of the spectrum
default,
default are doctors coming into the NHS from other countries sufficiently well versed in dealing with our approach to AMR?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultI will take the second 
defaultpart 
defaultfirst
default,
default as it is easier in my day
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultday job to understand what we do. When doctors come into the UK
default,
default they register with the General Medical Council showing that they have standard competencies to achieve that registration. Once they are within the system
default,
default every doctor starting within the NHS system in health
default 
defaultcare
default,
default 
defaultin 
defaulthospit
defaultals or in a training programme—
defaultthat includes GP training programmes or any train
defaulting programme within hospitals—has
default a minimum
default,
default mandatory day that they have to cover
default; i
defaultt includes infection prevention and control
default and
default antimicrobial stewardship as a basic minimum on the day they start. The curricula for all hospital doctors 
defaultall 
defaultinclude basic requirements on microbiology infection control and antimicrobials stewardship
default,
default and it is required that they have this knowledge and awareness as they are progressing t
defaulthrough the system. All the post
defaultgraduate 
defaultexams have some aspect of this
default. 
defaultCould it be strengthened? Of course. I am speaking as an infectious diseases physician; I obviously believe it should have gr
defaulteat priority on all the post
defaultgraduate curricula
default. W
defaulte push for that as the Royal College of Physicians
default,
default a
defaultnd have pushed to strengthen i
defaultt throughout all of the curricula at the Royal Colleg
defaulte of Physicians. It is there;
default it is present. I would never say it 
defaultwas
default enough
default,
default but that is coming from the area that I am in. 
defaultNow
default is an opportunity to make sure that we have raised awareness again with people who are not specialists in this area
default,
default to ensure that they understand why they should not prescribe, what are the unnecessary consequences and, in particular, to think about it as 
defaulta whole-
defaultpopulation approach
default 
defaultrather 
defaultthan 
defaultjust the individual sitting in front of them. As doctors, we very much think about the individual in 
defaultfront of us
default; 
defaultantimicrobial resistance really focuses us to think about the population and the impact 
defaulta
default prescription may ha
defaultve on somebody down the line. 
defaultWith respect to Health Education England, as a new organisation they have been very much focusing on postgraduate training across 
defaultthe health care work force,
default as their remit is the NHS work
default 
defaultforce. 
defaultT
defaulthey are there to help
default to develop 
defaultthe undergraduate curricula
default,
default and I look forward to their impact in this area.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultThe education of professionals is complex and 
defaultmultifactorial
default. On top of 
defaultthe 
defaulteducational packages for doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others involved, there are
default—
defaultand the new strategy has provided
default—
defaulta range of other educational material
defaults
default being developed already
default. I
defaultn Public Health England
default,
default we are preparing prescribing quality guidelines for primary and secondary care. NICE
default, 
defaultthe National Institute for Health and 
defaultCare
default Excellence
default, 
defaultalong with Public Health 
defaultEngland
default,
default are already preparing new good practice guidance, clinical guidance and public healt
defaulth guidance—three sets of guidance—on
default antimi
defaultcrobial resistance. T
defaulthe strategy has enabled us to ramp up the priority attention that has been given to antimicrobial resistance
default, and 
defaultprovides us w
defaultith an excellent opportunity. 
defaultIn terms of Health 
defaultEducation England and its role on 
defaultthe professional educat
defaultion strand of the new strategy, 
defaultthe overall co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination is falling to Public Health 
defaultEngland
default.
default I am the policy lead for Public Health 
defaultEngland
default,
default so 
defaultI chair the co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination group, and
default Health Education England 
defaultis
default on that group. Just 
defaultas
default the strategy is only relatively new
default—
defaulta few months
default—
defaultHealth Education England and indeed ourselves are relatively new
default,
default so we are settling down
default,
default but we
default,
default Public Health England
default,
default are absolutely dependent on working with partners like Health Education England to e
defaultnsure further improvements in
default prescribing education.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultCould I expand on the perspective from the acute NHS trust side of things? Echoing what Susan says, acute hospitals have a framework
default, so i
defaultt does not matter w
defaulthere doctors join them from;
default they should have an infrastructure and a framework that actually supports, encourages and drives good prescribing around the principles of good prescribing. The other thing is that prescribers and doctors are not doing this in iso
defaultlation. 
defaultThere is a mu
defaultltidisciplinary programme for
default how we look after antibiotics, monitor 
defaultthem and
default ensure that best practice is there. 
defaultI
defaultf the systems are there
default—
defaultthe trusts should have these systems in place
default—
defaultit really should not matter where doctors come from.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultDr Moore, you talked about the distance between initiatives and GPs. Is one way of narrowing that distance through the use of continued professional development
default—
defaultCPD
default—
defaultand how much control is there over what is studied as part of your continuous professional development
default?
default 
defaultC
defaultould antimicrobial resis
defaulttance form a greater part of i
defaultt?
defaultDr Mooredefault: That is the way forward. 
defaultGPs are mandated to continue professional education. They have an annual appraisal process at which their educational attainments are discussed with an appraiser, but at the moment they are independent contractors and they choose, or choose with their appraiser, what their development needs are. I do not think at the moment that antimicrobial resistance and rational prescribing are high on the agenda. There are lots of other new thi
defaultngs, huge pressures and 
defaulta massive curriculum for GPs to try and keep up with
default,
default and they are probably pretty comfortable with their day
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultday stuff. They have been in practice for 20 
defaultyears prescribing antibiotics; 
defaultpeople do not come back because they 
defaultget better.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey are not really thinking about looking in a critical way at their prescribing practice and 
defaultdoing educational activities. 
defaultO
defaultne of the difficulties
default is 
defaultthat there will be 
default100
default other things 
defaultGPs will be 
defaultasked to look at
default,
default and they will not be critically looking at their 
defaultantibiotic prescribing. 
defaultDame Sally Davies
default’s
default annual report highlighting antimicrobial resistance is really helpful and the strategy is helpful, but these are words on paper in Government offices and they do not 
defaultreally filter down 
defaultto the man or woman behind the desk with the prescribing pad.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default How do you change that—b
defaulty the assessor making it more of a priority? 
defaultDr Mooredefault: The mechanism for change would be 
defaultsomehow 
defaultto 
defaultraise the priority level so that it is discussed in the ap
defaultpraisal process and people 
defaulttake up educational initiatives.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultWho is responsible for raising that priority?
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultI do not know the mechanism, but you have someone 
defaulthere 
defaultwho knows the answer to that.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: O
defaultne of the points being made is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have, I believe, an ambitious and very important strategy, but we must not underestimate the enormity of the challenge of implementing 
defaultit,
default and making the changes required nationally and internationally for what is a very significant problem. 
defaultW
defaulthat Dr Moore has also highlighted is the gap between the strategy and its ambitions and the greater opportunity with implementation 
defaultat ground level. 
defaultI echo some of that as a former GP 
defaultmys
defaultelf. 
defaultT
defaulthe new system of revalidat
defaultion
default for doctors in this country that the General Medical Council introduced earlier this year
default—
defaultwhich 
defaultin 
defaultthe responsible officer part of my role I am responsib
defaultle for in Public Health England—
defaultprovide
defaults 
defaulta really good opportunity
default 
defaultto strengthen the appraisal process. A significant part of that
default—
defaultI am already seeing it through in the new style of appraisals that are required annually for every consultant, specialist and GP
default—
defaultis greater attention to continue
defaultd professional development. But,
default to my knowledge at the moment, there is not a way of specifying, 
defaultwhichever specialty you are in—
defaultpublic health ph
defaultysician or general practitioner—
defaultwhat should be in the CPD, what you should be doing. 
defaultT
defaulthat is an opportunity. The 
defaultRoyal C
defaultolleges and the Faculty of Public Health have a part
default to play in that, and I think i
defaultt is an interesting idea.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultBy mandating it, by making it obligatory.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultOf influencing, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default R
defaultevalidation, the appraisal system as it stands at the moment, will be different depending on who is carrying out that appraisal. It does not contain the same
default—
default 
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultYes and no. The appraisal process, whichever specialty of medic
defaultine you are in—
defaultwhether you are a microbiologist, a general practitioner or 
defaulta public health physician—
defaultcovers the same domains of medical practice and areas of importance
default. 
defaultWhen you go into the details of it with your appraiser, you will focus on the area
default relevant to your specialty. 
defaultA
defaultntimicrobial resistance is obviously important whether you are a paediatrician, a public health physician, 
defaultor 
defaulta GP and so forth.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: T
defaulthere are enormous opportunities to use the appraisal and revalidation process
defaultes
default. 
defaultW
defaulte are 
defaulttalking just about medics here, 
defaultbut 
defaultI think 
defaultwe can look at 
defaultthe roles of all health professionals
default 
defaultin 
defaultthis
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultne opportunity is also framing this in terms of patient safety and the quality of care. 
defaultI
defaultt does not need to be a technical
default,
default s
defaulteparate little bit of expertise. I
defaultt can be about the overall delivery of quality of care and patient safety
default,
default and you can frame that bit of the appraisal to fit in addressing antimicrobial resistance as an aspect of patient safety and quality of care
default. Y
defaultou can use that
default, and 
defaultI think t
defaulthere are enormous opportunities.
default 
defaultI
defaultn fact
default,
default that addresses one of the issues about stakeholder engagement, which is not just all about stakeholder engagement with the public
default, but 
defaultstakeholder engagement with other health
default 
defaultcare professionals
default. T
defaulthe appraisal and CPD mechanism may be a great opportunity.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultThank you for that. I take it, therefore, from your answers that there is at the moment no effective way of monitoring the use of ant
defaultimicrobials within GP practices.
default There is no national monitoring going on.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultTo some extent
default,
default there has been a policy to reduce the presc
defaultribing of some antibiotics that
default are associated with 
defaultC. 
defaultdiff infections
default—
defaultquinolones
default and 
defaultcephalosporins
default. 
defaultT
defaulthose things have been m
defaultonitored and fed back to practic
defaultes and there has been quite a dramatic change in 
defaultthe 
defaultprescribing 
defaultof those antibiotics 
defaultin primary care. 
defaultI
defaultt is possible to specifically focus on an antibiotic and to deliver that through the quality mechanisms for primary care
default,
default and to implement change
default. I
defaultt is not entirely true that there is no mechanism. It is simply that general antimicrobial stewardship has not been part of one of those approaches.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default It works on individual specified drugs at the moment, rather than taking a wider view of use generally.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultYes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultWith the examples you used 
defaultfor
default C. diff, were 
defaultthere 
defaultor are there any consequences if you discovered that someone was continually overprescribing that particular antimicrobial?
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultThe feedb
defaultack takes the form of a traffic-
defaultlight chart
default,
default and you are green, amber or red. I guess it is up to your professional standards
default,
default if you are persistently showing red on the traffic light
default,
default to change your behaviour or not, but there are n
defaultot any sanctions for people who
default do not change their behaviour.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultDo you think there should be?
defaultDr Mooredefault: T
defaulthe new mechanisms with CCGs are an opportunity
default,
default because they are slightly more grounded in practice
default,
default and I think that there will be greater pressures brought to bear as 
defaulta result of being in a CCG rather than a PCT
default.
default I am not a great fan of regulatory big
default&#x2011;
defaultstick
default approaches
default,
default but there may be a case for some kind of sanction for people 
defaultwho
default persistently do that. 
defaultP
defaulteople will always say
default,
default 
default“
defaultI did it in this instance
default,”
default and you do not know
default what the drivers are; 
defaultyou are not the clinician in the consultation
default, and
default I think it is a mistake to have absolutes.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: I
defaultt is a complex picture that you get in primary care
default—
defaultthe same goes for secondary care
default, to get a picture for us—
defaulton the amount of antimicrobial resistance
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte will want to look at antibiotic prescribing
default,
default but also antibiotic usage
default,
default which might not be the same as prescribing
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultlso the real end result, th
defaulte amount of resistance 
defaultin infections in primary care
default,
default which will be different from secondary care
default,
default is equally important. Again, we do not have at the moment all those surveillance systems set up optimally, but the strategy provides us with the opportunity to work towards those
default,
default and we are. My experience has been that, thankfully, in this country we are not at a standing start in terms of our general surveillance systems for health
default 
defaultcare
default&#x2011;
defaultassociated
default infectio
defaultns and antimicrobial resistance. W
defaulte have one of the best sets of systems in the world
default, and my experience, 
defaulttravelling to other countries, is 
defaultthat 
defaultoften we are the envy. But we are thinking about ways that we can share good practice. I was recently with the chief medical officer at the World Innovation Summit for Health conference. We were talking about ways that different countries could share their good practices, fo
defaultr instance around surveillance—
defaultboth high i
defaultncome and low income countries—
defaultwhich is I think something we have to do.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: I want to raise an
default issue about the critical role of pharmacists
default.
default 
defaultW
defaultith some of the changes
default,
default it is not quite so clear what their roles are now in primary care. Within secondary care
default,
default the role of our pharmacists is absolutely critical in working in a multidisciplinary way to address this issue
default,
default 
defaultlooking at prescribing, 
defaultmonitoring prescribing
default and 
defaultbeing involved in the f
defaulteedback within the organisation
default so 
defaultthat 
defaultprescribing can be performance
default-
defaultmonitored at the level 
defaultof directorate, division, unit and
default individual
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte completely rely on our pharmacists to work with us in this
default, and with the changes that
default will become clear in primary care. 
defaultThe other thing that is going to be important 
defaultfor us 
defaultis that we address this as a whole health
default 
defaultcare economy
default, so that
default we are not addressing it in acute care and primary care but really bring
defaulting
default it together
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is completely artific
defaultial and 
defaultnonsense to do it 
defaultcompletely 
defaultseparately.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultDr Moore, you mentioned the horror story of someone contracting pneumonia after not being prescribed antibiotics
default,
default and we know about the effect resistance is having on TB
default, 
defaulthere in 
defaultLondon
default, and gonorrhoea—
defaultthe two that we talk about. Are there other examples? Are these just horror stori
defaultes? I am thinking of my family. 
defaultI am sure everyone in this room was 
defaulteither 
defaultill or had a family member who was ill over the Christmas break
default,
default and many were running to the doctor. As a result of this inquiry, I spent a lot of time persuading my family members that they did not need to go to the doctor, and
default I even had a pharmacist
default trying to tell me to go to the doctor and get an antibiotic. 
defaultA
defaultre these horror stories
default,
default or could you give us a better understanding of what the dangers are of not prescribing antibiotics?
defaultDr Mooredefault: I
defaultf you compare areas with high and low antibiotic prescribing in England
default,
default 
defaultthe evidence shows 
defaultthat if you move to a lower prescribing area there are more episodes of infection 
defaultsuch as
default quinsy, which is a throat infection 
defaultthat
default is a complication of a sore throat. 
defaultT
defaulthey are very rare complications
default, but if you prescribe less 
defaultyou will se
defaulte more of those complications. 
defaultThe same applies to prescribing for chesty coughs or bronchitis. If you do less 
defaultprescribing, there will be a few more cases of pn
defaulteumonia seen as a result. T
defaulthose complications are rare and are usually treatable rather than untrea
defaulttable. I
defaultf you move to 
defaulta lower prescribing environment, 
defaulty
defaultou will see, as a result
default, a small increase in more serious infections
default. T
defaulthat will be a k
defaultind of consequence
default of that public health strategy. The positive side is that you are going to reduce antimicrobial resistance in the future
default, and t
defaulthe future we might be looking at in 20 years
default’
default time is that
default,
default if you develop pneumonia
default,
default you will have an untreatable infection
default,
default and that may be fatal
default. T
defaulthere is a kind of a pay
default&#x2011;
defaultoff
default,
default 
defaultbut it
default is a difficult place to be
default,
default to say, 
default“
defaultIf we do this globally now, there will be a few more cases of pneumonia and serious infections
default,
default but in the future we will have antibiotics which still work
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf we just prescribe indiscriminately now, we will prevent a few of those infections
default,
default but in the future we
default won’t
default be able to treat people.
default”
default 
defaultW
defaulte need to be honest about that in the public debate about antibiotic prescribing
default,
default and we need to be smarter about spotting
default the people who really need 
defaultantibiotics.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default S
defaulto
default so
defaultme of this could be mitigated with better
default or alternative treatments.
default 
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultThere are various approaches to doing that
default,
default and one of them, as I mentioned before, is the delayed prescription
default,
default where you say to somebody, 
default“
defaultYou do not need an antibiotic now, but
default,
default if you do not get better in four or five days
default’
default time, you do not have to come back and see me but you can take this prescription at that point.
default”
default That reduces prescribing in sore throats, say, from 90% down to about 40%. 
defaultY
defaultou get much less antibiotic uptake by using that. You ne
defaulted to use strategies where you have what we call a 
defaultsafety ne
defaultt,
default which is 
defaultthat 
defaultyou say to people, 
default“
defaultYou do not need an antibiotic now, but these are the things that you need to look out for and I would want you to re
default-
defaultconsult for.
default”
default In other words, if people are deteriorating or getting worse
default,
default they 
defaultshould 
defaultseek further medical advice. Another strategy is to use near
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient
default tests
default.
default 
defaultF
defaultor instance, in people 
defaultwho present 
defaultwith chest infections, there i
defaults a near
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient
default test available that
default moderately increases your ability to detect or determine who does and does not need antibiotics, although the
defaultre is a grey area in the middle; p
defaulteople with very high scores almost certainly do need antibiotics and people with very low scores almos
defaultt certainly do not, but there are
default still a number of pe
defaultople in the middle, o
defaultn whom you are uncertain. 
defaultW
defaulte can get smarter and 
defaultwe can 
defaultuse delayed prescribing, we can use effective safety net advice and we can use near
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient
default tests. 
defaultW
defaultith all of these things complications are rare but they are serious
default,
default and that is one of t
defaulthe things that worries
default the prescriber and the patient 
defaultwith
default bad symptoms 
defaultwho is 
defaultseeing the doctor.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: M
defaultoving fro
defaultm primary care into acute care—
defaultI am sure
default Susan will support me on this—
defaultthis is not something way in the future; it is something we are seeing now. 
defaultI
defaultt is really important that we start shifting the public debate away from MRSA 
defaultbacter
defaulta
defaultemias
default and 
defaultC.difficile
default to looking at how we address antimicrobial resistance in our hospitals
default, 
defaultparticularly the rise in 
defaultE.c
defaultoli
default infections and some of the
default other gram negative infections and the resistance rate
defaults
default. 
defaultW
defaulte need to 
defaultshift
default that so that we can actually start addressing this within our health
default 
defaultcare services and have a whole
default&#x2011;
defaultsystems
default approach 
defaulta
defaultrou
defaultnd it, but we really 
defaultneed to move from looking at those two to looking at antimicrobial resistance in a more comprehensive way.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultThat is absolutely right. Working in public health, we are constantly having to weigh up 
defaultthat balance 
defaultbetween what might be in the population
default’s
default health
default interests—
defaultnationally 
defaultbut also the global population—
defaultwhich is undoubtedly to reduce antimicrobial resistance, which will involve reducing antibiotic prescribing and certainly reducing 
defaultinappr
defaultopriate antibiotic prescribing, 
defaultagainst the individual person
default’
defaults interests. Arguably, on an individual person basis, actually not receiving an antibiotic which is of no use to you is probably a good thing anyway, but there will be cases where that does not happen, albeit thankfully rare. The near
default&#x2011;
defaultpoint
default diagnostics 
defaultthat could tell you in the doctor
default’
defaults surgery whether the infection the patient next to you 
defaulthas 
defaultis viral and will not benefit from an antibiotic
default,
default or 
defaultis 
defaultbacterial and will
default, will
default be i
defaultnvaluable, hence the importance—
defaultit is mentioned, I think, in the 
defaultstrategy and in our submission—
defaultof more research around that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I
defaultn a hospital environment is there not a tension between the clinical desire to deal with every patient as an individual and the big corporate view that
default,
default 
default“
defaultWe must n
defaultot have our statistics look bad”
default?
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultThat is spot on. That is why we need these processes, structures and leadership within trusts to understand the
default risks and that tension, but i
defaultt is also why
default—as we were discussing earlier—
defaultwe should not be talking just about antibiotic control. It is about access to effective antibiotics, so we need to make sure that our sick patients get antibiotics im
defaultmediately when they need them. 
defaultThere can be no blocks to that. But then we have the opportunity to review, step down, narrow the spectrum, stop, IV to oral, all those things, and they need to be part of the process. Earlier on
default,
default we were talking about the risk at the individual level in terms of antibiotic resistance and the risk at the societal level of antibiotic resistance.
defaultThe other issue for us within hospita
defaultls of course is 
defaultC.difficile
default—antibiotics driving 
defaultC.diff
default—and 
defaultthe risk
default&#x2011;
defaultbenefit
default. W
defaulte have a variety of ways of making sure that we minimise the amount of antibiotics we expose people to. B
defaultut you are absolutely right; that is a tension and i
defaultt is managed every day in complex patients. It is something that has to be thought through. 
defaultY
defaultou cannot walk away and think, 
default“
defaultActually, what I
default’ll
default do is just leave this person on 
defaultso many antibiotics that I 
defaultcover everything. It does
defaultn’t
default matter that we
default’ll
default drive resistance, give the patien
defaultt 
defaultC.diff
default and when they next have an infection we w
defaulton’t
default be able to treat it.
default”
default 
defaultY
defaultou have to weigh 
defaultup all of that 
defaultat the time you are treating the patient
default,
default with the possible collateral damage you will do to that patient then and in the future
default,
default as well as 
defaultto 
defaultthe society and people around the
defaultm.
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: T
defaulthere is an important role for pharmacists, nurses and infection specialist
defaults in hospitals. You help
default to arbitrate the individual clinician who is responsible for the patient into lo
defaultoking at the big picture and 
defaultbasically say, 
default“Y
defaultes, I understand that you have treated this patient aggressively
default, but now it’
defaults two days later, they are doing fine
default,
default and we could do this.
default”
default 
defaultIt is about being able to have 
defaultstructures in a hospital that help to bring down antimicrobial prescribing into the narrower spectrum that will treat the patient effectively
default,
default using the
default epidemiology that we know 
defaultis occurring in the hospital and the best for the patient. 
defaultI
defaultt
default is about having those external-
defaultinternal pe
defaultople, if you like, who do not, potentially,
default have the same doctor
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient
default relationship but are looking a
defaultt the best for that patient and 
defaultalso the best for the population.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultIn the evidence that we have received so far, and indeed you mentioned it this 
defaultmorning, there is variation 
defaultacross England in terms of doctors prescribing antibiotics. Could you give us an idea of how much
default—
defaultwhat is the ra
defaultnge of that variation—and,
default if any of you know
default, whether
default that variation exists across the United Kingdom as well, not just England?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultI will take a little bit of this, if that is okay. I have recently taken over the oversight group looking at the English surveillance programme for ant
defaultimicrobial use and resistance. 
defaultAs part of that, we have been gathering information at a CCG level from primary care and also from hospitals, but as a larger grouping of hospitals together, to understand what is happening in ecological levels across the country. 
defaultW
defaulte can see 
defaultthat
default there is about a fivefold variation in prescribing across practices. Some of that can be explained by the age structure of the populations
default,
default but some of it cannot. What we are looking at is trying to understand this information better: what particular antibiotics are being prescribed across the country? Is it related to deprivation? 
defaultT
defaulthere is some evidence that the more deprived populations have higher prescribing levels
default,
default and that may be related to their co
default&#x2011;
defaultmo
defaultrbidities
default and smoking and so on. 
defaultW
defaulte 
defaultalso 
defaultknow that we can help drive down prescribing if we are
default open and transparent about the
default 
defaultdata. We need to understand it at Public Health England 
defaultand
default at
default prescribing levels across the country
default,
default and then we need to feed that back
default,
default to explain to people, 
default“I
defaultf one practice can do this
default,
default can we look and see what that practice is doing to drive down prescriptions?
default”
default Very much part of our aim at Public Health England is to 
defaultbe open and transparent in
default looking at antimicrobial prescribing data across CCGs and across hospitals over the next year
default,
default and the AMR strategy is helping to drive that.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: T
defaulthe funding that has been made available to look at some of these interesting aspects
default in the strategy—
defaultparticularly 
defaultto 
defaultdevelop applied 
defaultresearch—
defaultwill drive some of the research and address some of these important questions. The creation of health protection research units in this area will also help
default to
default address some of these questions.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: It is a
defaultcross different countries
default. W
defaulte are obviously not the only country that sees this kind of variation in practice
default.
default Public Health England
default’
defaults c
defaultounterpart in America, the CDC—
defaultthe 
defaultCenters
default for Dis
defaultease Control and Prevention—
defaultproduced their report on antimicrobial resistance late last year, 
defaultin 
defaultautumn 2013, and one of the quite striking maps shows almost double the problem of antimicrobial resistance antibio
defaulttic prescribing 
defaultbetween states in south
default&#x2011;
defaulteast United States and the west coast and California. There are various reasons discus
defaultsed, but again you see 
defaulta variation in practice and in seriousness
default,
default which reminds us that the factors that influence prescribing and antimicrobial r
defaultesistance are complex. T
defaulthey are professional factors about doctors and their prescr
defaultibing and lots of other factors, 
defaultbut also public awareness. I think we touched on it in the previous qu
defaultestion. I believe there is 
defaulta responsibility on 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic around demands for antibiotics
default,
default and we experience this in the general practice room where you have a very short consultation and can be pressed on receiving an antibiotic. That is a real ground
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel
default issue, hence 
defaultagain the importance 
defaultin the strategy of greater improving 
defaultof 
defaultawareness and understanding among the public of antimicrobial resistance.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultProfessor, you just touched on my next point. We have discussed the variation in prescrip
defaulttion and the fact that in 
defaultareas with more prescription there is some increased infection, but the Society of Biology has given us evidence that resistance is still increasing across the country
default. I
defaults there variation in resistance
default,
default and do we have enough information yet to say that 
defaultin 
defaultareas where prescribing antibiotics has been curtailed resistance 
defaultis 
defaultreceding
default,
default or is it still continuing to rise at the same rate?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultThe first thing to say is that
default,
default predominantly in the 
defaultUK
default and in 
defaultEngland
default over the last 10 years, 
defaultwe have monitored bacter
defaulta
defaultemi
defaulta surveillance, which is the tip of the iceberg, and 
defaultb
defaultacter
defaulta
defaultemias
default do not occur in primary care. By and large, if somebody is sick with a blood culture infection or sepsis, the
defaulty are in hospital. 
defaultM
defaultore recently
default,
default over the last couple of years
default,
default 
defaultwe have 
defaultdeveloped a surveillance system to look at all microbiology samples from microbiology laboratories
default,
default and we have now almost achieved a 60% uptake of laboratories across the country reporting centrally to Public Health 
defaultEngland
default. That is from samples such as urine, which are a really good marker for what is happening in the community
default,
default and sputum samples as well. 
defaultT
defaulthat is the surveillance system that will help give us the early warning signals. In some areas, such as the west midlands
default,
default 100% of the laboratory data 
defaultare 
defaultbeing reported, so we know exactly what is ha
defaultppening in that. In other areas,
default there are resources being put in by Publi
defaultc Health 
defaultEngland
default to improve 
defaultsurveillance
default.
defaultU
defaultntil we have robust surveillance systems collecting laboratory data
default,
default we do not know where our gaps are. Our priority over the next year is to improve that
default,
default to make sure 
defaultthat 
default60% of lab
defaults
default are reporting
default and
default to get that to 70% to 80%
default, so that we know we have 
defaultgood coverage and that we have developed our early warning systems. But with that
default,
default we need hospitals and laboratories to work with us to make sure that they can give us the data
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte need hospital laboratory systems to be updated to modern IT so that they can transmit the message
default to us
default. 
defaultWe cannot have outdated systems; i
defaultf we have old IT systems
default,
default they will not communi
defaultcate with more modern ones. I
defaultt is everyone working together
default,
default so 
defaultthat 
defaultPublic Health England can develop a surveillance sy
defaultstem. H
defaultospitals need to help us engage with that so 
defaultthat 
defaultwe know what is happening at the ground level.
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultThank you. That is important.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultIn primary care there is not a history of sampling. 
defaultFor
default most people who come
default,
default we do not take microbiological samples. When you do take samples
default,
default it is when there are complicated cases, 
defaultwhere 
defaultpeople have 
defaulthad a course of antibiotics, 
defaultthe infection has not improved and they have come back with a urine in
defaultfection, say, for a third time, 
defaultand you send a sample off at that stage. 
defaultThe routine samples that
default come from primary care are not representative of the global picture. One of the 
defaultmissing 
defaultpieces of the jigsaw is a systematic sampling of all routine cases
default,
default and 
defaultI think that is something 
defaultwe could develop for the future so that you used a number of sites across the UK to routinely sample everybody who presented with particular conditions
default,
default which would give you a much better idea of the rates of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria isolated in the general population, whereas at the m
defaultoment your sample is from 
defaultcomplicated cases
default,
default so you will not get a true picture of the ant
defaultimicrobial resistance. T
defaultha
defaultt is a gap that could be filled.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: M
defaulteasuring the amount of antimicrobial resistance in primary and secondary care
default 
defaultis complex. There are definitely gaps
default,
default and Dr Moor
defaulte has highlighted one. F
defaultrom an already good start in terms of our surveillance in this country, I am confident, because we 
defaulthave already made a significant
default start in Public Hea
defaultlth England, that in 
defaulta r
defaultelatively short period of time—a few years—
defaultwe will have even stronger systems in place. They will not necessarily have answered all the questions, and this particular one may take longer, but 
defaultthere will be 
defaulteven stronger surveillance systems
default,
default so we can speak even more clearly about the amount of the problem in this country. I do not know about the Society of Biology
default’
defaults re
defaultport, but if you could share i
defaultt with us we could respond in a written manner to the Committee because I do not know what they are referring to.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultI think there is someone in the room who might be able to do that. Just before I move on to my last point, Professor 
defaultKessel
default, you mentioned the 
defaultUS
default. T
defaulthere was evidence that
default,
default 
defaultwhere 
defaultthere was a variation in areas where antibiotics, the prescription, had been curtailed
default,
default there was a reduction in resistance. Is that correct?
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultThere is almost a twofold difference between states in the amount of the problem of antimicrobial resistance and prescribing practice between states in the south
default-
defaulteast.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default But those 
defaulttwo
default figures 
defaultcorrela
defaultte. The data where resistance exists correlate
default with prescribing.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultThat is right. I have that here 
defaulti
defaultn my pile of supporting material
default, and I am happy to share i
defaultt or send the report through afterwards. It came out as the CDC
default’
defaults publication came out in the autumn 
defaultof 
defaultlast year.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default My final point 
defaultcover
defaults
default the fact that there is variation across the world, as we have touched on, in antibiotics
default; 
defaultindeed
default,
default in many countries we can buy them over the counter.
default How will that affect us
default in the United Kingdom
default, and how significantly will i
defaultt undermine our efforts here in the UK?
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultThe scope of the problem internationally is absolutely huge. 
defaultIt is not only our own strategy; o
defaultne of the things
default 
defaultthe work of the chief medical officer over the last three or f
defaultour years has done, 
defaultwh
defaultich has been hugely influential,
default has been to dramatically raise the profile of antimicrobial resistance as an issue internationally. Last year at the World Health Assembly
default,
default which I attended
default,
default there was a session on AMR that there had not been before. There is planned to be a new resolution at the World Health Assembly next May. There is a whole range of other international activities going on. We are doing a lot of work with Public Health England
default and 
defaultthe CMO and her team with the Commonwealth about twinning countries
default—
defaulthigher income, lower income countries
default—
defaultaround laboratory and antimicrobial resistance issu
defaultes. There is a huge amount of attention that
default did not exist to the degree it 
defaultdoes
default 
defaultnow 
defaultjust three or four years 
defaultago, 
defaulteven when I started at the Health Protection Agency. That attention internationally was not there.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultOn the BBC programme on regional television the night before last that I referred
default to in my introductory remarks,
default a clinician was arguing in favour of screening for the resistant form of TB from certain populations. Do you think that is a serious proposition
default—
defaultpeople moving into the country from particular countries
default?
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultI might ask a colleague on that. I realise I did not quite answ
defaulter your question about over-the-
defaultc
defaultounter medicines; we know that i
defaultt is a significant
default issue in a number of countries—s
defaultome of the high popul
defaultation, lower resource countries.
default 
defaultI
defaultn 
defaultIndia
default,
default they have been doi
defaultng a lot of work to change over-the-
defaultcounter provision of medicines
default, but of course i
defaultt is a problem. If you can just go and get an antibiotic over the counter, it may well be an antibiotic that is not necessary. One of the huge challenges there is 
defaultthat 
defaultin those kinds of 
defaultsettings that might be your only way to get a valuable treatment. So the work that needs to be done has to be done in conjunction with improving primary care infrastructure and so forth, but there is a huge amount of work going on 
defaultinternationally to raise that in
default the agenda, which is incredibly valuable. 
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultCould I just say one other thing about over the counter
default, and then talk about screening, b
defaultut bring it to the scr
defaulteening of antibiotic resistance
default particularly in bact
defaulterial infections rather than TB?
default 
defaultF
defaultirst
default,
default in the 
defaultUK
default,
default we have v
defaultery tight regulation about over- the-
defaultcounter prescribing
default,
default but your question was 
defaulton the impact of over-the-
defaultcounter prescribing around the wor
defaultld when it is a global problem. W
defaulte are
default talking locally and nationally
default but it is a global problem. There has been a huge amount of work done on this, particularly in 
defaultIndia
default with the Chennai D
defaulteclaration. Their first proposal for antibiotic control was 
defaultunpragmatic
default and not deliverable
default,
default because of the is
defaultsue about tight control of over-the-
defaultcounter antibiotics. When we actually talk about access to antibiotics, that might be the only place people can access antibiotics
default, s
defaulto the more pragmatic approach was a step
default&#x2011;
defaultwise
default progression of the antibiotics that had to be regulated and the ones that were still over the counter
default,
default and that has now been introduced. I think it was introduced in August. 
defaultT
defaulthe work in Ind
defaultia has been quite extraordinary.
defaultI
defaultn terms of the question about screening
default, 
defaultwe are particularly concerned about severe antibiotic resistance being brought in
default;
default indeed there is a document that has been released
default recently 
defaultadvising hospitals what best to do about screening. We are ve
defaultry conscious of the issue 
defaultwhen patients come in from intensive care units from other places, from hospitals from other places, or even 
defaultwhen they are just 
defaultinvolved in health
default 
defaultcare in other places
default, and the need to screen 
defaultis being recommended, but Susan may want to say a bit more about the policy.
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultYes. Public Health 
defaultEngland
default has generated screen
defaulting guidelines for 
defaultcarbapenem
default resistance
default,
default which is really important for people coming from overseas
default, 
defaultseeking health
default 
defaultcare 
defaulthere, 
defaultor after having health
default 
defaultcare abroad 
defaultin
default one form or another
default.
default 
defaultThose 
defaultare the patients 
defaultwho 
defaultcan transmit
default and cause an epidemic of multi
defaultdrug resistant bacteria within a hospital setting
default,
default and that is where we have been focusing 
defaulta 
defaultlot of our attention
default,
default because obviously that would be a new transmission event and a very dangerous form of in
defaultfection—gram negative infections—
defaultwithin hospitals
default,
default rapidly developing resistance to, essentially, all first, second and third
default&#x2011;
defaultline
default available 
defaultantibiotics, leaving us with old and
default poor available drugs. 
defaultYou also mentioned TB. 
defaultI think tuberculosis has had a long history in 
defaultthe UK of slow, simmering rates,
default and higher rates in London where there are higher populations from overseas, so we have about 3,500 cases 
defaulta year 
defaultin London
default,
default and about 
default1.5% to 1.7% of those are multi
defaultdrug resistant, so resistant to two of our major first
default&#x2011;
defaultline
default drugs. That has not changed that much over
default the last 10 years actually; 
defaultwe have had a slow, steady rate
default,
default between 1% and 2%
default,
default of drug resistance. It is important that we ensure that patients with symptoms are screened as necessary
default.
default 
defaultPort health screening 
defaultis organised for individuals who have symptoms of TB coming 
defaultin
defaultto the 
defaultUK, and there is a questionnaire for those from 
defaultcountries that are
default high risk.
default It is important that we have good microbiology services
default,
default so that if people present
default we diagnose multi
defaultdrug resistant TB fast and accurately
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is available through Public Health England
default’
defaults tuberculos
defaultis national reference lab
default to any laboratory in the country
default,
default so any laboratory can request that test for a fast turnaround on any patient 
defaultwith 
defaultsuspected
default 
defaulttuberculosis.
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe are running a tad behind time, so can colleagues speed things up a bit?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Morris:default 
defaultI think a lot of what you have already said has probably answered 
defaultthis, but, in relation to 
defaultantimicrobial resistance, are existing diagnostics tests used effectively across the NHS? If not, why not? Do you think t
defaulthat the diagnostic tests used for
default looking into diseases are actually pertinent to what we are doing to dish out antibiotics
default, or do you 
defaultthink we are 
defaultnot 
defaultdoing a good enough job of the diagnostics in the first place?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultThere are two elements of diagnostics. Once a sample gets to th
defaulte microbiology department, 
defaultwe can say that the microbiology departments are accredited to p
defaulterform the microbiology tests. 
defaultThey have minimum standards 
defaultso 
defaultthat they can do it
default. If they are unsure about the 
defaultresu
defaultlt
default, they can send it to a national reference laboratory. The question is if there is no sample
default sent; as we have heard
default already, 80% of prescribing happens in primary care where the majority of patients have no samples performed at all
default,
default and actually even if they did have a sample sent it would have little impact on that patient
default’
defaults antibiotic prescription because the result would take three to five days to get back to the general practitioner. 
defaultThere needs to be new development of easier
default point
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaultcare
default testing—testing 
defaultthat will give rapid results. Some of that is happening to diagnose viral infections. For example, we know that there are now tests that we can use
default where we 
defaulttake a nose swab and see if someone has a virus
default, and if they have a virus 
defaultyou can say that they do not ne
defaulted an antibiotic. 
defaultWe need to develop it such that the GP can do that quite easily
default,
default at a cheap cost that is not goin
defaultg to massively influence health care costs across this country,
default and deliver that at a p
defaultrimary care level. A lot of development work is required on that. F
defaultrom a hospital level, once the sample gets into the laboratory, and it is an approved, accredited
default laboratory in a hospital, 
defaultwe can be pretty sure that that laboratory is performing the right tests.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Morris:default 
defaultIs there a central database that these tests can be fed into
default,
default to give you a mapping of where and when antibiotics should be used, or certain treatments?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: A
defaultntibiotics are used according to the clini
defaultcal syndrome about the patient—
defaultwhen the patient presents
default,
default what signs and symptoms they have. The microbiology helps focus our treatments down to narrow treatments
default,
default or widen them as necessary, so it helps us in 
default“Start Smart—Then Fo
defaultcus
default,”
default but it does not change what
default happens to the patient and the
default patient
default&#x2011;
defaultdoctor
default interaction on the front line.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultThe issue about the point of care is not just one for primary care. With the centralisation of microbiology laboratories
default,
default it is becoming more and more important sometimes that we get the diagnosis at the point of care, particularly in intensive care. 
defaultP
defaultoint of care is very important in acute care as well as primary care
default,
default so that we can get the results fast, rapidly, where we are looki
defaultng after the patient. I
defaultnvesting in research in this technology is absolutely critical. 
defaultIt shapes how we treat patients and
default improves outcome
defaults,
default and there is a lot more we could do there. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultMost of the focus 
defaultso far has been on the clinical and
default on the professional side
default, but Professor Holmes, you 
defaultmention
defaulted
default there was a need for public debate. Do you, as a panel, think that 
defaultUK
default patients understand the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance and how their own actions contribute towards it?
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultI think some of them do. 
defaultW
defaulte have touched on some of the issues
default,
default and perhaps we need to consider the issue about heal
defaultth literacy and be a little 
defaultmore analytical about that in its broader sense, not just about the antimicrobial resistance issue. I mentioned before that there is a lot of work 
defaulta
defaultround public engagement. We may need to look more critically at how we measure whether it is effective enough, but I also think we need to look at not just public engagement but engagement across everybody who is involved in delivering health
default 
defaultcare. 
defaultWe still need to work on 
defaultengagement within health
default 
defaultcare
default,
default as well as looking at
default public engagement. 
defaultI think we are looking more and more in
defaultto
default aspects of qualitative research and social science
default and so on,
default to get the messages right and
default to calibrate them a little 
defaultmore effectively
default. T
defaulthat is taking place now.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultWhenever anyone says
default,
default 
default“
defaultWe need to look at doing this,
default” 
defaultI ask more spe
defaultcifically what needs to be done.
defaultProfessor Holmesdefault: 
defaultI will start with what I was saying about people within h
defaultealth care. We need to make sure as technical experts
default that we are not just talking to each other. We need to engage with our clinical 
defaultand
default professional colleag
defaultues. I
defaultt is really important
default that we recognise the effect of
default the power of hierarchies within specialities, 
defaultand 
defaultwork with leaders
default across a range of specialities and
default work with our professional bodies. We must include nurses here. There needs to be much more talk about the role of nurses in the delivery of antibiotic safety. There needs to be much more talk about the critical role of pharmacists
default; 
defaultquite a bit of wo
defaultrk has been done already with 
defaultthe development of a 
defaultmasters
default pro
defaultgramme for pharmacists
default. I think Anthony might be able to say a bit more about the work that is being done critically and academically looking at behavioural change strategies and
default getting the message right. T
defaulthere is investment in research to do this
default,
default but there is also a programme of work that Public Health England is involved in.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultIt is the public awareness side of things that I am particularly interested in.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: 
defaultI think the answer is yes
default; in my view,
default there is a need for fur
defaultther 
defaultpublic engagement or public awareness. Again it is not straightforward
default: how do you raise public awareness?
default One could say we will run an awareness
default&#x2011;
defaultraising
default campaign
default,
default but it is very important, in so doing, that you run something that is effe
defaultctive. They cost a lot of money and
default they take time. One does not want to do something that is not effective in terms of raising the public
default’
defaults knowledge, understanding
default,
default or even, most importantly, their behaviours in terms of going to a GP and asking for antibiotics. 
defaultWe in Public Health 
defaultEngland
default have from 
default1 
defaultApril this year taken from the Department of Health the team responsible for running those kinds of campaigns
default,
default and I and my team have been asked to look at whether we can run a broader public health campaign around antimicrobial re
defaultsistance in this country. W
defaulte have started to look at how we can do that in a targeted way that is effective and cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective
default. T
defaulthe research
default 
defaultdraws on some of the work that the World Health 
defaultOrganisation has done, called 
defaultTAB, which is about targeting app
defaultropriate antimicrobial resistance
default strategies around, first of all, doing some qualitative work to find out where such a ca
defaultmpaign might be most effective—
defaultwhich 
defaultgroups, so it could be age groups;
default which sectors
default, whether it is schools or 
defaultresidential
default sectors, and those kind of things—
defaultand then 
defaultrunning a tailored campaign accordingly. 
defaultYou ask what should be looked at, and t
defaulthat is something we are looking at
default,
default b
defaultut we have just started doing i
defaultt
default. T
defaulthat is very much part of the s
defaulttrategy in terms of raising the
default level of discussion and debate. 
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: This is a
defaultn important release, I think, to start us ha
defaultving those conversations
default. 
defaultEurobarometer
default, which is a European
default&#x2011;
defaultwide
default survey, has just released the results of the 2013 survey
default,
default which focused on antimicrobial resistance because obviously this is a big attent
defaultion area throughout Europe. That survey 
defaultshowed that one in three people in the UK, and roughly the same across Europe, had an awareness of some antibiotic cam
defaultpaign in the previous year. T
defaulthere are campaigns out there that people are becoming aware of. Interestingly, one in two people in the 
defaultUK
default knew that antibiotic
defaults were not right for colds, flu
default and viruses
default,
default but that means 50% do not, so we still have a lot of work 
defaultto do 
defaultout there to convince people that viruses do not need antibiotics. 
defaultW
defaulthat I thought was really important in those results was to know t
defaulthat actually the main place where
default people seek advice and where they will get advice that they believe in is from health professionals. 
defaultT
defaulthat comes back to the engagement of health professionals
default,
default and look
defaulting
default at health professional strategies rather than just looking at all
default&#x2011;
defaultencompassing
default campaigns. 
defaultW
defaulthen people are ill and seek health advice
default, that
default is the moment whe
defaultn 
defaultthey will listen to the important piece of advice that can change their behaviour, not only for this episode but potentially for the next episode and the one thereafter. 
defaultI
defaultt is about resources
default,
default education campaigns and interventions that can be rolled out across GP practices that can change those behaviours in the future, not just for now.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultWe 
defaulthave 
defaultfocused on the prescribing of medicines. It is also important that once a member of the 
defaultpublic has these medicines 
defaultthe
defaulty complete the course and use them
default properly. How can medical p
defaultrofessionals make sure that 
defaultpatients actually complete the course they are given
default? People go to the doctor
default, get given the antibiotics and then that is the end of the story as far as that connection with the GP is concerned. How can you make sure t
defaulthat the link continues and 
defaultthey complete the course?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultThere are two things that are quite important. The first thing is that a lot of the research about the length of course happened a long time ago
default; 
defaultoften 
defaultit 
defaultw
defaultas
default predefined 30, 40 or 50 years ago. Actually we need research about what i
defaults the shortest length of course.
default Can we let the courses be shorter so that people do not take antibiotics on day 7 when they are better
default,
default because they do not need them? 
defaultWe also know that
default,
default if people do not have an infection in the first place
default,
default they do not need antibi
defaultotics. If they were in hospital,
default they would have stopped antibiotics on day 2 when we decided they did not have an infection, so perhaps we need to reinvent this a bit and get better at understanding when patients do not need them
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is about stopping the prescriptions in the first place
default,
default but it is als
defaulto about trying to see if 
defaultwe 
defaultcan 
defaultcome up with a way that we can shorten the durations of courses so that they do not take them
default for such a long time. I
defaultf they are feeling
default better after two days, and it wa
defaults thought 
defaultto
default be a virus at the beginning 
defaultbut
default it was a delayed prescription, perhaps they should stop it at that point. I would like to turn that on its head a bit
default; 
defaultwe need to look at that in the future in a different way
default,
default because the more antibiotics people tak
defaulte, the more the microbiology 
defaultinside their body will change.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: I
defaultf a patient ultimately decides when they have a five
default&#x2011;
defaultday treatment that they are feeling better after three or four days and they want to throw the rest in the bin or not continue, it is quite 
defaulthard
default to influence that
default. The way we do i
defaultt is by awareness raising, public debate
default,
default discussion with the public
default,
default but also with professionals about how they convey the importance of those messages. I
default was just 
defaultreminded by a note about a very good educational material called e
default&#x2011;
defaultBug
default, electronic bug, which is an online tool that we developed in the Health Protection Agency
default—
defaultnow Public Health England
default—
defaultwhich has
default won awards and is used multiply
default in schools across this country
default. I
defaultndeed
default, it
default has been used in a number of countries overseas, having been tran
defaultslated into different languages.
default 
defaultI
defaultt covers areas pertaining to that understanding
default—
defaultwhich bugs respond to antibiotics, why antibiotics should be used and for what duration and so forth.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default 
defaultI think all of you have made reference during the course of the morning to the 
defaultdifferences and 
defaultdiscrepancies
default, or 
defaultthe different ways matters are treated in
default 
defaultsecondary as opposed to primary care. I want to look briefl
defaulty at the antimicrobial resistance
default 
defaultstrategy, the five
default&#x2011;
defaultyear plan for 2013-
default18. It has been criticised from a number of quarters for being far too concerned with the cl
defaultinical environment, principally
default the secondary acute sector, at the expense 
defaultof 
defaultprimary care
default,
default and
default not mentioning 
defaultt
defaulthe environment in nursing homes
default at all. I wo
defaultnder 
defaultif any of yo
defaultu would care to respond to that.
defaultDr Mooredefault: 
defaultI can talk to that. I have recently done some work looking at antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes
default; it
default is not yet published
default,
default but it shows that if you take into
default account the other co
default&#x2011;
defaultmorbidities
default—
defaultthe othe
defaultr illnesses that people have—
defaultthe rate of antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes is around double what you would expect for that population. 
defaultT
defaulthere is a problem with antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes and it is, I think, often misdirected
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis 
defaultis 
defaulta high
default-
defaultrisk population
default;
default these are very frail, elderly people usually
default,
default who are at high risk of bacterial infections and serious infections
default. M
defaultanaging that risk in primary care is difficult because you are worried that people may h
defaultave more serious infections, b
defaultut there is still overtreatment
default.
defaultM
defaulty particular focus has been on urinary infections
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is very common for people in nursing homes to carry bacteria in their urine. Probably about a third of people, if you do a random sample, would have bacteria in their urine
default;
default there is a kind of a paradigm
default,
default where somebody becomes more unwell and then somebody 
defaultelse 
defaultwill dip their urine and show that there is protein and blood in it
default,
default which suggests an infection
default,
default and then they will get an antibiotic, but actually the link between the bacteria in the urine and the illness is very tenuous
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is one of the driver
defaults of antibiotic prescribing, so i
defaultt is an area that I have been looking at and will be focusing on to try and intervene and get better targeting. Again, it is about identifying the people that really need the antibiotics
default,
default but we are talking about a high
default&#x2011;
defaultrisk environment with the frail elderly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default Y
defaultour 
defaultview would be that the resistance
default strategy is seriously deficient in this area.
defaultDr Mooredefault: I
defaultt is an area which warrants more attention
default,
default and I thi
defaultnk it has not been an area that
default has been looked at. There are high levels of prescribing, probably greater than you would expect even for the frail elderly population who are in there
default,
default and I think more work needs to be done, yes.
defaultProfessor defaultKesseldefault: A
defaults I mentioned earlier, I think this is an amb
defaultitious and important strategy; i
defaultt 
defaultis an overarching strategy. W
defaulte talked earlier about the enormity of the challenge and the fact that implementation at ground
default level has other elements, 
defaultwhich cannot be, and would not be, covered in an overarching strategy. The issue around community settings is vitally important for all the reasons that have been mentioned. I cannot recall whether that i
defaults specifically mentioned,
default but I can be absolutely sure that it does not stop Public Health England, as part of our work on surveillance and our r
defaultoles and responsibilities there—
defaultroles on sur
defaultveillance, education and practice—
defaultfrom attending to co
defaultmmunity settings, nursing homes and
default residential homes. In fact only last year
default—
defaultDr Hopkins might correct me if I get the date wrong, but I think it was last year or the year before
default—
defaultwe produced an important pack 
defaulton 
defaultcommunity nursing home
defaults
default, residential care settings and advice for practitioners on health
default 
defaultcare
default&#x2011;
defaultassociated
default infections an
defaultd antimicrobial resistance. I
defaultt is an area that is already being addressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default 
defaultBut the huge increase in recent years in 
defaultresistance, and attention
default 
defaultgiven to 
defaultresistance
default,
default has been in the community rather than in clinical environments. The position in hospitals, 
defaultin 
defaultthe acute sector, has not really changed that much over
default time. 
defaultInfection levels are effectively under control and now reducing, but the huge explosion in this has taken place in the community sector. Should that not be where the attention is being placed?
defaultDr Hopkinsdefault: 
defaultWe can say that we have seen a rise
default in 
defaultE.coli
default 
defaultbacter
defaulta
defaultemia across the country. We know that you are more likely to have resistance if you have had a health
default 
defaultcare setting intervention in
default the previous three months. T
defaulthe infection may start in the community
default,
default but it is more likely to have been related to your previous health
default 
defaultcare event. 
defaultN
defaultursing homes are really important. There are more than 30,000 nursing and residential homes across England
default,
default and they have a very vulnerable population. I do not think they are excluded from the strategy
default,
default because the strategy encompasses the whole health
default 
defaultcare economy and primary and secondary care
default,
default and nursing home residents are involved
default. T
defaulthe delivery of their care 
defaultis 
defaultvia primary care
default, so 
defaultthei
defaultr prescriptions that we gather—
defaultthe resistance that we g
defaultather—are
default being gathered by the same mechanisms a
defaults everything else. A
defaults something that could be strengthened
default,
default explicitly stating what is requir
defaulted in long

defaultterm care facilities would be beneficial. L
defaultong
default&#x2011;
defaultterm facilities are also covered by the Health and Social Care Act. They are also regulated by 
defaultthe 
defaultCQC. 
defaultT
defaulthey fall under everything else that we have talked about in primary and secondary care as well, so they are not excluded by any means by what it says in the strategy, though it does not, I agree, explicitly state
default, “This applies to long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm care,” but 
defaultprimary and secondary care physicians and nurses
default 
defaultare the same people who deliver care in long

default,
default which David 
defaultTredinnick
default just mentioned. I am a GP and a consultant physician. I have 30 years of experience in researching herbal medicines and hold a variety of roles. One of the things I have been involved with
default very recently is getting the 
defaultNational Sc
defaulthool for Primary Care Research—part of the NIHR—
defaultto develop a really powerful working group looking at alternatives to antibiotic prescribing both in care homes and in primary care
default,
default using a variety of nutritional and herbal approaches, particularly in relation to urinary and lower respiratory tract infections. I do not re

defaultwe research into

default&#xa0;
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIn different ways
default,
default you all propose alternatives to antibiotics. Could you each 
defaultoutline what your approach is? 
defaultLet us go down the line again.
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: 
defaultThe diagnostics industry sees the tools that our products produce as a way of appropriately differentiating patients
default’
default treatment. 
defaultI
defaultn primary care the
defaultre are simple tests, as we 
defaultheard in the last session, which are in common use in the Nordic countries, Germany and Switzerland and also in the USA, to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections
default,
default and allow a debate or a discussion between the primary care physician and the patient as to whether an antibiotic is appropriate
default for that condition or not. I
defaultn secondary care
default,
default it is a way of targeting antibiotic therapy to make sure that the correct antibiotic is used for the correct infection. Increasingly, there are products available 
defaultthat
default will look at more than one parameter in one sample type
default,
default and 
defaultthey 
defaultare reducing the length of time to get the results. 
defaultIn
default the trad
defaultitional microbiology lab, 
defaultit would take five to 14 day
defaults to culture up micro
default&#x2011;
defaultorganisms;
default you can now 
defaultdo it within five hours using 
defaultmolecular technology.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultMy background is as a clinician, a GP, so I can add to some of the comments made by Dr Moore and I can certainly expand any that may be relevant to this part of the meeting. As a primary care physician, you a
defaultre in a very difficult position;
default you are in a one
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultone situation with a patient who may 
defaultwant or demand
default an antibiotic. Education works 
defaultto a point
default, and we 
defaultdiscussed the strategies in the previous part of the meeting, but GPs very much feel they need alternatives. The evidence we have from the research is that they would look at things like herbal and nutritional medicines if they were t
defaulthoughtfully evidence based. W
defaultithin the EU, particularly in Germany, 20
default% of the 
defaultOTC prescriptions are for herbal medicines. There is a real good track record of herbal medicines 
defaultbeing
default better produced and us getting better quality herbal medicines in the 
defaultUK
default,
default and better herbal practitioners, particularly since the 2001 House of Lords report. 
defaultMy main approach would be to try and see how we can use these kinds of approaches
default,
default looking at good science but perhaps understanding that we are not after a magic single chemical. Herbals work differently. They work synergistically and often through several different 
defaulti
defaultmmuno
default&#x2011;
defaultmodifying
default mechanisms. O
defaultne herbal, which may have 40 or 50 different biologically active chemicals, may be working through several different systems
default,
default and nutritionals may be as well. They modify many different systems in the body, so it is a different kind of approach
default,
default which requires a slightly different understanding of science. I think we can use those approaches to manage symptoms and mitigate antibiotic prescribing in primary care very effectively when we know that there is good preliminary evidence and we do not need to make many of the antibiotic prescriptions that we are making. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you. We are go
defaulting to pursue that a little 
defaultfurther later on.
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultAntibiotics are used for treatment generally
default,
default and vaccines are used for prevention. We have had a golden age of antibiotic development
default,
default and I believe that golden age is coming to an end. I believe we are at the beginning of a golden age of vaccination and discovery of vaccines. Vaccination has the potential to prevent patients 
defaultfrom 
defaultbeing admitted to hospital, thereby preventing their exposure to organisms in the hospital. Vaccination also has the potential to preven
defaultt disease in the community; 
defaultin fact
default,
default vaccination can prevent large epidemics. Vaccination can prevent the long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm consequences and 
defaultsequelae
default of infections. I believe that vaccination is now the best approach for looking at organisms, both resistant and multi
default&#x2011;
defaultresistant
default and susceptible in that fashion, by targeting multiple targets on these organisms. Antibiotics just target one aspect of the organism. Vaccines have the potential to target multiple targets on the organism. I also believe that with effective vaccines against community and healthcare
default&#x2011;
defaultassociated
default pathogens, 
defaultand 
defaulteffective implementation, we have the potential to reduce antibiotic resistance by up to 50%.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultWe are trying to develop 
defaultbacteriophage
default therapeutics. 
defaultPhages
default are viruses that kill bacteria
default,
default and you will be drinking them as you drink your water. They have been around for longer than bacteria. They are used regularly in the eastern bloc
default,
default but they are not used here yet because we have not done clinical trials that are to western standards. Our belief is that they will form a complementary approach to the use of antibiotics
default. T
defaulthey are very narrow spectrum. Typically, any one phage will only kill a number of strains withi
defaultn a bacterial species, s
defaulto you need to know what bug you are dealing with before they are effective.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat response, from your point of view, answers one o
defaultf my next questions: a
defaultre other countries ahead in your particular fields and are the procedures for adopting alternatives in the NHS easy ones to deal with?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultWith vaccination
default,
default the United Kingdom has set an extraordinary example over many years of introducing new, innovative vaccines. We 
defaulthave now 
defaultnot completely 
defaultconquered, 
defaultbut are getting towards conquering
default,
default the great killers of the 20th century
default,
default and before that. We now face somewhat rarer infections in the community
default,
default such as meningococcal infecti
defaulton, and in the hospital, such as S
defaulttaph and 
defaultE.coli
default. With 
defaultits
default 
defaultextraordinary 
defaulttrack record of vaccinati
defaulton, 
defaultthe United Kingdom is in fact right at the sharp end of being able to develop new vaccines. Of course, other countries are using variou
defaults vaccines, and t
defaulthe United Kingdom is using those and other vaccines, so it does depend somewhat, but my point is that the United Kingdom is really very advanced with the implementation of most vaccines.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: My response
default is that you need all of us in a co
default-
defaultordinated way. You need 
defaultphages
default when you have rea
defaultlly bad infections in hospital. You need 
defaultvaccinations for prevention
default. You need 
defaultsimple primary care approaches that stop over
default-
defaultprescription and you need near
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient
default testing
default,
default so you need the technology. You need to implement the near
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient
default testing by making private contractors in general practice do it so that it is feasible
default,
default so 
defaultthat 
defaultthey do not lose money. At the moment
default,
default they would be paying for the tests themselves out of their own wages. You need better research for symptom
default&#x2011;
defaultrelieving
default remedies
default,
default and we need a better structure to manage that research within the NIHR. We need the vaccinations prevent
defaultat
defaultively
default,
default and we need better strategies when we have serious overwhelming infections in secondary and tertiary care environments. 
defaultY
defaultou cannot have one of us without the other. I am sorry I am in the middle. I am the GP, you see, 
defaultand 
defaultI am always in the middle.
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: I 
defaultagree that we are not talking about one of our approaches against all of them. There is room for everything to fit into the health
default 
defaultcare pictu
defaultre. One of the problems, 
defaultwhich George just alluded to
default,
default was the cost of doing testing in primary care. It is an added cost, but there are ways around it. Outside of antimicrobial infection, GPs have started doing simple tests
default,
default which stop referring to secondary care
default,
default and the money is recouped in other ways. Companies are quite innovative at doing risk
default&#x2011;
defaultsharing
default projects on costing
default,
default so I do not think that is beyond the wit of us to do. Much 
defaultmore important, I think, is 
defaultawareness among GPs of what tests
default are available commonly and
default are being used in northern Europe and in the US.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultI wanted to discuss vaccinati
defaultons in particular, so I guess this
default is 
defaultmainly aimed at Dr McIntosh
default, but if anyone has any comments, please add in. In your initial answer
default, you 
defaultcover
defaulted the broad areas and
default I want to be a bit more specific. We 
defaulthave had recent news 
defaultin the London press abo
defaultut TB and the incidence, or 
defaultrates
default,
default of TB in London in particular. The current TB vaccinations that we all ha
defaultd
default as teenagers are 70 years old now. I think you said that we are entering a golden age of vaccination. How can that be so when the vaccines are so old?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultOf course, we have had an unfortunate failure of the developmen
defaultt of a new tuberculosis vaccine
default from the Jenner Institute
default,
default and this was sad because we do need to replace the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis. The approach that has been used for
default the 
defaultBexsero
default meningococcal 
defaultsero
defaultgroup
default B vaccine is called reverse 
defaultvaccinology
default,
default and this is what I mean by a new golden age of vaccine development. By looking at the genetics of the organism
default,
default we now have the pot
defaultential to identify targets that
default ca
defaultn be used for vaccine. The 
defaultserogroup
default B meningococcal vaccine—the Novartis 
defaultBexsero
default vaccine—
defaultwas developed along those lines. For the 
defaultnosocomi
defaultal
default infections—to be specific, S
defaulttaphylococcus 
defaultaureu
defaults
default—
defaultt
defaulthere has also been a failure, or two failures, of vaccines.
default 
defaultE.coli
default, 
defaultAcinetobacter
default, 
defaultEnteroba
defaultcteriaceae
default, 
defaultKlebsiella
default and so on:
default 
defaultw
defaulte need to use this new sort of technology to
default develop specific vaccines for Staph, 
defaultE.coli
default, Staph 
defaultepi
default and so on. W
defaulthen I 
defaultsay 
defaultgolden age, we are going to have great difficulties in developing new antibiotics unless the
defaultre are some miracles. But we 
defaulthave the potential now to 
defaultuse genetics, looking at these very resistant organisms, to develop vaccines, not necessarily to use them throughout the whole community
default for 
defaulteveryone, like we generally do
default, 
defaultbut 
defaultto use these new vaccines 
defaultin a more targeted approach, especially 
defaultfor 
defaultpeople going into hospitals, people who are at risk of these serious infections.
default&#xa0;defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default Is one of the problems 
defaulty
defaultou face—going back to the BCG—
defaultthat it only protects against certain 
defaultstrains of the TB virus, or 
defaultbacteria? Is there a problem that
default,
default if you are just vaccinati
defaultng against certain strains, 
defaultactually you can encourage the other strains to develop?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultThe beauty of this new approach is that one can attack or prevent as many potential strains as possible, and again I refer to the meningococcal 
defaultserogroup
default B. Until
default now we have had a vaccine in 
defaultC
defaultó
defaultrdoba, a vaccine in Normandy
default and
default a vaccine in New Zealand
default,
default 
defaultbecause that is where there have
default been particular strain
defaults
default of this organism. But in fact there are hundreds of different strains of this organism around the world, the meningococcal B, and now we have the potential to have a vaccine which can cover the majority of
default those strains. Similarly with S
defaulttaph, similarly with tuberculosis
default; 
defaultin fact
default,
default what I would also like to mention
default—
defaultthis might come as a surprise to you
default—
defaultis the role of viral vaccines in preventing antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance. For example, influenza may result in secondary super
default-
defaultinfection, bacterial infection, and this is why the influenza vaccine has the potential to prevent antibiot
defaultic usage. 
defaultI think we should be talking about bacterial vaccines
default and
default about viral vaccines as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultWhy is vaccine development so much behind an
defaulttibiotic development? Again with TB, 
defaultit is 70 years since it was developed. There must be some sort of failure in the system.
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: With 
defaultvaccine devel
defaultopment we have been using, let’s call them,
default old
default&#x2011;
defaultfashioned approaches, 
defaultmushing
default up the organism or breaking up the organism, using bits of the organism
default,
default intuitively trying them out. Now we have the potential to look at the genetics of the organism, do various tests after that
default, using bio
defaultinfo
defaultr
defaultmatics and computer systems
default,
default and reall
defaulty identify the targets that 
defaultwill be successful vaccine targets. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultWhy has
defaultn’t that 
defaultcome along in the past? Is it a technology thing or is it because of the market situation
default?
default 
defaultD
defaultrugs companies have a vaccine on the market, it does 90% of the job
default,
default so, hey, it is not really worth the
defaultir
default econom
defaultically developing a new vaccine.
default Is that the case
default?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultNo.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Mosley:default 
defaultWhy has it taken 70 years?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultIt is a long process to develop a new antibiotic. It is also a long process to develop a new vaccine. It is very expensive. Once you have done that particular process of discovery of an antibiotic or a vaccine, then you have to run it through human clinical trials, 
defaultyou 
defaulth
defaultave to get it approved and so on
default, so it is very costly. I think that the process of reverse 
defaultvaccinology
default will reduce the costs of developing new vaccines. I do not see any new techniques available for developing new antibiotics. I think the discovery process there is fixed. 
defaultW
defaulte now have a flexible, new approach to developing n
defaultew vaccines.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Morris:default M
defaults Williams, you said you wanted Government action to ensure existing diagnoses were taken up more widely in the NHS. Is there ready evidence that this would be cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective?
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: 
defaultThere is some
default evidence. T
defaulthere ar
defaulte studies done on certain tests. There are international audits;
default there is an audit on a C
default&#x2011;
defaultreactive
default protein, which is a test to show 
defaultrise in infection. T
defaulthere are some studies
default,
default with co
defaultst
default&#x2011;
defaulteffectiveness
default related,
default ava
defaultilable from a global study
default. Cost savings within the NHS are hard. There is never a bag of cas
defaulth that is released. W
defaultith diagnostics, 
defaultit is more 
defaultthat you are shifting resources to be used elsewhere
default,
default or releasing capacity
default,
default much more than actually turning up with money at the chief executive
default’
defaults door
default,
default and it is quite hard to track that through the s
defaultystem. It is not quite as clear; it is not as simple 
defaultas taking a pill and someone gets better
default, or they don’t,
default and they release a bed. Diagnostic tests produce information which is used
default,
default but it is
default only one step in the pathway. I
defaultt is quite complex. 
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultIf we use a CRP, which is C
default&#x2011;
defaultr
defaulteactive
default protein, you can use i
defaultt as a near
default&#x2011;
defaultbedside
default test. That is what GPs can use. It is reasonably effective at differentiating between viruses and bacteria. It is something that is used outside the 
defaultUK
default quite widely. We do not use it here, as I 
defaultsaid, because it costs the GPs three 
defaultquid each time they do it
default,
default and t
defaulthey might be spending a lot of three 
defaultquids
default in a
default winter. We are about to pilot a large study in Southampton
default—
defaultMike Moore is running that
default. It will be piloted through our 
defaultclerk and we will look at the cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffectiveness
default of offering that remuneratio
defaultn within primary care. T
defaulthat is a process that is in the planning stages at the moment. It is a very good question
default,
default and it is one we need to answer for the NHS
default, but w
defaulte need rigorous evidence
default,
default which we do not have yet.
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: T
defaulther
defaulte is 
defaultgreat potential for synergy between diagnostics and vaccination
default. I 
defaultrefer to the previous session in terms of the fear of medical practitioners that the patient could have some underlying serious infection
default,
default and therefore 
defaultthe wish
default to prescribe antibiotics. With diagnostics and successful vaccination
default, we can reduce the fear level—
defaultnot only in the medical practitioners b
defaultut also in the public—that the
default patient w
defaultill have a severe infection. 
defaultI think there is a great potential for synergy between diagnostics and vaccination. 
defaultWe 
defaultmentioned influenza diagnostics. We should mention the great success of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
default,
default which has really reduced the fear of people having pneumonia
default,
default because it has reduced pneumococcal pneumonia
default,
default and the great success obviously of measles, mumps 
defaultand 
defaultrubella, measles being associated with pneumonia as well. 
defaultT
defaulthe synergy between effective diagnostics and effective vaccination can certainly impact on compliance, 
defaultthe 
defaultnumber of prescriptions, 
defaultthe 
defaultfear of patients that there is a serious infection and also 
defaulton
default this public debate about whether or not antibiotics should be used.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultDavid, I agree with you that it could impact, but it is not
default,
default because it is not getting into primary care. It is not happening. The science is right, but the dissemination and the activity 
defaultare
default not happening from the GP
default’
defaults seat. 
defaultWe have real issues—
defaultMike Moore and some of the ot
defaulther guys were talking about it this morning—
defaultabout a co
default-
defaultordinated process of making this happen in primary care where the prescriptions are happening.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Morris:default 
defaultPresumably information on the incidence of infection and resistance would be useful to companies producing diagnostic tools. Should these companies be doing more to facilitate gathering the information
default,
default to aid their product
default’
defaults production?
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: 
defaultAccess to that sort of information is quite tricky. As an industry
default,
default we are small with limited resources
default,
default and it is a bit of a vicious circle to drive production of a product when you have limited resources to pay for the data and the information. But companies are quite happy to work in combination with the NHS wherever possible to produce that sort of data.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default T
defaulthis is really to Mr 
defaultHardcastle
default and Professor 
defaultLewith
default first and foremost
default. What advantages 
defaultdo your approaches have over other tradit
defaultional antimicrobials
default?
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultThe thing that gets me about this discussion is 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is lots of talk about 
default“
defaultpotential
default”,
default and the thing that Dame Sally Davies keeps emphasising is that we are running out of time. 
defaultT
defaulthe critical thing for us i
defaults that we know that 
defaultphages
default work; i
defaultt is just that we cannot make them available in this country. The reason we cannot make them available in this country is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have more rigorous regulatory standards. 
defaultFirst, 
defaultwe know 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is evidence that they work. 
defaultS
defaultecond
defaultly,
default they are harml
defaultess in man and they are inert; t
defaultherefore, the rate at which you can bring them through the regulatory regime should be quicker. 
defaultT
defaulthird
defaultly,
default there are lots of them. One of the issues that the antibiotic development arena has is that there are lots of possible candidates and very few of them actually get thro
defaultugh to being useful drugs. F
defaultrom our perspective, we have a lot of good putative candidates already.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultI think that the nutritional and herbal approaches have some preliminary eviden
defaultce behind them. We need 
defaultsome further investment in research, so we need some harder studies to demonstrate that they really do control symptoms, 
defaultand 
defaultthat they can be prescribed by GPs
default,
default or over the counter and made available by pharmacists, so that the GPs can feel they are doing something. It is very difficult when somebody comes to ask you for help
default to say,
default 
default“
defaultGo away and put up with it for five days.
default”
default We do not have that kind of culture.
defaultWe need to be able to do something that is safe and does not actually load up antimicrobial resistance for the future. There is huge potential with herbal remedies, but I think we need to move away a little bit from the drug
default&#x2011;
defaultmining
default element of herbal remedies, where we are looking for the wonderful chemical in the way they lo
defaultoked for the new malarial with A
defaultrtemisia. We need to see them in a slightly different context
default,
default as more complex mixtures of chemicals. We need to understand much more about herbal safety, because herbs generally are much safer than conventional medicines
default—
defaultthe evidence is pretty overwhelming around that
default—
defaultand we need to have thoughtful levels of regulation with t
defaulthe MHRA. 
defaultI share with John that we need a better process within our regulatory and safety processes
default,
default to take account of things which are not standard pharmaceutical agents
default,
default and a process which allows us to have
default good, critical and 
defaultthoughtful scientific review 
defaultthat
default is relevant to the disciplines
default, so
default that these new and old medications may be reviewed properly and scientifically.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultOur dealings with the MHRA have been pretty good
default,
default but
default,
default as far as I am aware, we are the only company on the planet that has regulatory approval in the way we make our product
default,
default and that is where most of
default our money has gone to date. I
defaultt is not that the 
defaultMHRA are difficult
default,
default or the FDA or any of the rest of them for that matter, but the mentality makes it very difficult to bring new antimicrobials through quickly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThe UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance St
defaultrategy 2013 to 2018 states that 
defaultthe development of novel therapies is an important element of the mult
defaultifaceted approach to tackling 
defaultAR
defaultM
default. Do you then feel that more resources should be dedicated to your work
default,
default and that this falls into the category so described here?
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultIt certainly falls into that category. I get very nervous about suggesting that more money from Government should be placed behind our company or our initiative, but what you should think about is changing the landscape so that both big 
defaultpharma
default and the venture capital community will put private money behind potential new antimicrobials.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultThe answer to that, I would add, 
defaultis 
defaultthat t
defaulthe MHRA has been really helpful,
default but they are surroun
defaultded by a regulatory system that
default makes it sometimes difficult for them. 
defaultT
defaulthe situation with herbals is very difficult because herbals are not easily patentable
default,
default and 
defaultalso 
defaultmany nutritionals, which may equally be effective
default. W
defaulte have a big trial that is in debate at the moment about using nu
defaulttritionals in care homes—
defaultvitamin D and 
defaultprobiotics
default—
defaultto diminish or cause antibiotic prescribing. 
defaultY
defaultou have talked about care homes
default,
default and 
defaulti
defaultt could have a big impact if we could 
defaultdo 
defaultthat. They 
defaultare 
defaultvery simple, cheap supplements, but they are not
default patentable, so it is very difficult for us to 
defaultcombine with industry to do that
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte need to do that with Government
default&#x2011;
defaultfunded
default research boards
default,
default and that is difficult with the present structure.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default D
defaulteveloping this theme for a second, accor
defaultding to a submission from the Chinese Medical Institute, 
defaultresearch in China tells us that the 
default“
defaultimmunomodulatory
default actions of 
defaulttraditional Chinese medicine formulations have a stimulatory effect on immune cells, immune organs,
default cytokine production
default as well as inhibitory effect on in
defaultflammations, allergies and auto
defaultimmune diseases. Studies on acupuncture have shown that this treatment can increas

defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Thank you, Professor. “—t
defaulthat affect the immune system. Indeed, acupuncture can strengthen the immune system
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe effect can 
defaultbe 
defaultfurther enhanced with acupuncture when combined with Chinese herbal medicine
default”—and w
defaultestern medicine.
default 
defaultIs this not something that we should be looking at more carefully? They have a body of knowledge there that has been developed over thousands of years. 
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultWe are. First, we are looking at it. Secondly, that is a bit of a claim, and I will just leave it at that. Thirdly, you are unlikely to go to your GP in 
defaultLondon
default and get acupuncture for your chest infection. That is not going to be cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective. That is not a reasonable thing to expect the NHS to pay for. But, for instance, we are currently doing a study in 
defaultSouthampton
default on recurrent urinary tract infections in older women
default,
default which is a big problem for a significant minority of older women
default,
default in which we are using Chinese herbal medicines instead of antibiotics. We think that they act in several ways. Interestingly, they act to block the cell membrane pumping the antibiotic out
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultne of the ways that the body becomes resistant to antibiotics is that 
defaultit
default get
defaults
default rid of 
defaultthem
default from the bacterial cells very quickly
default; 
defaultsynergistically
default,
default the herbs appear to stop that membrane transport pump
default,
default so the antibiotics can stay in the cells for longer. 
defaultO
defaultne of the actions of the particular concoction of herbal medicines we are using does that. It also has direct 
defaultantibacterial effects. The whole point of this process is 
defaultthat we can do this, 
defaultand 
defaultwe can do it very scientifically
default and very thoughtfully, b
defaultut we cannot do it in an easily patentable way
default,
default and commercialisation is difficult.
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: O
defaultne needs to remember that there is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence in favour of immunisation and vaccination
default,
default and that immunisa
defaulttion and vaccination is preventa
defaulttive. 
defaultT
defaulto crystallise your point, do you want to go down the path of treatment or do you want to go down the path of prevention? I think prevention is, ultimately, in the short term and the long term
default,
default going to be the way to combat antibiotic resistance.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultI am a big fan of vaccines, but all I would point out again is the time line. Traditionally, vaccines work better against viruses than bacteria
default,
default and I am not sure it makes commercial sense to develop vaccines against all bacteria that cause problems, simply because not everyone gets infected.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default I have j
defaultust one more question. I think I am right in saying that none of you a
defaultre qualified as homeopaths, but,
default Professor 
defaultLewith
default, 
defaultI think 
defaultyour submissi
defaulton was in conjunction with Dr Peter Fisher
default, who is the Queen
default’
defaults physician
default.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultHe is.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default He
default also runs the 
defaultLondon h
defaultospital for integrated 
defaultmedicine
default. He draws attention in your submission
default—
defaultI assume it is him
default—
defaultto a health technology a
defaultssessment commissioned by the Swiss Federal G
defaultovernment which found that 
default“29 clinical trials of hom
defaulteopathy for upper respiratory tract
default infection or allergies found 29 clinical studies
default of which 24 were positive for
default hom
defaulteopathy.
default”
default He also refers to a study supported by the Indian Minis
defaulttry of Health, which “involved 
defaultcollaboration between conventional ear, nose and throat specialists and homeopathic doctors in a randomised control
defaultled trial of hom
defaulteopathy versus conventional treatment in acute 
defaultotitis
default media
default.”
default 
defaultI
defaultt suggests that the numbers of antibiotic presc
defaultriptions in the 
defaulthomeopathically
default 
defaulttreated group were much lower. Although this is not particularly your field, would it not be sensible for us to make further investigations in this field to establish whether its usage is effective?
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultThere are two things. First, I agree that vaccinations are very important preventatively
default,
default but you are not going to stop every virus or bacteria with vaccinations. We need some interventions. Secondly, as far as homeopathy is concerned, this Committee has been around the corner very publicly with homeopathy previously and I do not want to get involved in that. The biggest impact a general practitioner has in a consultation is the consultation
default. W
defaulthen you consider that we 
defaulthave
default an ageing population with multi
default&#x2011;
defaultmorbidity
default, pain, arthritis, hypertension, irritable bowel, headaches and all sorts of things, 
defaultfor 
defaultthe vast majority of those chronic illnesses, except perhaps hypertension, the biggest response is 
defaultto 
defaultthe consultation, not the medicine. If you go to a GP and get a homeopathic medicine, it may well be a placebo
default,
default but you may go away without using your antibiotics. That happens quite a lot in 
defaultFrance
default and it seems to be quite an effective way of minimising antibiotic prescribing. If you wanted to know whether homeopathy really worked for these infections, then you would need to do more clinical trials
default,
default because the trials are promising but small. T
defaulthere are about 80,000 medically qualified hom
defaulteopaths, mainly in France and Germany, who use homeopathy 
defaultin this situation quite regularly
default,
default and the evidence is that they use many fewer antibiotics. Whether that is all placebo or real effect, we do not know yet.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default B
defaultefore we move on, to help my understanding, could micro
default&#x2011;
defaultorganisms develop resistance to either the 
defaultbacteriophage
default approach or indeed the herbal approach?
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultResistance in micro
default&#x2011;
defaultorganisms is very interesting. If you go back to the genome of the micro
default&#x2011;
defaultorganism
default,
default you note that they evolved with fungi. Most of our antibiotics a
defaultre fungi. There is 
defaultan interesting theory that quite a lot of the current antimicrobial resistance is the reawakening of old evolutionary genes
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf you remember Fleming
default’
defaults experiment 
defaultin 
defaultSt Mary
default’
defaults, the fungi flew in from the window, sat on his plate and the penicillin 
defaultfungus killed the bacteria. O
defaultur antibiotics largely come from fungi 
defaultthat
default have co
default&#x2011;
defaultevolved
default with bacteria.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultSo the answer to my question is yes.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultYes. The argument here around vaccination and stimulating the immune system becomes ve
defaultry powerfully preventative
default if you look at the evolutionary context of antimicrobial resistance.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultJust for a bit of background, 
defaultphages
default have been around for about 3 billion years an
defaultd bacteria just afterwards. T
defaulthere has been, for want of a better expression, an arms race going on between the pair of them for a long time. Every day about a quarter of all bact
defaulteria are killed by 
defaultphages
default world
defaultwide. 
defaultT
defaulto be clear, the way they apply them is as a cocktail
default,
default so that you do not get that concern practically.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultFurther research seems to be key to finding future developments. Who should be the main funders
default,
default or who are the main funders of the various types of research that are going on?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultT
defaulthis is obviously relevant to a
default big question for vaccination
default,
default because vaccine
default&#x2011;
defaultdeveloping
default companies invest hundreds of millions of dollars and pounds in developing new vaccines.
default Universities and 
defaultbiotechs
default 
defaultare 
defaultoften involved
default at very early stages
default,
default but then you get to the very expensive part of doing the big clinical trials, which we have all referred to
default. T
defaulto get these products approved one has to do clinical trials. The question then comes on to the val
defaultue that the particular product—
defaultthe phage
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaulthomeopathic
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultvaccine
default,
default obviously, or 
defaultthe antibiotic for that matter—
defaultwill have to the NHS in reducing cost. The balance is the amount of i
defaultnvestment being put in and the cost-benefit to the national health service that will come out—
defaultthe reduction in antibiotic prescriptions, the reduction in antibiotic resistance. My quick answer really is that in appraising vaccines
default—
defaultI am not going 
defaultto comment on the 
defaultphages
default or hom
defaulteopathy
default—
defaultwe now need new ways of appraising using health technology assessment to assess the cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffectiveness
default of vaccines, not only in the community but also within the hospital setting.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultStephen, did you mean as in who should be picking up the tab for the development of new antimicrobials?
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultNo, non
default&#x2011;
defaultchemical
default antibiotics. Who is funding the research that is going on at the moment?
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultI would say that any antimicrobial
default—
defaultit does not really matter whether it is a vaccine, a phage or a new drug
default—
defaultfor the most part should be funded by the private sector. The reason I say that is that you need to ensure that everyone is appropriately incentivised. The reason there are few new antibiotics coming along is that it is not worth big 
defaultpharma
default’
defaults
default while to put their effort there. That is why
default,
default if you look at the top selling drugs, they are antidepressants, cholesterol reducers and the like. 
defaultW
defaulthat you need to do is change the landscape to encourage those with very deep pockets to take advantage of the good work that is done in academic centres already. It is not an issue about a lack of good ideas. The real issue is when it gets expensive and you have to make it 
defaultworth
default 
defaultwhile
default for those with deep pockets to make a turn.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: I 
defaultagree with that completely.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultI was just going to use you as an example of why you may not agree with that.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: Thank you. W
defaulte can always turn the arguments round the other way. I think what John is saying is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe need different kind
defaults
default of processes to incentivise companies. There are 
defaultlots of 
defaultbig herbal companies
default in Europe—
defaultunfortunately not in this country because we seem to be in the process of destroyi
defaultng that industry at the moment—that
default produce very good quality products and want to work with us
default,
default and we need to make that easier and more feasible
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte need to understand tha
defaultt if they are going to invest 
default£1 million in a clinical trial they need to have something out of that
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat then comes back to the process of patenting and how we manage that insti
defaulttutionally. People are willing; 
defaultwe 
defaultjust 
defaultneed to create the right environment for that to happen.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultThat was my point. You were saying how difficult it was to patent herbs. 
defaultC
defaultan you give us some direction that we should go in
default,
default to try and resolve this
default,
default rather than saying 
default“This is the problem”
default? We can all see that. What is the resolution to that problem?
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultThe resolution is to have commitment from both public and private joint ventures
default that 
defaultwo
defaultrk well, because if you incentivise
default people they work harder and they do not sit on their bums and expect the Government to pay. I think that is really important. The other thing is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe 
defaultcan 
defaultcreate
default 
defaultpatented remedies around two or three herbals 
defaultthat
default might do this
default,
default and they might be very effective mechanisms of symptom control
default; 
defaultsome of the big Chinese companie
defaults are really interested in this
default. 
defaultW
defaulte need to reach out to them
default and
default get our MHRA inspectors going 
defaultin
defaultto 
defaultChina
default to make sure that these products are produced to good manufacturing practice. We need to be more open in our universities and incentivise 
defaultthem
default to set up joint ventures
default,
default and 
defaultwe need 
defaultto have facilities within the MHRA so that they
default can understand and facilitate—not drop standards—
defaultand bring in the skilled people who understand these processes and can let us work. I think if we can do that
default, it is not expensive: it needs legislation 
defaultand a few people.
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultCould I give you a concrete example of why big 
defaultpharma
default might not want to invest in antibiotics or vaccines? The concrete example is the vaccine I referred to before, 
defaultBexsero
default, the meningococcal B vaccine
default,
default which has had a huge amount of investment and approval in 
defaultEurope
default but rec
defaultently got knocked back by the 
defaultJCBI. Now of course the JCBI is reviewing that decision and putting some new inputs into their model, but for big 
defaultpharma
default, let us say, the investment that one has to make in a vaccine such as 
defaultBexsero
default, or a vaccine for S
defaulttaphylococcus 
defaultaureus
default,
default 
defaultE.coli
default or 
defaultAcinetobacter
default,
default is huge
default,
default and the tools we have for measuring the potential benefit for the NHS and the health system in general are not the best tools
default. That is a concrete example
default 
defaultwhere I think 
defaulta big 
defaultpharma
default company may think twice about investing huge amounts of money in any intervention if there is not more of an as
defaultsurance of it being recommended—
defaultwhether it be a phage, homeopathy or a vaccine such as 
defaultBexsero
default, which is now available to prevent the most common cause of childh
defaultood infectious death in the UK
default. 
defaultO
defaultne thinks
default,
default 
default“T
defaulthis is a huge investment, but is this product or vaccine going to be recommended?
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default It strikes me that
default barriers to the resear
defaultch are the regulatory framework and
default the tools that are used to work out that cost
default&#x2011;
defaultbenefit
default analysis. Funding is an issue because of some of that. Are there any other barriers to people investing? The will? Is there a will to research?
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultThere may not be a will to research certain things 
defaultlike 
defaultphages
default or herbal medicines; t
defaulthere may not be enough investme
defaultnt academically to do that. S
defaultetting up one or two centres of excellence would be really helpful and can be done relatively cheaply in joint ventures with specific universities 
defaultthat
default express interest. 
defaultS
defaultmall amounts of money can be used to seed things. 
defaultI
defaultf you get the academic interest and get people on side
default, in
default the clinical professions, you can begin to make things change.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: My experience on this has been that
default we have had to go outside the UK to tie up with centres of excellence in our business, but really there are three things you need to think about. 
defaultFirst, you 
defaultneed to think about changing when the patent time starts ticking
default. R
defaultather than 
defaultit being 
defaultwhen you apply for a patent, you need to tie it to whe
defaultn you can sell the medicine. S
defaultecond
defaultly,
default you need to think about why 
defaultit 
defaultis that those folk who set the drug tariffs believe it is worse to die of cancer
default than it is to die of pneumonia,
default because right now you can get a heck of a lot more mon
defaultey for a new drug against, let’
defaults say, bowel cancer than you can against a new antibiotic or antimicrobial. 
defaultT
defaulthird
defaultly,
default you might think about supercharging 
defaultE
defaultIS relief
default,
default which should be relatively straightforward. You are not going to be able to pick winners
default,
default so what you should be thinking about is saying 
defaultthat 
defaultthose folk who are prepared to back companies in our situation need to be encouraged to divert more of their spare cash 
defaultaway from, let’s say, a bricks and 
defaultmortar deal or a software development company into antimicrobials.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultThank 
defaultyou. There is a proposal for a D
defaultiagno
defaultstics and Stratified Medicine Catapult C
defaultentre. Do you think that is the right approach
default,
default or do you think we should have one that specialises in antibiotics research and things associated with that
default—
defaultdiagnostics?
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: 
defaultWe were delighted in the diagnostics industry that the TSB recogni
defaultsed the importance of having a C
defaultatapult to get diagnostics used
default,
default and
default that
default stratified medicine is 
defaultacross the whole heal
defaultth care continuum, 
defaultdiagnosing, ruling out, monitoring and managing disease as well. I would be highly in favour of that continuing along the plans that they have got going at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Metcalfe:default 
defaultDoes anyone else have a comment on that?
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultIt would probably be no bad thing to align those 
defaultkinds of initiatives with the 
defaultimport 
defaultthat Dame Sally gives, b
defaultut I would say 
defaultthat 
defaultthe diagnostic aspect is absolutely critical.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultYou have covered quite extensively the barriers to research in the UK. Could you tell us a bit more about barriers to introducing new techniques to the market
default,
default apart from research?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultFirst, I will make a broad comment,
default not necessarily about vaccines.
default 
defaultW
defaulte do value more, I think, interventions for the elderly end
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaultlife
default type of approaches which may extend life perhaps by a few months or improve quality of life in older people and the elderly
default,
default and there is nothing wrong with that at all.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultI am sorry, Dr McIntosh, when you say 
default“
defaultwe
default”,
default who are you referring to?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultI am saying 
default“
defaultbroadly speaking
default”
default.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultAre you making a comment about the age of politicians now?
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultI am speaking as a paediatrician
default;
default we could spend more investment and resources at the beginning
default,
default in
default childhood, in paediatrics. 
defaultI am speaking, I guess, as a paediatrician more than anything, again not devaluing what is done for elderly 
defaultpeople 
defaultand 
defaultolder people, but 
defaultI think we could perhaps start to transfer the focus to earlier times i
defaultn life, childhood, paediatrics and 
defaulteven neonato
defaultlogy, with vaccines coming in for
default that area as well
default,
default where we can really improve not only the quality of life but the length of life by preventing childhood infections. Secondly, preventing childho
defaultod infections with vaccines has
default been shown to have a benefit for adult and elderly population
defaults as well;
default the pneumococcal and influenza vaccination programmes are cases in point where an intervention in childhood has an extreme benefit in the a
defaultdult and elderly population. 
defaultI think we can start to link up a little bit the beginning
default of life
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultend of life.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultI would be quite interes
defaultted to hear, M
defaults Williams, about the barriers that BIVDA feel are prevalent in the 
defaultUK
default, particularly within the NHS.
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: 
defaultOne of the barriers is the financial flows around the NHS systems in both 
defaultEngland
default and the developed nations. Pathology generally has a budget to provide the testing 
defaultfor all of the hospital care and 
defaultlocal community care as well
default,
default and that means that there is a restriction on the amount of testing that can be done.
default O
defaultne of the things we would like to see
default,
default wherever tests ar
defaulte specific to a patient pathway, is
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthe relevant department actually 
defaultpicks up the costs of that
default,
default because, as we have said, the cost of a diagnostic test is relatively cheap on the whole and the value it provides is much higher. But if you
default have a restricted silo budget for 
defaultnumerous tests on respiratory infections
default—
defaultrespiratory infections are the second of the main 
defaultcauses of admission to hospital—and 
defaultif you have an old
default&#x2011;
defaultfashioned microbiology lab
default,
default 
defaultwhich
default will very effectively pick
default up the cause of the infection but 
defaultwill take t
defaultime to culture those plates up,
default it is very difficult to 
defaultintroduce a new technology that
default will be slightly more expensive
default but 
defaultmeans that the patient could get the right antibiotic therapy within five hours of being admitted.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default I know we are running short of
default time, but I am interested in everyone
default’
defaults view 
defaulton this, particularly yours:
default do you think that the new structure
defaults within NHS England are
default going to be a help or a hindrance to getting new techniques through?
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: 
defaultAt the moment
default,
default it does not look like the situation for us has changed significantly. Maybe it will and commissioning may help in that, but one of our problems is the lack of awareness as well
default;
default 
defaultwe need 
defaultto make physicians aware 
defaultof the tests that are available.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have talked about CRP, but there are simple swab tests that could be used in primary care 
defaultthat
default are routinely used el
defaultsewhere, which just give a colour-
defaultchange reaction in the same 
defaultway
default as a pre
defaultgnancy kit. They take seconds to do and 
defaultco
defaultst
default maybe £1 or £2
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have to find a way of financing that, but it is 
defaultabout 
defaulteducating GPs. I even thought that having a biomedical scientist working in the c
defaultommunity would be a way to support 
defaultGP
defaults’ workload
default for that sort of point
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaultcare
default testing.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultWe have a uniquely refined primary care research structure in the UK which is probably the best in the world
default,
default and it is really well funded. It has not been dramatically affected by the NHS changes
default,
default becaus
defaulte it is mainly an academic and
default NIHR
default&#x2011;
defaultfunded
default structure
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere is a huge amoun
defaultt that we could do if we took 
defaultco
default&#x2011;
defaultordinated and
default thoughtful action on this. I
defaultt is very attractive to large 
defaultpharma
default to do that kind of work in the UK
default,
default because they know it will be hig
defaulth quality. W
defaulte could do a lot of these things here
default,
default within the community
default,
default very ef
defaultfectively and earn money from them
default.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultYou asked about the barriers
default, a
defaults I understood it, in relation to the NHS. The issue for us is cultural. There is a real familiarity with using antibiotics to sort out infectious disease
default,
default and it is not necessarily easy for cli
defaultnicians to have to deal with a
default number of different approaches to killing a troublesome bug
default,
default so there is going to be a cultural issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultPamela Nash:default 
defaultWhen you say a 
default“
defaultcultural issue
default”
default, who is this affecting? 
defaultI
defaultt is the same with what you 
defaultwere saying about 
defaultBIVDA
default; 
defaultthere is a high recognition within this place, for 
defaultinstance, about what BIVDA does.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultSay, for example, 
defaultthat 
defaultsomeone comes in and they have an infection, the typical response would be a broad spectrum antibiotic, initially. If you have rapid diagnostics and you know exactly which version of a bug is causing you difficulty, you could apply a narrow spectrum treatment
default,
default which would give you a better outcome
default,
default but it would require a different approach by the clinicians treating the patient.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultThe medical culture, not the culture in the House of Commons.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan we pin this down a bit more? There is a UK antim
defaulticrobial resistance strategy 
default2013
default&#x2011;
default18. Does that strategy encompass fully the approaches that each of you 
defaultis
default adopting? If not, what amendments would you recommend
default?
default I will just go down the table and ask that.
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultI know 
defaultphages
default are mentioned on page 18, so yes is the short answer. The key issue is the funding.
defaultChair:default 
defaultDr McIntosh? 
defaultDr McIntoshdefault: 
defaultThe strategy is a good document but it does not explicitly or implicitly state that vaccination has had a role in reducing 
defaultantibiotic 
defaultc
defaultonsumption or
default antibiotic resistance
default,
default and does not implicitly or explicitly state that in the future vaccination has a role in reducing antibiotic resistance.
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan we leave Professor 
defaultLewith
default till last
default?
defaultDoris-Ann Williamsdefault: 
defaultI think the strategy is excellent. It does mention diagnostics. I was quite surprised in the earlier session to hear that GPs are not considering prescription of antibiotics. When you think that must be the most common prescription they write, you would think they would look for a tool and that that would still be at the forefront of their mind.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe reason I left you 
defaulttill
default last, Professor 
defaultLewith
default, is that I want to split the answer in two from you, one in respect of what you said about herbal and the other in response to David 
defaultTredinnick
default’
defaults
default question, your response on hom
defaulteopathy
default,
default because I guess there mu
defaultst be two separate answers
default.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: 
defaultYes, there are.

defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultProfessor Davies is on record to this Committee and talking to the Lords as saying that 
default“
defaultoutwith
default the placebo effect
default, hom
defaulteopathy has no impact
default.
default I am very concerned when homeopathic practitioners try 
defaultand
default peddle this way of life to prevent malaria or other infectious diseases. I am quite clear 
defaultabout where 
defaultI believe the evidence is.
default” 
defaultI am presuming you might have two separate answers.
defaultProfessor defaultLewithdefault: Let’
defaults answer the difficult one first. I do not t
defaulthink you should be using hom
defaulteopathy with malaria; I think that is outrageous. In dealing with acute infections, the actual evidence, if you look at it, is unclear 
defaultas to 
defaultwhether it is a placebo or not. With the greatest respect, I do not think Dame Sally Davies has perhaps studied that evidence in any detail, but I think the jury is very much out on that. I do not think it is conclusive. I would support that by saying that you can look at 
defaultthe same data in two separate 
defaultLancet
default systematic reviews about hom
defaulteopathy and come to entirely opposing conclusions
default,
default which, to me, me
defaultans there is not enough data. 
defaultAs to t
defaulthe second
default,
default in terms of herbal medicine, I agree that the policy is a great policy. I have read it and I think it covers most of the issues. I think that the issues around herbal medicine are around regulatory issues and facilitating expertise in the 
defaultUK
default,
default and within that context, with 
defaultvery small changes, we could do some quite interesting things in the same way as they are doing in continental 
defaultEurope
default.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI thank the panel for their presentations this morning
default.
default It has been a very interesting morning all round. If you have any additional information you would like to submit, please feel free.

defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Dowd:default 
defaultI have one brief question, if I may, Chair. If 
defaultphages
default are killing a quarter of all the bacteria in the world every day, how come there is still so much of it about?
defaultJohn defaultHardcastledefault: 
defaultIt is those pesky bacteria
default that go and
default breed the next day.
defaultChair:default 
defaultOn that point, thank you very much for your attendance.
