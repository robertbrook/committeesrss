[[[Bicycle Culture by Design: Mikael Colville-Andersen]]]The focus on re-establishing more liveable cities continues unabated. The primary problem however is that 85 years of traffic engineering revolving around the car has failed miserably. It’s time for modern thinking. Design can help. Historically, streets were human spaces. Let’s design our cities like we design toasters or smartphones, following the desire lines of our citizens. Using basic design principles instead of engineering is the surest route to developing thriving, human cities.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX8zZdLw7cs&amp;feature=youtu.be***
