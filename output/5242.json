"              \n              \n&#xa0;DIS 59Written Evidence Submitted by The Children’s Book Project for Tanzania (CBP)Executive SummaryHigh quality education for all children, including disabled children, in their first years of schooling builds a foundation for future learning and for healthy and productive family and civic life. Literacy skills equip a person both to  gain knowledge and understanding of their immediate environment, and to make sense of the wider world. Research shows that a child who is able to read and write is better able to contribute to his or her personal and community well being. \nThe Primary Education Development Plan (PEDP III), Big Results Now (BRN) and the LANES literacy and numeracy proposal all firmly recognize the importance of education to support literacy development, so as to ensure better lives for  Tanzanians including people with disabilities. But the challenges are many, including semi-trained teachers for literacy, a lack of Braille reading materials to read, besides having few textbooks transcribed into Braille.\nThe CBP’s experience in Braille book provision is in line with  DFID’s mission to support disabled children and youths to improve their lives, and prepare them to become responsible citizens in their communities.\n1.0&#xa0; \nIntroductionThe Children’s Book Project\n for Tanzania is a local N\non – Governmental \nO\nrganization whose main goals are to cultivate a strong reading culture among children in Tanzania through the provision of books to children for the purpose of increasing and widening their knowledge and developing their reading skills; \nthrough \n the teaching of literacy and support for reading in the formal education system \nvia in-\nservice training of teachers\n;\n and \nthrough \nsupporting indigenous authorship and publishing.\n              \n2.0&#xa0; \nDescription of CBP ActivitiesCBP\n’s\n programme has three main components which include:\nCBP implements  professional development for \nt\nrainers. This\n is \nled by CBP’s experienced staff. Trainers are trained for 15 days\n, divided into three 5-\nday workshop sessions spread out\n over 8 months. \nIn addition to training of teachers, CBP provides reading materials to help children l\nearn to read and develop life-\nlong habits of reading. Schools are supplied with reading materials\n,\n and teachers are given training in library management and in reading promotion\n.\nCBP provides book sector training to publishers, writers, illustrators and editors, with the aim of develop\ning\n \ntheir \nprofessional skills\n, \n hence improving the quality of the books produced.\n3.0 Provision \nof Braille Books for Visually Impaired Children.Rationale for the Project\nIn 1994 CBP organized a Children’s Book Day at the National Library. Among the invited children where visually impaired children from Uhuru Mchanganyiko, in Ilala District, Dar es Salaam region. The children performed a poem which  \nexpressed how \n they were being neglected in CBP’s book project activities, while normal ch\nildren were provided with books\n.\nThe children raised their concern that they had very few textbooks in Braille and there were no reading books. \nFollowing the request, CBP embarked on a programme \nto produce \n Braille books for visually impaired children. Those were the first readers ever produced for visually impaired children in the countr\ny. To date, CBP has transcribed 37 story books for visually impaired children. The books have been distributed to 25 schools which cater for  disabled children.\nCurrently there are more than 2,000 visually impaired children in primary schools in Tanzania. Among them are two specials namely Bwigili in Dodoma region and Furaha in Tabora region. There are also integrated schools which are Uhuru Mchanganyiko in Dar es Salaam,Mazinyungu in Morogoro region and another one in Lushoto, the rest are inclusive schools.\n \n4.0 ChallengesChildren\nTeachers\n5.0 Recommended ActivitiesCBP will carry out \na \nneeds assessment to determine the actual number of visually impaired children who are in primary schools in Tanzania. The number of visually impaired children will determine the print run of the Braille books to be produced and distributed to schools. Apart from getting this crucial information, the project will\n also provide data on \nthe list of schools with such children and number of tutors and teachers available for these children. The information will support project planning.\n2.\n Training of Trainers\n S\nelect\n a\n number of tuto\nrs from the colleges which train teachers for visually impaired children and train them on how to teach effective literacy skills .and prepare them to become trainers and mentors.\n.\n T\nrain teachers through in-service teacher training\n, using the  t\nrain the tra\niner model.\n. The initiative i\ns focusing on enabling \nteachers to acquire book management\n skills\n \n for\n Braille books, and provid\ning\n them with basic librarian skills\n;\na\nnd also working to to incorporate reading materials into the school’s instructional strategies and  culture through library development and instructional practice.\n.\nThe Braille book provision i\nnitiative strongly supports PEDP\n III which states the necessity for school libraries and supplementary materials \nto support learning and teaching.\nProvision of Braille Books to \nintegrated\n schools which cater for visually\n impaired\n children and to \ninclusive schools \nwill \nsupport instruction strategies, literacy development and learning outcomes. These materials will support the quality of education, the country’s literacy development and nurture children’s lifelong habits of reading during a formative period of learning.\nCBP has participated in the preparation of the government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) proposal on literacy and numeracy (LANES) to the Global Partnership in Education (GPE), which has been approved. The proposal to GPE  accommodated neither the  provision of reading books to both normal and visually impaired children nor the establishment of school libraries.\nFurthermore, these measures were also absent from the new presidential initiative Big Results Now (BRN) and the PEDP III activities In this respect CBP is appealing to DFID to take the responsibility to provide Braille Books to improve the children’s outcome and eventually contribute to improving the quality education.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;\n"
