[[[Written evidence submitted by Shelter]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Shelter welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Work and Pensions Select Committee on the significant reforms that have taken place in the welfare system over the past three years. More than a million people a year come to us for advice and support via our website, helpline and network of face-to-face services. Our evidence is rooted in the experiences of people we help every day, many of whom are extremely worried about housing costs and will be deeply affected by these changes. &#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At a time when so many are struggling to make ends meet, losing a job or a serious illness is all it takes to tip people into a spiral that could end in homelessness.&#xa0;Having access to a safety net can make all the difference, yet these reforms have cut the safety net back so much that if the worst happens families might not be able to get the help and support they need to stay in their homes and get back on their feet.  &#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission relates to the most detrimental of the housing related welfare reforms:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The restriction of the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates means low income households are increasingly struggling to find affordable private rented housing-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The removal of the 13 week protection will mean many renters who lose their job will no longer have a grace period in which they can stay in their home while seeking a new job-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposals for the alternative to direct payments for Universal Credit are insufficiently robust and react to rent arrears rather than proactively prevent them-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The so called ‘bedroom tax’ takes little account of the legitimate needs of disabled people and others for additional space. In addition, downsizing could in fact increase the housing benefit bill, for example if affected households move into the more expensive private rented sector.  &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; Worryingly, the discretionary, short-term and cash-limited nature of Discretionary Housing Payments means they are inadequate to support people who have been hit by the reforms outlined in this submission and have no alternative support.&#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; We therefore make some practical recommendations to ensure these reforms work better, including:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The DWP commits to review affordability and up-rate LHA rates if necessary to ensure low income households can access accommodation-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The ‘bedroom tax’ should only apply when alternative smaller accommodation is unavailable, and certain groups should be exempt-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 13 week protection rule must be replicated under Universal Credit.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0; Successive governments have moved to curb the rising cost of housing benefit by adjusting benefit entitlement, but these efforts have focused on treating the symptoms rather than the cause. While this submission makes recommendations to mitigate against the worst effects of these welfare reforms, the Government must invest in building new homes if it is serious about bringing down the housing benefit bill. This is the only long term way to reduce the cost of housing and lift households out of the benefit trap.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Local Housing Allowance Reforms ]]]&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; LHA is a form of housing benefit paid to tenants in the private rented sector. Until April 2012, LHA rates were calculated on a monthly basis based on actual rents in a local market. Benefit levels would stay the same or even fall if rental markets remained steady, but if rents started rising due to market pressure, LHA rates would increase to ensure that low income private renting households could find affordable accommodation.

[[[LHA rates to CPI inflation from April 2013. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This means LHA rates will fall behind the actual cost of private renting as private rents have traditionally risen faster than inflation (from 1997-2007 rents increased by 70 per cent but CPI only rose by&#xa0;20 per cent). 

[[[Li]]]

[[[nking CPI to LHA would make a third of local authorities unaffordable to low income households by 2023]]]

[[[.]]]&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Minister for Welfare Reform acknowledged that linking LHA to CPI risks creating a “critical lack of affordable housing” and said the Government was only committed to the measure until 2014-15, although the policy will automatically run on beyond the current spending review period. He pledged to reconsider LHA rates at this point if they were out of step with local rents, with the option to increase rates. 

[[[The Government must stick to this pledge. ]]]

[[[ a further cut, making it more likely that rents will outpace LHA.]]] LHA rates will be up-rated by&#xa0;a maximum of one per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16, even if rents or CPI are rising faster than this. The least affordable areas will be exempt, but DWP has so far released insufficient evidence of how this will be calculated and distributed, nor have they addressed concerns about the impact in other areas.

[[[ in the private rented sector]]]

[[[. ]]]&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is exacerbated further by

[[[ ]]]landlords’ aversion to housing tenants on benefits. Successive reductions in housing benefit have made claimants more unattractive to landlords. A Big Lottery funded project by Shelter and Crisis showed that landlords’ unwillingness to accept tenants on LHA is a major barrier to access a private rented home. &#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, separate evidence from Shelter revealed how poorly the LHA changes have been communicated. Claimants we spoke to were extremely confused about what was changing and what it meant for them. We found a tendency for claimants to conflate different changes or to confuse different timetables. For example, Universal Credit (UC) and housing benefit changes were referred to interchangeably. This weakens support for UC and causes unnecessary concern. The UC roll-out must seek to avoid replicating these communication errors.

[[[660,000 people living in council or housing association homes had their ]]]

[[[housing benefit]]]

[[[ reduced as they had one or more rooms]]]

[[[ judged to be “spare bedrooms”]]]. Hard-pressed families on the lowest incomes now need to find an average of £14 per week out of already stretched budgets to cover the shortfall. Some will be unable to pay this shortfall and will cut back on essential spending on food and household bills. Others may take out debt, joining the one million households who used a pay day loan to cover their housing costs last year, while many may risk arrears, eviction and homelessness. This increases costs for local authorities and undermines social housing as the last truly affordable housing option for families on low incomes.

[[[ to, meaning they will be unable to escape the penalty]]]. Because social landlords have tended to build homes to last families for many years, there is a lack of smaller one and two bed flats for households to downsize into. This is true nationally but is a particular problem in certain areas. For example, in Scotland we know that of the 82,500 households affected by the social sector size criteria, 60,000 need to move to a 1 bedroom property to avoid the penalty. Currently around 20,000 one bedroom properties are let annually across the whole of Scotland in the social sector.

[[[Homeless households should not be penalised by the social sector size criteria.  ]]]Homeless households living in local authority owned temporary accommodation (TA) should be exempt from the under occupation penalty. This is particularly a problem in Scotland where 56% of TA is local authority owned rather than leased or licensed from a social or private landlord where different subsidy rules apply. By definition, households who are forced to stay in TA until a settled home is available are vulnerable and in stressful situations and in particular need of a stable home to get back on their feet.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The calculation of how many bedrooms a household needs is a crude assessment which takes little account of the legitimate needs of disabled people ]]]

[[[and others ]]]

[[[for additional space]]]. Shelter has been approached by families who have good reasons for their ‘spare’ bedrooms, for example where they need space to store essential medical equipment. Only very limited exemptions have been granted for disabled children and the DWP continues to maintain that the over-stretched DHP fund is the best way to support disabled households. However, there is no guarantee that this will happen, and families have no right to appeal if DHP is not granted.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the case of Burnip, Gorry and Trengrove the Court of Appeal ruled that housing benefit regulations and not DHPs should cater for disabled children who cannot share a bedroom due to different caring needs. Where the DWP wish to support hard cases it would be more appropriate to do so via statutory regulations, which provide guaranteed protection, rather than unpredictable DHPs. &#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Even if DHPs were an appropriate tool to protect hard cases, the additional money that has been made available is unlikely to be sufficient. For example there is no guarantee that the additional £25 million in intended to support disabled people living in homes with expensive adaptations will be sufficient, and it is certain that many other disabled people will not be awarded a DHP.

[[[redit – Alternative Payment Arrangements]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Universal Credit (UC) will be paid as a ‘Standard Payment’ for the majority of claimants, meaning claimants will receive a direct monthly payment to the household, inclusive of housing benefit. Everyday money management is difficult for those on low incomes and with complex needs. So, having to manage finances in this way may therefore lead to arrears and ultimately eviction.&#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The DWP has announced welcome safeguards in the form of Alternative Payments Arrangements (APAs) where the housing cost component of UC will be paid direct to the landlord. 

[[[The APA proposals are welcome, but can be strengthened to ensure arrears are prevented in the first place.  ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The goal for UC claimants in settled accommodation should be improving financial capability to move those who can]]]

[[[ to financial independence]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[ ]]]Each claimant should be assessed to identify whether they should begin on Standard Payments or an APA. The assessment should consider needs beyond money management and debt and cover financial literacy, access to appropriate financial products, and other circumstances such as drug and alcohol addiction and debts. The assessment should result in an understanding of how long it might take the claimant to build financial capability and what support is required to make Standard Payments a realistic goal. Households should have the option to self-refer for an assessment for APAs, at any time in their UC application.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Importantly, APAs should be used to prevent arrears occurring in the first place.]]]

[[[ ]]]Claimants who need APAs should be identified up-front in collaboration with landlords, Job Centre Plus, local authorities and other agencies to prevent them moving into arrears – the Local Delivery Partnerships charged with making UC work on the ground would be a natural lead for this.

[[[5.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[In a little discussed move, short-term protection against rent arrears for people who have recently lost their job will be abolished under ]]]

[[[UC]]]. Currently if someone has not claimed housing benefit in the previous 52 weeks and could afford their rent when they signed up to a tenancy, they can claim housing benefit for their full rent for 13 weeks. Under the UC this will be removed. &#xa0;

[[[5.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Housing benefit is subject to a number of regulations that limit the amount that can be paid out. This frequently means that people eligible for housing benefit are not able to claim sufficient support to cover their actual rent. This is especially likely to affect private tenants as LHA rates are purposely set below “average” rents. &#xa0;

[[[5.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A comparison of median rents across Broad Rental Market Areas and LHA rates shows that a family renting a typical three bedroom home would have to make up more than £100 a month in over a quarter (27%) of local authority areas in England if the 13 week protection rule is abolished. In more than two in five (43%) of local authorities families will have a shortfall of more than £75 a month.&#xa0;

[[[5.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 13 week protection rule is intended to give people sufficient time to find work and resume paying their rent independently or, if their circumstances are unlikely to improve, make a planned move into cheaper accommodation. &#xa0;

[[[5.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The majority of people who lose their job will only experience a short-term spell of unemployment. Of the 325,000 unemployment claims that came to an end in June 2013, 53% of claimants were in receipt of JSA for 13 weeks or less. Shelter’s concern is that without an adequate safety net, people will be unable to bounce back and will be anxious about how they will pay their housing costs at a time when they should be focused on getting back into work. For some, inadequate support will tip them into arrears, eviction and homelessness.

[[[Discretionary Housing Payments]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Shelter is extremely concerned that Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) are being called upon inappropriately to support people with a predictable and clearly defined additional need, when statutory regulations would be better placed to avoid unintended consequences.&#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Concerns with DHPs:]]]

[[[They are discretionary]]] - People cannot guarantee they will receive support, even if their circumstances are those that Ministers had in mind when releasing additional funding.  

[[[They are short-term]]] – Although guidance does state that indefinite awards can be made if a claimant’s circumstances are unlikely to change, local authorities are wary of doing this as it makes it harder to budget. Where a shortfall is ongoing and predictable people shouldn’t have to go through repeated applications.

[[[They are cash-limited]]] – The allocation of DHP given to local councils is cash limited and insufficient to respond to everyone with a shortfall. The need to make the budget last throughout the year can also encourage local authorities not to publicise DHPs or to reject applications earlier in the year in case of a surge in demand later. Local authorities can top-up the DWP allocation by 1.5 times but are legally prohibited from spending anything beyond this. Moreover, many are unable to do so because of pressures on their budgets.  &#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the first three months of 2013 there was a sharp increase (of 60 per cent) in the number of DHP applications in local authorities in England from 31,562 (2011/12) to 50,393 (2012/13). In 2011/12 the average number of DHP applications per local authority was 274, it rose to 420 in 2012/13, and just in the first three months of 2013/14 an average of 294 DHP applications have been received per local authority. We therefore do not expect the historic trend of local authorities returning unspent DHP allocations to be repeated.&#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
