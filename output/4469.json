"&#xa0;\n                                          Written evidence submitted by Special Olympics &#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroductionSpecial Olympics\n \nbring\ns\n together more than 4.2 million athletes with intellectual disabilities across 175 countries. Established in 1978, we provide year round training and competition opportunities for children and adults with intellectual disabilities in 33 different sports ev\nery single day. We don't just support athletes but their families too.\n \nWe \nrecognise\n the correlation between poverty and disabil\nity and the further impact that \nimpoverishment has on those already marginalised by disability.\n&#xa0;\nParticipating in sports \nhelps \npeo\nple with intellectual disabilities\n become more confident, active citizens and learn important physical and emotional life skill\ns. But the Special Oly\nmpics movement\n is about more than just sport – we run\n education, early intervention training and health \nscreening programmes to create more inclusive communities and improve \nthe \ngeneral health and wellbeing of our athletes.\nSpecial Olympics is helping foster a more inclusive society by highlighting ability over disability, allowing people with intellectual \ndisability to realise their potential whilst also breaking down inaccurate and negative perceptions about intellectual disability amongst the wider community.\n \nWe welcome this opportunity to submit evidence to the International Development Committee and wo\nuld be delighted to provide \nfurther, oral\n evidence to the inquiry. \nFor further information on the Special Olympics visit:  \nhttp://www.specialolympics.org/\n \nGiven the broad focus of this inquiry, \nwe\n have addr\nessed the following issues \nof specific interest \nwhere \nSpecial Olympics have real\n experience of delivering \neffective \nprogrammes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe adequacy of DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development, and whether it needs a disability strategyIt is \nthe \nSpecial \nOlympics\n’\n firm belief that DFID should develop a clear disability strategy – and one that explicitly seeks to address the challenges faced by \npeople \nwith intellectual disabilities across the world.  \n&#xa0;\nIndividuals with intellectual disabilities represent on\ne of the most marginalized and underserved groups in the world today.  Representing approximately 3% of the world’s population, individuals with intellectual disabilities are subjected to some of the most \nthe worst\n abuses and rights deprivation the world h\nas ever \nseen.  These individuals suffer the lowest child survival and education rates, and some of the highest abuse and health disparity rates in the world.  \n&#xa0;\nDespite global reporting on this epidemic from the World Health Organization’s \nWorld Report on \nDisability\n, UNICEF’s \n2013 State of the World’s Children \nReport\n, and the recent UN High Level Meeting on Disability and Development, development assistance and aid falls woefully short in providing direct support and investment in improving their social pro\ntection, education, access to health, employment\n –\n and\n \nmost importantly, their right to life.\n \nNowhere in the world has this epidemic come with\n more dire consequences for the \npopulation than in Africa.  \n&#xa0;\nDFID ha\ns\n traditionally led the world on disability-inclusive development. Recent initiatives\n – include the \nannouncement\n that all new DFID-funded schools will be accessible to disabled children, \nthe Department’s\n call\ns \nfor be\ntter global data on disability \nand an \nincreased emphasis on disabled people in future development targets\n –\n have\n \nall been welcome. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, DFID’s \ncurrent policy commitments on disability and development do not g\no far enough in addressing the strong\n link \nbetween disability and poverty\n. Remov\ning barriers to the participation of disabled \npeople in society \nshould be a cornerstone of DFID\n’\ns pol\nicies\n and development work.  \n1.3&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntegration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmes (for example in health, education, sanitation, livelihoods, and empowerment) and its humanitarian work.The \nSpecial Olympics\n’\n goal is to end the cycle of poverty and exclusion faced by people with intellectual disabilities.\n \n People with intellectual disabilities are \nregularly \nexcluded from government\n-\nrun disability programmes \nwhich more often focus\n on physical disabilities. \nWe believe that DFID should fully integrate disability issues – particularly those associated with intellectual disabilities – into all its sector programmes. \nEvidence of \nthe effec\nt of poverty on people with intellectual disabilities across \nthe \ndifferent \nDFID sector\n programmes \nincludes:\nEducation:&#xa0;HealthcareEmploymentCommunity and political participationOur work\n in the areas of inclusive sports, global health, early childhood development, family support and youth activation \ncould support DFID’s development work throughout Africa \nand\n serve as ‘bes\nt practice’ that DFID can offer to additional assistance program\nme\ns.  \n1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effectiveness of DFID’s approach to rehabilitation and service provision for disabled people.DFID has been a leading development stakeholder in driving critical support for people \nwith disabilities across many parts of the world.  As part of a renewed disa\nbility and development approach – and one that focuses on \nrehabi\nlitation and service provision – \nDFID\n \nstands to make one of the largest and most sustained impact of any foreign aid\n.  \n&#xa0;\nFor people with intellectual disabilities, the \n‘s\nervice\n provision’ \naspect of DFID’s programme \n is of the highest importance.  \nAs already highlighted, people with intellectual disabilities (especially children)\n face some of the lowes\nt access rates of any marginalis\ned population subset in the world.  Education, health care, socia\nl protection, advocacy services and\n recreation still remain very much out of reach to this population.  In addition, most sectors, including education and heal\nth across developing nations, are in desperate need of disability health care training, special \nteachers\n, inclusive ed\nucation training, youth sensitis\nation campaigns, and much more to create a viable setting for true inclusive development that will benefit\n the groups most in need.  \n&#xa0;\nIn an effort to increase the effectiveness of service provision for people with intellectual disabilities, \nwe believe \nDFID \nshould\n integrate the population into mainstreamed initiatives, while also helping to create and resource\n important training opportunities for doctors, teachers, and government officials so that people with intellectual disabilities are \nfully integrated into society\n.\n1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe strength of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disability.Special Olympics have a wealth of evidence demonstrating the impact that development programmes can have on people with intellectual disabilities. \nA\n particularly successful programme has focused on health screening. \n200 million\n people with intellectual disabilities are denied access to quality health services\n and we have been working through the \nHealthy \nAthletes \nprogramme to offer participants free \nhealth screenings, education, and\n referrals for follow-up care\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nSpecial Olympi\ncs believe that every person with an intellectual disability and their family should be provided with the information and support to understand what they need to do in order to optimize their health. In order for this to be achieved information, resources,\n systems and policies must exist at an individual, community and national level to support individuals and their families to realise healthy and productive lives. \nIn Africa, over 27,000 free health screenings have been provided by Special Olympics between\n 2007-2013. This has allowed basic access to health care for \nover 18,500 Special Olympics athletes \nin 33 countries\n.\nThe results of these screenings illustrate\ns\n the value of this care and highlight the striking disparity of access to healthcare for people w\nith \ni\nntellectual disability living in the developing world compared to their global counterparts.\n&#xa0;\n For example, in Africa \n72.5% of athletes screened by Special Olympics to date had never had an eye exam\n before, compared to 23.5% of Special Olympics athlete\ns globally.\nThrough a system of community partnership\n,\n Special Olympics aims to develop a network of local community health providers \n[\nin each country we work in\n]\n that are engaged with the Special Olympics’ health work and committed to providing ongoing health resources and services to people with intellectual disability and their families. Through this network\n,\n we aim to ensure that all athletes remain engaged wit\nh the health system throughout their lives. \nOver the next three years Special Olympic\ns will be piloting the Healthy C\nommunities programme in the following countries: Peru, Mexico, South Africa, Malawi, Romania, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, and within t\nhe U.S. in Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas, New York, New Jersey, and Florida.\nThe Healthy Communities programme aims to\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRaise awareness around the issue of health disparities facing people with intellectual disability worldwide; \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFoster increased international\n development cooperation focused on delivering care to this marginalized population, and;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUltimately create communities where Special Olympics athletes and others with intellectual disability have the same access to health and wellness resources – and can \nattain the same level of good health – as all community members.\n&#xa0;\n \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
