"&#xa0;\nCabinet Office – Supplementary written evidence&#xa0;\nP\nolicy briefing \non the Deregulation Bill\n&#xa0;\nClause 1: Health and Safety at Work: general duty of self-employed persons &#xa0;Self-employed persons who do not pose a potential risk of harm to others, except where they work in specified prescribed sectors would be exempt from health and safety law. The intention is that the new Section 3(2) would enter into force by way of a Commencement Order so that consequential amendments to cross cutting Regulations\n&#xa0;\nand the SI prescribing sectors can come into force simultaneously.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2011, the Government commissioned a review of health and safety legislation by Professor Löfstedt, Director of the King’s Centre for Risk Management at King’s College London. This report made a number of recommendations including exempting from health and safety regulation those self-employed in low risk activities, whose work activities pose no potential risk of harm to others. The Government accepted this recommendation.\nThe main benefit Professor \nLöfstedt\n identified from the exemption was that it will help reduce the \nperception\n that health and safety law is inappropriately applied. \nThe Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (“the 1974 Act”) currently imposes a general duty on self-employed people to conduct their undertaking in a way that they and other persons affected by it are not exposed to risks to their health or safety, so far as is reasonably practicable (section 3(2)). EU legislation does not generally apply to the self-employed, and the approach by other member states varies, with some countries choosing not to apply health and safety law to the self-employed, whilst several apply the law to the self-employed only where activities are considered particularly hazardous or if they present risks to others. Professor L\nöfstedt’s proposal will bring the UK\n more in line with other EU member states.\n&#xa0;\nThis proposal will require an amendment to Section 3(2) of the 1974 Act to limit the scope of the general duty to those self-employed persons who pose a risk of harm to others, or who work in a prescribed industry or activity.\n&#xa0;\nSecondary health and safety legislation places duties on those who create risks and are best placed to control them whether as “employers,” “employees”, “self-employed persons” or “persons in control.”  Consequential amendments will be required to some health and safety cross-cutting regulations.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government is seeking a delegated power for the Secretary of State to maintain existing safeguards and protections under section 3(2) of the 1974 Act for those self-employed who conduct their work in high hazard or high risk industries or activities.  The separate regulation-making power to prescribe these industries or activities will give an assurance that those self-employed persons working in high hazard industries or undertaking high risk activities will not be exempt from health and safety law. \nGuidance will be required to clarify the extent of the exemption.  A self-employed section will be introduced to the HSE website to host the new guidance.  This will include: illustrative case studies and a set of key questions and answers to help individuals determine whether or not they need to comply with health and safety law. The guidance will be available online only.\n&#xa0;\nIt is estimated that this proposal will exempt approximately 800,000 people from the law.  It is projected that the change will save businesses a net £300,000 a year.  The savings will come from existing businesses not having to keep up-to-date with health and safety requirements, and from individuals setting up new businesses.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPrimary legislation is \nconsidered to be the most appropriate mechanism for delivering this change.\n&#xa0;A 12 week consultation ran from 2 August 2012 to 28 October 2012. 176 responses were received to the consultation from a wide range of stakeholders including trade unions, trade associations, industry and health and safety professionals. There was no clear consensus of opinion from respondents as to which option was preferred. 74 respondents (43%) agreed that the preferred option (option 2) was the best way to implement the recommendation. However, a significant number (of the 176 respondents expressing some view) preferred no change to the law.\n&#xa0;The matter is reserved in relation to Scotland and not transferred in relation to Wales. Neither of these Devolved Administrations have expressed any concerns with this proposal.\nNorthern Ireland may seek a Legislative Consent Motion (LCM) for corresponding changes to be made to their national legislation.\n&#xa0;\nThe proposed amendment is not intended to diminish the health, safety or welfare of those persons who currently enjoy the protection of section 3(2) of the 1974 Act.  Its aim is to help reduce the \nperception\n that health and safety law is inappropriately applied.\n&#xa0;\nSeveral responses to the public consultation raised concerns about the impact of the changes on vulnerable self-employed workers, particularly migrant workers in construction and agriculture. HSE will ensure that information and guidance produced about the changes to the law is linked to existing HSE information streams for self-employed migrant workers. \n&#xa0;\nClause 2: Removal of employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations&#xa0;This provision seeks to remove the power for employment tribunals to make wider recommendations to employers who have lost a discrimination case.\n&#xa0;\nThe wider recommendations provisions in the Equality Act 2010 were seen by the previous Government as a ‘light touch’ tool to help employers learn from their mistakes and take the necessary steps to avoid claims being subsequently brought against them.  However, employers are concerned that the provisions enable tribunals to go too far in interfering with their business.  \n&#xa0;\nRepeal of this measure, subject to consultation, was announced as part of the Red Tape Challenge equalities package on 15 May 2012.  All business representative organisations who responded to the subsequent consultation supported the repeal.  They considered that the wider recommendation making power under subsection 124(3)(b) of the Equality Act 2010 adds little to existing powers available to employment tribunals.  They also stated that employers will often make changes to their policies and practices of their own accord due to a tribunal finding without the need for a wider recommendation by a tribunal, to avoid a similar claim being made against them in the future.  The other responses did not provide any compelling argument or evidence to support its retention.  The Government subsequently announced its intention to go ahead with this repeal.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Government\n consider that, as wider recommendations are, in practice, discretionary on employers, those who are unlikely to make any changes of their own accord following a tribunal finding are unlikely to act on a wider recommendation either.  We believe that wider recommendations provisions add little value to the powers tribunals already have where an employer has lost a discrimination case.   \n&#xa0;\nThe Government\n consider that there are better ways to achieve the aim of the provision’s original intention (i.e. to help employers comply with anti-discrimination law) that are less burdensome than a statutory provision).\n&#xa0;\nThe Government considers that \na better approach is through the practical non-legislative measures\n which it \n proposed in May 2012 as part of the Red Tape Challenge equalities package announcement, to support industry-led programmes to promote a better understanding amongst employers of what equality legislation requires.  For instance, local chambers of commerce across England delivered a series of workshops from Autumn 2012 to Spring 2013 set up by the Government Equalities Office with the British Chambers of Commerce to improve small business understanding of compliance on equality legislation.\n&#xa0;\nThe impact of the change is that legislation will be brought in to line with what is happening in practice. Records show that, since the wider recommendation power came into force in 2010, a total of 19 successful discrimination cases have been ordered with wider recommendations as part of the remedy.  The most common wider action order was for staff training (15 cases), either on equality and diversity generally or more specifically on, for example, harassment or disciplinary and grievance procedures.    \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe wider recommendation provision power is unnecessary given that the types of recommendations made are usually straightforward, co\nmmon sense type actions.  In the Government’s\n view, employers who lose a discrimination case often take such actions themselves in the interest of avoiding similar cases being brought against them in the future, and those employers who are unlikely to take such remedial action are unlikely to adhere to a wider recommendation, as it is not legally enforceable.\n&#xa0;\nEquality Act 2010: consultation on repeal of two enforcement provisions in May 2012\n&#xa0;\nThe repeal will apply to England, Scotland and Wales.\n  The Equality Act 2010 does not extend (save for some limited provisions which do not apply here) to Northern Ireland.\n&#xa0;\nClauses 12-18: Rights of Way &#xa0;To simplify and streamline the processes for recording and making changes to the public rights of way network.\n&#xa0;\nBackground and the Stakeholder Working Group\nThe Natural Environment White Paper 2011 commits the Government to consulting “\non simplifying and streamlining the processes for recording and making changes to public rights of way, based on proposals made by Natural England’s Working Group on unrecorded rights of way\n”.\n&#xa0;\nThe 1949 National Parks &amp; Access to the Countryside Act introduced the definitive map and statement of public rights of way. The aim was for local authorities to create a legal record of all public rights of way to ensure that they were not “lost forever”. But despite several subsequent attempts to improve the legislative framework the definitive map and statement remains far from complete.\n&#xa0;\nThe Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 introduced a cut off date, whereby after 25 years (i.e. in 2026) all rights of way already in existence in 1949 and not recorded on the definitive map by 2026 would be extinguished. The intention was that this would both remove uncertainty for landowners, and provide an incentive to complete the definitive map.\n&#xa0;\nIt has become evident that the 2026 cut-off date proposal did not take account of the following obstacles.\n&#xa0;\nDefra now recognise\ns that\n the completion of the definitive map by 2026 under current arrangements is not feasible and that, if the definitive map is to be completed by 2026, a new approach is needed. Defra endorsed Natural England’s proposal to work to develop a consensus among stakeholders about the best way forward, through an independently-chaired Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) on unrecorded rights of way.\n&#xa0;\nIn March 2010 the Stakeholder Working Group published a report, entitled ‘Stepping Forward’ containing a package of 32 proposals aiming at improving the processes for identifying and recording historical public rights of way.\n The Working Group’s package as a whole was deregulatory. It has agreement across the full range of interests in rights of way.\n&#xa0;\nDefra has\n recognised that some of these proposals need legislation and so they now wishes to adopt most of those into the \nDeregulation \nBill, except the proposal that: “regulations should be made to ensure close monitoring of surveying authority performance in preparing for the cut off”. Defra feel that this would impose an additional reporting burden on local authorities, contrary to the current Government policy of removing central reporting requirements.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government agreed to take forward most of the Stakeholder Working Group proposals administratively and legislatively, but also set out proposals for two key areas not within scope of the Working Group’s terms of reference. The consultation queried: whether similar improvements should be applied to procedures for extinguishing or diverting rights of way and for creating new ones; looking at how it could be made easier for landowners to progress proposals for the diversion or \nextinguishment of rights of way crossing their land (the landowners’ ‘right to apply’), these are now reflected in clauses 15 and 17 in the\n draft\n Bill.\n&#xa0;\nClause 15: Making similar improvements to procedures for extinguishing or diverting rights of way \nThe Stakeholder Working Group’s recommendations seek to simplify and streamline the processes for recording existing public rights of way. Given that these recommendations are intended to make the processes work more effectively and to bring about efficiency and cost savings, a logical extension of this initiative would be to apply comparable changes to the legal and policy framework governing the creation, extinguishment and diversion of public rights of way, collectively known as ‘public path orders’. The Bill will amend the (yet to be implemented) provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 by a) extending the right to apply provisions to land uses to other land uses not covered by the 2000 Act and b) giving the SoS discretion not to make and order on appeal\n&#xa0;\nClause 17: Landowners right to apply\nAt present landowners find it difficult to apply for diversions or extinguishments for rights of way on their land, even where there are good grounds for doing so. \nThe objective of this policy is to develop and implement an effective mechanism which provides landowners with a service which will benefit them by enabling them to apply for diversions and extinguishments to the rights of way on their land, while minimising the impact on public expenditure. Clause 17 will also amend the ‘right to apply’ provisions in the 2000 Act by dis-applying the provision for a prescribed charge, in order to enable Local Authorities (and Secretary of State) to instead recover the actual costs incurred.\n&#xa0;\nThe package of primary legislation contains measures to: protect useful rights of way from extinguishment; give local authorities more scope to use their judgement in dealing with insubstantial or irrelevant applications and objections; enable negotiated solutions; make procedures more streamlined, flexible and light-touch. \nThe provisions fit broadly with the Government’s aim of reducing regulation, of smaller government and of giving more power to local authorities and local people to develop solutions.\n&#xa0;\nOnce the necessary changes to the primary legislation have been made, the rest of the reforms package will be put in place, with a view to commencing all the provisions at the same time. Through secondary legislation, we will then implement the 2026 ‘cut-off’ date, the protection for useful or potentially useful rights of way from extinguishment and Natural England to be one of the prescribed consultees for orders.\n \nThe remaining proposals will be implemented administratively, e.g. by guidance \n&#xa0;Natural England Working Group proposals on unrecorded rights of way as agreed, in principle,  by Government.\nThe impact assessment shows a positive net present value (i.e. the benefits outweigh the costs) of £19.3m with the quantified benefits arising from savings to both central government and local authorities from streamlined processes. For example a reduction in the number of cases going to the Secretary of State on appeal and a reduction in costs from no longer having to pay for newspaper adverts. The main cost is from developing guidance and a shift in burdens to the courts (although this has not yet been quantified). There will also be benefits arising from savings to landowners and any users involved in the processing of right of way orders.\n&#xa0;\nThe landowners’ ‘right to apply’ \nThe monetised costs set out in the Impact Assessment are the costs to landowners of applying for an order. In addition there are the costs to the local authority, including the cost where local authorities have to submit opposed orders or modified orders to the Secretary of State and costs to the Secretary of State of dealing with appeals and opposed orders. There are also costs to statutory undertakers and highway authorities from considering additional applications and costs to parish council and local amenity groups of having to respond to additional consultations. The summarised costs are £80m.\nIt is proposed that these costs should be recovered from landowners in full, in cases where the benefit is only to the landowner. The quantified benefits are the benefits to landowners of the changes to rights \nof way they should receive should their application be successful. It is assumed that the benefit to applicants is at least equal to the costs as otherwise they would not pay for the application.\n&#xa0;\n3 month consultation carried out in May 2012. The responses to the consultation broadly endorsed these proposals.  This consultation, however, did not cover Clause 14, which was \nadded on the advice of Lawyers \n&#xa0;None.\n&#xa0;\nAll public rights of way matters involve both public and private rights and rights of way procedures are designed to resolve disputes where those rights come into conflict. The proposals strike a fair balance across the rights of all of those involved and therefore also adequately address human rights.  The Group believe that equality issues are taken into account, insofar. As they seek to comply with the principle of the least restrictive option in the provision of public access.\n&#xa0;\nPublic rights of way provide a remarkable network of 190,000 km of traffic-free routes connecting from town, city and village centres right out into and through the countryside. As such, they help people to engage positively with the natural and the farmed environment, and promote healthier lifestyles. There is considerable evidence that walking and other active means of travel improve health and well-being.\n&#xa0;\nThe rights of way provisions have no identifiable impacts on: employment law, skills and the labour market; the environment, particularly in the management of waste; the provision of education; or the effective administration of justice.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 20: Reduction of qualifying period for right to buy &#xa0;This clause will amend section 119 of the Housing Act 1985 (the Act) to reduce the qualifying period for Right to Buy (and, therefore, Right to Acquire) from five years to three years. Part V of the Act enables secure tenants of a local authority, and \nassured tenants of housing associations who transferred with their homes from a local authority as part of a stock transfer (Preserved Right to Buy),\n to exercise the Right to Buy their home provided they meet the eligibility criteria set out in the Act. \n&#xa0;\nSome tenants of housing associations who do not have the Preserved Right to Buy may have the right to buy their home from their landlord, providing the housing was acquired using public funding. This is known as the Right to Acquire. Under section 180(1) of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, a tenant of a dwelling in England has the Right to Acquire where the tenant meets the criteria set out, including that the tenant must satisfy any qualifying conditions in Part V of the Act (the Right to Buy provisions). Therefore, any amendment to the qualifying period for the Right to Buy will also apply to tenants with the Right to Acquire.\n&#xa0;\nThe measures do not change the discounts available to tenants under the Right to Buy.  Tenants with three years qualifying period will be entitled to the initial discounts set out in section 129(2) of the Act - of 35% for houses and 50% for flats. The increase in the discount, 1% for house and 2% for flats, for each complete year of the qualification period, will apply only when the qualifying period exceeds five years.  \n&#xa0;Until recently, Right to Buy sales had been in long term decline. Sales have subsequently been reinvigorated as a result of a more generous maximum cash discount for social tenants from April 2012 (£75k across England), and a further increase (to £100k) for social tenants in London in March 2013. The Government is concerned, however, that tenants are being forced to wait an excessively long period before becoming eligible for the Right to Buy, which is contrary to the requirements in force when the policy first came into effect\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nReducing the qualifying period for the right to buy will enable more social tenants to meet their home ownership aspirations sooner, support social mobility and will help create and sustain mixed communities. Housing need remains high and building replacement homes for affordable rent from the additional receipts will help us to meet this need. The replacement programme will help support the sector &amp; support economic growth.\n&#xa0;\nThe Right to Buy clauses in this Bill amend section 119 of the 1985 Act to reduce the qualifying period from five years to three years.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government has\n published a full Impact Assessment which sets out the benefits/impact of reducing the Right to Buy eligibility criteria from five to three years.\n&#xa0;\nIn summary, \nthe Government’s \nproposed change will extend the Right to Buy and Preserved Right to Buy to approximately 275,000 tenants as well as a significant number of Right to Acquire tenants.  This will enable increased homeownership among social tenants, but at the same time ensure sufficient sales receipts to enable one for one replacement of every additional Right to Buy unit that is sold.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government\n forecast\ns\n that the proposed change will lead to an additional 2,750 Right to Buy sales in 2014-15, 3,500 in 2015-16 and 4,250 in 2016-17. \n&#xa0;\nWhilst there has been no formal consultation \nthe government has \ninvited key partners to discuss our proposals in further detail. These include the Local Government Association (LGA), London Councils, Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Building Societies Association (BSA) and the National Housing Federation. \n&#xa0;\nWhilst there have been no previous attempts to make this specific reform, our proposals for a three year qualifying period would revert the qualifying period for the Right to Buy scheme back to the requirements when the Right to Buy was first introduced in 1980\n \n&#xa0;\nThere are no consequences for the Devolved Administrations in making this change. Right to Buy is a devolved policy and therefore \nthe\n proposed changes apply to England only \n&#xa0;\nChanging \n the Right to Buy eligibility period will not have an adverse impact on any tenants affected by the policy. All tenants who are currently eligible through Right to Buy or Right to Acquire will still be eligible, and some may even be able to exercise their rights sooner. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Clause 31: Abolition of office of Chief Executive Skills Funding&#xa0;Removing the post of Chief Executive of Skills Funding from statute to replace it with a non-statutory position. \n&#xa0;\nThis move follows a review into the status of the Chief Executive and the Skills Funding Agency, and will move the Skills Funding Agency to a conventional executive agency, by enabling it to operate through the powers of the Secretary of State rather than through those of a separate statutory post holder (the Chief Executive of Skills Funding).   \n&#xa0;\nThe change is consistent with the Government’s commitment to improve the transparency and accountability of all public services.  The reform will clarify the legal framework by removing the separate statutory post of Chief Executive, and transferring all relevant powers and duties to the Secretary of State, so that in future there will only be one person with legal responsibilities in this area.  This will ensure that roles and accountability are clearer and more transparent, and reduce the associated delivery and financial risks \n&#xa0;\nThe measure consists of the removal of the statutory post of Chief Executive of Skills Funding and transfer of the majority of the chief Executive’s powers and duties to the Secretary of State, with suitable modification.  This includes the transfer of the Chief Executive’s powers to secure and fund education and training for people aged 19 or over, and apprenticeship training for people aged 16 and over, as well as duties around funding eligibility.  \n&#xa0;\nThis will clarify the legal framework, by moving from the current position of having two separate legal entities each with their own powers and duties relating to the provision of vocational education and skills.  Putting all the powers and duties under a single legal entity (the Secretary of State) will overcome the existing ambiguity around respective roles, making it clear where legal responsibility sits and strengthening the associated accountability arrangements.\n&#xa0;There are no cost implications, but the change will be expected to reduce financial risk and the administrative burden on Government by clarifying respective roles and creating a clearer and more streamlined governance and accountability framework for the Agency.  \n&#xa0;\nA review of the status of the Chief Executive and the Agency was conducted in Autumn 2011\n including consultation with key stakeholders &amp; representative bodies. The outcome of the review was announced in December 2011.\n&#xa0;These changes relate to England only, although the Chief Executive currently has powers to assist in arrangements made by the Secretary of State, Welsh or Scottish Ministers, or the Dept for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland for helping people to select, train for, obtain and retain employment.  These arrangements will continue under the new arrangements, but we do not believe that the Secretary of State will need a specific power to engage in such arrangements.\n&#xa0;\nClause 32: Further and Higher education sectors: reduction of burdens&#xa0;This is a package of measures aimed at repealing or amending various provisions of legislation which \nthe Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (\nBIS\n)\n considers either obsolete or an unnecessary burden on the Further Education (FE) sector \n&#xa0;\nIn the Government’s vision for the FE and skills sector colleges and providers are freed from unnecessary regulation and are able to respond to the needs of their local communities.  The Education Act 2011 removed or transferred various powers held by the Secretary of State in relation to FE corporations and sixth form college corporations.   \n&#xa0;\nBIS has subsequently undertaken a comprehensive review of all FE legislation and identified further provisions which are considered to be obsolete or an unnecessary burden on the FE sector.  The changes will ensure a consistent approach for all categories of institution within the FE sector, while ensuring safeguards remain in place to ensure standards and quality within FE.  \n&#xa0;\nThe specific measures are to: \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrepeal the SoS’s powers to regulate qualification requirements for FE teaching staff and principals (s136(a) &amp; (b), 137 and 138 of the Education Act 2002);\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrepeal the SoS’s powers in relation to the governance of designated institutions conducted by companies (s 31 of the Further &amp; Higher Education Act 1992);\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrepeal the SoS’s power to set the minimum interest rate on loans made by local authorities to certain types of educational institutions (s3 of the Further Education Act 1985);\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrepeal the SoS’s power to convert unilaterally a sixth form college corporation into an FE corporation where the SoS is no longer satisfied that it is appropriate for the body to be a sixth form corporation (s33D(2)(b) &amp; (4) of the Further &amp; Higher Education Act 1992);\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrepeal time-limited provisions concerning the transfer of property, etc, to FE corporations, designated institutions and sixth form colleges (s23 to 26, s32,33,34 to 36, 38, 58 &amp; Schedule 5 of the Further &amp; Higher Education Act 1992); and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrepeal/amend the SoS’s powers in relation to local authority maintained institutions (s61(2) &amp; (3) and 62 of the Education (No.2) Act 1986; s158 &amp; 159 &amp; s219 of the Education Reform Act 1988 &amp; s56A of the Further &amp; Higher Education Act 1992  \n&#xa0;\nThe FE sector will benefit from consistency and the removal of unnecessary controls. \n&#xa0;\nThe majority of the changes are minor and would have a limited impact because the legislation is either: (i) obsolete, (ii) time-limited and the time limit has been reached or (iii) potentially places inappropriate controls or restrictions on colleges and providers.\n&#xa0;\nThe revocation of the 2007 Further Education Workforce regulations (following recommendations from the Lingfield review) has removed various requirements in respect of teaching\n&#xa0;\nstaff and principals at further education institutions. The final stage of removing these powers is to repeal the primary legislation that enabled these regulations to be laid (repeals to sections 136-138 of the Education Act 2002). This will ensure the 341 further education colleges in England, their Principals and their teaching staff (82,040 according to the LSIS 2011/12 Workforce Survey) are not placed under further legislation. The Education &amp; Training Foundation has recently been created to promote a sector-led raising of teaching standards in the sector.\n&#xa0;\nMeetings have been held with the Association of Colleges, Local Government Association and National Union of Students to outline the proposals. Information was also sent to 157 Group, the Sixth Form Colleges Forum and Centre for Educational Sociology for comment. The sector is broadly supportive of measures to deregulate the sector and the impact of these proposals was considered to be minor.\n&#xa0;\nWith regard to the first measure cited above at paragraph 3, an independent review conducted by Lord Lingfield (final report published in October 2012) concluded that the regulations made under this power were no longer fit for purpose and should be revoked. The Government consulted in April 2012 on this recommendation to revoke the regulations and published the response in August 2012. \n&#xa0;\nThe Education Act 2011 represented the government’s main attempts to deregulate the FE sector under the stated aim of providing 'freedoms and flexibilities' to institutions. These proposals follow the same direction (and are minor in extent).\n &#xa0;Education, including FE, has been devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost all of the provisions \nthe Government is\n seeking to repeal or amend apply to both England and Wales (the exception is section 33D of the FHEA 1992 which applies to England only).   We have consulted with Welsh Government officials who have indicated that the Welsh Government would like most of the repeals/amendments to apply to Wales.  For these we will require a legislation consent motion in due course.\n&#xa0;Clause 33: Schools: reduction of burdens&#xa0;This is a package of measures to reduce burdens on schools consisting of:&#xa0;Responsibility for discipline\nHome School Agreements\nDetermining School terms \nStaffing Matters\nPublication of reports\n&#xa0;\nResponsibility for discipline&#xa0;The clause removes the requirement for governing bodies in England to make and review a written statement of general principles to which the head teacher is to have regard, when determining the behaviour policy under section 89(1) of the Education and Inspections Act (EIA) 2006.\n The amendment ensures that the governing body instruct the head teacher to determine a behaviour policy.  The amendment also means that governing bodies in England will no longer be required to consult staff, parents and pupils in relation to the behaviour policy.\n&#xa0;\nThis Government is committed to reducing unnecessary bureaucratic requirements, particularly those which affect schools, by removing the statutory burdens that are placed on them, and by minimising the amount of guidance to which they must have regard.\n&#xa0;\nDiscussions with governor representative bodies reveal that there is little awareness among governors of the specific requirement to produce a written statement. Instead governing bodies see it as their responsibility to determine the school’s behaviour policy when in fact the duty to determine the behaviour policy is with the head teacher. \n&#xa0;\nOfficials surveyed around 120 school websites over the summer of 2012. Rather than have a document described as a ‘\nstatement of behaviour principles’\n, most of the sites looked at had a \n‘code of conduct’\n which set out the expected standards of behaviour and in some cases the sanctions for breaches of the code. A number of the websites included a statement on the school’s ethos, usually in the school prospectus. These sometimes referred to standards of behaviour. This suggests that schools interpret this duty in a variety of ways.\n&#xa0;\nThe changes \nthe Government\n are proposing will remove the requirement to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State (section 88(4) of the Education Act 2006) so we will withdraw the current “\nBehaviour and discipline in schools – guidance for governing bodies\n”.  While we do not intend to issue new advice or guidance specifically to governors on this issue we will amend the Department’s general behaviour advice to schools to reflect these changes.   \n&#xa0;\nThe Government\n believe\ns\n this legislative change ensures that the process for drawing up the behaviour policy is as streamlined and sensible as possible; it will help to clarify the roles and responsibilities of governing bodies and head teachers, and bring all schools more in line with what \nthe Government\n believe\ns\n to be current practice in schools. The legislative change, however, will not prevent the governing body from continuing to influence the behaviour policy.\n&#xa0;The proposed legislative changes were raised at a meeting of the Advisory Group on Governance (AGOG) on 14 March. A paper explaining the changes in more detail was circulated following the meeting and the Group was invited to comment. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNone. Sections 88 and 89 of the EIA 2006 apply to England and Wales. The clause preserves the current position for Wales and the amendments apply to England only.\n&#xa0;\nThis amendment will mean that there will no longer be a power for the Secretary of State to direct a governing body (GB) (under section 496/7 of the Education Act 1996) to instruct the head teacher to amend the specific contents of the behaviour policy. We do not envisage that this will be a significant problem as the Secretary of State has not used the section 496/7 power for this purpose. The Secretary of State will have the power to direct a GB to ensure that the head teacher determines the behaviour policy in accordance with section 89(1) of the EIA 2006, but will have no direct power to influence its specific contents. \n&#xa0;\nSection 88 of the EIA 2006 applies to maintained schools, PRUs and non-maintained special schools only. Academies do not have to produce a written statement of principles, so removing this requirement on other schools will bring maintained schools, PRUs and non-maintained special schools more in line with Academies.\n&#xa0;\nHome School Agreements&#xa0;Remove the duty on school governing bodies to adopt a Home-School Agreement (HSA)\n&#xa0;The government is committed to reducing unnecessary bureaucratic requirements, particularly those affecting schools, by removing the statutory burdens which are placed on them, and by minimising the amount of guidance to which they must have regard.\n&#xa0;\nCurrently parents are not required to sign the HSAs and there are no associated sanctions for failing to comply with them. This lack of any enforcement powers is perceived as a significant weakness by some schools and parents. While many schools may use HSAs effectively, research (DCSF 2008) has shown that two in five parents had not heard of a HSA and only 39% said they had signed one.\n&#xa0;\nSchools can still use HSAs if they choose, without this duty. Furthermore the legislation dictates a prescriptive process that imposes significant administrative burdens on schools. \n&#xa0;\nTo repeal sections 110 and 111 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, to remove the duty on school governing bodies to adopt a HSAs. \n&#xa0;The duty to produce a HSA places a burden on schools without giving schools additional powers. Schools could choose to continue to have HSAs or to develop more creative approaches to engage parents once freed from the legal duty. Schools are currently required to review their HSA and manage the process of getting them signed by parents, a process which many find burdensome.\n&#xa0;This measure is part of a wider government initiative of deregulation which has been welcomed by schools so we did not have a specific consultation. However there is research to suggest that the HSAs are not necessarily used or effective. Research from the DCSF in 2008 found that two in five parents had not heard of a HSA and only 39% said they had signed one. A 2003 evaluation of the HSAs found that only 30% of schools thought they had a positive impact on parents and teachers working together. The research also suggested that parents can find HSAs patronising and, because they are not legally enforceable, of limited value. In addition informal soundings from head teachers unions and governing bodies indicate that they see little value in the HSAs.\n&#xa0;\nAll the provisions apply to England only. \n&#xa0;\nThe provisions of the SSFA 1998 placed a statutory obligation upon governing bodies of certain schools in England to adopt a HSA, together with a parental declaration. The parental declaration was intended to provide a record of a parent’s acknowledgment and acceptance of the four main specifications of the HSA, namely the school’s aims and values; the school’s responsibilities towards its pupils; the responsibilities of the pupil’s parents; and the school’s expectations of pupils.\n&#xa0;\nAttempts were made as part of the Children, Schools and Families Bill to link individualised HSAs with parenting orders and parenting contracts to give them greater force; however the provision was among those dropped during the wash-up period.\n&#xa0;\nDuring the passage of the Children, Schools and Families Bill, at the committee stage, Nick Gibb (the then Shadow Schools Minister) committed to making HSAs into a more properly enforceable contract to give them legal force. Accordingly, when the current Government came to power, HSAs were considered again, this time in the context of the Education Bill 2011. Ministers raised concerns that there were not sufficient safeguards in the provisions to prevent the powers being used incorrectly by schools and therefore the amendment was not included in the Bill. Shortly after this, Ministers decided that HSAs would remain a statutory requirement but with a reduction in the volume of guidance to which schools should have regard.  \n&#xa0;\nThe provisions are now being looked at as part of the Government’s reducing bureaucracy policy and Ministers have decided that the requirement on schools to adopt a HSA and parental declaration should be repealed.   \n&#xa0;To place a duty on community, voluntary controlled, community special schools, and maintained nursery schools to determine their own term and holiday dates (instead of the local authority). &#xa0;This clause moves all responsibility for determining term dates in community, voluntary controlled, community special schools, and maintained nursery schools from the local authority to the governing body. The effect of this deregulation will be to give head teachers and governing bodies more autonomy to decide how to organise their school year in the best interests of pupils, their parents, teachers and the local community. \n&#xa0;\nThe Government believes that the governing body and head teacher running the school, not local or national government are best placed to make decisions about the way education is organised in their school in the best interests of pupil attainment. \n&#xa0;\nAround 70 per cent of secondary and 30 per cent of primary schools already have responsibility for setting their own term dates. This includes all Academies and Free Schools, and other schools where the governing body is the employer of staff, such as foundation or voluntary-aided (church) schools.\n Some of these schools have made innovative changes in the interests of pupils and parents, and many have chosen not to make changes.\n&#xa0;\nFor community, voluntary controlled, community special schools, and maintained nursery schools, however, section 32 of the Education Act 2002 places the duty to set term dates on the local authority. This is a barrier to these schools taking their own decision about whether to make changes to their term dates.\n&#xa0;\nThe deregulation would bring all schools into the same position and create a level playing field. It would give these schools more autonomy with head teachers and governors able to decide the structure of their terms in the interests of pupils, their parents, teachers and the local community.\n&#xa0;\nThis means that decisions about whether, and how, to make any changes to term dates will be made by those best placed to decide what will support pupils’ education and to respond to local need and circumstances. \n&#xa0;The law currently requires the local authority to set term dates for community, voluntary controlled, community special schools, and maintained nursery schools. The governing body is responsible for determining the term dates of a foundation, voluntary-aided or foundation special school. The Education (School Day and School Year) Regulations 1999 require all maintained schools to be open for a minimum of 190 days (but they can open for more if they have the resources to do so). Academies and Free Schools are responsible for their own school year. \nThe measure places the duty to set term dates on to the governing body, bringing all schools into the same position. No further regulation or guidance is required. \nThe Government does \nnot\n currently provide any guidance to local authorities or schools about determining term dates and has no plans to do so. \nLocal authorities and schools are \nnot\n currently required to consult when determining the term and holiday dates. In practice, however, they do routinely consult with head teachers, governing bodies, schools and other parties when making changes to term dates. We would expect schools to continue this practice.\nWhile the local authority would no longer have a duty to set term dates for any school, this does not mean there would be no local co-ordination. Schools may wish to put local arrangements into place to avoid unintentional problems for parents and teachers with childcare arrangements.\nThe Government recognises that this will be a new role for these schools. We will, therefore, provide non-statutory advice for all schools, including: \nAny changes to term dates should be in the best interests of their pupils’ education and take into account the needs of parents and local circumstances.\n&#xa0;\nGoverning bodies should give adequate notice of any changes to term dates. \n&#xa0;\nGoverning bodies must act reasonably; considering the impact of decisions on those\naffected by them (including parents’ and teachers’ work commitments and childcare options).\n&#xa0;\nWhere appropriate, schools may consider co-ordinating their term dates with other local schools to avoid unintentional disruption to parents and teachers. \n&#xa0;\nThe benefit of this measure would be that those best placed to judge what is in the interest of pupils’ education and the local community would be able to decide whether to make any changes to their own school term dates. \nGoverning bodies of community, voluntary-controlled and community special schools, and maintained nursery schools would be placed under a new duty to set their own term dates. We estimate that around 13,488 governing bodies would be placed under the duty (based on January 2012 figures). \nAs a minimum, the duty requires the schools to decide on their term dates and consequentially to give parents and teachers notice of these dates each year. There will be a small cost associated with this duty from the time spent by governing bodies and staff determining the term dates. We anticipate, based on informal consultation with schools, that they will be able to decide their term dates without incurring any significant costs or burdens. We anticipate that the functions associated with this duty would be carried out by the schools existing staff and within their existing budgets.\nWhile all schools would be responsible for their own term dates, we estimate that only a small number will decide to make any changes to their existing school year. Around 70 per cent of secondary and 30 per cent of primary schools can already change their own term dates. We do not have official figures on the number of schools that have changed their term dates from the local norm. A survey by the Reform Education Trust (2012) suggested, however, suggested that around 11 per cent of Academies had done so.   \nThe Department for Education (the Department) informally sought the views of the head teachers on the Department’s Reducing Bureaucracy Reference Group, as well as others, between 15 January and 1 February 2013. The Department has also taken views from the local government association, the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, Association of School and College Leaders, National Association of Head Teachers, National Union of Teachers, Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the Family and Childcare Trust, Mumsnet, Netmums and the Federation of Small Businesses.\nThese discussions sought views on whether schools would welcome the freedom to set their own term dates; gauge the likely impact of the policy; and invite consultees to highlight any wider issues with the proposal that the Department may not have considered. There was broad support for the government’s proposals.\nThere has been no previous attempt to place the duty to set term dates on these schools. Academies, Free Schools and voluntary-aided schools, however, already have responsibility for their own term dates. These reforms have proved successful with several examples of schools making innovative changes in the interests of pupils and parents.\nThe existing legislation applies to England and Wales. We have received confirmation from the Department of Education and Skills (Wales) that Welsh Ministers do not wish our changes to section 32(1)(a) the Education Act 2002 to apply to Wales. We are working with lawyers in the Welsh Government to ensure our changes do not apply to Wales. \nStaffing Matters&#xa0;the repeal/removal of \ns35(8) and 36(8) of the Education Act 2002, which  provide  the \nSecretary of State with power to issue statutory guidance in respect of school staffing matters in maintained schools in England.\n&#xa0;\nThe above powers have been used to issue the current statutory ‘\nGuidance on managing staff employment in schools\n’.  As statutory guidance, school governing bodies and local authorities are required to have regard to its content when appointing, disciplining and dismissing staff in maintained schools in England.  However, the guidance simply restates the statutory obligations set out in the Education School Staffing (England) Regulations 2009 (“the School Staffing Regulations”).  This means that its content and statutory status adds no value to the Regulations themselves and is, therefore, superfluous.\n&#xa0;\nA review of the School Staffing Regulations during late 2013 and early 2014, will \nstreamline and simplify the regulatory staffing provisions and remove references to duplicated requirements that appear elsewhere in mainstream employment legislation.  \n&#xa0;\nWe intend to produce complementary non-statutory advice for schools and local authorities that clearly signposts them to relevant information that is produced outside of the department specifically for employers and employees e.g. ACAS publications.  This revised style and content would not warrant a ‘statutory guidance’ classification. \n&#xa0;\nA key element of the Government’s education policy is to review and remove unnecessary bureaucracy in schools and in doing so to promote increased autonomy.  As academies and free schools are not required to ‘have regard to’ statutory guidance on staffing matters, this repeal provides maintained schools with similar freedoms in respect of staffing matters.  Ministers have indicated they consider there is no place for any future statutory guidance in respect of staffing matters in maintained schools and, therefore, have no need to retain the powers provided by s35(8) and 36(8).\n&#xa0;\nThe Bill clause will remove the two relevant clauses.  No further legislative provisions will be required.\n&#xa0;\nThe provisions will remove the need for local authorities and school governing bodies of maintained schools to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State.\n This change will not impact on business.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSection 35 and 36 apply to England and Wales.  The repeal is in relation  to maintained schools in England only.  S35(8) and 36(8) will continue to provide the National Assembly for Wales with powers to issue statutory guidance for maintained schools in Wales.\n&#xa0;\nPublication of reports&#xa0;As part of the Government’s drive to reduce bureaucracy, Ministers have decided to \nremove the requirement for governing bodies to make available to the public, provide copies on request and ensure that parents receive copies of section 5 inspection reports, section 48 religious inspection reports, interim assessment reports and copies of reports relating to investigation of complaints about schools.\n&#xa0;\nParents will receive notification of the overall outcome of section 5 and section 48 reports and will be able to request schools to provide a hard copy if they have no internet access. \n&#xa0;\nThese provisions are outlined in Schedule 14, paragraph 6 of the Bill.\n&#xa0;\nReducing bureaucracy and administrative cost. At present a school is required to print out copies of reports to every registered parent of every registered pupil as well as members of the public on request.\n&#xa0;\nIt will remove the current duties on schools to disseminate reports.\n&#xa0;\nRemoving these duties will reduce the administrative burden on schools by saving them the administrative task of having to print and distribute reports to parents. It will also reduce printing costs\n.&#xa0;The duty being repealed was in primary legislation. In addition at paragraph 6(5) of the Bill we are amending secondary legislation (\nthe School Information (England) Regulations 2008) \nwhich would normally be done through secondary legislation itself.\n&#xa0;\nThe reform extends to \nEngland only\n&#xa0;\nClauses 58 to 61: Exercise of regulatory functions&#xa0;The duty will ensure that those exercising specified regulatory functions have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth. The non-economic regulators who will be in scope of the duty have a combined budget of around £2bn.  The duty will empower those regulators, and others exercising specified regulatory functions, so that they can direct their resources to support economic growth.  \nThe growth duty is a process duty: it will not affect any regulators’ existing functions or obligations.  As many regulators are created and guided by statute, Government must legislate in order to enable them to play a full part in supporting a key agenda.  The duty will also ensure that regulators consider the necessity and proportionality of proposed enforcement action before making enforcement decisions.\nMinisters will set out in regulations both: to which regulators the duty will apply; and guidance on the performance of the duty.  Draft guidance will be published before the Bill is introduced to Parliament.\nThere are more than 50 non-economic regulators with a combined budget around £2 billion and 25,000 employees. This resource should be encouraging compliant businesses to grow through proportionate regulatory activity and provision of reliable advice, without compromising the protection of the public. \nThe growth duty obliges regulators, and others exercising regulatory functions, to consider the desirability of promoting economic growth when carrying out those functions, for example, when they design their policies and processes, when they interact with individual businesses and when they make decisions about the most appropriate regulatory approach to take. \nEvidence from the World Bank\n suggests that the regulatory framework can have a significant impact on businesses’ willingness to invest; and the Business Perceptions Survey 2012\n showed that businesses believe that regulation is impacting negatively on business growth, with fifty-five per cent citing regulation as an obstacle to their success.\nThe Focus on Enforcement initiative, which looks at industry experience of regulatory enforcement through a series of reviews, has shown that some non-economic regulators fail to consider the impact of their actions on growth and/or believe themselves unable to take sensible steps to assist businesses due to the limitations of their statutory framework.  Findings from the Post Implementation Review of the Regulators’ Compliance Code support this, showing that some regulators actually feel unable to consider growth, as it is not part of their statutory remit. \nThe growth duty will remove any uncertainty over whether regulators should consider growth, creating a statutory obligation for them to have regard to the economic consequences of their actions.  \nIt will focus regulators’ attention on ensuring that their actions are proportionate and they remove unnecessary burdens on business wherever they can. \nThe measure will provide non-economic regulators with a statutory obligation to consider the desirability of promoting economic growth in the exercise of their regulatory functions. \nThe Bill will give two order making powers to a Minister: (1) to specify the regulatory functions in scope of the growth duty; and (2) to issue guidance in relation to the exercise of the growth duty. \nThe statutory instruments carrying the guidance and the list of regulatory functions in scope will be introduced to Parliament once the bill has been enacted, subject to the affirmative procedure.\nThe Government has undertaken an initial impact assessment to identify the costs for regulators of implementing a growth duty and the benefits to society that the growth duty will deliver. Whilst costs and benefits are difficult to monetise, we will continue to build the evidence base and share this information with Parliament. \nThe current impact assessment found that a relatively modest saving to business of 0.3% of administrative costs would result in a positive net impact to society. \nThe growth duty is expected to generate significant benefits to businesses by:\nSo far, only a few regulators have felt able to provide details of anticipated costs of implementing the growth duty.  We will be working with regulators to develop guidance on how to respond to the growth duty. Regulators will be able to use this guidance to provide figures on the likely cost of implementing the growth duty and this additional information will be fed into the impact assessment as it is developed.\nA business survey has been commissioned to gather baseline data against which the impact of the growth duty will be measured.\nConsumers and individuals will benefit directly from growth. Moreover, the growth duty will encourage regulators to be more proportionate in their interactions with businesses that wish to comply. This may lead to a more targeted approach, with regulators able to focus resources on dealing with non-compliant businesses, thus improving consumer protections.\nWe do not think the measure could have been done with secondary legislation.  Efforts have been made through the statutory Regulators’ Compliance Code to reinforce the principle that those exercising regulatory functions should do so in a way that would allow and encourage economic progress. The evidence base from the Focus on Enforcement initiative and the Post Implementation Review of the Regulators’ Compliance Code, along with comments from regulators themselves, showed that this was insufficient to incentivise regulators to consider economic considerations when carrying out their regulatory functions because the Regulators’ Compliance Code only applies when determining any general policy or principles or when setting standards or giving guidance generally.  The duty to have regard to the Regulators’ Compliance Code is also subject to any requirement affecting the exercise of the regulatory function which means this guidance is trumped by all other statutory duties affecting regulators.  A duty in primary legislation is therefore required to put this requirement on the same playing field as other considerations which are relevant to regulatory decision making.\nA full consultation was carried out earlier this year, and the Government has since responded.  A wide range of views from a variety of stakeholders on the likely impact, benefits, risks and costs of the growth duty were presented in response to the consultation and reflected upon throughout the formulation of the Government response.\nBIS will also be consulting stakeholders through a series of workshops and meetings in October about draft guidance which will accompany the duty.\nResponse to questions 17-22 of the Committee’s Call for Evidence.&#xa0;\nTo what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary? In the past, efforts have been made through the statutory Regulators’ Compliance Code to reinforce the principle that those exercising regulatory functions should do so in a way that would allow and encourage economic progress. The evidence base from the Focus on Enforcement initiative and the Post Implementation Review of the Regulators’ Compliance Code, along with comments from regulators themselves, showed that this was insufficient to incentivise regulators to consider economic considerations when carrying out their regulatory functions, because the Regulators’ Compliance Code only applies when determining any general policy or principles or when setting standards or giving guidance generally.  \nThe duty to have regard to the Regulators’ Compliance Code is also subject to any requirement affecting the exercise of the regulatory function which means that it is trumped by all other statutory duties affecting regulators.  A duty in primary legislation is therefore required to put this requirement on the same playing field as other considerations which are relevant to regulatory decision making.\n&#xa0;\nWill the introduction of a duty to have regard to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator? No - the Government recognises the importance of preserving the independence of regulators and the addition of duty to have regard to growth will not compromise this.  The role of government is to determine the objectives for regulation and to create a framework which ensures regulation is consistent with those objectives.  The growth duty makes it clear that one of the objectives of effective regulation is to promote economic growth.  Regulators will still have decision making autonomy in exactly the same way they do now.\nIt is proposed that the guidance which will accompany the growth duty will be subject to the affirmative procedure so that, if there are concerns that it threatens the independence of regulators, this can be properly debated.  In addition the Government intends to produce draft guidance prior to the introduction of the Bill in Parliament so that this can be considered alongside the proposed clauses. \n&#xa0;\nHow is a duty to have regard to the desirability of economic growth likely to affect those regulators to which it is applied? Broadly, the duty will require regulators, and those exercising regulatory functions, to consider growth when carrying out all areas of regulatory activity. In practice, this will encourage regulators to alleviate burdens on business; be proportionate in their decision making, including in relation to their enforcement functions; and where possible provide tailored support to industry sectors, for example by making information and guidance more easily accessible to business. \nRegulatory bodies would be expected to take notice of the growth duty at Board-level and for this to filter through to operational policies and to interactions with individual businesses. In order to develop \nthe best guidance and support for industry, it is expected that regulators will actively engage with the businesses they regulate\n.  \nWhere is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences? Benefits for individual businesses will be seen in finding the most cost effective route to compliance quicker than they can now, or through more consistently proportionate decisions being made where there is a willingness to comply. The growth duty will stimulate the use of interventions to achieve compliance which may be more supportive of the growth of a business than traditional compliance and enforcement methods/sanctions.\nBenefits to individual businesses and to wider business sectors will be achieved through improved advice and guidance and, where possible, more proactive support for growth through for example regulators’ recognising where good business management practices match with a good grip on risks and compliance issues at key points in a business lifecycle. \nThe impact of the growth duty will be seen in areas where regulators have an element of discretion as to how they carry out their activity.  For example:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government has taken care to frame the growth duty in a way which avoids negative unintended consequences - the growth duty will not prevent regulators from dealing with non-compliance using the full range of sanctions at their disposal nor have any impact on the importance of their current duties. We have worked closely with regulators and other Government departments and taken measures to mitigate risks where they have been identified. \nThe consultation process highlighted concerns among regulators that the duty could invite vexatious legal challenges intended to frustrate the regulatory system, consuming resources and undermining regulators’ ability to carry out their statutory functions. \nEvidence from regulators however suggests that vexatious or unfounded claims made by businesses against regulators are rare as they are quickly thrown out by the courts and can also have a negative impact on businesses’ reputations. \nThere are ways to minimise the legal risk of vexatious challenges, for example through guidance that articulates the sorts of measures regulators need to take to meet the growth duty in different regulatory fields, which will assist in defining expectations of the duty.\nHow might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained? At this stage the Government does not propose that the growth duty should impose additional reporting and monitoring requirements on regulators. These regulators are already be bound by obligations under the revised Regulators’ Code. However there will be a clear expectation that regulators will be transparent and make clear in public the steps they are taking to respond to the growth duty through existing mechanisms. \nIf a regulated person has grounds for considering that a regulator has acted disproportionately, without having due regard for the impact its actions have had on growth, then the growth duty will provide a mechanism for regulated persons to hold regulators to account. \nWhere challenge mechanisms are already in place (e.g. appeals), the duty in primary legislation will provide a ground upon which businesses can challenge a decision taken by a regulator.  The risk of challenge will provide an important incentive for regulators to take the growth duty seriously and be transparent in how they respond to it. \n&#xa0;\nHow can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed? The Government has undertaken an initial impact assessment to identify the costs for regulators of implementing a growth duty and the benefits to society that the growth duty will deliver. Whilst costs and benefits are difficult to monetise, we will continue to build the evidence base and share this information with Parliament. \nThe current impact assessment found that a relatively modest saving to business of 0.3% of administrative costs would result in a positive net impact to society. \nThe growth duty is expected to generate significant benefits to businesses by:\n&#xa0;\nSo far, only a few regulators have felt able to provide details of anticipated costs of implementing the growth duty.  We will be working with regulators to develop guidance on how to respond to the growth duty. Regulators will be able to use this guidance to provide figures on the likely cost of implementing the growth duty and this additional information will be fed into the impact assessment as it is developed.\nA business survey has been commissioned to gather baseline data against which the impact of the growth duty will be measured.  The draft guidance currently in development may by extension also assist businesses in considering the likely benefits of a growth duty.\nConsumers and individuals will benefit directly from growth. Moreover, the growth duty will encourage regulators to be more proportionate in their interactions with businesses that wish to comply. This may lead to a more targeted approach, with regulators able to focus resources on dealing with non-compliant businesses, thus improving consumer protections.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n World Bank, \nDoing Business 2013, \nOctober 2012\n \nIFF Research, \nBusiness Perceptions Survey, \n2012 \nwww.bis.gov.uk/assets/brdo/docs/publications-2012/12-p145-business-survey-2012.pdf \n \n \nFor example the BIS-led Accountability for Regulator Impact (ARI) scheme provides a way for regulators to consult upon and take account of economic considerations, as measured by the impact of proposed changes on businesses, when they make changes to their policies or practices. \n&#xa0;\n"
