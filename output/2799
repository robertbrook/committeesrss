[normal]Key Points:[bold]Background[bold]Professor Marsden is the Director of the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds. He is also the Project Director for the Disruption project (
[normal]www.disruptionproject.net
[normal]), a £1.2m Research Council study examining what can be learnt from disruptive events of various sorts. 
[normal] 
[normal]Jeremy Shires is a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Transport Studies at University of Leeds and had responsibility for designing and implementing all surveys undertaken as part of the Disruption project.
[normal] 
[normal]The Disruption project conducted a large scale on-line survey (
[normal]2,417
[normal]) in six of the worst affected areas of the UK (Hampshire, Kent, Surrey, Norfolk, South Wales and West Yorkshire) during the severe bout of winter weather in January 2013. The submission draws on the findings from this survey and broader insights from the Disruption project which has also explored flooding and infrastructure closure. The submission however represents
[normal] the views of the authors 
[normal]rather than the Disruption project team or the Institute for Transport Studies.
