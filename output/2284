defaultWith the closure of the DfE consultations on regulatory reform of children’s homes, 
defaultt
defaulthe Children’s Services Development Group and the Independent Children’s Homes Association have joined together to express our concern that
default the Government’s changes to care regulations will do little to protect vulnerable children form harm or abuse. Without a wider strategic approach to the care system, the Department for Education is hindering the comprehensive changes needed and stands only to reinforce the silos that already exist in children’s services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the 
defaultintention of the 
defaultchanges
default, but are concerned that the narrow focus will not be effective
default in protecting children and young people
default. 
defaultAll children should have safe, effective care whether in fostering, kinship care or children’s homes, and whether placed in- or out-of-area. Many children at risk of abuse and 
defaultexploitation will still be living with their birth families, as was the case in Rochdale, and these changes do little to safeguard them.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is more that providers can do, but they cannot effect change alone. More has to be asked of social work
default colleagues
default, schools, health services and the police in order to achieve effective multi-agency working. Revising regulations without acting to ensure effective implementation and better strategic commissioning of placements will not truly make a difference in the lives of children in the care system. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultDfE
default has recognised that too often children’s homes are used by local authorities as a ‘last resort’. 7,900 of the 67,000 looked-after children in England are cared for in residential homes,
default and we believe that residential 
defaultcare can and should play a vital role as part of a range of provision for children with complex needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany 
defaultyoung people
default in residential homes will have had multiple placement breakdowns and often have the most complex needs.
default Statistics released in the 
defaultChildren’s Homes Data Pack
default show that nearly a third of children in children’s homes have had 6 or more placements.
default This is a scandal, with poor commissioning denying children stable and secure placements that meet their needs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DfE’s own data contradicts recent misleading statements made by the Education Secretary.
default The 
defaultData Pack
default shows that 71% of children’s homes are rated good or outstanding, and there is no direct correlation between level of deprivation and location of children’s homes.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere homes are inadequate or located in unsafe areas, this must be addressed and quickly, but the majority of children’s homes 
defaultprovide young people with intensive and specialist therapeutic support that will enable them to live fulfilled adult lives
default. 
defaultWhere local authorities lack provision, and so turn to out-of-area placements, we would encourage them to work in partnership with providers to develop high quality provision that meets children’s needs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRecent parliamentary questions have revealed that the DfE decided against developing a care strategy.
default Instead the department has chosen to implement piecemeal reforms – such as to the adoption system – that do not impact upon the majority of looked-after children. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe
default would urge the
default DfE
default to
default rethink this decision and
default take a strategic approach to reforming
default the wider care system in order 
defaultto best meet the needs of vulnerable children, rather than making piecemeal changes in 
defaultisolation.
default Only by doing so will they safeguard vulnerable children and help to provide the high-quality care and support they deserve.
