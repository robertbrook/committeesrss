RCH0005[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Wr[bold]itten Evidence submitted by [bold]Children’s Services Development Group[bold] and the[bold] 
[normal]Independent Children’s Homes Association[bold] (CSDG and ICHA)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Sector urges [bold]DfE[bold] to take a strategic approach to care system [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]With the closure of the DfE consultations on regulatory reform of children’s homes, 
[normal]t
[normal]he Children’s Services Development Group and the Independent Children’s Homes Association have joined together to express our concern that
[normal] the Government’s changes to care regulations will do little to protect vulnerable children form harm or abuse. Without a wider strategic approach to the care system, the Department for Education is hindering the comprehensive changes needed and stands only to reinforce the silos that already exist in children’s services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome the 
[normal]intention of the 
[normal]changes
[normal], but are concerned that the narrow focus will not be effective
[normal] in protecting children and young people
[normal]. 
[normal]All children should have safe, effective care whether in fostering, kinship care or children’s homes, and whether placed in- or out-of-area. Many children at risk of abuse and 
[normal]exploitation will still be living with their birth families, as was the case in Rochdale, and these changes do little to safeguard them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is more that providers can do, but they cannot effect change alone. More has to be asked of social work
[normal] colleagues
[normal], schools, health services and the police in order to achieve effective multi-agency working. Revising regulations without acting to ensure effective implementation and better strategic commissioning of placements will not truly make a difference in the lives of children in the care system. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]DfE
[normal] has recognised that too often children’s homes are used by local authorities as a ‘last resort’. 7,900 of the 67,000 looked-after children in England are cared for in residential homes,
[normal] and we believe that residential 
[normal]care can and should play a vital role as part of a range of provision for children with complex needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many 
[normal]young people
[normal] in residential homes will have had multiple placement breakdowns and often have the most complex needs.
[normal] Statistics released in the 
[normal]Children’s Homes Data Pack
[normal] show that nearly a third of children in children’s homes have had 6 or more placements.
[normal] This is a scandal, with poor commissioning denying children stable and secure placements that meet their needs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The DfE’s own data contradicts recent misleading statements made by the Education Secretary.
[normal] The 
[normal]Data Pack
[normal] shows that 71% of children’s homes are rated good or outstanding, and there is no direct correlation between level of deprivation and location of children’s homes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where homes are inadequate or located in unsafe areas, this must be addressed and quickly, but the majority of children’s homes 
[normal]provide young people with intensive and specialist therapeutic support that will enable them to live fulfilled adult lives
[normal]. 
[normal]Where local authorities lack provision, and so turn to out-of-area placements, we would encourage them to work in partnership with providers to develop high quality provision that meets children’s needs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recent parliamentary questions have revealed that the DfE decided against developing a care strategy.
[normal] Instead the department has chosen to implement piecemeal reforms – such as to the adoption system – that do not impact upon the majority of looked-after children. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We
[normal] would urge the
[normal] DfE
[normal] to
[normal] rethink this decision and
[normal] take a strategic approach to reforming
[normal] the wider care system in order 
[normal]to best meet the needs of vulnerable children, rather than making piecemeal changes in 
[normal]isolation.
[normal] Only by doing so will they safeguard vulnerable children and help to provide the high-quality care and support they deserve.
