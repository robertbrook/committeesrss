"A supplementary submission on the Committee on Climate Change’s (CCC) \nFourth Carbon Budget Review – part 1, November 2\n013\n, and Cargo cult science\n, Alex Henney\n&#xa0;\n“He who professes to foretell the future lies even if correct”\nThe Koran\n&#xa0;\nThe CCC took no notice of the inaccuracy of the climate models\n in AR5\n, which I set out in 2.2. of my main submission.  \nThe Independent of \n20/3/00\n reported that David Parker\n of the Met Office’s \nHadley Centre \nforecast that “\nBritish children could have only virtual experience of snow. Via the internet, they might wonder at polar scenes - or eventually \"feel\" virtual cold.\n  This forecast was linked with that of \nDr David Vine\nr of \nthe Climatic R\nesearch \nU\nnit of the \nUniversity\n of \nEast Anglia\n, \nthat \nwithin a few years winter snowfall will become \"\na very rare and exciting event\" - \n\"Children just ar\nen't going to know what snow is.\n\"\n  \nIn \n2007, a\n team of climate scientists from the Met Office wrote a paper “\nImproved Surface Temperature Prediction for the Coming Decade from a Global Climate Model\n” \nusing their new modeling system \nwhich forecast\n:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMs.\n&#xa0;\nVicky Pope\n of the Met Office\n gave a talk on these predictions, \nstating t\nhat\n&#xa0;\n“these are very strong statements about what will happen over the next 10 years.”\n  \nThese predictions are wrong - there has been no warming at all since 2004; \nnone \nof the years since 2009\n h\nave broken the record of 1998 according to HADCRUT3 data\n. \n&#xa0;\nPhysics Nobel Prize Winner Richard Feynman’s inaugural lecture at Caltech in 1974 “Cargo cult science”\n provides a useful concept.  If we were dealing with real science which hypothesizes then tests the hypothesis against reality, the abysmal record of the models in projecting/predicting/forecasting \n(\nor whatever word \none cares \nto choose\n)\n would have led to chucking them out\n \nand going back to the hypothesis drawing board. \n The \nMet Office would be eating humble pie for the aforementioned misforecast (and perhaps also for recent seasonal \nmis\nforecasts\n).  But no, it is telling us the temperature pause is a temporary phenomena and normal warming will be continued soon in line with its \n(CO2 \nd\nriven\n)\n models. We\n are dealing with politicized and too often fanciful climate science whose models have in many\n \nmind\ns\n become a pseudo reality – climate models are real cargo cult science.\n&#xa0;\nAs Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT commented\n in a seminar he gave in the House of Commons last year\n “Climate science is immature.  It cannot forecast the past, let alone the future”.  And he commented of the Fifth Assessment Report\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“I think that \nthe latest IPCC report\n has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.\n&#xa0;\n They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…”\n&#xa0;\nAll of CCC’s\n (and Met Office’s and IPCC’s) \ntalk of \n2\n0\nC\n and \n4\n0\nC\n \nincreases in temperature is \nintellectual slop\n (as is much else)\n, and should be ignored\n.\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n  Doug Smith, Steven Cusack, Andrew Colman,\n \nChris Folland, Glen Harris, James Murphy,  Science 10, August 2007, \nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5839/796\n \n The Met Office produced UK Climate Projections 2009 which purports to project “how the \nUK\n climate may change for the 30 year period from 2010-2099 at a resolution of 25km.” \nC\nlimatologist \nProfessor Emeritus \nR.A. Piel\nke Sr. of the \nU\nniversity\n of \nColorado\n in \nBoulder\n, \ncommented:-\nThis study…is clearly a subversion of the scientific method. To state that that climate science is being stretched is quite an understatement. There is absolutely no multi-decadal prediction skill on the spatial scales presented in this study.\nThe scientists who present the viewpoint of skillful multi-decadal regional predictions to policymakers are deliberately and dishonestly misinforming the public and policymakers. \n(emphasis original)\n \nSee blog, A view of science worth reflec\nting on, 16/11, wattsupwiththat and Wikipedia cargo cult science.  Feynman commented:-\n&#xa0;\n“\nIn the \nSouth Seas\n there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.\n”\n&#xa0;\nFeynman cautioned that to avoid becoming cargo cult scientists, researchers must avoid fooling themselves, be willing to question and doubt\n&#xa0;\ntheir own theories and their own results, and investigate possible flaws in a theory or an experiment. He recommended that researchers adopt an unusually high level of honesty\n&#xa0;\nwhich is rarely encountered in everyday life\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nAt a more modest scale, but apparently using similar models, the Met Office mis-forecast a “barbecue summer” for the washout in 2009; “milder-than-average winter” for 2010/11 through which we shivered; and a “drier-than-average” spring and early summer just before one of the wettest summers on record. \n&#xa0;\n \n“Global Warming: How to approach the science”, HoC, February 2012, \nhttp://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/reprint/how_to_approach_the_science.pdf\n.\n"
