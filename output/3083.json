"              \n              \nWritten evidence submitted by BBC Media Action and BBC World Service&#xa0;How Media Can Support Democracy and Development in Burma&#xa0;Executive summaryThis inquiry submission examines the role that media and communication can play in strengthening governance in Burma, also known as Myanmar. It is based on the BBC’s experience in the country over many years, both via BBC Media Action, its international development charity, and through its Burmese language service. \nTo date, a major focus of international governance support in Burma has been at a macro level, such as financial regulation and legislative reforms. However, strong democracies also require citizens and communities that are empowered to play a role in dialogue and decision-making that affects their lives. The evidence available in Burma at present suggests that individuals and communities lack the confidence or ability to make their voices heard and to participate in political processes. There is a need for increased discussion and engagement on social and political issues, more bottom-up communication between communities and their leaders and greater inclusion of religious and ethnic minorities, women, and the rural poor. Media has the potential to influence these barriers by enhancing knowledge and engagement and creating platforms for citizen voice and participation during Burma’s transition to democracy.  The BBC has a vital role to play on both counts.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBarriers at the population level&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRecommendations for how media can contribute to improved governance in Burma&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDonor Support to Media in Burma&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBBC services in Burma&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Recent distribution developments&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBBC Burmese and BBC Media Action&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Newsgathering in Burma&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nBBC Media Action set up an office in Burma in January, 2012, although it has worked with Burmese audiences – remotely – since 2006. Most project work has focused on building the capacity of local journalists and producing a youth radio programme broadcast on BBC Burmese Service that seeks to improve access of young people to accurate, impartial and relevant information\n.\n \nThe most visible elements of this transition to democratic governance have been the revision of labour laws, greater press freedoms, release of political prisoners and the return of a viable political opposition.\n BBC Media Action Governance Baseline Study (2013) - Quantitative national population survey  conducted in Burma in June/July 2013\n BBC Media Action Youth Study (2013) - Qualitative research with young people conducted in 5 states and regions of Burma\n \n10 Household, Village, Village tract (ward in urban areas), Township, District and State/Regional administrations\n \nActionAid\n Myanmar (2012) \nTraditional Forms and Mechanisms of Accountability in Myanmar\n Township administration are primarily responsible for public service delivery\n \nOxfam, \nActionAid\n and CARE (2011) \nIf Given the Chance: Women’s Participation in Public Life in Myanmar\n \nThe Village Tract and Ward Administration Law \nspecifies\n that ‘heads of households’ elect 10 household leaders, who in turn elect village tract leaders. It is very uncommon for the head of a household to be female and so women are indirectly excluded from the process in most cases.   \n \nA public service media is, by definition, one that seeks public benefit, rather than commercial gain. It serves the entire population and ensures a high technical standard with a balance of views and a range of topics.\n Lively News is a radio programme broadcast nightly at 9pm, following the main national evening news. It\n is \nMRTV’s first live radio current affairs \nprogramme\n, and\n features live interviews and reports, as well as the reading of emails and texts from audience members.\n BBC Media Action (2013) \nHow\n do political debate \nprogrammes\n influence political participation? A case study from Nepal\n \nLocal FMs do not produce news independently, \nalthough \npossibilities are beginning to open up for BBC Burmese to rebroadcast news on local FMs\n. \nA\nccess to independent newspapers and journals is largely limited to urban areas.\n BBC Media Action Baseline Governance study (2013) found that only 17% of participants had accessed a journal or newspaper in the past year, the majority of these being urban inhabitants. \n"
