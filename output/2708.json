"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Sustainable Homes&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe regulations and stand\nards established by national Government are a key means of raising the environmental performance of new housing and improving people’s local quality of life.  Sustainable Homes welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the continuing review of housing standards.  \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nAs the leading provider of training, research, consultancy and benchmarking for social housing providers in the environmental performance of new and existing homes we have both expert and practical experience\n to inform the review. \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nOur response also draws on the experience \nof \nSHIFT (Sustainable Homes Index for Tomorrow)\n, our\n benchmarking and good practice network \nwith a membership of\n over 60 housing associations.  Together these manage over one million homes with over two million residents. \n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nWe welcome the proposals to rationalise and simplify the confused approach to housing standards and reduce the volume of guidance.  We also welcome the intention to clarify the distinctive contribution of building regulations and planning policy/guidance.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0; \nWe believe that alongside this need for efficiency policy makers must maintain an awareness of the limits of market self-regulation and the unique position of government in the management of environmental risks. This concern was strongly stated in a 2010 review by the Innovation and Growth Team: \n&#xa0;\n“Primary leadership needs to come from Government, because of the degree of market failure and because plans for carbon reduction must reach into every fibre of the built environment, at a scale that is far beyond the reach of anybody other than Government.”\n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0; \nWe have identified a number of important areas that the consultation and its accompanying impact assessment have failed to address.  These are \ncovered\n in current standards and risk being lost.  Many contribute significantly to the achievement of important wider environmental, social and health outcomes.  \n&#xa0;\n1.7.\n&#xa0; \nA Sustainable Homes\n (2013)\n survey of 200 housing professionals showed 75% believed materials, waste and other environmental issues in housing should be regulated.  \n&#xa0;\n1.8.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nareas\n \nmost \nat risk \nar\ne\n the responsible sourcing of materials and ecology and we urge that these are addressed by\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.9.\n&#xa0; \nWe make a number of \nother \nproposals for further change:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0; \nWe welcome the restated commitment to ‘zero-carbon’ homes from 2016 and the proposal to mainstream this commitment by absorbing regulation of improved energy efficiency standards into building regulations.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nThere is a serious risk, however, that slippage in bringing forward the new regulations and the significant gap between the scaled back 2013 regulations \nwill pose a challenge in meeting \nthe 2016 ‘zero carbon’ target. Allowable solutions \nwill \nhelp\n industry to reach the 2016 standard\n however \nambition\n \nand commitment to training and\n \nzero carbon \npilots\n will be needed in advance of the 2016 target\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nW\ne believe a standard beyond the current \n2016 \n‘zero-carbon’ definition needs to be developed that aims for true zero-carbon, including currently unregulated emissions.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0; \nMore serious consideration of overheating is needed\n: \nOverheating is acknowledged as a problem but the consultation does not offer serious consideration of this issue other than a proposal to keep it under review.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nCuriously, the consultation states that “there are no standards or regulations that directly control overheating for thermal comfort”.\n&#xa0;\n Yet, building regulations state that there should be a low risk of overheating and that this can be demonstrated using the methodology described in appendix P of SAP. \n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe\nse\n existing \nrequirements are in-fact already in need of review as the existing methodology\n \nuses\n historic summer temperatures as part of its assessment and not projected temperatures, which could significantly alter the risk assessment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe proposals to eliminate requirements for provision of cycle storage sit awkwardly with the Government’s clear commitment to encouraging more cycling. In responding to the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group report \nGet Britain Cycling \n(2013)\n, \nTransport Minister Norman Baker said:\n&#xa0;\n “The coalition government takes cycling very seriously and we are committed to leading the country in getting more people cycling, more safely, more often”\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nStorage is one of the practical barriers to further growth in cycling and we believe building regulations should support provision of secure cycle storage for each new home with the potential of local variation according to current and future demand.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe proposals seem a sensible approach.  We support the ability of and the capability for local authorities to impose a tighter minimum standard in areas of water scarcity although an alternative approach would be to establisher higher \neffeiciency\n standards and allow these to be relaxed in areas of relative water surplus.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe proposal for a specification checklist of compliant flow rates for each fitting is very welcome.  It offers increased transparency and an outcomes based framework for builders which will allow for innovation and different approaches.  We believe the specification list could be improved in a number of areas:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0; \nSustainable Homes welcome the inclusion of space standards in the consultation. These are currently unregulated through building regulations but assessed through HQIs. \n&#xa0;\n6.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe two options of a minimum space standard or a space labelling scheme are presented as mutually exclusive.  We support a hybrid approach which establishes minimum standards in building regulations across all tenures and then uses a space labelling scheme.  This will help prospective residents make informed decisions in choosing new homes which have larger rooms\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe proposals on waste and recycling storage provision are confused and inconsistent.  There is welcome provision to \nto\n strengthen requirements for external recycling space but too little attention to the implications of how recycling will be accommodated internall\ny.\n Internal recycling bins are mentioned in the design element of proposals for minimum space standards but not addressed in the proposals for space labelling. \n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0; \nA study by WRAP (2008) found that a lack of internal space for recycling is a significant barrier to household recycling.  \nI\nnternal installation of space for recycling should be required under all options.\n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0; \nSpace for internal recycling storage should be required in building regulations.\n&#xa0;8.1.\n&#xa0; \nSustainable Homes is seriously concerned \nby\n the failure of the consultation document and the accompanying impact assessment to take account of the value accruing from broader sustainability and management considerations in housing standards.  These protect and contribute to wider environmental, social and health outcomes. This is a serious omission. \n8.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe following important considerations are currently included in standards but are omitted from the consultation: \n8.3.\n&#xa0; \nThere is no indication of how these benefits are to be provided under the new arrangements.  Sustainable Homes has received responses from approximately 200 housing professionals on their views on whether materials, waste and other \nenvironmental issues should be regulated in housing.\n&#xa0;\n Around 75% of those asked stated that they believe they should be regulated\n (Sustainable Homes, 2013)\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.4.\n&#xa0; \nWe \nfocus\n here on outlining practical ways that materials and ecology may be brought into a revised regulatory system.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.1.\n&#xa0; \nThere may be a case for simplifying how responsible sourcing is demonstrated but omitting it altogether does not seem to be a reasonable response.  The consultation suggests that existing voluntary industry standards cover these areas and that regulation is therefore unnecessary. We do not agree. The voluntary standards mentioned in the consultation, including BS, ISO and CE, govern aspects of quality, design and processes but they do not cover the issues of embodied energy and environmental impacts of materials.\n&#xa0;\n9.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe proposals put at risk the key benefits from responsible sourcing – using materials which do not require human exploitation and encouraging greater use of recycled materials and reduced landfill.  The \nuPVC\n is one area where the benefits of greater recycling are evident and there is significant potential in growing this part of the green economy.   \n&#xa0;\n9.3.\n&#xa0; \nWe suggest three policy options to encourage the use of more sustainable materials\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n10.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEcology is simply ignored in the consultation document.  This gross omission reinforces concerns raised by the Government’s Natural Capital Committee, that policies are too often based on economic rationalisation without reference to the value of our natural assets (2013). Ecological management in development processes are an important part of reversing a trend of biodiversity loss: populations of farmland and woodland species have declined by 28% and 17% respectively since 1990 (DEFRA, 2009). \n&#xa0;\n10.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBiodiversity is crucial for a healthy ecosystem, upon which humans depend and it has important social and economic value.\n&#xa0;\n The Government’s Natural Environment White Paper is unequivocal in recognising that:\n&#xa0;\n“\nNature is sometimes taken for granted and undervalued. But people cannot flourish without the benefits and services our natural environment provides. Nature is a complex, interconnected system. A healthy, properly functioning natural environment is the foundation of sustained economic growth, prospering communities and personal wellbeing.\nThis is why we must properly value the economic and social benefits of a healthy natural environment while continuing to recognise nature’s intrinsic value. The Government wants this to be the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than it inherited. To achieve so much means taking action across sectors rather than treating environmental concerns in isolation. It requires us all to put the value of nature at the heart of our decision-making – in Government, local communities and businesses. In this way we will improve the quality and increase the value of the natural environment across England.\n”\n&#xa0;\n10.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy omitting consideration of ecology the Housing Standards Review risks being an unfortunate example of taking nature for granted.\n&#xa0;\n10.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHousing development has a major impact on biodiversity.  As well as damaging and fragmenting existing habitats and ecosystems new development creates different opportunities for supporting wildlife.  The nation’s gardens are one of its most important wildlife resources and residents also benefit – whether through contact with nature in their back garden or the additional cooling effect of vegetation during increasingly extreme heat wave events.  \nE\nnvironmental \nbenefits of biodiversity\n \nhave been estimated as valued in the \nbillions in health impacts alone\n \n(\nUK National Ecosystem Assessment\n, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\n10.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe suggest two policy options to encourage address biodiversity in new housing:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n11.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe support the focus on building control officers and approved bodies to implement the standards.  This will be a significantly expanded and more complex role and we have concerns about the capacity and expertise within current building control teams to deliver.\n&#xa0;\n11.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe the new approach to housing standards needs to be accompanied by a significant boost in the competency and status of the building control profession.  This needs to embrace sustainability as an important area for development.  Sustainability is a relatively new field with a wide variety of unregulated information from products and suppliers and this presents a challenge to building control departments.  We believe \nthere is a need for an extra accredited qualification for building control officers who will be approving the sustainability elements of building regulations as part of the review.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;\nDEFRA (2009), “Sustainable development indicators in your pocket” available from \nhttp://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20090810002953/http://defra.gov.uk/sustainable/government/progress/data-resources/sdiyp.htm\n \nInnovation and Growth Team (2010), “Low Carbon Construction,” available from \nhttp://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/BISCore/business-sectors/docs/l/10-1266-low-carbon-construction-IGT-final-report.pdf\n \nLondon Climate Change Partnership (2013), “Your Social Housing in a Changing Climate,” available from \nhttp://climatelondon.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Your-social-housing-in-a-changing-climate.pdf\n \nNatural Capital Committee (2013), “The State of Natural Capital: Towards a framework for measurement and valuation” available from\n http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/files/State-of-Natural-Capital-Report-2013.pdf\n \nUK National Ecosystem Assessment\n (2011), “\nUnderstanding nature’s value to society\n” available from \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/hidden-value-of-nature-revealed-in-groundbreaking-study\n \n&#xa0;\nWRAP (2008), “Barriers to recycling at home,” \nRobert \nPocock\n, Ian Stone, Helen Clive, Rebecca Smith, Jill \nJesson\n and Stefan \nWilczak\n, available from \n \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/barriers-recycling-home\n \n&#xa0;\n3\n October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
