default1. 
defaultIn answer to 
defaultthe select committee
defaults
default request
default,
default I feel the bullet points you raised are best answered individually. Please see 
defaultm
defaulty answers to your questions below. I am an Electrical engineer and have worked in the electrical installation industry for over 20 years. I am currently employed by an engineering 
defaultentity
default and
default my view is my own personal view and not that of my employer
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. 
defaultThe general public as a whole do not understan
defaultd Part P, nor realize the requirement for using a suitably competent person. In my experience that part of the general public actually having works carried out to their property may use various media to understand what they need to do to employ a contracto
defaultr and in so doing pick up what Part P is
default about,
default but not really understand it
default,
default as many contractor web sites can be misleading. So
default,
default as advice is scant and misleading at best
default,
default I would say that only a small majority of the public are aware of Part P of the building regulations
default;
default however being aware of and understanding something are two very different 
defaultconcepts and most people don’t understand Part P of the building regulations. I
default have come across electricians registered on competent person’s schemes, that don’t understand the wiring regulations or Part P, so how could their unsuspecting general public clients possibly stand a chance.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultI feel that a large portion of the workforce pertaining to be compe
defaulttent and trained are way wide of the mark and wouldn’t consider a large section of those on competent persons schemes to be competent to carry out electrical installation work
default in general,
default regardless of that covered by the scope of Part P of the building Re
defaultgulations. The proliferation of 3-5 day or 12 week training courses do not provide prospective electricians with the skills to become competent and sadly they are accepted on to competent persons schemes and left to “practice” on the homes of the general p
defaultublic. This is a truly shocking scenario. I have discussed this with 
defaultscheme
default officials 
defaultand
default they 
defaultwere concerned
default that they were
default almost
default forced to keep unskilled non 
defaultcompetent
default people on their registers as the cost implications of losing the annual payment from them was not acceptable. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultThe 
defaultscheme
default 
defaultoperator’s
default used to send a field engineer out annually to inspect a supposedly competent 
defaultperson;
default however the wor
defaultk that was inspected was chosen by the contractor and 
defaultran the risk of being stage managed
default by the contractor,
default 
defaultready 
defaultfor the inspecting field engineer. In many cases the inspections lapsed to two years and now the schemes
default are
default rumored to be operating a risk based approach where by contractors may skip annual inspections for a number of years. 
defaultThe concept is flawed as
default one scheme provider runs a Qualifying Supervisor
default (QS)
default scheme, whereby the Qualifying Supervisor is assessed, ann
defaultually or other, but the rest of the company, which could have multiple
default non skilled
default 
defaultoperators
default that
default are not inspected
default. T
defaulthis is a highly dubious practice and allows totally inadequate and un skilled persons into a dwelling to carry out work, the paper work fo
defaultr which may only receive a cursory glance by the QS
default, who may not have even visited site to view the work. It is a misnomer that an electrical certificate or report produced
default,
default proves that the installation has been installed correctly, in many cases the elect
defaultrical test readings will not highlight poorly installed electrical systems or indicate the work that was carried out is in accordance with the building regulations.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultThe two schemes mentioned are not requir
defaulted as a register already exists
default that will tell a member of the public if a person or entity is registered with a competent person’s scheme, the existing register can be found at:
default 
defaulthttp://www.competentperson.co.uk/
default , this register is alrea
defaultdy fit for purpose 
defaultand no other is required.
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultThe register offered up by the Certsure alliance (Electrical Safety Council, NICEIC, ECA,SELECT and ELECSA), requires that any person accepted on to it is a member of, or registered with
default,
default one of their member 
defaultbodies, therefore any person or entity registered with a non-Certsure group company, would not be accepted on to it. How then can it be the register for the public? It is merely a register of all of the people registered with Certsure and not a register of
default those people or entities equally competent and registered to carry out electrical work
default.
default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultThe NAPIT register has all of the non Certsure registered bodies but also accepts the Certsure group members on to its register, however it is still a register and not required as the competent person scheme register, 
defaulthttp://www.competentperson.co.uk/
default is by far the most effective and neutral.
default&#xa0;
default8. 
defaultOne of the new registers 
defaultseemed to be
default set up as a direct competitor to the other as the competition between competent person schemes can only be described as ferocio
defaultus and volatile in nature. They are constantly attempting to discredit each other
default. I feel they
default are not working to the benefit of the general public with the
defaultir
default new register 
defaultfolly
default,
default which
default they both seem to be driving very hard
default&#xa0;
default9. 
defaultIn short a new register is 
defaultnot required as a perfectly serviceable register already exists.

default10. 
defaultI am not aware of any supervision what so ever by DCLG of the accreditation bodies. The experience I 
defaulthave had of DCLG interacting with the accreditation bodies was to ask for feedback and minimal advice on the recent changes to Part P of the building regulations. I see the accreditation bodies very much as individual companies and not answerable to DCLG i
defaultn a way that can be seen as useful to the general public.
default 
default&#xa0;
default11. To sum up, I don’t feel Part P has impacted the general public in a positive way, it has only served to enable scheme operator’s to prosper and develop well beyond their bounds. Vigilant monito
defaultring of competency by a neutral body, not driven by massive profit requirements is what is required to improve safety and by doing so increase the skill levels of those undertaking electrical installation work by continual development.
default&#xa0;
default12. Merely taking ci
defaultrca £500 a year from a contractor to enable them to work is no use to anyone, especially not the public they are supposed to ensure the safety of
default.
