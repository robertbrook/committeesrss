[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Capital Traffic Management Limited
[normal] (CYS0139)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Capital Traffic has substantial 
[normal]UK and international experience in all transportation modes a
[normal]nd of the interfaces among them, including pedestrian and cycle planning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]In our submission to the APPCG Inquiry, 
[normal]Get Britain Cycling
[normal], we focused on 
[normal]the 
[normal]three 
[normal]complementary 
[normal]issues
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]we 
[normal]had 
[normal]identif
[normal]ied
[normal] as being critical to t
[normal]he future of cycling in Britain, 
[normal]viz
[normal]…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]1.2.1
[normal]              
[normal]the provision of cy
[normal]cling infrastructure
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]1.2.2
[normal]              
[normal]sharing roadspac
[normal]e with other traffic
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]1.2.3
[normal]              
[normal]rights of way
[normal] 
[normal]and safety 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]We identified
[normal] the need to change attitudes and 
[normal]behaviour as 
[normal]an 
[normal]essential
[normal] pre-requisite to the growth of walking and cycling
[normal], and explored how best such 
[normal]change
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]may be leveraged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]Our submission concluded…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Capital Traffic does not accept that sufficient attitudinal and behavioural change 
[normal]has occurred or will occur by the provision of dedicated cycling and walking infrastructure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In any case, the limited availability of finance will mean that would never happen to any widespread extent anyway.  We must recognise that segregated cycleways a
[normal]re and will be exceedingly helpful in many places, but that cyclists are everywhere.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Capital Traffic does not accept that attitudinal and behavioural change will occur through exhortation to share roadspace.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Self-interested motorists may continue to fail to take adequate notice of other road-users – to many, they are simply in the way.  However, the simple message of Share the Road would have resonance if accompanied by legal liability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Capital Traffic 
[normal]believes that attitudinal and behavioural change will take place only if powerfully reinforced by law.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are convinced that the legal protections 
[normal]we 
[normal]outlined [
[normal]refer below
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]would prompt both an immediate change in driver behaviour and subsequently the t
[normal]ake-up of walking and cycling.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Capital Traffic concludes that the primary pre-requisite to enable walking and cycling in Britain to flourish is to change the law to give strong legal protections to the most vulnerable of our road-users.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]We
[normal] regret to note that the otherwise very good report from the APPCG did not recommend any changes in the law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]We have been given to understand that were any legislation brought forward, there would be moves 
[normal]by some Members of Parliament 
[normal]to 
[normal]make cycle helm
[normal]ets compulsory
[normal], as some sort of 
[normal]otherwise 
[normal]ill-advised 
[normal]quid pro quo
[normal].  While we would have no objection were such a restriction applied to cyclists under 16 (though the impact of the requirement is likely to be 
[normal]cosmetic and 
[normal]negligible in terms of injury prev
[normal]ention
[normal], and a recommendation would be prefer
[normal]able
[normal]), 
[normal]we consider that
[normal] that
[normal] would be a highly retrograde step to apply to all cyclists, and 
[normal]likely to 
[normal]restrict future cycling growth
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]This should not have been a reason for avoiding sensible legislation howeve
[normal]r, particularly in respect of rights of way and legal liability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]We appreciate that much 
[normal]public
[normal] concern has arisen after the recent 
[normal]tragic 
[normal]deaths of cyclists in London, which 
[normal]gives urgency to
[normal] the present Inquiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Below, we have attempted a response to the question 
[normal]what can be done?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The understandable 
[normal]public 
[normal]demand is for action now, a quick-fix, an immediate reduction in cycling casualties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]With due respect
[normal] to the Committee
[normal], 
[normal]Capital Traffic contend
[normal]s
[normal] that proposals for…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- 
[normal]              
[normal]better training and advice for drivers and cyclists
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- 
[normal]              
[normal]better enforcement of the law applying to drivers and cyclists
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]              
[normal]better vehicle and road infrastructure
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]…are unlikely to have more than 
[normal]limited and
[normal]/
[normal]or 
[normal]long-term effects.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Notwithstanding the 
[normal]above, we recommend that more 
[normal]innovative use is made of the many electronic displays now commonplace in cities and larger towns to offer safety advice
[normal] and other guidance
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]At present, the 
[normal]displays are eithe
[normal]r blank, or the 
[normal]same hackneyed messages appear constantly, and tend to be ignored.
[normal]  A communication opportunity is being missed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]When operational, t
[normal]he display
[normal]s
[normal] do not 
[normal]generally 
[normal]appear to be sufficiently reactive to real-time changes
[normal].  I
[normal]t is rare that tra
[normal]ffi
[normal]c disruption is indicated in cities (as distinct from on motorways).  Usually, they show 
[normal]road closures next week
[normal], or some such.
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]In pursuit of a rapid response to public concern, Capital Traffic reiterates its view that dramatic 
[normal]legislative 
[normal]action is required.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If we wish to encourage walking and cycling, the fear and insecurity that many have must be eliminated.  
[normal]To achieve that change in mindset
[normal] requires 
[normal]the backup of the law
[normal] for optimal e
[normal]ffectiveness
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We need to change the law to give [bold]better protection to both pedestrians and cyclists.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Without the legal protections that pedestrians and cyclists have across most of mainland Europe, the Active Travel movement will be stymied in the UK.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While 
[normal]large amounts of public funds
[normal] may be 
[normal]spent on infrastructure, it will always be insufficient to give people the confidence and courage to walk and cycle on their own streets.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We need to change the law and create a climate wherein pedestrians and cyclists feel safe on 
[normal]all
[normal] streets, not just 
[normal]where dedicated infrastructure is in place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This means 
[normal]a change from 
[normal]vulnerable users being provided with space at the discretion of vehicle users, as now, 
[normal]to where 
[normal]the latt
[normal]er 
[normal]is 
[normal]mandated to provide it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]We propose a short Bill to amend the Transpor
[normal]t Act which focuses on the rights of way and legal liability, and nothing else.  Anything more would unnecessarily delay or halt any legislation.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We urge the Transport Committee to 
[normal]ensure
[normal] a fast passage through the House, while at the same time facilita
[normal]ting a debate on the issues in the Bill only.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]It should be re
[normal]c
[normal]ognised 
[normal]that if 
[normal]one 
[normal]take
[normal]s
[normal] the number of KSIs for pedestrians and cyclists in any on
[normal]e year (assuming all of them 
[normal]mad
[normal]e a claim for damages, injury or loss) divide
[normal]d
[normal] by the number of licensed 
[normal]drivers
[normal], a very small percentage 
[normal]would result.  Few 
[normal]car drivers would be impacted by th
[normal]e proposed 
[normal]change
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Nonetheless, the changes would be salutary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sharing the Road in New Zealand
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Our 
[normal]preferred Bill would contain the following provisions…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]all 
[normal]users of 
[normal]h
[normal]ighways, cycleways, walkways and off-routes be required to recognise the rights of all other users
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and to share 
[normal]that
[normal] facility
[normal] in a safe 
[normal]and courteous 
[normal]manner
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.2
[normal]              
[normal]that when
[normal] a powered vehicle passes a cyclist, 
[normal]a minimum passing distance of 1m between the 
[normal]vehicle 
[normal]and the 
[normal]bicycle 
[normal]is observed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]that when a cyclist passes a pedestrian or horse and rider, a minimum passing 
[normal]distance
[normal] of 1m between the bicycle and the other road-user is observed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.4
[normal]              
[normal]that, 
[normal]in the event of 
[normal]a 
[normal]collision
[normal] with a 
[normal]pedestrian
[normal], 
[normal]legal liability 
[normal]rests with the vehicle 
[normal]user, cyclist
[normal] or horse-rider in all cases where th
[normal]ere is no overwhelming evidence
[normal] to the
[normal] 
[normal]contrary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].4
[normal]              
[normal]that 
[normal]the law be clarified 
[normal](in the Bill) 
[normal]and strengthened in favour of pedestrians, and standardised for all types of road crossings
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].5
[normal]              
[normal]that 
[normal]the rights of way of pedestrians and people in wheelchairs 
[normal]take precedence
[normal]…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- on all footways
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- on cycleways
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- in shared space
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- on driveway crossings 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- once they have stepped 
[normal]off the 
[normal]footway
[normal] on to the 
[normal]carriageway
[normal] at junctions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- on all formal
[normal]ised pedestrian
[normal] crossings
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal] at light-controlled intersections
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].6
[normal]              
[normal]that
[normal] Local Traffic Authorities reduce the waiting time for pedestrians and people in wheelchairs at light-controlled intersections
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].7
[normal]              
[normal]that, in the event of a
[normal] collision with a 
[normal]cyclist
[normal], 
[normal]legal liability for collisions rests with 
[normal]the vehicle user 
[normal]or 
[normal]horse-rider
[normal],
[normal] in all cases where there is no overwhelming evidence
[normal] 
[normal]to the contrary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.8
[normal]              
[normal]that all left-turning vehicles be required to give way to any cyclists within 50m back from the intersection
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].9
[normal]              
[normal]that 
[normal]the rights of way of cyclists on designated cycleways be 
[normal]circumscribed by those 
[normal]of 
[normal]pedestrians and equestrians  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal].10
[normal]              
[normal]that the default maximum speed limit in 
[normal]town centres
[normal] and on all non-arterial highways in residential areas becomes 
[normal]either 30 or 35km/
[normal]h (18.7 or 21.8mi/h) 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Clearly, a new range of offences would be created by the above
[normal] changes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We note the apparent lack of effectiveness of the current penalties in achieving behavioural change, despite often being draconian 
[normal]where
[normal] maxima are applied.
[normal]  The exception seems to be the requirement for re-training.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We consider that there should be new emphasis on penalties that affect vehicle use, including for those who use their vehicle for their employment.  It is often the latter, t
[normal]he archetypal 
[normal]white van men
[normal] and other commercial drivers, who appear the most immune to the law.  They are often 
[normal]observed
[normal] using their cellphones while driving, for example.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Limits on distance travelled, higher insurance premiums, restricting licences to t
[normal]imes of the day
[normal] 
[normal]and/or weekdays 
[normal]etc should all be considered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]The distances and speeds mentioned above are deliberately in metric to recognise
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]- the unnecessary use of both Imperial and metric systems in the UK
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- the
[normal] familiarity that younger people have with metric rather than Imperial
[normal] measurements
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]- the number of European and other foreign drivers on UK roads.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Department for Transport should be encouraged to 
[normal]metricate 
[normal]the transportation system 
[normal]without further
[normal] delay, as most other sectors have.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Capital Traffic note
[normal]s
[normal] the e
[normal]xperience 
[normal]of
[normal] The Netherlands in the 1970s
[normal] that shows
[normal] that cycling was not widely taken up until 
[normal]similar
[normal] legal protections were in place.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In France
[normal], since the passage of 
[normal]a stricter liability regime in 1985, bicycle safety has improved markedly. 
[normal]  A
[normal]ccording to OECD statistics
[normal] (
[normal]2012
[normal])
[normal], the fatality rate for cyclists has decreased by 
[normal]66 per cent since 1990
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where The Netherlands 
[normal]and France were 
[normal]then, Britain is now.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]The understandi
[normal]ng one’s responsibilities while
[normal] in charge of a potential
[normal]ly
[normal] lethal weapon when sharing the road with other more vulnerable road users would be greatly enhanced
[normal] by the changes we propose
[normal].  We are confident these 
[normal]would 
[normal]then 
[normal]start to change beha
[normal]viour and eventually culture.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]Capital Traffic sincerely regrets the 
[normal]tragic and 
[normal]continuing loss of life on our highways
[normal].  
[normal]We consider that the balance has long been too much in favour of powered traffic to the detriment of our people, towns and citie
[normal]s.  It is time this imbalance 
[normal]was
[normal] corrected in favour of pedestrians and cyclists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]urge the Committee to recommend a prompt and meaningful response as well as a long-term strategy to the Government, not excluding legislation as 
[normal]proposed in this 
[normal]submission, to better protect pedestrians and cyclists.
