[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Vertex’s product Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is the first in a new class of innovative medicines that treats the underlying causes of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease affecting approximately 10,000 people in the UK. &#xa0;1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Kalydeco has been available to all patients with the G551D mutation in England since 1st January 2013. This has a number of implications for the commissioning and delivery of specialised services for cystic fibrosis, particularly in relation to NICE’s appraisal process for Highly Specialised Technologies and NHS England’s clinical commissioning policies for higher-cost medicines.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Vertex is a global health sciences company that aims to accelerate the discovery, development, and commercialisation of critical medicines for life-threatening diseases including cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C, and epilepsy. &#xa0;2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; In 1998, Vertex established its first global research and development site in the UK. Researchers at Vertex’s approximately 150-person UK site are focused on discovering new medicines for a variety of cancer types and neuroinflammatory diseases.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease affecting approximately 10,000 people in the UK. It is a complex and multi-system disease that causes the internal organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, to produce thick sticky mucus that eventually leads to death from respiratory failure. In 2011 the median age at death for cystic fibrosis patients was 26 years. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Cystic fibrosis is also associated with other long-term conditions including diabetes, infertility, and osteoporosis. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; The care of children and adults with cystic fibrosis is coordinated by specialised services that are directly commissioned by NHS England. These specialised services provide care from a multidisciplinary team including specialist doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Vertex’s product Kalydeco received regulatory approval for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients aged six years and older who have a G551D mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene from the European Medicines Agency in July 2012. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2011 there were 466 cystic fibrosis patients with a copy of this mutation in UK. Due to this small patient population Kalydeco is widely recognised as an ultra-orphan medicine (i.e. a treatment for a very rare disease). &#xa0;4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Kalydeco is the first in a new class of innovative medicines that treats the underlying causes of cystic fibrosis. The results of clinical trials indicate that treatment with Kalydeco could lead to a 10-year increase in life-expectancy and a significant improvement in quality of life. 4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Kalydeco has been available to all patients with the G551D mutation in England since 1st January 2013 following a commissioning decision made by the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group. Since 1st April 2013 it has been commissioned on a national basis by NHS England. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; UK clinicians have noted that Kalydeco ‘is life changing for the few patients with cystic fibrosis for whom it is indicated’ and, as the first medicine of its kind, ‘has the potential to transform cystic fibrosis care’. This transformation in cystic fibrosis care may require changes to the way that specialised services and treatments for the disease are commissioned and delivered. &#xa0;

[[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]]]&#xa0;5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) assumed responsibility for the appraisal of Highly Specialised Technologies (i.e. ultra-orphan medicines) on 1st April 2013. It is essential that NICE’s appraisal process for Highly Specialised Technologies recognises the value of innovative medicines for the treatment of very rare clinical subsets of more common diseases, particularly long-term conditions for which there is no cure, and takes this into account when making its recommendations. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[NHS England]]]&#xa0;5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Although the majority of medicines for the treatment of cystic fibrosis are funded using the Payment by Results system, certain higher-cost medicines are directly commissioned by NHS England. It is essential that this direct commissioning continues to ensure cystic fibrosis patients have equitable access to higher-cost medicines across England. &#xa0;5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; If Kalydeco and other innovative new medicine for cystic fibrosis lead to a reduction in exacerbations and hospital admissions, it may be possible to redesign some services to allow patients to receive a larger proportion of their care in the community. This would be likely to lead to further improvements to patients’ quality of life and reduce the costs of providing specialist services in a hospital setting. May 2013 Cystic fibrosis Trust.
