[[[Submission from Unlock Democracy]]]

[[[* ]]]

[[[(Merseyside &amp; West Cheshire) (FDC 35)]]]&#xa0;Unlock Democracy* (Merseyside &amp; West Cheshire) welcomes any movement towards more open and accountable strategic political leadership for the 

[[[proposed]]] Liverpool City Region (LCR). Our City Region is emerging as an economic, social and cultural entity, a political reality. But we contend that its governance structures have failed to keep pace. We agree that the current arrangements are weak and lack transparency. Reform is to be welcomed.&#xa0;&#xa0;In the DCLG consultation document on the proposed LCR, https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposal-to-establish-a-combined-authority-for-greater-merseysidewe contend that the arrangements for scrutiny are too vague. In the Annex paragraph 24 (Scrutiny Arrangements) it states that the Combined Authority 

[[[may ]]]establish joint overview and scrutiny arrangements. Further in the Draft Statutory Instrument: 

[[[Committees ]]]4- (1) The Combined Authority 

[[[may appoint]]] one or more committees as an overview and scrutiny committee… We propose that the wording be amended to 

[[[shall appoint]]]. &#xa0;In the LCRCA document "

[[[Outline of the potential role of a LCRCA", ]]]the proposed Scrutiny Arrangements paragraph 9&#xa0;are at the top of page 15. Please see below in bold a link to the document

[[[ “Proposal for the ]]]

[[[ of Scrutiny".]]] The DCLG received this document when the six authorities in the LCRCA submitted their proposal. We regard this to be a very good four page document, on the second page of which we draw your attention to paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 

[[[“Structures and Processes of Scrutiny at the City Region Level”]]].

[[[ of Scrutiny]]]The composition of the scrutiny panel, however, could be overwhelmingly dominated by one political party. We are keen, therefore, to see that the scrutiny structure for the proposed "City Region Cabinet" includes 

[[[a specific guarantee of representation for opposition voices]]]. This safeguard is especially important when, as is the case at the moment, the political leaders of the six authorities (the LCR Cabinet members) might be drawn from the same political party. In this regard, on the third page of the document 

[[[“Proposal for the ]]]

[[[organisation]]]

[[[ of Scrutiny"]]], there is sub paragraph 3.2 (ii) 

[[["Cross Party]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Representation"]]], which addresses this issue of representation for opposition voices.&#xa0;Our vision is one of a more democratic Local Governance model, with the necessary provision of checks and balances, scrutiny and transparency. That is: a Liverpool City Regional Mayor, with a system of representation similar to that implemented in London, i.e. the existing six Local Councils, a Liverpool City Regional Assembly (similar to that of&#xa0;the Merseyside County Council, which was abolished in 1986), all of these would preferably be elected with a proportional electoral system, as adopted in Scottish Local Government.&#xa0;&#xa0;The group would be pleased to respond to any questions and would welcome any opportunity to elaborate on these points.&#xa0;On behalf of the Merseyside and West Cheshire Unlock Democracy Group*,&#xa0;Geoffrey Woodcock (Chair)&#xa0;&#xa0;*About us:- Unlock Democracy, of which we are a local group, is a national organisation which campaigns on voting and constitutional reform.
