defaultIan Selby – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultMy concern is with the state of the Green Lanes that I constantly see being destroyed by motorised vehicles, 4x4s and trials bikes.
defaultI would like to make two proposals
defaultThese proposals are covered in more detail by the formal submissions made by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group(GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA)  and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) which I expressly support.
