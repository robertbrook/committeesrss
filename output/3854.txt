[[[Written evidence from the]]]

[[[ Greater London Authority  (CYS 060)]]]&#xa0;Thank you for inviting us to submit evidence on cycling safety. We hope that your inquiry can help improve the quality of the debate on this issue. &#xa0;

[[[1. Is cycling safe?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The rate of cyclist fatalities has fallen dramatically in recent years. &#xa0;&#xa0;Serious injury rates have also fallen. &#xa0;&#xa0;Although it is possible to draw some conclusions from deaths over the medium term, it is much harder to draw any conclusions from relatively short-term events. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;London’s cycle casualty rates are comparable to, or better than, most equivalent foreign cities, though exact comparisons are difficult. &#xa0;&#xa0;The concept of “subjective safety” is sometimes employed to argue against these empirical truths. We accept the importance of this.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Some objective and empirical signs are also causing us growing concern.&#xa0;&#xa0;Cycling is far more likely to prolong your life than to end it; and more likely to improve your health than to harm it.  &#xa0;&#xa0;Cycling will even prolong other people’s lives. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What can central and local government do to improve cycle safety? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Safety improvement is a partnership with many partners. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We take a smart, targeted approach to safety. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We believe route improvements, including segregation, are essential to improve safety – but more so perceived safety. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;TfL and the boroughs support and provide better training and advice for drivers and cyclists. &#xa0;&#xa0;The Metropolitan Police, City of London Police and TfL are increasing enforcement against bad driving and cycling.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We are promoting safety in a number of other ways. &#xa0;&#xa0;Change takes time – and the roads are not just for cyclists. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Government and EU need to act too.&#xa0;&#xa0;Our key “asks” from Whitehall include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013There is a need to raise the quality of the debate. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We fear that the all-consuming focus on cycling deaths may be deterring cyclists. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;By the very act of trying to help cyclists, we are treated as if we have nationalised every accident.&#xa0;&#xa0;Some of the assumptions in the debate are wrong.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Even the best infrastructure in the world cannot remove the responsibility to behave safely, or entirely immunise cyclists against harm. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We do not say that people should stop talking about safety. It is the number one deterrent to taking up cycling. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3. Lorries – and whether it is desirable or feasible to prohibit them from entering city centres at peak hours]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Mayor is acting to remove the most unsafe lorries from London.&#xa0;&#xa0;We are stepping up enforcement against dangerous HGVs. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We have a wide variety of programmes to mandate higher standards for lorries and drivers; and to encourage lorries and cycles to be more aware of each other. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We are looking at different ways of shifting lorries outside of the peak&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; There are two different ways of measuring cycle use. “Journeys” are where all or part of the journey was made by bike. “Trips” (about 181 million in London in 2011) are where the entire journey was made by bike. For instance, cycling to the station to get a train would count towards the first figure but not the second. &#xa0;
