&#xa0;Written evidence from Alan Reid [PH 23]&#xa0;

[[[Parliament’s Ombudsman Service]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;This submission is a separate response to the PASC’s questions 11, 12 and 13, based on my recent successful completion of the PHSO’s “obstacle course” for admissible complaints.

[[[financed by the departments it covers.]]]As a creature of Parliament, the PHSO has not been properly held to account by Parliament. To the citizen, PHSO accountability seems to consist of producing a glossy annual report, and an annual canter by the Ombudsman before the PASC. &#xa0;A citizen with a complaint can be made to feel he is taking on the Establishment fronted by the PHSO, which gives a privileged position not only to the Department (vis-à-vis the citizen) but to the MP who gets the final letter from the Ombudsman (on first-name terms in my case) with just a copy to the citizen. &#xa0;The office of Ombudsman would surely be more convincing to the citizen if the holder was not seen as part of the Establishment. The current Ombudsman was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire ‘for services to equal opportunities’ - after heading the Equal Opportunities Commission for eight years.  All other Ombudsmen with one exception have been ‘Sirs’.  The PASC published a report criticising the giving of honours to people for doing their day job, yet it went along with (presumably) appointing such a member of the Establishment as the current Ombudsman.&#xa0;The Ombudsman should be independent, financed by the departments it covers. For every admissible complaint that reaches the Ombudsman, a department should also pay a fee. In this way, each select committee can get involved with its department’s complaints procedures and outcomes.

[[[ relationship, but on a less chummy basis.]]]Any kind of broader relationship between the PHSO and the PASC is difficult to envisage.  It is surely the PASC which has allowed the present sorry state of affairs to develop. The PASC works mainly in private, meeting only occasionally in public, to ‘take evidence’.  At the time of writing (mid-September 2013), the Committee has not met since publicly since 2 July 2013, and currently has no scheduled public meetings (although a hearing is mentioned for October 2013).  &#xa0;The PASC secretariat may share the same address as the PHSO, but they can hardly take any initiative without the say-so of their MPs.   &#xa0;

[[[basis of my experience, ‘ineffective’]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[ ]]]Yes, the MP did forward my complaint and, yes, the PHSO did obtain an apology from the UK Border Force, but to get the PHSO to act I had to allow myself to become angry with a PHSO employee, whose one-sided questioning on the telephone was designed to make me drop the case. Prior to knowing whether the PHSO would indeed take up my complaint, and in connection with the annual hearing of the Ombudsman, I submitted evidence to the PASC on the procedural ‘story so far’. This was also designed to put pressure on the PHSO to take up my complaint, following that telephone call.

[[[, ]]]

[[[unconvincingly. ]]]I did get some acknowledgments of procedural faults, but I was not convinced that ‘lessons would be learned’.  In one case, the PHSO would have been better just to acknowledge that they had made a mistake, instead of giving me a cock-and-bull story about the department’s arrangements.

[[[NHS?]]]

[[[Answer: ]]]

[[[Direct]]]

[[[ access]]]

[[[ for all]]]

[[[, without having to go through an MP.]]]As things stand, there is even a lack of precision as to whether one can go through any MP, or only the constituency MP. In my case, as a complainant living outside the UK, PHSO wording implied I could only go though Mr Jenkin MP (as chairman of the PASC). &#xa0;The arguments for retaining the ‘MP filter’ seem to rest on a rather idealised view of MPs’ relationships with their constituents. Most people do not know who their MP is (80 %?). People move residence between elections. Many will have never voted for their MP, given the UK electoral system, and may be disinclined to go to the ‘opposition’. Some may know another MP better, through circumstances. Then people get ‘disenfranchised’ for weeks when there are by-elections and general elections, and a new MP has to recruit staff and learn the ropes.  There must be nagging doubts about whether, or when, a certain MP will deal with a case, because of some highly-publicised activity which clearly impinges on their ‘day job’, or because the MP is an important Minister, or simply because of the many recesses when people are not sure if the MP is around. Others might wonder if the MP would indeed forward the case, because the complaint fortuitously goes against that MP’s known political agenda, or sponsors.&#xa0;
