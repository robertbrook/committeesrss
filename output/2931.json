"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Philippe Sands QCProfessor of Law, University College LondonMatrix Chambers, London (PCD 03)&#xa0;\n“\nGiven the commitment made by the Foreign Secretary in March 2011, how can progress be made on enshrining in law the necessity of consulting Parliament on military action?\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(A) Iraq &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nnotes the opinion of the Attorney General\n that, Iraq having failed to comply and Iraq being at the time of Resolution 1441 and continuing to be in material breach, the authority to use force under Resolution 678 has revived and so continues today\n”\n.\nThis impl\ni\ned \nthat the Attorney General had \noffered s\nuch an opinion\n,\n and had done so \nwithout caveat. \nThe publication of the full legal \nadvice \nin April 2005 confirmed that the document offered to the house two years earlier as \nan \n‘unequivocal’\n \nstatement\n that the war would be legal \nwas in fact nothing of the sort\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(B) Syria &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable\n”\n. \nWhen I first saw the doc\nument I noted that it \npurported\n to set out “the UK Government’s position”, that it was unsigned, and that it made no reference to any advice or op\ninion or ‘view’ of the Attorney-\nGeneral. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

\nParliament \n(or a Committee of Parliament) obtains\n its own legal advice as to the legality of any military action\n, from an independent source; \n(iii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
