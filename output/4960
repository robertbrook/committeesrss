defaultIntroduction
defaultCare for the Wild International submits this document for consideration at the inquiry into the keeping of primates as pets in the UK by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. 
defaultCare for the Wild is 
defaultan international wildlife 
defaultcharity
default based in the 
defaultUK,
default 
defaultwhich has worked for 
defaultto the protection of wildlife in the UK and around the globe
default for 30 years. 
defaultA
defaults a member of ENDCAP, Care for the Wild International was a key partner in producing the
default ENDCAP report, Wild Pets in the European Union, launched at the Eu
defaultropean Parliament on 3rd October 2012

defaultExecutive Summary
defaultThe keeping of primates as pets presents
default many issues including t
defaulthe impact on 
defaultthe individual primate’s 
defaultwelfare, 
defaultthe 
defaultconservation of
default wild populations and 
defaultthe 
defaultprevention of 
defaultthe 
defaultillegal trade
default, as well a
defaults the possible tr
defaultansmission of disease or
default injury to humans
default.

defaultOverview
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithin the UK, 
defaultit is estimated that there could be as many as 15,000-20,000 primates as pets.
default 
defaultMuch of the trade in primates within the UK is done privately and so 
defaultit is 
defaulthard to monitor exact numbers. Most t
defaultrade appears to normally occur in private, making monitoring difficult. Breeders and private dealers are believed to be the main source of pet primates.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a group, primates are recognised as being highly intelligent an
defaultimals with complex emotional and physical needs and capabilities. As such, when kept in any form of captivity, they must be cared for by qualified individuals 
defaultthough
default evidence suggests many privately owned primates do not receive suitable care. Solitary hou
defaultsing, early separation from the mother and inappropriate housing are just some of the husbandry practices likely to cause welfare problems in pet primates.
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the wild, many primate species are threatened by habitat 
defaultdegradation
default, 
defaultbush meat hunting, and 
defaultcap
defaultture for the pet trade. 
defaultLegal trade in wild species
default (or products deriving 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultfrom them)
default can often lead to an illegal trade supplied t
defaulthrough the poaching of wildlife – this has been notable especially in the ivory trade.
default Wide scale 
defaultillegal 
defaultpoaching has been
default 
defaultshown to fund other illegal activities such as terrorism
default, weapons trade
default and drug smuggling and poaching is
default driving 
defaultmany
default species to extinction. 
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor
default 
defaulteach wild pet that does end up in someone’s home, numerous others may have died along the way. For every wi
defaultld animal captured and sold as a wild pet, an estimated 50 may be killed or die in transit.
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWild in nature and often unpredictable, some 
defaultprimates
default are potentially 
defaultvery 
defaultdangerous to people, and able to inflict severe physical injury or transmit unusual and 
defaultharmful diseases
default such as
default hepatitis A, tuberculosis, monkey pox and herpesvirus simiae-B
default. 
defaultIf the animal escapes, it could present further danger to UK wildlife populations. 
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrent legislation for primates offers protection by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA)
default 2006 and some species require a licence to be kept as pets under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act (DWAA) 1976. International trade is controlled by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). 
defaultHowever, t
defaulthe current Code of Practice on
default the Welfare of privately owned primates cannot be legally enforced and the information therein only offers generic advice insufficient for the wide ranging species that make up the primate pet trade.
default 
defaultA number of countries have now introduced legislation t
defaulto ban, regulate or restrict the private keeping of pet primates, including Denmark, Bulgaria, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, the US, Australia, Israel, Mexico and Honduras.
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the need for specific guidelines for the keeping of p
defaultrimates as pets has been recognised, we are concerned that there are no provisions for an auditable licensing system for keepers of these animals, which would enable oversight of adherence to current legislation. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCare for the Wild believ
defaultes that it is extremely difficult to achieve the suitable provision of welfare standards for primates in private ownership, and that the keeping of primates by private collectors can have adverse consequences for their welfare, as well as their conservatio
defaultn status in the wild in some circumstances. 
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCare for the Wild feels that t
defaulthe need for keeping primates should show clear purpose beyond that of simply being a companion animal or pastime. 
defaultAs a welfare and conservation charity, we 
defaultrecommend
default that the keeping of any primate should be solely for the conservation of the species o
defaultr the welfare of an individual and not for private collections.
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe strongly support legislation being 
defaultproposed
default in the United Kingdom to restrict the private ownership of
default primates to purposes other than pet ownership, namely species conservation or the care of animals, by sanctuaries and individuals to whom sanctuaries 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultre-home animals, as a result of their abandonment, neglect, maltreatment or injury.  
defaultWe would support 
defaulta full ban in the keeping of primates as pets for private owners. 
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn relation to private ownership for conservation, only species for which a genuine conservation need has been recognised 
defaultshould
default be able to be kept.  It is acknowledged that not all profess
defaultionally recognised controlled breeding programmes admit private 
defaultindividuals.  Nevertheless, if private individuals were able to participate in such programmes, this could be a permitted purpose for private primate ownership.
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCare for the Wild believes that
default all those keeping primates for a permitted purpose should follow a government 
defaultendorsed
default detailed, speci
defaultes-appropriate code of practice that promotes a high level of care, coupled with a licensing or registration scheme.
