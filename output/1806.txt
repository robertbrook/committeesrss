[[[&#xa0;]]]voluntary lines why this should be so&#xa0;We have a radio interview that was commented upon by Louise Ellman which was given by Barbara our 85 year &#xa0; service user, passenger assistant and board member should you require a copy please get in touch&#xa0;Shropshire has come together to form a consortium of Community transport operators Because of the shortness of time I was unfortunately unable to solicit all opinions although the group were in favour of sending you a response&#xa0;&#xa0;This is therefore the opinion of NORTH SALOP WHEELERS The details of which are at the end of this message&#xa0;.................................&#xa0;AN influential committee of MPs is calling for evidence on passenger transport in isolated communities.&#xa0;The&#xa0;inquiry by the House of Commons Transport Committee&#xa0;believes all communities should have access to adequate transport services.Committee chairman Louise Ellman said: "People from different communities across the UK should have access to adequate transport services."We will be looking at how best to meet the needs of passengers in isolated communities, including rural areas, island communities, and suburban or urban areas with poor transport connections."We are particularly interested in the provision of bus and rail services, as well as the role of Community Transport services."The Committee intends to hear oral evidence in the Autumn. Ahead of this, it would like to receive written evidence on the following points:&#xa0;&#xa0;How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?&#xa0;Sometimes local survey are undertaken, but from experience figures come from former subsidised bus routes that are cancelled because of reducing populations and an increased dependency on personal transportWe originally conducted our own assessment of need under a project called the “Vital Villages Scheme” 10 years ago&#xa0;&#xa0;*To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;We always try to take a holistic view when planning vehicle purchase so that our services are available to the largest number of people possible&#xa0;*What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;Only one really adequate funding we need someone to recognise the large distances we cover serving isolated people and make provision to fund the services we provide accordingly &#xa0;Example each Friday we connect two market towns, actual distance 16 miles our shoppers bus covers at least 70 miles each time connecting those isolated communities&#xa0;*How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;Local services are the only way to maintain an adequate link with the outside world for these people and usually this is best served by CT. CT work needs properly recognising and funding Example The recent 20% cut in our BSOG has hit us all badly&#xa0;*To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?&#xa0;Taxis usage is largely dependent on ability to pay. Low incomes in the rural community make reliance on taxis difficult&#xa0;&#xa0;DRT should always be us.ed because of the associated costs of running a traditional service&#xa0;*What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable? &#xa0;The main challenge is one of distance and associated fuel costOur services are affordable we currently make a vehicle available to community groups cheaper than anyone else because of our innovative attitude to fuel We have most of our vehilce running on LPG&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
