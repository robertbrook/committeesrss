[normal]Witness: 
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross[bold],[bold] Chief Executive, OFWAT
[normal] gave evidence.  
[normal]Chair[bold]: Good afternoon and welcome, 
[normal]Cathryn
[normal]. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you as the new Chief Executive Officer of Ofwat. Before we start, just a little bit of housekeeping if I may: are there any declarations of interest anybody would like to make?
[normal]Mr [bold]Spencer[bold]: [bold]Chair, can I draw the Committee’s attention to my declaration of interest, particularly that I currently have two abstraction licences?
[normal]Q1 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair: [bold]Thank you very much indeed. First of all, 
[normal]Cathryn
[normal], could I ask you to tell us a little bit about your background and what makes you particularly well qualified to be Chief Executive?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] [bold]Ross[bold]: I have been Chief Executive of Ofwat for the grand total of five and a half weeks. Prior to that, I was Executive Director of Railway Markets and Economics at the Office of Rail Regulation where, literally this October, we delivered our periodic review of Network Rail. Prior to that, I was at Ofwat, so I have been away from Ofwat for two and a half years now while I was at ORR. While I was at Ofwat, I was Executive Director of Markets and Economics. Prior to that, I was at the Competition Commission as the Director of Remedies and Business Analysis—basically, leading on the question of what we do to make markets work better if we think that there is a problem with a market. Before that, I worked at various other regulators as an economist and in consultancy as an economist also.
[normal]Q2 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you. Would you like to share with us your immediate priorities on taking up office, some of which have been dictated for you?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross[bold]: 
[normal]I am not sure about that. The first thing I would like to say is thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you so early on. I think it will be very helpful to me to have this conversation at this stage in my tenure.
[normal] 
[normal]I suppose really there is just one priority for me coming into Ofwat, and that is customers. Our primary statutory duty is to protect the interests of customers, and one of the things that I have found most impressive coming back to Ofwat, very much in the same way as when I 
[normal]was there last time, is the level of commitment from the staff in the organisation to delivering against that duty. 
[normal]At the moment, there are two main priorities for us as an organisation. The first, which will not surprise you at all, is the periodic review, and the second is the Water Bill and changes to water markets, thinking though what that means and how best to deliver benefits for customers. Obviously in delivering for customers we need to make sure that we challenge ourselves as a regulator continually to improve, to adopt best practice and to innovate, in order to keep the companies on their toes and also to challenge ourselves to deliver as best we can. I suppose my final priority for Ofwat is to make sure that we, as an organisation, really are at the very top of our game making the best of the contribution of all the people who work for us to deliver for customers.
[normal]Q3 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]What do you see as the main regulatory challenges facing Ofwat and how do you see the regulatory regime for England, Scotland and Wales developing?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross[bold]: 
[normal]Regulation in the water industry since privatisation has been a real success story. An enormous amount has been delivered. You will have heard some of those things before—we often talk about the £116
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion worth of investments since privatisation and the challenge that Ofwat has brought to bear on bills, which means they are a third lower than they would otherwise have been. 
[normal]There is a real success story, but the regulatory environment is getting increasingly challenging. The economic climate at the moment makes it really important that we continue to challenge the companies hard to deliver for their customers, but also really to think about the implications of that for bills and to try to push them to deliver efficiently. Water regulation is particularly interesting in this regard, because you have a real nexus of issues around affordability and customer bills, the environment and investment in economic growth. They all come together in water regulation. 
[normal]Q4 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I know in the recent past Ofwat has engaged at quite an early stage with the European Commission on some of the draft proposals coming through. Is that something that you as a new CEO intend to continue? In answering that, are you able to say what you think the impact of implementing on such a tight timetable some of the provisions in, for example, the Water Framework Directive has on customer bills?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I do not think I can get into the detailed impacts of the Water Framework Directive, but I can say that I do believe in early engagement with the Commission on these proposals that come out, not least because they do drive not an enormous proportion of customer bills, but a significant proportion of customer bills. At the last price review, roughly £15 on the average bill was accounted for by environmental improvements coming out of the European Union. It is important that we continue to engage, but it is also really important that the companies engage as well. What you would expect to see in a normal market, in a competitive market, is companies looking at obligations that were being placed on them by Governments, both in the UK and at the European level, and really challenging hard as part of that process, in terms of whether they were really cost
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]beneficial
[normal] and value for money. Yes, I think Ofwat has a job to do there, but the companies and the industry have a job to do as well.
[normal]Q5 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]So that we understand, and before we go on to corporate structure and governance, could you explain how you have slightly changed the structure of the directors at Ofwat?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross[bold]: Sure, absolutely. Obviously, as Chief Exec, I sit across the organisation. One of the changes we made in the summer was to promote Sonia Brown into the role of Chief Regulation Officer, a really critical role for us, because that allows Sonia to range across all of our regulatory policy and provide that consistency, overview and focus. I have also taken steps since I was appointed to strengthen the senior leadership team at Ofwat, which is really important to me. 
[normal]As well as Sonia, we have as part of that team a number of senior directors who have particular portfolios. One of those is Keith Mason, who is our Senior Director of Finance and Networks. Another new appointment for us is Richard 
[normal]Khaldi
[normal], who is joining us from the Water Industry Commission for Scotland in January, with a portfolio that focuses on customers and case work. We also have a new Director of Corporate Communications, Claire Forbes, whose background is in the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, and we have just appointed a new Operations Director, Bev 
[normal]Messinger
[normal], who, before a number of interim roles, was Deputy Chief Exec at Coventry City Council. 
[normal]Essentially what you are looking at in the structure there is the Chief Executive at the top, the Chief Regulation Officer in Sonia Brown, and essentially a sort of Operating Director role, looking at how we work as an organisation, in Bev 
[normal]Messinger
[normal]. Probably one more thing just to put on the record is we are currently out to recruit a new General Counsel.
[normal]Q6 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Ms Ritchie:[bold] 
[normal]Do you think that the high levels of debt held by the water companies are an appropriate structure for companies that provide a vital public service?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] Our view on that is that the capital structures that the companies choose must be a matter for them. Now, that comes with some caveats because in choosing their capital structures, the companies must make sure that they can finance the performance of their functions. To the extent that, if the proverbial hits the fan, they cannot, then their owners are on risk for that. Not only do the companies have to make the choice about the capital structures, it is the companies that bear the costs associated with that choice.
[normal]Q7 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Ms Ritchie:[bold] Does the high level of borrowing by the water companies pose any risk to the resilience of our essential infrastructure?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross: [bold]No.
[normal]Q8 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Ms Ritchie:[bold] How do customers benefit from the tax
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]efficient
[normal] structures put in place by water companies, which have led to such high profits over the past few years?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross: [bold]Two points on that: the first is that, as the regulator, as I said before, one of our jobs is to challenge the companies to be as efficient as possible in order to keep bills down for customers. I recognise that there is a public debate at the moment about the tax system. That is, to be honest, a matter for HMRC rather than the water regulator, but I do acknowledge that there is that public debate at the moment.
[normal]Q9 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Ms Ritchie:[bold] How will Ofwat encourage companies to comply with its high
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]level board governance principles?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] We have been doing a lot of work over the past 12 months with companies on this, and we have actually been quite pleased by the response. What we have done is we 
[normal]have said to the companies that, as providers of essential public services that have a really key role to play in our society, we expect them to operate at the highest levels of transparency and board leadership. There are two things that we have done in respect of that. The first is that we have developed a set of principles that we expect the companies to follow. We have taken those principles to the companies and consulted them, and they have all agreed to follow those, which means that we can follow a self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]regulatory
[normal] approach through a code of practice there and that is what we are going to do. 
[normal]The other thing is that, as part of the periodic review, we have been absolutely adamant that company boards must own their business plans. We have required board assurance as one of the key tests that will determine whether companies’ business plans are graded as enhanced, standard or resubmit. There is an added incentive there on the boards really to grip their plans.
[normal]Q10 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Neil Parish:[bold] Going back to the question about the high level of profits of water companies, do you actually feel that greater competition in the retail sector would be one way of bringing down those profits and getting a better deal for customers? Most private enterprise works on competition; is there enough in the water industry? 
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] The short answer to that is I do not think that there is enough competition in the water industry. With that in mind, I very much welcome the provisions in the Water Bill to introduce competition at the retail level for non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]household
[normal] customers. As to the effect on profits, time will tell. I am not going to gaze into my crystal ball on that one, but it certainly should deliver a better deal for customers.
[normal]Q11 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Is there cause for any particular concern about the financial position of any of the water companies?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I do not think that there is and I will explain why. It goes back to the answer that I was giving to Ms
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ritchie that, essentially, the companies’ corporate capital structures are a matter for them to choose. They bear the risk associated with that choice and one thing that we are confident in is that, if the worst happens and the company does get into financial difficulty, there is a really robust system there of special administration that will ensure that customers are held harmless—the taps will continue to turn on; loos will continue to be flushed; services will continue to be provided—and the assets will remain in service, while the shareholders essentially end up having to sell those assets on to another buyer in order to get themselves out of financial difficulty. That is very much at the risk of the shareholders and not at the risk of customers. 
[normal]Q12 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Iain McKenzie[bold]: Good afternoon, 
[normal]Cathryn
[normal]. You have already, in a few of your answers, alluded to a focus on customers. With that in mind, the question is about a redress scheme and dispute resolution. Could you tell us how and when Ofwat will introduce a redress scheme for customers? Is this being co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordinated with the Consumer Council for Water?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] It is coming in 
[normal]in
[normal] spring 2014. The exact date is still to be decided, but it is coming in 
[normal]in
[normal] spring next year. It has been introduced very much in consultation with the Consumer Council for Water, which has been very helpful in getting us to the position that we are at. Absolutely; they have been part of that process.
[normal]Q13 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheryll Murray:[bold] Could I turn to the social tariffs, please? Why do you think that only three water companies have introduced social tariffs for vulnerable customers? Is there any evidence to show that more will be moving that way?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] To answer your second question first, as Sonia was saying earlier, we have just received the company business plans and there are several more social tariffs in there. Why were companies perhaps slightly slow off the mark? I honestly do not know, and that is something that, when I talk to the companies, I should ask them. You will remember one of the things that came up yesterday in the Water Bill Committee, to just sort of turn back to that debate, were some of these questions around why companies were slow off the mark. I recall Mr Wesley from Water UK explaining that there are a number of things that companies are doing in addition to social tariffs, but maybe that is something that I could ask the water companies as I speak to them in the next few months.
[normal]Q14 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheryll Murray:[bold] Could you give us some examples of what they are doing in addition? Are there any alternatives that you think will address the affordability situation for struggling householders in the short term?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] Affordability is a huge issue. It is really why I was alluding to this point about the economic climate really colouring the conversations that we are having about the water industry and water regulation at the moment. It is a complex issue. Social tariffs are one part of the answer to that; they are an important part of the answer, but there are other things that are important as well. 
[normal]What we have been doing through the periodic review is challenge companies to talk to their customers, particularly different customer groups. Do not just talk to your average typical customer, but actually go out of your way to talk to some of the vulnerable customer groups and some of the people who are genuinely finding it tough to pay their bills, understand why and do things that work for the customers in your area. Social tariffs may be part of that. Working with citizens advice bureaux may be another part of that. There may be things that could be done short of social tariffs, as a rung above the social tariff, to help those customers who perhaps do not quite qualify for social tariffs but are still having a tough time. There are a number of things there. All of those things are available to companies and I am expecting to see quite a number of them coming through in the business plans that we got a couple of days ago.
[normal]Q15 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheryll Murray:[bold] Do you know of any additional companies at the moment or have you got a number that you could perhaps give us of companies that are moving towards this?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I do. Could I take that away and write to you on that, because I am not entirely sure how much of which companies’ plans are public? I can say that there are more companies moving in the direction of social tariffs than we have at the moment. 
[normal]Q16 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Most of them have charitable foundations as well, do they not? Is that the way they deliver a cheaper tariff there? Does it have a different title?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] Yes. It tends not to fall under the category of “social tariffs”. It is another one of the things that the companies do to help customers who are having difficulty paying their bills.
[normal]Chair[bold]: We could possibly write to Water
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UK as well, and then they can let us know which are in the public domain and which are not. If you could let us know, that would be most helpful. Thanks very much indeed. 
[normal]Q17 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Roger Williams:[bold] It is said that during the process of price review Ofwat will be able to reduce the pressure on customers’ bills by between £120
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million and £750
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million. How are you 
[normal]going to do that? When you are looking at best value for customers, what elements of the service do you take into consideration?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] You are right that we did identify scope for reductions in bills of that order. We were very clear a few weeks ago to the companies that we would expect companies to reduce bills to customers or explain to them very clearly why not. How is that reduction going to be delivered? Well, there are probably two things that are worth drawing out particularly. The first is that, given changes in the economic climate between five years ago and now, companies’ costs of financing are lower than they were. That is a big driver of that reduction. 
[normal]Secondly, it goes back to this point about the changes that we have introduced to the periodic review that allow companies more flexibility to choose different ways of delivering the things their customers want. Probably the biggest most important one of those is the fact that we are not distinguishing between capital expenditure and treating it one way, and operating expenditure and treating it another way; we are just saying to the companies, “You need to deliver what your customers want and you need to come up with the cheapest, most efficient cost, of doing that.” We think that is going to deliver quite a number of savings. In fact, you can see in the water resource management plans produced this year the difference that that approach has made. Whereas the previous resource management plans had a roughly 90/10 split between capital and operating expenditure, it is now 50/50. That is a big saving in itself. I would say those are the two main drivers. 
[normal]Q18 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Roger Williams:[bold] You are going to be very tough with these water companies. How are you going to ensure that they have resilience in order to continue to deliver good water through the taps and through the toilets in homes, and get rid of the sewage as well?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] It goes right the way back to the fundamental principle of water companies having to deliver what their customers want. As Sonia said earlier, what customers want is a resilient service. They want to be able to turn the tap on and be confident that the water will come out. They want to be able to flush the loo and be confident that stuff will be taken away. If water companies are not delivering that, then I am afraid we will be telling them that they have to deliver that.
[normal]Q19 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Roger Williams:[bold] Water companies seem to me to be cash
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]negative
[normal] organisations. That is they are always having to either borrow or spend more than they get in, so to speak. Is that a long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term model that can be continued? For instance, I was told—I do not know if it is true—that in terms of replacing sewers at the moment, it is on the basis that sewers are going to last for 600 years. Is this a proper sustainable model for a modern business?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I honestly do not know about the 600
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]year
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]lasting sewer asset, but you are right that certainly a lot of the water businesses are cash
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]negative
[normal]. Essentially what that means is that it is really important, if the companies are going to continue to deliver for their customers, that these companies remain investable propositions, because it is access to private finance that allows continued delivery in a way that means that customers get what they want; they do not face unduly high bills in the here and now, and the burden does not fall back on the public purse. If we can maintain the companies as investable propositions, then that model can continue going forward. 
[normal]Q20 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Fitzpatrick:[bold] Ms Ross, congratulations on your appointment. One of the first decisions that you either must have made or inherited was the decision to decline Thames Water’s interim price increase. Can you just tell us all about the dynamic behind that? Is that now concluded? Does 
[normal]Thames
[normal] have an appeal? Is there an impact on other water companies, because of the criteria you used to decline their interim request?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] A number of questions in there. First, the decision to decline the 
[normal]Thames
[normal] request was taken or was achieved by us on 8
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]November, so it was while I was around. You asked about the dynamic. On one level, it was fairly straightforward: 
[normal]Thames
[normal] came in with a request to us to raise customers’ bills by £29. They argued that that was because of additional costs that they had incurred, primarily in relation to the acquisition of land for the Tideway project, additional costs from transfer of private sewers and for bad debt particularly associated with the recession. There was also an element in that of charges from the Environment Agency as well. 
[normal]We did our job; we looked at that, very much from the point of view of our statutory duty to protect customers. We concluded that, if we were going to allow Thames to put up customers’ bills, there would have to be a very compelling case. We looked at the evidence that Thames had brought forward and we concluded that there was not that compelling case, and that was why we turned down their interim determination request. 
[normal]Is it all over? Maybe; maybe not. Thames has the right to make a request to us that we refer the matter to the Competition Commission. They have two months after the date of our decision, so that is basically until 8 January. If they make that request, the test is basically whether it is a reasonable request, and if it is we have to refer it to the Competition Commission. If they make such a request, the likelihood is there would be a reference to the Competition Commission, and then I believe the Competition Commission would have three months in which to look at our decision and decide whether to reopen that or not.
[normal]Q21 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Fitzpatrick:[bold] Any impact on other water companies?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] In terms of turning down the 
[normal]IDoK
[normal], not directly. Of course, we are aware of certain other companies—South West is one of them—which did face some of the same sort of costs that were part of the Thames interim determination request, and which decided not to come in with an 
[normal]IDoK
[normal] request to us. That was another element in our evidence that we considered in declining the 
[normal]Thames
[normal] request.
[normal]Q22 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Neil Parish:[bold] In order to increase clarity and certainty, should the Bill include a target date by which the Government will publish its mandatory charging rules guidance and, if so, when are you expecting this to be?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I am not going to comment on whether the Bill should contain a mandatory target date, but what I would say is, if we could have the guidance as soon as possible, that would be extremely helpful. Unsurprisingly, I suppose what I am saying is unsurprising because we have the periodic review at the moment; we are going to be determining charges over the next year. If we had that guidance, it would be much easier for us to do that. 
[normal]Q23 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Neil Parish:[bold] Especially where different water companies border each other, if you are going to see different prices coming out, which you do, should that not put more pressure on those companies that are charging more for their water than perhaps the neighbour? 
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] Yes, I think it should, but again it goes back to this point about companies really needing to deliver what their customers want at a price they are willing to pay. It must be true, and we can see this coming through the business plans, that what customers want and are willing to pay for varies area to area. The economies are different; the geology and natural environment are different; the demographics are different. Where you see that most acutely is around water company boundaries, where you may well have customers on one side of the street with one bill and on the other side of the street with the other. That does put the onus very much on the company really to explain to customers why that is happening. In that 
[normal]situation, the company with the higher bills is going to have to do an extremely good job of that. 
[normal]Q24 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Neil Parish:[bold] Is it not very much the case with customers that, if you ask them if they want a lot of extra services, they say yes, then if they land up having to pay for it they are rather inclined to say no. How do you balance that?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I suppose the first answer to that is that is the challenge we have given the companies, as part of their business plans. Precisely how well they have done that is going to be a critical part of how well we think they have done in their business plans, which will then feed into how much money they get over the next control period. Companies have taken different approaches to this, but you can go through a process of working with customers to say, “Okay, what would you like to see? If this is what you want to see, then this is how much it would cost. If this is how much it would cost, would you be willing to pay for that?” and then you can iterate that. There are very well established research ways of doing that. [Interruption.] 
[normal]Neil Parish:[bold] Thank you very much. We have to vote.
[normal]Chair:[bold] We stand adjourned and we will come back as soon as we can. 
[normal]Sitting suspended for a Division in the House. 
[normal]On resuming—
[normal]Chair:[bold] We will resume. Thank you very much indeed for your patience. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q25 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mr Spencer:[bold] I would just like to talk sewage for a while, if that is alright. How is Ofwat going to promote the long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term investment so we have the resilience within the network to make sure that the sewage companies deliver their primary obligations?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I am not sure I see any difference in the fundamental approach that we are taking on the sewerage side, as compared to on the water side. It goes exactly back to this fundamental issue of what levels of resilience customers want to see and what they are willing to pay for. That is what companies need to do and, in a sense, that is the conversation we are having with them at the moment in the context of the periodic review. Of course, once we have done the periodic review and we have put our settlement out there, then the companies need to deliver on what they have promised their customers they would get, and then we need to stand behind that and make sure that, if they do not, appropriate sanctions are taken.
[normal]Q26 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mr[bold] 
[normal]Spencer[bold]: Is not one of the challenges that some of the customers who might not want to pay are not the customers with a problem with the sewerage network? If you are at the bottom of the hill and the sewerage system does not have the capacity, then you will be willing to pay a substantial premium to try to solve that problem. If you are at the top of the hill and, every time you flush the toilet, it goes away and that is fine, then you are not going to be as enthused. How are you going to solve that problem in trying to get enough capacity and investment into the network, when some of the customers frankly do not have a problem?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I can see what you are saying, but one of the things that we see when we look at company business plans is that customers are willing to pay for improvements that other people will experience, even if they do not directly affect them. A lot of it is about how the company goes about asking the question. I think it is possible to get customers to agree to pay for improvements in service standards that will be more beneficial to other people than just to them. Then again, that goes into the issue of, once what the company needs to deliver 
[normal]becomes part of the periodic review settlement, we need to stand behind that and make sure that they do what they said they would do.
[normal]Q27 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mr Spencer:[bold] Of course you have your secondary sustainability duty and your primary resilience duty. Do you foresee a circumstance where there is a clash and you have to choose one over the other?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I would not call it a “clash”. This is always true for regulators: you have different statutory duties that potentially take you in slightly different directions. One of the things that you do routinely is balance those. For us, it will keep coming back to this question of what is it customers want and what are they willing to pay for. All of our statutory duties we look at very much through that lens but, of course, customers are not just individuals here and now. There are future customers and there are people who essentially use the services or benefit from the services that water companies provide, which are not the people who just narrowly pay for them. It is that wider expanded group of customers that we are taking into account in our statutory duty. Actually, I think it is perfectly possible to reconcile things like the sustainable development duty with the protecting customers duty. I do not think there is a clash there, but there is a balance to be struck in how one interprets that.
[normal]Q28 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mr Spencer:[bold] Quickly, on the obligation to connect, I just wondered whether you see that as something of benefit or a problem. If you have a network that is under stress and a developer builds a large development on the side of a village, there is an obligation to connect without necessarily the obligation to solve that problem fully downstream.
[normal]Chair:[bold] I think you are signed up to ending the automatic right to connect.
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] From week five and a half, I am afraid it is not an issue that I have engaged with, but I would be happy to take it away and get back to you.
[normal]Mr Spencer:[bold] Yes, that would be useful.
[normal]Q29 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Iain McKenzie:[bold] The Government has amended the Water Bill to strengthen 
[normal]Ofwat’s
[normal] enforcement powers. Which of these new enforcement powers would you say would be most effective in practice?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] Which of 
[normal]Ofwat’s
[normal] enforcement powers or which of the changes in the Water Bill?
[normal]Iain McKenzie[bold]: The enforcement powers.
[normal]Chair:[bold] It is the function of the separation of companies that we discussed privately earlier.
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] What I was going to say—if I am in the wrong territory, tell me—is I think one of the things that is a real benefit in terms of the changes in the Water Bill is the ability for us to go back five years to investigate breaches of licences, as the Water Bill allows us to do, because at the moment we can only go back one year. I was going to say is that that is a huge benefit to us and something that I would expect we would make use of. That was going to be my biggest single change from the Water Bill that will benefit customers, but I am not sure if that is what you are getting at. 
[normal]Q30 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Iain McKenzie:[bold] No, I think that answers. That seems to be what you would recommend as the most beneficial. You talk about going back five years instead of one. Would you do that review generally, across the board, or would you apply maybe two years to some or three years? Is it a general rule that you would go back five instead?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] At the moment, one year is a constraint. Certainly, I remember from when I was at Ofwat previously, it takes a while sometimes before you became aware of an issue; it takes a while before you really understand what is going on. Actually, only to be able to act within 12 months is quite constraining, so the ability to go back five years with the Water Bill is really welcome. It does not mean that we will automatically go back five years in every case. What it means is that we have the ability to go back further and, frankly, with the ability to go back five years, we would find ourselves relatively unconstrained to take a sensible decision about how far back to go in any individual case. It is really about removing that constraint on our ability to act, which is what is so welcome about it.
[normal]Q31 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Roger Williams:[bold] Bad debts are a real problem in terms of both the water companies and indeed customers. It has been suggested that they have a voluntary approach for sharing information between landlords and water companies, via an online database, working effectively to address the problem of bad debt in the water industry. What is your view on that?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] A voluntary approach is helpful. What we have achieved, in terms of talking to the companies about this and getting that voluntary approach, really does move us on. There is a question about whether it will be sufficient, but is it much better than what we have? Yes, it absolutely is.
[normal]Q32 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Roger Williams:[bold] In general, when you have a bad debt—a really bad debt—should that be paid for by the other customers or should it be paid for by the water companies and the people who invest in them?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] The reality at the moment is that it is paid by other customers. The average bill in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] has roughly £15 in it that relates to bad debt. Of course, what the companies need to do is get that down as part of being as efficient as they can be and delivering for customers at the most efficient cost. There are a number of tools that they can use to do that. Social tariffs is one, and we have three companies at the moment with social tariffs and we are expecting to see more as we go through the business plans. There are other tools they have in their toolkit, but they absolutely have to work hard to get that bad debt down, because it is a really significant cost.
[normal]Q33 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Roger Williams:[bold] Would one of those tools be going back to the old system of trickle, rather than cut
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]off?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I know that is a really controversial issue. At the moment, that is not on the table in the same way as disconnection is not on the table. It is not really for us to make the running on that debate, because that is something that Parliament would need to discuss and decide on. In terms of the options that water companies do have on the table, we are challenging them really hard to make sure they have thoroughly explored all of those, including but not limited to social tariffs, to get that bad debt cost down.
[normal]Q34 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Jim Fitzpatrick:[bold] I wanted to ask whether there was enough of an incentive on the water companies to pursue bad debts. If they can transfer it to other paying customers, then is there enough incentive, and can you incentivise them to pursue bad debt, rather than just load it on to customers, when we are all paying £15 to cover that?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] That is exactly what we are trying to do with the periodic review—we are trying to give them that incentive. If we are not satisfied that the companies are doing everything that they can to get that bad debt cost down, we may well not allow them to recover that cost from customers.
[normal]Q35 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Is there any reason why the 2010 Act provisions on bad debt should not be implemented? Is there any particular reason why the Government has chosen not to implement the 2010 provisions on bad debt?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross[bold]: I am afraid I have no idea. I can look into it and get back to you.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]It would be helpful if you could, thank you.
[normal] 
[normal]Q36 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mrs Lewell-Buck:[bold] Hi, 
[normal]Cathryn
[normal]. How do you co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordinate action with the Environment Agency when the water companies fail to deliver their agreed environmental performance?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] The first point on that is that we have been absolutely clear with the water companies that in their business plans that they have submitted to us this week they need to demonstrate compliance with their environmental obligations. It is absolutely no use a water company coming into us with a business plan, even if it is a business plan with low bills, that does not demonstrate compliance with their environmental obligations. That is not acceptable, so that is the way that that comes into the periodic review.
[normal]In terms of how we co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordinate with the Environment Agency, what we have done in the periodic review this time is built the Environment Agency into the process of customer challenge that the companies have had to go through. We have required the companies to go through this customer challenge process, and essentially what we have done is built the Environment Agency into that, so that there is a broad conversation with customers about all the different aspects of what the company is delivering, some of which are around environmental improvements. That gives the ability to see what environmental improvements are possible, but also to have the conversation about how much they might cost and then to come to a conclusion on what they are willing to pay for, beyond the minimal obligations that the companies are required to comply with.
[normal]Q37 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mrs Lewell-Buck[bold]: With that in mind, in the past the Environment Agency’s fines have been quite low and the likelihood of fines has been at quite a low level, so do you think they actually act as a deterrent or not?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I am afraid that is probably more of a question for the Environment Agency than for me.
[normal]Q38 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mrs Lewell-Buck[bold]: In terms of reducing environmental pollution, does that lie in greater infrastructure as opposed to better processes and checks, or more stringent enforcement?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] Reducing environmental pollution is one of those outcomes that companies have been talking to their customers about. Do customers want to see a significant reduction in environmental pollution beyond that statutory minimum? In terms of how the companies deliver that, that is very much a matter for them. Our challenge to them is that they need to deliver what their customers want, which may well include a reduction in environmental pollution, at the lowest cost. It may be that a capital solution is appropriate, but actually what we would really like to see is companies not rushing to pour concrete, not rushing to expensive capital solutions, but thinking a little bit more creatively about how they might be able to reduce environmental pollution in a more innovative way. One of the examples there is the work that 
[normal]Wessex
[normal] has been doing with the agricultural community on catchment management, so it is possible to do that.
[normal]Q39 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] I am very conscious of your time. I just have some quick
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]fire
[normal] questions if I may. Should abstraction not have been included in the Bill, particularly when upstream competition is?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] Where we are on abstraction with the Bill means that it is something that we are going to have to come back to. As I said, the Bill does represent a significant step forward in terms of upstream trading, but it is not going to be the last word on this. The thing that we are going to have to do is learn from the sorts of things that the Bill will allow to take place, learn from the abstraction incentive mechanism that we are putting in place through the periodic review and then see what the appropriate next steps are to take it on to the next level. I think there is further work to be done on that. 
[normal]Q40 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] In our report, our pre
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]legislative
[normal] scrutiny, we came down firmly in favour of company wholesale and retail arms being separated and a retail exit. Does Ofwat have a view on the Government’s unwillingness to agree to those and the reasons perhaps for that unwillingness?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross[bold]: I do not have a view particularly on the Government’s reasons, but I have a very strong view on the question of retail exit. I think it is critically important for an effective retail market and, in particular, critically important for the delivery of the maximum benefits to customers from that retail market because, without retail exit, essentially what we are doing is baking in inefficient retail costs that customers are going to have to pay for. I am very much in favour, as you are, of retail exit.
[normal]Q41 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Again on the guidance produced by Government on your charging rules, we requested that these be laid and be open for scrutiny as part of the Water Bill. Obviously we are very disappointed that they have not been. Is there any reason that they should not have been open to scrutiny in the normal way?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] None that I am aware of.
[normal]Q42 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] I think Mark wanted to come in again on sewerage, if we just have a couple of minutes. Could I just ask to what you think you attribute the fact, if it is true, that Ofwat seems to have been more successful in limiting the increase in customer bills than, say, Ofgem has been? If you look at the 10% increases, which seems to be the average increase that has happened in the energy sector, to what do you attribute your regulatory regime’s success?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] The obvious example there is that we have direct regulatory powers over the retail bill that customers pay in a way that Ofgem no longer does.
[normal]Q43 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Was that because of the Energy Act?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] I would not be able to tell you which piece of legislation it was, but Ofgem no longer regulates the prices that customers pay directly. They regulate the wholesale prices associated with the networks but not those prices that consumers pay. Arguably, the market is not working as effectively as it might, which is of course why we have the Ofgem-Competition and Markets Authority study going on, at the moment.
[normal]Q44 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] On the bad debt issue, I got an answer back that it is more the affordability aspect. The Department for Work and Pensions seems to be moving; they are not saying that they are not minded to share the information; they are now saying that the law does not permit the information to be shared. It strikes me that, if we can actually release the information of those most vulnerable customers who are on benefits to the water companies, that will help them introduce a social tariff or a more affordable tariff.
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross: [bold]Not just social tariffs, but also managing the affordability issues more widely. I do think it would be helpful. The only caveat I would put on it is the fact that that is not available at the moment should not give the water companies a get
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]out
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]jail
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]free card. There is a lot that they can do right now, and they should be getting on and doing it
[normal]. [bold]Q45 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Would you act as a champion with the Department for Work and Pensions to ask that they do consider this?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross: [bold]We would be more than happy to discuss it with DWP and try to work through the issues with them.
[normal]Q46 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mr Spencer:[bold] When we were talking about the obligation to connect, it struck me that you are, in effect, in the hot seat and being asked to deliver on resilience within the system, but other Departments can influence that. DCLG is in charge of building regulations and other Government Departments like Defra are in charge of abstraction licences and all those sorts. My question is: how keen are you going to be to engage with those Government Departments and how keen do you think they are going to be to listen to you?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross: [bold]That is a really important issue for us. The approach we have taken to the periodic review this time has been very much focused, as we keep saying, on what customers want. We need to recognise that what customers want is not as simple as what water companies provide and the stuff that Ofwat regulates; it is a more complicated picture than that. One of the things we need to think about as a regulator is what our role is, perhaps in a more facilitative, more collaborative mode, in making sure that customers get what they want and are willing to pay for, even where it is not quite as narrow as being something within our jurisdiction or within the ambit of the water companies.
[normal]Q47 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mr Spencer:[bold] My constituents get enormously frustrated with the planning system, in that they recognised that there is an issue with the sewerage system in their community; the water company is obliged to connect a new development, and nobody seems to have the teeth to say to the water company, “You must address this issue before the planning permission is granted.” Is that something you can be involved in?
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross: [bold]I would happily look into that. 
[normal]Q48 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Effectively, our recommendation in the report that water companies be made statutory 
[normal]consultees
[normal] on major developments would surely cover that point.
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross[bold]: That seems very sensible. As I said before, I am happy to look into issues around connection. It is not something I have grappled with in the last few weeks, but I would be happy to look into it for you.
[normal]Q49 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] It strikes me there is a gap in the law currently. For one thing, the sustainable drainage systems have not come into effect. Is the fact that this surface water is coming off the highway and not going into a SUDS, but is going into the combined sewers, something you could use your good offices to try to address? To me, it is something that should be addressed in the Water Bill, but it clearly is not. Is that something you could use your good offices for? It strikes me as very unfair that in my area, Yorkshire Water, and your area, Severn Trent, are getting the blame when it is not their fault. The customer thinks that because sewage is coming into their homes, it is clearly the fault of the water company. I would argue that it is the fault of the water coming off the road into the combined sewer, and it could be addressed by creating a SUDS at the side of the catchment road.
[normal]Cathryn[bold] Ross:[bold] 
[normal]It goes back to what I was saying before. If we take as our jumping
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]off
[normal] point what customers really want to see in terms of services relating to water, that is a bigger picture than just water companies and it is a bigger picture than just the stuff that Ofwat regulates narrowly. We need to think as a regulator about how we can help to make sure that customers do get the services that they want, even perhaps where it is slightly 
[normal]outwith
[normal] our narrow remit.
[normal] 
[normal]Q50 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Can I on behalf of the Committee thank you and your whole team for the briefing we had earlier? Thank you very much for being so generous with your time. We wish you every success in your new role. I am sure we will have opportunity to invite you back, but particularly we shall watch very carefully the price review and the passage of the Water Bill. Thank you very much indeed.
