[normal]CYCLING SAFETY
[normal] – Changing 
[normal]rule  163
[normal] of the Highway code.
[normal]As more cyclists venture onto the road drivers unused to sharing the road with 
[normal]bicycles  frequently
[normal]  treat  cyclists as they would other cars passing within close proximity often at speed.
[normal]Currently “Rule 163 of the Highway Code adds that a driver should give cyclists ‘at least as much room’ as you would a car,”
[normal] 
[normal]This is far too vague and subjective 
[normal].It
[normal] 
[normal]ignores 
[normal] completely
[normal] 
[normal]the inherent difference in the risk involved in passing a four wheele
[normal]d vehicle in which the driver is enclosed in the vehicle
[normal] and that in passing  a two wheeled vehicle which is subject to wind or road surface  irregularities that can deflect the path of the rider.
[normal]New drivers and indeed current drivers need to be given 
[normal]una
[normal]mbiguous  directions
[normal] on what a genuinely safe distance to allow is. 
[normal]In other 
[normal]countries ,
[normal] Germany &amp; Spain  for example there is a clearly stated 1.5 metre passing standard written into law.  Other areas have mandated minimum 3 ft limit 
[normal]yet  the
[normal] UK apparent
[normal]ly has nothing beyond the bland statement &amp; potentially misleading advice in rule 163.
[normal]Changing this to a specific distance and ensuring that 
[normal]drivers ,new
[normal] and old  become aware of this is a crucial  step in creating a safer environment on our roads for cyc
[normal]les and for car drivers.
[normal]Obviously  this
[normal] is in the interests of cyclists but  there will be many well-intentioned but  ill-informed  drivers who armed with this awareness may  as a result  not experience the trauma of being involved in what are frequently 
[normal]serious or deadly bicycle car collisions.
