default – Changing 
defaultrule  163
default of the Highway code.
defaultAs more cyclists venture onto the road drivers unused to sharing the road with 
defaultbicycles  frequently
default  treat  cyclists as they would other cars passing within close proximity often at speed.
defaultCurrently “Rule 163 of the Highway Code adds that a driver should give cyclists ‘at least as much room’ as you would a car,”
default 
defaultThis is far too vague and subjective 
default.It
default 
defaultignores

default 
defaultthe inherent difference in the risk involved in passing a four wheele
defaultd vehicle in which the driver is enclosed in the vehicle
default and that in passing  a two wheeled vehicle which is subject to wind or road surface  irregularities that can deflect the path of the rider.
defaultNew drivers and indeed current drivers need to be given 
defaultuna
defaultmbiguous  directions
default on what a genuinely safe distance to allow is. 
defaultIn other 
defaultcountries ,
default Germany &amp; Spain  for example there is a clearly stated 1.5 metre passing standard written into law.  Other areas have mandated minimum 3 ft limit 
defaultyet  the
default UK apparent
defaultly has nothing beyond the bland statement &amp; potentially misleading advice in rule 163.
defaultChanging this to a specific distance and ensuring that 
defaultdrivers ,new
default and old  become aware of this is a crucial  step in creating a safer environment on our roads for cyc
defaultles and for car drivers.
defaultObviously  this
default is in the interests of cyclists but  there will be many well-intentioned but  ill-informed  drivers who armed with this awareness may  as a result  not experience the trauma of being involved in what are frequently 
defaultserious or deadly bicycle car collisions.
