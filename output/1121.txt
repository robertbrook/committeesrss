[[[Background]]]&#xa0;1.              A rehearsal here of the background to this matter would be superfluous other than, perhaps, to reiterate that a further rejection of a change in the law by the legislature will condemn the UK to an extended period of humiliation by unknown numbers of prisoners - undoubtedly including the most serious offenders - at vast expense to the taxpayer in legal costs and fines; and that in any event some compromise would have to be reached at some future date with further wasted Parliamentary time.&#xa0;2.              On the evidence of the Commons debate there is no basis whatever for believing that any proposal currently being considered by the Committee would have the very slightest chance of passing a vote in Parliament.&#xa0;

[[[Current proposals]]]&#xa0;1.              The current proposal of a fixed cut-off based on the length of sentence may be straightforward from an administrative viewpoint but is deeply flawed in its ideology.  It depends critically on the erroneous presumption that an offender with any given sentence length (whether six months or four years or anything in between) is as deserving (or undeserving) as any other offender serving the same sentence.  Thus such a determinant falls firmly into the category of blanket decision making, the very conduct to which the Court of Human Rights is so clearly increasingly opposed in this area of human rights as in any other.  It must be assumed that there will be an endless trail of appeals against such a provision, and that it is only a matter of time before the facts of a particular case will result in defeat of it.&#xa0;2.              The Committee should be very slow indeed to promote such a blanket proposal, whatever the sentence length proposed, and should be looking for alternatives that might truly be regarded as proportionate.&#xa0;

[[[A presumption of rehabilitation]]]&#xa0;1.              The proposal put forward here is that prisoners:(a)              whose date for release (this is determined within days of the commencement of a sentence) is within twelve months of the date of a general or local election; and(b)              who retain a “presumption of rehabilitation”; and(c)              who are already “eligible” to vote under the rules;will be entitled to vote at that election.&#xa0;2              For the purposes of (3.1.b) there would be a presumption of rehabilitation for prisoners upon release except for those on a prescribed list, as below (indicative criteria):&#xa0;3              For the purposes of (3.1.c) prisoners would be deemed eligible to vote if:(a)              they were on the voting register prior to commencing their current sentence; or(b)              they were below the age of eligibility to vote at the start of their sentence.&#xa0;4              The underlying principle is of a scheme of eligibility based on a forward look at the right of (and need for) representation after release, not a backward look at the crime and an arbitrary extension of the punishment beyond release.  This is a proportionate and individual assessment of whether there should be a right to vote while in prison.  It excludes the serial sex offender whose current sentence just happens to be a short one.  It excludes the career armed robber whose current sentence happens to be short because the police were lying in wait and thwarted the last attempt.  It makes a proper distinction between the repeat violent offender and the senior executive or public figure who has committed serious offences but who is highly unlikely to repeat them.  A fixed sentence-length cut-off is not capable of any such distinctions.&#xa0;5.              The prescribed list would doubtless be subject to much debate and change.  Should serious fraud or perjury or perverting the course of justice be in the list, or would these offences be covered by the criterion as to length of current sentence, and so on.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Other matters]]]&#xa0;1.              The prospect of large numbers of prisoners voting in a particular constituency by virtue of the location of a prison that takes their category of offenders (an affront to democracy, albeit perhaps unlikely on the numbers actually eligible) is readily solved.&#xa0;2.              Prisoners would vote in the constituency in which they were already registered to vote at the start of a prison sentence.&#xa0;3.              If the prisoner was not registered to vote at the start of a prison sentence then there would be no right to vote while in prison.  It is not a duty of the Criminal Justice system to assist people to vote who have shown no previous inclination to do so.&#xa0;4.              Prisoners not eligible to vote only at the start of a prison sentence by virtue of age would be eligible to vote in the constituency of last residence.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Recommendations]]]&#xa0;1.              That the scheme should be considered by the Committee and consulted on.&#xa0;2.              That the Committee call evidence (refused to me in a FOI request to the Ministry of Justice of May 2012, on the flimsiest of grounds) as to the likely numbers of prisoners who would be eligible to vote under this scheme, with the prospects of success in a Commons vote in mind.&#xa0;July 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
