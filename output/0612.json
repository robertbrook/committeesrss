"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Unite (ESA017)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis response is submitted by Unite the \nUnion\n. Unite is the \nUK\n’s largest trade union with 1.5 million members employed across the private and public sectors.  Unite members work in a range of industries including manufacturing, financial services, print, media, construction, transport and local government, education, health and not for profit sectors.\n&#xa0;\nThe industry is an economic success story contributing £9.1 billion to the \nUK\n economy and employing 29,000 people.  At a time when our manufacturing base is under threat we must do all we can to retain and grow industries such as Space.\n&#xa0;\nThe Space industry in the \nUK\n is one of the fastest growing industrial sectors.  Space services and applications are crucial to the strategic economic development of commercial, security and military Space systems.   The \nUK\n is a global leader in space-related innovation and research and development.  Because of this evolution some of the most profitable and technologically advanced enterprises in the world are based in the \nUK\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs well as being a substantial generator of economic activity in its own right, the sector also stimulates GDP and employment throughout the rest of the economy.  The sector currently employs around 29,000 people and with planned investment in the sector could increase employment levels to 100,000 people\n, \n&#xa0;\nIn addition to the economic impact of the industry, space is making an increasingly important contribution to social policy and engagement in the form of the \nUK\n’s vital contribution to satellite technology and the greater access to free or low cost broadband for \nUK\n citizens.  \n&#xa0;\nThis is a key plank in achieving Lisbon Treaty objectives of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, providing highly skilled jobs, boosting innovation and increasing technological R&amp;D.\n&#xa0;\nUnite welcomes the UK government announcement of investment of £1.2 billion into some of Europe’s biggest  space projects through the UK Space Agency, a 25% increase in investment in the European Space Agency (ESA).  However, Unite would be concerned if this amount of investment into ESA did not transmit into significant space projects and an increase in space related jobs.\n&#xa0;\nUnite believes the \nUK\n could have a much stronger role in ESA.  We believe this could be achieved by ensuring there is at least one \nUK\n director at ESA encouraging a more pro-active approach to supporting \nUK\n industrial priorities.\n&#xa0;\nThe long term nature of technological R&amp;D in the space industry means that government investment is crucial especially for SMEs and those micro companies that often drive R&amp;D and innovation.  R&amp;D is incredibly important as an enabler for economic growth and encourages the industry to remain competitive and exploit any competitive advantage.\n&#xa0;\nUnite believes the formation of the UK Space Agency is of vital importance to the progression and growth of the space industry in the \nUK\n.  The last government’s commitment to supporting and investing in the industry was very welcome and the result of that commitment is a space agency with its own budget and a clear role to aid the advancement of the sector globally.\n&#xa0;\nIn conclusion, Unite believes it is vital for government to put in place the essential elements needed to promote growth.  These include; funding and support to enable innovation and research and \ndevelopment to flourish.  Financial investment for science based training and degree programmes, investment in technological inventions which may need seed capital to allow growth. And, most importantly to ensure that the \nUK\n education system is fully funded and fit for purpose.  Young people are the inventors, engineers and technicians of the future.  Without a challenging and holistic education system the \nUK\n will lose out to emerging economies such as \nIndia\n and \nChina\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n CBI – How the \nUK\n’s space industry is aiming for the stars\n"
