defaultIn 2005/6 the
default Environmental Audit 
defaultSelect 
defaultCommittee investigated “Reducing Carbon Emissions from Transport". At paragraph 82 the EAC concluded that, 
default“
defaultW
defaulte understand the 
defaultG
defaultovernment's reluctance to lower the mo
defaulttorway speed limit, or rigo
defaultrously enforce the current 70 mph limit, given the likely public
default controversy such a policy would provoke. However, compared to the potential danger which this could help to avert, proper enforcement of the legal speed limit would be a trivial incursion on personal liberty. The 
defaultG
defaultovernment cannot forever duck the harsh d
defaultecisions in its duties to face up to “the greatest long-term challenge facing the human race", in the words of the Prime Minister. In matters of such grave importance, the 
defaultG
defaultovernment does a disservice to future generations by running scared of critical tab
defaultloid headlines. Beyond its direct impact, a new policy on speed limits would help to raise awareness of the reality of climate change, and of the need 
defaultfor
default everyone t
defaulto take action on it.”

default              
defaultThe 
defaultEAC
default had considered the VIBAT study commissioned by the Depa
defaultrtment for Transport which recommended a reduction in the national speed limit to 50 mph. This was supported by the UKERC recommendation of a 60 mph limit (Quick Hits 2006), and similar proposals by the King Review
default, 
defaultthe
default European Energy Commissioner
default and the
default Committee on Climate Change.  It is probably safe to say that there is no evidence that
default carbon emissions from transport can be reduced in accordance with the Climate Change Act 2008 without reducing the national speed limit.
default&#xa0;
default1.04
default              
defaultThe main reason why the 
defaultGovernment has refused to act on this matter is the reduction in fuel duty that successive Chancellors have refused to contemplate.
default&#xa0;
default1.05
default              
defaultThere have been 2 important changes in circumstances since 2006 that would make the EAC recommendation even more relev
defaultant to the current considerations by the Transport Select Committee.  Carbon emissions have continued to increase with no sign that the Department for Transport (including “Action for Roads”) has any effective policy to meet 
defaultin 
defaultthe
default short, medium or long
defaulter
default term. The only measure to appear in Action for Roads is the reliance on Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs).  Notwithstanding the doubts about such vehicles becoming commonplace 
defaultor that
default their actual carbon footprints
default are significantly lower than modern IC
defaultEs
default, this Government 
defaultpolicy implies an even greater loss of revenue from fuel duty, than would a 50-60 mph national speed limit. In fact, a lower speed limit would be one of the greatest possible incentives for the use 
defaultof  ULEVs
default as a speed of around 50 mph 
defaultwould 
defaultmaximise
default their range
default (range being one of the key limitations)
default.

default              
defaultIt should be noted 
defaultby the Transport Select Committee 
defaultthat the following comments were made in the context of the Cook Review of the Strategic Road Network and have been made consis
defaulttently throughout the last 15 years. 
defaultTo date, t
defaulthe response 
defaultto the proposal to reduce the national speed limit 
defaulthas been the same as that of the Government to the recommendation of the EAC.
default&#xa0;
default2.default              defaultHow will the policies set out in the defaultGdefaultovernment's “Action for Rodefaultads" improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?default&#xa0;
default2.01
default              
default 
defaultThe simple answer to this question is that it should be asked only when the full impact of a reduced speed limit on the whole transport system has 
defaultbeen properly assessed. The Department for Transport has consistently and repeatedly refused to carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment into the impact of a reduction in the national speed limit. Given the l
defaultikely benefits in terms of the 
defaultreduction i
defaultn congestion arising from the substantial increase 
defaultof
default the efficien
defaultcy in
default use of both roads and junctions that would be achieved through a reduction in the national speed limit, until this has been properly assessed, it is irresponsible to consider the benef
defaultits
default of more motorway lanes.
default 
default The Department for Transport is fully aware of the benefit
defaults
default of lower speeds (these are introduced on motorways at the same time as hard shoulders are made availa
defaultble with reduced journey times, 
defaultreduce
defaultd
default accidents and reduced cong
defaultestion). 
default&#xa0;
default2.02
default              
defaultHowever, these variable speed limits do not represent the 
defaultsystemic approach to capacity, safety and
default&#xa0;
default environmental
default sustainability
default that is urgently required. 
default&#xa0;
defaultVariable speed limits do not sit in the virtuous circle that would include a power
default shift to more efficient vehicles and a modal shift to lower carbon means of transport.
default&#xa0;
default2.03
default              
defaultAction for Roads refers to 
defaultboth 
defaultcompetitiveness and international examples. In this context it should acknowledge that 
defaulta 
defaultsignificant number of freight 
defaulthauliers
default ch
defaultoose to restrict the speed of their vehicles to less than the national speed limits in order to save fuel. Reference should also be made to the fact that in Japan, Canada and Norway the national speed limit is alread
defaulty 100kph or 62
defaultmph.
default  
default&#xa0;
default2.04
default              
defaultThe Department of Transport has attempted to 
defaultassess the cost to business of 
defaulta reduction in the national speed limit. However, this calculation has not taken into account the consequential reduction in congestion currently costing in the area of £20 billion
default. RTAs 
defaultare more frequent and serious at higher (and differential) speeds and place 
defaulta significant financial burden on all the emergency services and the NHS
default.
default 
defaultBusiness would quickly adjust to a lower speed limit and benefit from more reliable journey times.
default&#xa0;
default2.05
default              
defaultA
default reduction in the national speed limit have substantial environmental, 
defaultsocial and economic benefits compatible if not exceeding those anticipated by the £15 billion projected spend proposed in the Action for Roads, but this simple change in 
defaultregulation could be done immediately, at virtually no public cost and would be entirely equitable. Unlike the proposal to increase road capacity
default&#xa0;
defaultthrough building, achieving this through a reduction in speed engages the 
default‘
defaultconstant time budget
default’
default that would red
defaultuce or eliminate the ‘rebound effect’. The reluctance to spend a great
defaulter
default time in travelling would reduce the inclination to
default invest savings in money in travelling further. 
defaultRoad capacity increased in order to enable high speed driving quickly fills up. 
default&#xa0;
default2.06
default              
defaultAction for Roads
default 
defaultproposes an, ‘…
defaultaggressive policy of decarbonisation, to address the carbon consequences of motoring and move us to a lower-impact 
defaultf
defaultuture
default.’
default If that were true
default, 
defaultthe question must be asked as to why 
defaultthe Command Paper 
defaultc
defaultompletely fails to a
defaultddress the 
defaultissue of ‘speed’ that 
defaultthe 
defaultDfT
default know to be
default the most effective measure to reduce the

defaultimpact
defaults
default of 
defaultroad transport,
default including the overall carbon emissions.
default&#xa0;
default2.07
default              
defaultIn summary, the proposals would encourage greater more intensive use of an e
defaultnlarged strategic road network. What is required is the more efficient use of the network as it stands that would involve a modal shift (and power-shift) to more sustainable and lower carbon modes of travel.
default&#xa0;default3.default              defaultHow does the defaultGdefaultovernment's policy for roads defaultlink with planning for other transport modes?default&#xa0;default3.01
default              
defaultIt should be through a reduction in the national speed limit that the Government could achieve an integrated and reliable transport system depending more on the lower carbon modes of bus, coach and rail.
defaultIncidentally, 
defaulta 
defaultreduction in the 70 mph limit (commonly enforced at 85 mph) would 
defaultincentivise
default the development of smaller and more efficient vehicles that would be less polluting at lower speeds (e.g. 20 mph) suitable for urban areas.

default              
default‘
defaultReliability

default and 
default‘
defaultefficiency
default’
default are 
defaulttwo
default of the
default main characteristics of lower speeds. Increasing capacity through road building could, in the short term, increase reliability but would not increase efficiency. Insofar as road pricing could be part of a package of new technologies to apply to the strate
defaultgic road network,
default this has serious disadvantages in terms of equity (and significant 
defaultcosts and 
defaultpublic hostility). It would be irresponsible to introduce road pricing before the effects of a lower speed limit had been fully assessed, particularly on levels 
defaultof congestion.
default&#xa0;
default5.default              defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;default5.01
default              
defaultThe 
defaultvery sensible 
defaultquestions being posed by the Transport Select Committee Imply that it is most interested in the systemic effects of the 
defaultproposals in Action for Roads. This is obviously the right approach when considering 
defaultinterventions (including substantial public investment) in the transport system. Unfortunately, the quickest, cheapest, fairest and most effective intervention would be the reduction in the national speed limit that has not been considered in this or any o
defaultther Command Paper.  This is an omission that the 
defaultT
defaultransport 
defaultC
defaultommittee could seek to remedy.
default&#xa0;
default5.02
default              
defaultThere is already substantial evidence; the VIBAT study, UKERC, CE Delft
default, that a lower speed limit would meet all the objectives being sought by the Action on 
defaultRoads.  The 
defaultDfT
default should be required to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment to compare the 
defaultbenefits, costs and synergies of the alternative means of both managing demand and increasing capacity on the road (and wider transport network), before publi
defaultc money is spent on a road Building/widening programme. 
default&#xa0;
default5.03
default              
defaultIn 2006 The EAC failed to persuade the Government that speed was crucial to reducing carbon emissions.  
defaultThe 
defaultDfT
default is aware of the connection between speed and carbon emissions, 
defaultif  not
default the wider 
defaultsystemic and gener
defaultally beneficial effects.  One o
defaultf these wider effects is what 
defaultthe EAC saw as a potential ‘game changer’, 
defaultthe 
defaultbring
defaulting
default home to the general public 
defaultof 
defaultthe obligation to reduce our carbon emissions.  
defaultIf the EAC was right, t
defaulthe inaction by Gover
defaultnment on this issue 
defaultis sending the contrary
default message
default,
default that 
defaultthe reduction in carbon is not a priority.
