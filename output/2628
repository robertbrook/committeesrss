defaultIn the year to April 2013
default, Citizens Advice Bureaux in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultW
defaultales
default dealt with
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe housing costs component of Universal Credit (UC) will not constitute a “clean sheet
default”. The essential structure of HB (and support for mortgage interest) will carry through into UC
default, along with a 
defaultnumber of associated problems
default, which we explore below
default.
default&#xa0;
default2. The main
default issues
default&#xa0;
defaultAffordable housing and shortfalls in housing-related benefitsdefault&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCitizens Advice endorses
default the definition of “affordable housing” adopted by Lord Whitty’s independent inquiry into affordable homes
default:
default “comfortable, secure homes in sound condition that are available to rent or buy without leaving households unable to afford their other basic needs
default (eg food, clothing, heating, transport and social life)”. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs regards rents eligible for HB - and in due course the rental element of UC - we fully accept that HB/ UC cannot be expected to meet any rent, however high. But limits must take account of the 
defaultconse
defaultquences for poverty and social exclusion
default and our bureaux are picking up growing numbers of cases where HB cuts are causing hardship 
defaultand debt
default.
default 
defaultThe role of such limits in leaving claimants with inadequate disposable incomes after paying the rent is ther
defaultefore part of a wider problem – pointing to the need to develop a strategy for genuinely affordable housing in all sectors.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisc
defaultretionary Housing Payments (
defaultDHPs
default) have featured prominently in the current debate as a possible solution to HB cuts in individu
defaultal cases
default and CAB advice on DHPs has almost trebled in the first quarter of 2013-14 compared with the same quarter the previous year
default.
default However, their 
defaultpotential 
defaultrole is exaggerated
default, given the scale of the problem
default. A perspective can be gained from the fact tha
defaultt in the current year (2013-14) the overall DHP b
defaultudget is equivalent to about seven
default per cent of the HB cuts total
default. The consequent tight
default rationing means that payments, even when made, are frequently temporary
default, with no guaran
defaulttee that the claimant will be
default able to find 
defaultsomewhere affordable 
defaultby the time the DHP expires.
default&#xa0;
defaultShared accommodation ratedefault (SAR)default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA specific example of problematic HB
default/ UC restriction
default is the SAR, a lower level of eligib
defaultle rent
default based on the assumption that the claimant occupies shared acco
defaultm
defaultmodation,
default whether they do or not. Previously, it applied to single childless under-25s, but from January 2012 was extended to single childless under-35s. (It also applies to older people who actually do live in shared accommodation).
default 
defaultThe SAR causes major 
defaultproblems of affordability of adequate accommodation.
default Sharing is often not appropriate (see case illustration below) or accommodation within the SAR
default is simply unavailable.
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB in the South West advised a 31-year-old man with mental health difficulties wh
defaulto
default was
default under the care of an NHS psychiatrist. Due to his mental health problem
defaults, it was
default not feasible for him to share
default accommodation
default. H
defaulte wa
defaults, therefore, the sole occupant of
default a one-
defaultbedroom apartment, the rent for which was substantially higher than the SAR
default.
default A
default DHP
default was
default temporarily helping with the shortfall of £70 per month
default, but he could not
default meet the rent in the long term.
default&#xa0;
defaultBenefit capdefault&#xa0;default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn our view, 
defaultensuring that work pays should be a matter of bolstering in-work incomes, not cutting out-of-work benefits.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn any case, 
defaultit is 
defaulthard to understand the case for including 
defaultbenefits that are available on similar terms both in and out of work – notably HB/ the rental component of UC; Child Tax Credits/ the children’s elements of UC; and Child Benefit.
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClaimants advised by our bureaux illustrate the challenges faced by people affected by 
defaultthe benefit cap. For many
default, solutions are very limited - in part because work is often not an option. The Government’s own impact assessment shows that only just over a t
defaulthird of households affected receive Jobseeker’s Allowance – the others being carers, parents of young children or receiving Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB in the South East advised a single mother with three children (the 
defaultyoungest aged thre
defaulte) receiving Income S
defaultupport. Her house was
default the appropriate size for HB purposes, but the benefit cap will leave her a shortfall in rent of £38.23 per week
default. She
default worked full time through the childhood of her older two children but now stays 
defaultat home to look a
defaultfter 
defaultthe three-year-
defaultold. 
defaultShe had
default applied for a 
defaultDHP
default but 
defaultreceived a prelim
defaultinary indication that she was
default unlikely to be successful. 
defaultShe is no
defaultw facing the prospect of trying to find
default the shortfall in
default rent out of her I
defaultncome
default S
defaultupport. This is causing her a
defaultcute anx
defaultiety.
default&#xa0;
defaultExtension of HB size restrictions to defaultthe defaultsocial rented sectordefault&#xa0;
default2.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRestriction of HB eligible rent 
defaultfor accommodation of various sizes has been a feature of the scheme in the private rented sector for many years. From April 2013, 
defaultHB 
defaultsize restrictions have been extended to social housing. 
defaultAlthough promoted as a means of addressing under-occupation, the shortage
default of opportunities
default&#xa0;
defaultfor affected claimants to move means that
default&#xa0;
defaultthe measure is widely perceived as a levy on b
defaultenefits rather than a
default means of
default 
defaultmaking
default better use of the housing st
defaulto
defaultck
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCAB 
defaultevidence shows a very high demand f
defaultor advice on this change, 
defaultacross 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default. For many
default,
default there are no solutions. In some cases, tenants need the room - for example, for their child to visit
default, 
defaultor because a disability makes it impractical for couples to share
default; others are prevented from moving because of the unavailability of appropriate stock; or are excluded from exchange or transfer s
defaultchemes due to rent arrears. Regarding
default this last problem, the 
defaultNational Housing Federation has suggested to its members th
defaultat flexibility might be appropriate
default where arrears have arisen in consequence of the HB size restrictions. We support that approach.
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence shows that claimants affected by the HB size restrictio
defaultns are also likely to be caught by other benefit changes that together leave people facing considerable hardship and rent arrears
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB on the 
defaultSouth
default 
defaultCo
defaultast
default adv
defaultised a client in her 50s who had
default been living on her own in a 3-bedroom council house since her c
defaulthildren left home. She has long-
defaultterm health problems related to a genetic blood disorder. She
default had
default recently lost her 
defaultESA
default 
defaultafter being found fit for work
default and had appealed
default against the decision. The size restrictions
default had
default reduced her HB by £100 per month and she
default 
defaultwas receiving
default a
default DHP
default that was
default due to end
default shortly. Alth
defaultough she had
default agreed to move to a smaller property,
default she had
default been
default told that she could spend
default up to three
default years on
default the waiting lis
defaultt. She was worried how she would
default manage to 
defaultpay the rent until she could move
default and was
default distressed and concerned about what
default might happen when her DHP stopped
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHelp with mortgage costsdefault&#xa0;default2.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA very limited 
defaultSupport for Mortgage Interest 
default(SMI) 
defaultscheme helps with mortgage interest for people receiving out-of-work 
defaultmeans-tested 
defaultbenefits. It is 
defaultrestricted by waiting periods, time limits for certain groups and 
defaulta standard assumed interest rate (recently reduced
default from 6.08 to 3.63 per cent
default). The 
defaultintroduction of UC
default will further restrict help with mortgage interest, as any earnings will disqualify the 
defaultclaimant from support (at present, limited part-time earnings are permitted).
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB in the 
defaultNorth West
default advised a client in her 40s who suffers from depression and anxiety. She
default had
default sustained a double benefit cut as a result of 
defaultbeing found fit for work and 
defaultof 
defaultthe
default reduction
default 
defaultin the standard rate of interest used to calculate
default SMI
default.
default 
defaultShe was
default now unable 
defaultto meet the shortfall in her mortgage payments. 
defaultThese growing financial pressures 
defaultwere 
defaultthreaten
defaulting
default 
defaultto worsen
default her mental health problems
default and she faced
default the possibilit
defaulty of losing her home.
default&#xa0;
defaultNon-dependant deductionsdefault&#xa0;default2.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultN
defaulton-dependant deductions (N
defaultD
defaultDs) are reductions in housing costs eligible for HB and SMI,
default based on assumed 
default(not actual) 
defaultcontributions from “non-dependants” such as grown-up children and elderly relatives. 
defaultThe
default non-dependant is under no obligation to make these payments or to disclose their own financial details. Logically, one would expect non-dependants themselves to be able to claim HB to help them pay the assumed contribution, but in fact they cannot.
default&#xa0;
default2.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNDDs
default 
defaultcause various problems (of hardship, complexity, reduced housing options and work disincentives)
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe pre
defaultvious Government had frozen them
default for some years, with a view to phasing them out. The current Government has returned to a policy of increasing them, w
defaultell above the rate of inflation.
default&#xa0;
default2.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNDDs are to be restructured (and re-named “housing cost c
defaultontributions”) under
default UC, with an emphasis on reducing work disincentives for the non-dependant, but at the cost of extending their impact elsewhere, notably to many 
defaultyoung unemployed people and their parents.
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB in the East of England advised an unemployed couple with three dependent children and a 20-year-old daughter earning £210 per week gross. 
defaultT
defaulthe daughter was not meeting the NDD. A suspended possession order 
defaultwas eventually made, the arrears partly resulting from the NDD. The daughter has since taken out a loan to make back payments. The total weekly rent is £90 and it seems unreasonable that over 40 per cent of this should be payable by the daughter (who share
defaults a bedroom with a younger sister).
default&#xa0;
defaultLocalised Council Tax Supportdefault&#xa0;default2.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe abolition of Council Tax Benefit and its replacement with cash-limited localised relief is expected to create a scenario
default in England
default in which people on very low incomes will be required
default to pay small amounts of council tax that they cannot afford, creating major problems of collection, enforcement and debt
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal tapers (withdrawal rates) will also potentially overlap with the UC taper, causing high marginal deduction rates across the a
defaultffected part of the income scale
default, 
defaulta problem which UC was supposed to solve.
default The original intention was that CTB would become part of UC – a coherence that has now been lost.
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB in 
defaultLondon
default advised a single, disabled man with a
defaultn artificial leg. He lived
default i
defaultn 2-bedroom council accommodation
default, receiving
default Income Support and Disability Living Allowance
default (DLA)
default. His HB ha
defaultd
default been reduced by 14 per cent under
default the size restrictions and he was
default now li
defaultable to pay 15 per cent of his council t
defaultax.
default This meant he now had
default to find
default £60 per month towards h
defaultis rent and £10.60 towards his council t
defaultax. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCumulative impactsdefault&#xa0;
default2.17
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCuts to a range of benefits will oft
defaulten affect
default the same individuals and families, having a multiple impact and causing considerable hardship. This is a neglected issue and is not adequately monitored. HB rides on top of other benefits and is received by the full range of claimant groups, so will featu
defaultre strongly in multiple impacts – as will the rental element of UC. 
defaultThe case examples at paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.16 illustrate this.
default&#xa0;
default2.18
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposals for 
defaultbenefit legislation should therefore be accompanied by a poverty impact assessment sufficiently sophisti
defaultcated to provide estimates of multiple impacts.
default&#xa0;
defaultPayment of HB/ UC to tenantsdefault rather than direct to landlordsdefault&#xa0;
default2.19
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlready the default position for HB in the private rented sector, it is intended that this will
default be the case in all sectors as
default UC is introduced. 
default&#xa0;
default2.20
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA number of “demonstration projects” are under way to test this approach. There will be exceptions, relating to vulnerability and/ or rent arrears. It is expected that arrears will be a significant problem. 
default&#xa0;
default2.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndeed, the demonstration projects have alr
defaultead
defaulty shown this to be the
default case: the most recent report monitoring
default the six project areas 
defaultcommented that: 
default“
defaultcollection rates are lower in all project areas than before the (demonstration projects) went live. And more of the rent that is paid arrives in instalmen
defaultts through the month (i.e. late) rather than on time in one sum as it did when Housing Benefit was paid by the local authority direct to the landlord. Landlord income and cash flow has, therefore, reduced. A small percentage rise in arrears represents sign
defaultificant funds for landlords”
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen direct payments
default to tenants
default were introduced 
defaultas the norm in the private rented s
defaultector
default, phased 
defaultbet
defaultween 2007-
default2011, Citizens Advice saw a significant 
defaultrise
default in the number of 
defaultprivate tenants seeking help with problems concerni
defaultng arrears – a 64 per cent increase 
defaultover the three years
default. W
defaulte 
defaultbelieve that the payment change
default was a sign
defaultificant contributor to this
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.23
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe DWP research
default report
default on the demonstration projects also
default concluded that supporting tenants to 
defaultminimis
defaulte such consequences 
defaultare “frequently linked to resource-intensive interventions”
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.24
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to note also that a policy of normally 
defaultmandatory direct payment to tenants
default 
defaultmilitates against principles of choice.
default&#xa0;
default2.25
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnless there is a reason for mandatory direct payment to the 
defaultlandlord (rent arrears above a specified level or vulnerability issues such as drug or alcohol abuse) the choice, in our view, should lie with the claimant as to who – claimant or landlord – should receive benefit payments for rent. This could be on an “op
defaultt in” basis (analogous to setting up a direct debit) to satisfy the Government’s concern with active claimant engagement. 
default&#xa0;
default2.26
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the very least, this option should be available for a transitional period of no less than a year, to enable any necessary money a
defaultdvice and financial capability support to be put in place.
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB in 
defaultWales
default advised a 50-year-old single woman living in a housing association property. She rec
defaulteived
default ESA
default,
default had fibromyalgia and was
default also ver
defaulty forgetful. Her HB was originally
default paid to her landlord but was changed to direct payment to her. Since then she
default had
default fallen into arrears 
defaultand was
default now being taken to court for possession. The 
defaultdirect payment decision had
default been rescinded, but she
default was
default still being taken to court.
default&#xa0;
default2.27
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis issue reflects a wider problem. 
defaultAlthough people on low incomes often – of necessity – have excellent financial survival skills, claimants face new challenges relating to benefit cuts and payment changes.
default 
defaultAs part of our Managing Migration project, w
defaulte r
defaultecently surveyed
default over 1,700
default of our
default clients who will start to receive 
defaultUC
default from October
default and explored
default whether they felt they 
defaultwould be able to cope with five possible problem areas
default – budgeting, monthly payments, banking, stayin
defaultg informed and internet access.
default&#xa0;
default9
default2 per cent
default said they felt unprepared for the ne
defaultw system in at least one area, while 38 per cent
default will need support with all
default of the possible problem areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is 
defaultthe first stage of a pilot we a
defaultre carrying out in three locations
default – 
defaultBir
defaultmingham
default, Ynys Mon and 
defaultN
defaultorth Dorset
default – to
default test out how we can support people with these changes.
default&#xa0;
default2.28
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn our view, both central and local government should therefore have in place an adequate 
defaultsupport strategy for claimants in need of money advice (including benefits, debt and financia
defaultl capability). This should include input from
default our
default bureaux, with appropriate funding.
default For our part, as well as providing support to individuals, we will be able to share our findings from our Managing Migration project to help develop innovative approaches 
defaultto helping claimants with the transition to the new system.
default&#xa0;
default3. Conclusions
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe impact of these changes are being felt by our clients across every area of 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default. Over time, given the range of benefit changes and against the backdrop of higher 
defaultcosts of living in general, many people both in and out of work will face increasing challenges to pay their rent or mortgage.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the drive to reduce rising housing costs within benefit spending totals is understandable, this will not be effectively ac
defaulthieved by simply cutting benefits. It’s now vital that we see the development of policies aimed at driving down housing costs themselves. Without this more strategic approach, blunt policies to cut entitlement will have a serious impact on family finances 
defaultin the short and the longer term, with all the attendant consequences for poverty, social inclusion, health and wellbeing.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs regards the roll-out of UC, we have noted in the previous section
default that our research suggests a substantial need
default for support among
default people who would otherwise struggle with the new payment systems. 
defaultIt is also 
defaultcrucial to remember the additional challenges for budgeting that people will face, not just as a result of the changes to how support is paid, but because of the greater risks of
default income shortfalls, sudden or otherwise. It is one thing to adjust to a monthly budget, but when managing a rent shortfall over a long period or a sudden income cut due to, say, the loss of 
defaultESA
default and/ o
defaultr of DLA
default, or perhaps incurring a benefit sanction, 
defaultsevere debt may suddenly no longer be avoidable.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are therefore 
defaultcalling on the Government to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Department for Communities and Local Government should 
defaultencourage social landlords to fadefaultcilitate transfersdefault which would otherwise not take place because of rent arrears, if those arrears have arisen subsequent to the application of the HB/ UC size restri
defaultctions.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposals for benefit legislation should be accompanied by 
defaulta poverty impact assessmentdefault sufficiently sophisticated to provide estimates of multiple impacts.
