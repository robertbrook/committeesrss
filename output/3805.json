"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the British Beer and Pub Association (CYS 051)&#xa0;\nThe British Beer &amp; Pub Association (BBPA) is the leading organisation representing the brewing and pub sector. Our members account for 96% of beer \nbrewed in the United Kingdom and own around half of Britain's 49,500 public houses\n&#xa0;\nWe \n write in response to\n your follow-up inquiry on cycling safety,\n in particular, your question; \n‘\nWhether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from \nother road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.\n’\n&#xa0;\nCity centre businesses, particular\nly\n those offering food, are dependent on daily deliveries to ensure \nthey \ncan operate without\n disruption\n. \n \nPubs situa\nted in city locations are no different and are heavily reliant on daily deliveries\n,\n of both food and beer, collection of empty kegs and \nrequire \naccess \nfor \ncompany technical support staff. \n&#xa0;\nSegregated cycle lanes already cause particular issues for pub del\niveries. Manual handling \nof \nbulk beer containers such as kegs and casks (as specified in current \nH\nealth \n&amp;\n Safety Regulations)\n ideally\n requires the delivery vehicle to be sited at the kerb-side outside the premises. \nPhysically segregated \nlanes prevent this \naccess\n and in some circumstances, \nbulk containers must be wheeled across the cycle lane which poses a \nfurther \nrisk \nto \nboth cyclists and delivery drivers.\n&#xa0;\nThere are already significant restrictions imposed on delivery vehicles\n, including \nthe enforcement of\n permitted delivery times (night time deliveries are not\n allowed\n), access routes and parking restrictions. Whereas it may be desirable to separate road users to protect those considered more vulnerable, further restrictions could seriously hinder the abili\nty to deliver to pubs, particularly if this were to \nprevent deliveries\n during busy trading periods, i.e. lunchtimes. \n \nImposing such restrictions \nc\nould also lead to increased, inefficient journey times as all deliveries would be squeezed into a shorter time\n window. \n \nThis \nin itself \nwould lead to wider congestion issues.\n&#xa0;\nRe\nlaxing some of the existing restrictions \nc\nould potentially ease traffic load at key periods such as peak commuting time, and would, in practice, offer a degree of segregation. In particular\n, easing the existing night-time restrictions on delivery times, as permitted during the 2012 Olympic Games, \nc\no\nuld optimise the efficiency of deliveries and could result in \nreduce\nd\n concentration of delivery vehicles on the road at peak times.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nbrewing industry supports safe\nr\n measures for \nall road users to reduce \nthe potential for incidents\n.  However, w\nhere further, physical segregation of road use\n is proposed\n,\n we would \nemphasise \nthat the road system is critical for the functioning of businesses \nin towns and cities, particularly London. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nBBPA would be pleased to be involved in any ongoing \ndiscussions \nwith TfL, DfT and others on this issue.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
