defaulti. defaultWho we aredefault&#xa0;
defaultRevolution Consulting Limited (“Revolution”) has operated exclusively in the arena of local government commissioning and procurement since 2006. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving gained experience as a supplier of such services since 2000, we apply commercial knowledge gained over more than twenty years to the sector working from the perspective of both purchaser and provider. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care (NCERCC), previously Government funded, is now an independent collaborating group. It is a principal point of reference and dialogue for the whole of the residential sector of England
default, purchasers, providers, practitioners and policy makers
default. 
defaultThrough close involvement 
defaultNCERCC 
defaultcan 
defaultprovide up-to-date information on significant policy, research, theory, and practice developments, and practical tools and materials for service and practice improvement.
default&#xa0;
defaultii. Our perspective on procurementdefaultThe specific focus of Revolution is the area of services for looked after children, including children’s homes, fostering and residential special schools. Public spending by English local authorities on such services is estimated to exceed £6bn per annum. 
defaultOur lead consultant in this area is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants with a substantial range of commercial experience in several sectors. It is the commercial and financial aspects of procurement for looked after children that are the core of our work, with a particular focus on the interaction of the commercial aspects with the professional childcare and education.
default&#xa0;
defaultRevolution produces publications on the financial performance of provider sectors, initially under the auspices of the Commissioning Support Programme and more recently on an independent basis. These analyses add weight to our view that commissioning and procurement in the looked after children services sector is sub-optimal both for the young people and for efficiency and further development. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNCERCC has been 
defaultdeeply 
defaultinvolved in the development of 
defaultpolicy and practice of the 
defaultcommissioning
default of residential options for young people; from the original regional commissioning pilots, to being core to the development of three national contracts (children’s homes, residential special schools, fostering), to member of the expert resource group for the Commissioning Support Programme, to supporting DfE and OPM in their recent review of commissioning practice
default&#xa0;
defaultNCERCC has undertaken research into the compatibility of practice of commissioners and providers. Its

defaultiii. Where our experience comes fromdefault&#xa0;
defaultRevolution
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are three strands of experience that contribute to our perspective.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have a wealth of professional financial and commercial experience gained in a wide variety of sectors including Fast Moving Consumer Goods, IT, International Biotechnology, Social Care and Education, and Venture Capital. 
defaultSeveral aspects of our work pull upon practice in sectors outside of social care.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have direct experience gained over 12 years of these types of provision for looked after children, both in a Private Equity backed setting and also in a smaller privately owned specialist start up setting.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur lead consultant instigated and chaired the first national trade association for Independent Children’s Homes (ICHA).
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2006 Revolution has gained further experience through delivery of consultancy and support projects in the sector including:
default&#xa0;
defaultNCERCC
default&#xa0;defaultCombines consultants with decades of service as both providers and commissioners.  
defaultWe are the only reference for the effect of missioning practices on child care effectiveness.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultiv. A summary of our perspectivedefault&#xa0;default“It’s about people not process”default&#xa0;
defaultOur experience, both as consultants to commissioners and procurement professionals, and as providers responding to public tenders for services for looked after children leads us to a perspective that concludes that current activity in the sector is too driven by process and by financial measurements, and insufficiently sensitive to the diverse and complex needs of the cohort of children and young people who should be at the very core of activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal authorities have not maliciously developed this situation, and indeed there are heroic examples of officers making genuine improvements in what has at times historically been a volatile and chaotic environment.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the variety of challenges faced are diverse and arise from 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our experience these two variables have a direct influence over how the local authority interprets national government guidance and the priority given to administration/financial (meeting Gershon) or maximizing welfare ( the Children Act ‘most appropriate placement’). 
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch are the specific needs of those young people needing residential options generic solutions applied for other cohorts often prove inappropriate for this high level of need group. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this environment there is also insufficient robust research or independently
default 
defaultverified data into how to aggregate needs, and how to treat or to manage cohorts, and what measureable outcomes are achieved. Commissioning for residential options for young people operates without any data that drive strategy
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is perhaps unsurprising therefore that the one absolute measure that is available has become dominant in decision making, often to the detriment of outcomes and to a wider strategic commissioning view of how markets can be supported and influenced.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat factor is cost, and whilst cost and finance are of course factors that cannot be ignored in times of budget constraints and public sector spending cuts, their sheer measurability allied to a slavish adherence to EU procurement rules are the real drivers of activity in the market.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe complexity and depth of knowledge and experience required to effectively commission services in this sector requires a combination of the very best social work, education, mental health, procurement and commercial skills. If just one factor is too dominant in what has to be a carefully managed mix then inappropriate results with devastating consequences on already vulnerable children can be the result.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately it is very rare to find real exemplars of outstanding commissioning and procurement in the sector, and Revolution and NCERCC advocate that the experience and quality of commissioning and procurement, of commissioners and of purchasers needs to be radically improved so that our most vulnerable young people do not get a continuing raw deal. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMost importantly those commissioners need to abandon inappropriate process based approaches and embrace the more complex task of dealing with people instead of process.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also believe that commissioning needs to be a matrix of local, regional and national efforts, and that much greater knowledge needs to be gained about the provider and supply side of services in order to incubate markets that are attractive to innovative investment as opposed to those which sometimes limp from one crisis to another under successive partial policy changes and dull use of bluntly inappropriate generic procurement approaches. 
default&#xa0;
defaultv. Our responses to the specific questions raiseddefault&#xa0;default1. To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?default&#xa0;
defaultA local placement can benefit some young people: close to their home and family contacts, to their school and to their friends, and to the professionals from their
default home local authority.
default&#xa0;
defaultImportantly these children will likely have specialist needs of physical disabilities, learning difficulties, autism, mental health issues, and sometimes a combination of those needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese needs, and definitely when found in combination, occur infrequently in any one authority. 
defaultRegional groups of authorities should cooperate in commissioning services for these lower incidence needs. Examples of successful regional collaborations are very rare. Where successes are claimed those claims are seldom audited and are usually claimed by those with vested interests in the activities being seen to be successful.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do not know how many young people with less-complex needs are inappropriately placed at distance. Without the data local demand and supply in many parts of the country is not appropriately understood or managed by
default local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal residents are only likely to be involved via planning processes for new home or school applications.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to contractor relationships there is a wide spectrum of performance. Most contractors are small providers with one or a small number of homes not large regional or national organisations yet the processes of local authorities seem designed towards those with the larger infrastructure and investment. Smaller providers can be more creative and yet are disabled from engagement in local authority processes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial Value and Social Return on Investment are similarly underemphasized by local authority placement strategy and processes. Where they are used they do not feature prominently in any decision making
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst local authorities claim progress through provider forum activities, it is difficult to detect many tangible long-term positive relationships. The majority of the markets still operate on variations of spot purchase arrangements and that is one clear indicator of an immature relationship profile. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere procurement has been used it tends to limit choice by producing preferred provider lists, which only seeks to further the limit the possibility of finding the most appropriate placement option.
default&#xa0;
default2. Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government.default&#xa0;
defaultCommissioning of residential options for children is not a collaborative activity. It is designed and directed exclusively by Local Authorities. There are provider forums and some consultative activity but these are largely delivery actions for decisions already taken rather than joint needs-led working together. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal Authorities collaborate with other statutory agencies and with each other and will offer evidence such as regional frameworks, sub-regional preferred provider lists, provider forums.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome claim for improvements in efficiencies via price control and reduction can be made but it is our experience that such claims are not made under any pre-defined measurement criteria and certainly are not subject to independent scrutiny. The efficiencies nearly always come at a cost to maximization of welfare. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur experience is of some of the best procurement coming from an individual professional in the local authority advocating for placements for specialist needs having to work outside of the framework, working against the structures put in place by commissioners in order to secure the most appropriate placement.
default&#xa0;
defaultPFI has made a limited entry to residential options for children. Where is has been deployed it is now seen as an obstacle to flexibility of provision and Local Authorit
defaulties are tied to buildings they 
defaultmight now not be using and sourcing from new ideas in the non-statutory sector. Alternatives vehicles for financing, such
default as SIBs, are in their infancy 
defaultand are fraught with variables.
default   The sector with most PFI opportunity may be residential special schools. 
default&#xa0;
default3. How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?default&#xa0;defaultWe have already highlighted that the sector suffers from poor results partly because procurement professionals often gain too much influence compared to their professional social work and education colleagues. This is partly a function of finance being the predominant measure and outcomes and quality being much more difficult to evidence and measure. Combined with authorities looking to freeze or reduce spending while numbers of looked after children have increased in the last few years, the result is one where procurement officers from non-childcare backgrounds have enforced inappropriate systems and procedures and have dangerously sidelined their fellow professionals.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is where our view that the current state of play is one of systems rather than people comes from.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that a transformation in approach is needed. There are clear legal opinions in the public domain that state that EU procurement rules do not have to be applied to social care services. We would go further and advocate that such processes should be outlawed unless they meet certain criteria. Such criteria would include that the process be lead by a team that has expertise in children’s social care, education and mental health. That any desired service structure either is already evidenced to be effective for a well-defined cohort or that the service is designed as a research project.
defaultThere is at best weak understanding of the provider sector, of its drivers and performance. Local Authorities often talk of market management and yet their approaches to this are difficult to detect. The provider sectors are increasingly dominated by independent sector organizations who have the potential to bring innovation and investment from outside of the public sector, but who are often not engaged in a way that encourages this.
default&#xa0;
default4. To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?default&#xa0;
defaultThe predominance of commissioners and procurement officers has lead to voluminous contractual arrangements in the sector, contracts which are developed and debated long and hard and which fail in at least two ways despite appearing in black and white terms to have moved much of the risk to the provider service.
default&#xa0;
defaultFirstly the contracts tend to fail to focus on research and outcomes measurements, and have a focus of commercial details. Even where contracts do attempt quality measurement frameworks local authorities do not coordinate with one another to bring about consistency. This leaves providers
default who deal with multiple authorities (which is what most providers do) dealing with multiple measurement frameworks, sometimes for the same home or foster agency or school.
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving designed monitoring and measurements into contracts local authorities substantially fail to follow these through. This sometimes relates to the volatility in their own professional staffing, with children being left without an allocated social worker, being unknown and un-contacted by virtual head teachers, having no representation at statutory reviews.
default&#xa0;
defaultContracts also tend to be too rigid, with authorities increasingly wanting to define in minute detail what they are buying, whereas a good provider working with a volatile and challenging young person with complex needs has to have flexibility to respond in real time.
default&#xa0;
defaultOnce again we return to our theme that the contracts need to be about people not process and strict adherence to general rules. Relationship procurement and contract management is required, which demands higher levels of both technical and interpersonal skills than are prevalent today.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, local authorities have inherent conflicts of interest in that they are often both procurers and providers. This situation completely undermines trust in their propriety.
default5. How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective?default&#xa0;
defaultThe continued weaknesses in contract monitoring by authorities increases the risk of impropriety.
default&#xa0;
defaultProvider services discussed here are almost always regulated and inspected by Ofsted. However, Ofsted inspectors are not expected to possess forensic accountancy skills. Ofsted inspection is designed for a different purpose than contract monitoring.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our work in the financial area we also sometimes find a disjoint between the placement functions and the payment functions within a local authority so that it can be surprisingly difficult to relate actual invoices being settled by the authority to the client and service being received. Budget monitoring can be excellent but we have also seen instances where it is at best tortuous and at worse at risk from over- and under- invoicing.
default&#xa0;
default6. Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe adherence to EU rules has brought about some transparency, but there is much here that can be improved also.
default&#xa0;
defaultTender processes have become increasingly dominated by price over difficult-to-measure quality and outcomes. Even where quality is measured and appears to be the dominant factor the scoring of tender tends to produce much wider scoring divergence on price methodology than on quality. Hence even where price is claimed to be 40% vs quality at 60% of the decision, if a top scoring low price provider can score 30% more than others because of the mathematical approach, and all bidders are within +/-10% of subjective quality measures, then price has still determined the outcome.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is little or no external scrutiny of the local authority procurement in this area, either during or after the process. Claims made, as mentioned elsewhere, are rarely measured in a transparent way, and virtually never audited.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn total there is very little true accountability to local areas or to central government that value for money is being delivered.
