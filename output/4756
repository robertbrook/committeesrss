defaultResponse from Kevin Hurley, PCC for Surrey:default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of my first acts as PCC was to do away with numerical targets for the police force – the first in the country to do so. The target culture has had a negative impact on British policing over the last 20 years.
default&#xa0;
default Targets provide reassurance to politicians but they mean very little to the wider public. They can lead to perverse incentives towards policing activity that satisfies performance managers and no-one else.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default I believe that the impact of doing away with targets has been very positive for policing in Surrey and nationally.
default&#xa0;
default Locally we are seeing a police force confident to record correctly and do the right thing for the victim and public.
default&#xa0;
default We have seen detection rates fall as a result, due to audit and changes in recording practices.
default&#xa0;
default Whilst I would clearly like to see detection rates improved, it is more important that we correctly record what is happening.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Nationally, I have lead the way in doing away with targets and with others following this should improve crime recording practices in England and Wales. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMy small team of support staff do not have capacity to carry out data audits so we can never be fully confident that data is 100% accurate.
default&#xa0;
default However, we do what we can to move towards that aim.
default&#xa0;
default As outlined above, the most important step has been the doing away of targets to give the freedom to record correctly.
default&#xa0;
default Surrey Police has an internal audit function, including audits in relation to crime data, and a force crime registrar in place. I have a senior member of staff who considers crime data, who meets with the force crime registrar and we receive copies of Surrey Police internal data audits.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default My office also has full and unrestricted access to the Surrey Police management information system and can look into data trends and ask appropriate questions.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have also asked our Internal Auditors, Baker Tilly, to carry out an audit of Disposal Methods and Crime Recording.
default&#xa0;
default This has recently been done and we are currently considering the recommendations but indicat
defaultions
default are 
defaultthat 
defaultthe auditors have reasonable assurance that the right controls are in place and no high priority recommendations have been made.
default&#xa0;
default We will publish the results of this audit report in due course for transparency.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default We are aware that HMIC are currently gathering crime recording data from forces and will 
defaultbe doing fieldwork shortly on data quality and we look forward to receiving this external reporting of our, and national, crime data standards. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI hold the Chief Constable to account at bi-monthly webcast management meetings.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Performance information, including crime data, is presented at these meetings allowing me to ask questions with regard to any trends.
default&#xa0;
default Alongside a quarterly update on progress against the Police and Crime Plan, I publish a quarterly performance report from Surrey Police to provide public and community safety partners information on performance and allow extra external scrutiny. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough I have not set targets, I have set out the 6 People’s Priorities for policing and crime issues.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese priorities include being uncompromising in police standards expected by the public.
default&#xa0;
default This would include the expectation for ethical and accurate crime recording practices. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease do get back to me if you require any further information.
