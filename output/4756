Written evidence from Kevin Hurley, Crime Commissioner, Surrey [CST0037]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please find below a response on behalf of Kevin Hurley, PCC for Surrey, to the questions posed in your letter of 6
[normal]th
[normal] December with regard to crime statistics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Response from Kevin Hurley, PCC for Surrey:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of my first acts as PCC was to do away with numerical targets for the police force – the first in the country to do so. The target culture has had a negative impact on British policing over the last 20 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Targets provide reassurance to politicians but they mean very little to the wider public. They can lead to perverse incentives towards policing activity that satisfies performance managers and no-one else.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I believe that the impact of doing away with targets has been very positive for policing in Surrey and nationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Locally we are seeing a police force confident to record correctly and do the right thing for the victim and public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We have seen detection rates fall as a result, due to audit and changes in recording practices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Whilst I would clearly like to see detection rates improved, it is more important that we correctly record what is happening.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Nationally, I have lead the way in doing away with targets and with others following this should improve crime recording practices in England and Wales. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My small team of support staff do not have capacity to carry out data audits so we can never be fully confident that data is 100% accurate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However, we do what we can to move towards that aim.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] As outlined above, the most important step has been the doing away of targets to give the freedom to record correctly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Surrey Police has an internal audit function, including audits in relation to crime data, and a force crime registrar in place. I have a senior member of staff who considers crime data, who meets with the force crime registrar and we receive copies of Surrey Police internal data audits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] My office also has full and unrestricted access to the Surrey Police management information system and can look into data trends and ask appropriate questions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have also asked our Internal Auditors, Baker Tilly, to carry out an audit of Disposal Methods and Crime Recording.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This has recently been done and we are currently considering the recommendations but indicat
[normal]ions
[normal] are 
[normal]that 
[normal]the auditors have reasonable assurance that the right controls are in place and no high priority recommendations have been made.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We will publish the results of this audit report in due course for transparency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We are aware that HMIC are currently gathering crime recording data from forces and will 
[normal]be doing fieldwork shortly on data quality and we look forward to receiving this external reporting of our, and national, crime data standards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hold the Chief Constable to account at bi-monthly webcast management meetings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Performance information, including crime data, is presented at these meetings allowing me to ask questions with regard to any trends.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Alongside a quarterly update on progress against the Police and Crime Plan, I publish a quarterly performance report from Surrey Police to provide public and community safety partners information on performance and allow extra external scrutiny. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although I have not set targets, I have set out the 6 People’s Priorities for policing and crime issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These priorities include being uncompromising in police standards expected by the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This would include the expectation for ethical and accurate crime recording practices. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please do get back to me if you require any further information.
