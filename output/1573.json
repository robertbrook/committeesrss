"              \n&#xa0;Written evidence from Preseli Rural Transport Association and Capital Traffic Management Limited (TIC 057)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nWe welcome the Committee’s interest in ensuring access to adequate passenger transport services by people in isolated communities where operating scheduled bus \nor waterborne \nservice\ns, say, \nwould \nbe uneconomic and \nrarely\n justified.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nIn such areas, there are many who are prevented from participating fully in education, training, employment and social \nactivity \nbecause they lack access to a motor vehicle.  This problem acutely affects the young, the elderly \nand disable\nd people of all ages, denying them the contribution they could make to community life.\n \n Those with mental health problems may have these exacerbated by isolation.\n&#xa0;\n              \nCommunications (telephone, cellphone\n, internet access, information\n) may also \nbe lacking\n or \nof poor quality\n in remote areas\n, creating issues of \ntheir\n own, \nand \nwith consequences for \naccess to \ntransportation services.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nA range of transportation needs are apparent.  These include emergency transport,\n \ntransport\n to medical services\n, commuting, \nshopping, visiting friends and relations, \nand \naccessing long distance travel, \nor \nrecreation and leisure\n facilities.\n&#xa0;\n              \nE\nmergency\n transport in remote areas is provided by Air-Sea Rescue\n (ASR)\n, the Air Ambulance, Royal National L\nifeboat \nI\nnstitute (RNLI)\n,\n \nthe \nCoastguard\n,\n mountain rescue, \nblue light services\n and other organisations.  \nResponse times are often significantly longer than in urban areas and \nt\nhe Committee may wish, for the purposes of the Inquiry\n or \notherwise\n, \nto review the adequacy of their coverage\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n              \nWe assume that \nd\naily or frequent commut\ners \nwould not choose to live in remote areas without the assurance of good access\n by\n \ncar or scheduled ferry, bus or rail service\n.  \nHowever, it would surely be undesirable were \npeople \nto \nbe forced out \nby lack of ac\ncess to \na \nmotor vehicle or public transport service.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nProvision of\n \ntransportation \nservices \nin remote areas \nis \ni\nnherently expensive b\necause of the distance\ns\n, the low population density and hence \ntheir \nlimited \nand spasmodic \ntake-up\n, low \nutilisation\n \nof equipment \nand high \nfuel costs.\n&#xa0;\n              \nOrganisations seeking to plug the gap\ns\n are invariably based on volunteers\n, charitable \ndonations, \nuncertain \nlocal government grants\n \nand/or low-paid staff\n along with Concessionary Fares Rebates\n.  The continuity and reliabi\nlity of the services offered may be \n              \nundermined by intermittent and\n/or\n low \ncashflow and therefore \nstaffing.\n&#xa0;\n              \nFew local CTAs or groups wanting to form CTAs will have the resources to prepare \nsubmissions to the Inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nThe reliance that \nremote \ncommunities \nhave\n on \nthe available\n paratransit\n services is often extreme.  Over-provision is never an issue, though there may \noccasionally \nbe some duplication\n and often spare capacity\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n              \nWith the rising costs of fuel and car use, the essential nature of \nlifeline service provision should be recognised\n,\n and positively rather than passively supported.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n              \nIt is a fortunate characteristic of many isolated communities that neighbours assist each other informally as a matter of course.    \nHowever, such assis\ntance can never be taken for \ngranted, with age, infirmity, \nabsence\n, demands of emp\nloyment and others they care for \ncreating uncertainty.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n              \nOur submission canvasses some potential solutions to \neasing \nthe \nphysical and social \nisolation \nand \nconseq\nuential \nloneliness\n, \nthe decline in \nmental health\n, \nlack of healthcare access\n and other problems that afflict\n many small communities\n located largely \non the fringes of the \nmainland.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nIn cities and towns\n, \nwhere many of our \ndecision-makers, \nemployment and major fac\nilities \nare located, most have a choice of a range of transportation modes\n, routes\n and services available.\n  \nIn \nareas not well served by \npublic transport\n, \nmost \nmay \nwalk or cycl\ne\n.\n&#xa0;\nMany h\nouseholds do\n \nn\no\nt \nusually \nrequire\n a second car (or a car at all) to \nreach\n their employment, medical appointments, \nshopping\n centres, \neducation facilities, leisure opportunities or social events.  \nThe \nrest of the household \ntend to \nwalk, bus or cycle\n.\n&#xa0;\nFamilies, \nfriends \nand neighbours\n \nare \noften avail\nable to support each other in illness and older age. \n \nFamilies without a car a\nvailable \ncan often visit by bus or on foot to help out when needed. \n \nIsolation happens, but not often \nthrough lack of access to a car or alternatives.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nB\nusinesses in urban areas are unlikely to struggle to find a range of employees, unless they are looking for very specialist skills or knowledge\n, or customers\n. \n \nMany people will be able to reach the workplace, even on a shift basis, with or without their ow\nn transport.\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThis \nextensive \nflexibility allows people to adopt least-cost strategies (\neg.\n \ntrip-specific modal choice\n) \nfor personal transportation (or have no choice, as in the case of young people)\n.  \nWalking and cycling \nis \nmore practical\n.  \nPublic transport services tend to be frequent, though often under-utilised in off-peak hours.  \n&#xa0;\nWhile p\nrivate motorin\ng is increasingly expensive, especially over the relatively short distances that cars are typically used \nin cities and towns \n(&lt; 8km)\n, it m\nay remain\n dominant until Peak Oil begins to bite.\n  Electric vehicles \nmay \nnever be a solution for most people\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nT\nougher economic conditions are unlikely to cost many people in urban areas their jobs, their ability to g\no shopping or\n visiting friends or fami\nly.\n  However, Councils should be require\nd to identify \nareas where transport provision is poor, and ensure that access is available \nto all \nby public \ntransport\n \nor a \nviabl\ne\n community-\nbased alternative\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.\n4\n              \nIn rural and other remote areas, the picture is \naltogether different.  This is not due to\n a difference in the people - it i\ns just geography. \n&#xa0;\nFor most people, it is too far to walk to shops, doctors, leisure centres and, in many cases, to \nvisit relatives.  Most country roads do not have any kind of fo\notpath or street lighting.  \n&#xa0;\nCycling is an option for some people on some journeys, but most country \nroads are not safe \nfor cyclists.  Places people want to or need to visit on a \nregular\n basis are not often close enough to make cycling a viable option. \nBus\nes are often not viable in remote \nareas\n.  Where dependent on central g\novernment funding, \nmany \nfinancially supported services have \nfaced major \ncut\ns\n. \n \nWhere buses do \noperate\n, services are unlikely to run in the evening\n,\n and there is often nowhere sheltere\nd and safe to wait. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nMany\n rural centres – lar\nger villages and small towns – now have limited public transport.  However, accessing them from the surrounding area is still difficult on foot or by bicycle\n,\n as the distances are often significant\n.  S\nafe\n roads for pedestrians and cyclists \ntypically do not begin until\n \nwith\nin the town or village. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nPeople and businesses in \nremote\n areas have the same \ntransportation requirements\n as people in urban areas\n.  Unless a car \nis \navailable though, \naccess \nto good\ns and services will be restricted, often severely. \n&#xa0;\n              \nRural businesses are less likely to be able to \nrecruit \nsuitable employees.  Potential workers \nwithout access to a car may find some areas\n and employment\n completely inaccessible, and other areas only at restricted times of the day. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n              \nPut simply, people and businesses in rural areas without ready access to a car whenever \nrequired \nsuffer \na \nlack of opportunity economically, socially and in accessing heal\nth and care services.\n  \nBecause \nof \nthe\n \nageing population and the increasing cost of motoring threatening car access to more households, \nremote areas are being depopulated\n, especially of younger \npeople\n and becoming even more isolated.  There is \nno foreseeabl\ne possibility of a change in this trend. \n \n&#xa0;\nClosing services and facilities due to Government funding cuts have disproportionately more impact in \nremote \nareas where the next service or facility may be completely out of reach.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nOne option is to take \nthe goods and services to isolated communities. Many people in rural areas shop online, but this threatens local businesses, reduces choice and removes the opportunity for social interaction and community \ndevelopment.\n Older and more vulnerabl\ne people often\n do not have \nthis option.\n \n Some people e-commute\n, which works well for some\n, but \nit \nincreases \nof the \nisolation\n of the remainder\n, severely limits job opportunities and does not achieve the same social benefits most working people enjoy. \n&#xa0;\nMobile libraries, \nhairdressers and so on provide excellent services, but \nthey are \ndelivered in \na\n way \nthat is\n necessarily limited\n.  They \ndo not provide all \nthe social benefits of visiting \npremises and meeting other people, or \nidentifying\n the full range of services available.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q1              How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?&#xa0;\nQ1.1\n              \nIn the first place, the authorities should \naccept\n, as the Chair of the Committee says, \nthat…\n&#xa0;\nPeople from different communities across the UK should have access to adequate transport services\n \nLouise Ellman MP\n&#xa0;\n              \nThis immediately establishes \nthe legitimacy of \na lower bound \nin\n demand.\n&#xa0;\n              \nWhile this demand will be at a \nmuch\n more\n reduced\n level in isolated rural, coastal and island communities than in towns and cities, \nthe same types of requirements other than \nfor \ndaily commuting can be \nsafely \nassumed. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ1.2\n              \nWe propose that systematic surve\nys are undertaken of a sample of such communities to identify all \nthe \ntravel requirements they generate, including those at present unfulfilled.\n&#xa0;\n              \nThe team \nthat authored this submission would be ideally pl\naced to carry out such research, \n              \npreferably \nin \nco\noperation\n with\n other paratransit providers\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ1.3\n              \nThis is not to suggest that all transportation demands will be realisable or should be \nall \nfinanced by central and/or local authorities.  Even favoured city dwellers do not expect that, especially as costs\n are rising for all motorised modes.\n  \nNeither do they expect fast travel, given \nour over-reliance on the least efficient mode – cars.\n&#xa0;\n              \nPeak Car\n might well be bringing despair to motor manufacturers, but that simply shows they are failing to respond to the\n market and \nnot \nproducing \naffordable \nmass transit vehicles!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ1.4\n              \nIn the case of urban and suburban areas with poor transport connections, questions should be asked of Councils procuring transport services as to why some areas are not well served.\n&#xa0;\n              \nRecen\nt changes to bus operator grants and cuts in local authority finances have forced both parties to review services and any subsidies that were provided, vis-à-vis other possibly more pressing claims\n on their stretched budgets\n.  \n&#xa0;\nThe reduction in public sup\nport appears to have marginalised some \nurban communities\n, reducing their access to community and social life and their employability.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ2              To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;\nQ2.1\n              \nTo the extent they are provided by local initiatives, the latter appear to be struggling to meet those varying demands, given their \noften \nhigh cost.\n&#xa0;\n              \nNevert\nh\neless, the fundamental legitimacy of those demands \nrequire\ns\n us to address all the issues such client groups give rise to.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ3              What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;\nQ3.1\n              \nCost, and the variability of demand.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ3.2\n              \nIt would be unfair to impose such requirements on commercial operators, and provided that community-based initiatives were well-suppo\nrted financially\n, prob\nably unnecessary.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ3.3\n              \nIt would be reasonable\n \nfor isolated communities to have access to \nferry ports, \nrailheads and \n              \nbus stops where rural and island \nproviders\n \ncould safely leave passengers for the\nir\n onward \n              \njourneys.  \n&#xa0;\n              \nThis may \nmean the construction\n of a shelter, and \nbe \nfurther \nfacilitated by \nthe provision of \nbetter \nreal-time and other passenger information in remote locations\n – which is especially proble\nmatic where there is no cellular tele\nphone or data signal\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhile we would be reluctant to support any further retrenchment of scheduled bus and rail \nservices anywhere, there may be, albeit probably limited, \npotential in shortening the routes and/or reducing the frequencies of the latter where community initiatives\n could fill the gap, switching the available funding accordingly.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ3.4\n              \nIt \nis probably the case\n that\n (financially-supported)\n community transport associations are better placed to provide transport ser\nvices to isolated communities than (subsidised) \ncommerc\nial operators.\n \n \nCommunity transport is cost-\neffective, responsive and non-profit making, but it must be financially viable and, as importantly, financially stable.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ4              How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;\nQ4.1\n              \nGiven their very limited resources, it is unsurprising that many local needs are not currently being met.  \n              \nSome Councils have been supportive to the extent their constrained budgets a\nllow, while others do not assist community transport in any way.  Local CTAs have found it impossible to engage with \nmany of \nthe latter.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ4.2\n              \nCommunity transport associations do not waste their scarce and precarious funding.  Much administrative time is \nspent in scrambling for limited funds, often from a wide variety of sources.  This makes planning ahead very difficult, and expansion to better meet existing needs virtually impossible.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ4.3\n              \nThe \nPreseli\n Rural Transport Association\n (Green Dragon Bus)\n, for\n example,\n secures funding from \nConcessionary \nT\nravel rebate\ns, a \nService Level Agreement (with Pembrokeshire County Council), \na \nservice bus route (for Ceredigion \nCounty Council), various grants\n \nand \nEuropean rural area \nfunds.  Small or very small amounts come\n from \nmembership fees, mileage contribution and donations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ4.4\n              \nThe best way to support transport associations that have shown themselves to be well-supported \nby the local \ncommunity\n would be by way of grants…\n&#xa0;\n- to develop their websites (preferably usin\ng a template that would fit readily within \nthe portals of transport information providers)\n and telephone support for those without internet access\n- to assist with procurement of vehicles\n, insurance\n and maintenance\n&#xa0;\n- to market their services within their \narea of operation\n&#xa0;\n- to encourage their use by tourists\n and recreational travellers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ5              To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?&#xa0;\nQ5.1\n              \nTaxis could and should \noccupy a very different role tha\nn\n hitherto in the UK.  \nThey ought to complement other public and community transport services, such as buses in low-density areas, and at off-peak times.\n&#xa0;\nThey should be cheaper\n to hire\n, while at the same time \nensu\nring \nthat \ntheir drivers \nobtain \na reasonable income.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ5.2\n              \nAn imaginative assessment should be made of their potential in urban, rural and remote areas before this question should be answered.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ5.3\n              \nI\nt \nis probably much \ncheaper to provide taxis and other demand-responsive transport \nservices \nto isolated communities than scheduled bus or rail services.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ6              What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? &#xa0;\nQ6.1\n              \nLack of cent\nral and local government commitment over time\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n              \nCommunity Transport organisations have no certainty of funding beyond a year or two for most funding sources\n,\n putting service development, provision and employment at constant risk\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ7              How can these services be made more affordable?&#xa0;\nQ7.1\n              \nThe real opportunity is to invest properly in \nremote area\n transport, through supported public transport, community transport, car clubs, scooter hire for young people, Dial-A-Ride for the older and more frail, and other Community Transport solutions such as Country Cars, community minibus hire, taxi and car shar\ning and other local and national schemes for those without access to a car when they need to travel. \n&#xa0;\n              \nCommunity transport associations endeavour to provide an appropriate range of services to \nthe extent their finances permit\n, but \nthese\n are patchy at best\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ7.2\n              \nGreater take-up of such services will reduce their \nper capita\n cost\n, which is bound to occur as car use continues to decline\n and the population ages and becomes more \ninfirm\n.  However, we contend that affordability is not the issue.  \n&#xa0;\n              \nThe focus mu\nst be on adequate provision to ensure a reasonable level of access and mobility for all\n, now and in the future\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThere is much national and local Government rhetoric regarding equal access to services, ensuing equal opportuniti\nes for all \nin education, employment, business development, social and health care and so on. \n But n\none of these can be addressed without proper access to transport in \nremote\n areas,\n where the largest \ndefici\nency \nlies. \n&#xa0;\nThere is no point in having the best h\nospital, factory or school if people cannot get to them and home again safely and affordably. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nAdequate\n \npublic and community \nt\nransport provision enables remote\n communities to be\ncome more \neconomically sustainable, reduces isolation, ensures access to\n goods and services, reduces mental health problems and difficult\nies\n in accessing \nmedical services.\n&#xa0;\nIt ensures \naccess for people and businesses to earn money and contribute to the economy. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nThe Inquiry is timely, in that\n transportation costs will continue to rise, and existing services will continue to be threatened.\n&#xa0;\nAccess and mobility that urban dwellers currently take for granted are a quantum leap above that available to people is isolated communities.\n&#xa0;\nAccess to job\ns, services, health care and a social life is critical to\n both\n physical \nand mental health. \n To our ageing population\n, isolation\n is a challenge.  \n&#xa0;\nIn some rural areas, suc\nh as s\nouth\nw\nest Wales\n,\n younger people are moving out to find employment and older peop\nle are moving in to retire\n.  T\nhe ageing of the population is accelerated\n, \nexacerbating the problem where car\n-\nless living is already least\n-well\n provided for.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nIn many areas, there is no support for community transport from Councils.  Local groups \nseeking assistance to establish community transport have often been unable to find anyone in the Councils to engage with.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nWe suspect that there may be few \nsubmissions to the Inquiry from local CTAs, potentially undermining the Committee’s objectives\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nWe understand that very few local CTAs would have the resources available to apply to \npreparing \na submission.\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nTo periodically survey\n remote populations as to their mobility and access requirements, and \n \n              \ncommunity transport associ\nations for ridership, trip lengths, costs and other metrics\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nTo provide a reliable source of \nadditional and long-term \ngrants \nto fund or part-fund \ncommunity transport, \nwith specific consideration being given to \nthe items listed in Q4.4.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nTo \nencourage the development of best practice in the sector, by funding appropriate learning resources.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nTo \nencourage all Councils to review their provisions for community transport.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nTo \nregularly survey Councils as to the extent of their support \nfor community transport.\n&#xa0;\nNote&#xa0;\n              \nThe submitting organisations propose to apply for funding\n…\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n- to survey a sample of remote areas to identify typical transportation requirements\n&#xa0;\n- to survey community transport associations\n,\n and groups intending to e\nstablish a CTA\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n- to survey Councils and their support for community transport\n&#xa0;\n- \nto research and\n produce a best practice manual\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nWe would be pleased to discuss this proposal further with the Committee if requested.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAppendix 1              Submitting Organisations and Contact Data&#xa0;&#xa0;              Preseli
