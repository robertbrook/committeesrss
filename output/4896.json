The city region’s focus on growth is, in some senses, progressed through the city deal. The community budget seeks to lower ‘failure demand’ for pub\nlic services through early intervention to tackle early years, troubled families, criminal justice, health and social care issues. If successful\n,\n this would enable disadvantaged households and communities to participate in and benefit from Greater Manchest\ner’s city deal economic opportunities in a virtuous ‘win-win’ circle.”\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\n2\n.6\n              \nT\nhe \nLondon Finance Commission \nalso \ncalls \nfor an extension to the remit and scale of \nCommunity Budget Pilots\n, and the idea\n \nof \nintegrating \nlocal economic development \nwith public service reform \nappears to \nhave \nsome \nmomentum\n.

This \nis manifesting\n itself in LE\nP Boards where \nsome \nBusiness Members\n are concerned \nat whether \nthey\n \npossess\n \nthe necessary skill\ns\n and experience\n. \nAs LEPs allocate\n and disperse\n greater amounts of funding, t\nhe issue\ns\n of \nlegal\n status and\n indemnities \nhave\n arisen, \nwhich \nhas\n \nprovided a stimulus for\n \nmore\n \nLEPs \nopting to \nbecome\n limited companies.  \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCity Deals\n and Growth Deals\n are a me\nans for local areas to decide\n strategic \neconomic \npri\norities\n and \nto negotiate and \nconclude agreements \nwith \nGovernment.\n \nHowever, an evident\n practical challenge\n is \nto understand \nand deconstruct \nhow\n these Deals \nare\n achieved\n.\n \nD\navid Marlow\n’s recent\n \nblog \noffers an instructive\n contribution\n on\n the subject\n: \n&#xa0;\n“When \nhistory comes to evaluate the Coalition Government’s approach to local growth, I suspect the fundamental critique of 2010-15 will be the subsuming of political values and conviction – whether to localism, city leadership, rebalancing, really to anything – \nin a series of tactical and one-sided ‘deals’. The ‘deal’ approach allows govern\nment to deconstruct 39 LEP, 28 C\nity, and any number of other places’ \nambitions into a series of bilateral negotiations with individual departments and agencies. The ‘deal’ mode\nl requires local leadership teams to ‘prove’ each individual proposition in a demonstration of their abilities to ‘haggle’ with an oligarchic patron. The default position is agreement to a slightly modified status quo where government retains the preponder\nance of powers, resources, flexibilities and influen\nce.....\n.\"\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nGovernment emphasises the value of deals in encouraging innovation, bespoke local approaches and decentralisation. Yet the deal-making system and culture raises questions concerning effect\niveness, consistency and equal treatment and the loss of scale economies in policy-making at the centre. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n.1\n              \nIn preference to the unbalanced deal-making syst\nem that is emerging, w\ne support the \ncreation \nof meaningful \n‘\nCentre-Local Contracts\n’\n to manage decentralisation\n.\n \nOECD analysis of international practice, such as the \n‘\nContrats de Ville\n’\n \nthat operate\n \nin France, suggest\ns\n that it is possible to allow for innovation, tailored local approaches and decentra\nlisation but within a more transparent, fair and accountable system.\n \nIn terms of \naccountability, i\nt is \nimportant \nto \ndistinguish between \naudit\n and scrutiny.\n It \nis \ninsufficient for \n‘\ndevolved\n’\n areas to \nintroduce\n \nfinancial \nmanagement \nprocesses \nwithout \nalso \nbeing \nsubject \nto broader public\n oversight\n. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.2\n              \nThe \nuse \nof\n \npublic service\n outso\nurcing\n require\ns \neffective \nscruti\nny of decision-making\n and delivery\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4\n.3\n              \nSome Combined Authorities, such as Greater Manchester, have \nestablished \nformal scrutiny arrangements \nthat\n provide \na check and balance \non \nthe\n \nexecutive.\n \nOther\n measures\n, such as publishing\n \npa\npers and minutes of meetings\n,\n \nshould form \nan integral \npart of the governance \nof cities, city regions and LEPs\n. \nPublic meetings, \nin which \nindividuals and \ncommunities ha\nve \nthe opportunity \nto question decision-makers\n, sh\nould also be held\n. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.4\n              \nIn relation to\n executive and legislative responsibility\n, \nthe Core Cities are seeking a\n \nchange \nin \nParliamentary Standing Orders to limit the questions that Ministers can ask of local\n politicians.\n \nWhile\n \nthe UK \nPa\nrliament has a crucial role,\n \nconcerns have been raised\n \nabout the \nsuitability and \ncapacity of Parliament to monitor local government spending\n, particularly\n as the Audit Commission \nis wound\n \ndown\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDecentralisation is an \ninternational phenomenon.\n \nW\nithin \nnew and \nemergent forms of local an\nd regional economic development\n there has been \na \nresurgence\n of local and regional levels of government – driven by the devolution of powers from\n central governments\n.\n \nDetailed studies\n \nof O\nECD \nmember \ncountries \n– between 1980 and 2005 –\n \nsuggest \nthat there is \na \nweak correlation \nbetween decent\nralisation and economic growth\n,\n whilst recent analysis indicates that it is difficult to draw \nfirm \nconclusions\n about\n local fiscal autonomy and the economic success of cities.\n S\ntudies of the UK\n’s\n \ndistinct \nexperience have \nalso \nfound \nin\nconclusive \nevidence \nto date \nof an \neconomic dividend\n \nemerging \nfrom\n devolution\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.2\n              \nT\nhe Core Cities \ncontend \nthat there \nis a\n “[S]\ntrong \nrelationship between the ability of cities to drive growth, the levels of local\n \nfinancial control and the freedom to make policies ma\ntch the needs of places”,\n derived from th\ne perceived benefits\n of \n‘\ntax competition\n’\n and the power to raise \nadditional\n reven\nue\n to fund goods, services and infrastructure\n.\n \nO\nther studies suggest that sub-national and local governments could assist with national fiscal consolidation (and reduce central transfers) if they raised more taxes locally.\n  \n&#xa0;\n5\n.3\n              \nR\nesearch\n \nled \nby Professor Michael Parkinson \nCBE\n,\n \non ‘Second Tier Cities’\n,\n \noffers \na useful perspective on decentralisation and the contribution of cities to national competitiveness and welfare. \nIt\n suggest\ns\n that genuine decentralisation to cities\n (including but cruciall\ny also\n beyond capital cities)\n, \nalongside \nrecognition of the \nimportance of the \ncontinuing different roles of, and \nrelationship between\n,\n national governments and local actors\n, \nunderpinned by \nbalanced territorial public and private investment\n,\n will provide th\ne\n basis \nin the long term \nfor successful national economies and higher performing cities.\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.4\n              \nThe call for cities and localities to be given new \ntax and borrowing \npowers \nis \npredicated\n on a \nview\n that the \nbenefits \nof fiscal decentralisation\n \nc\nould be \n(re)\ninvested in \ninfrastructure \nto support \nurban growth\n,\n \nalbeit \nwithin \na \nnational \nframework\n.\n  \nThis represents\n, in part,\n an attempt to \nreverse \nthe \ntrend \nof \nsuccessive UK \nGovernment\ns\n \nin \nfavouring \nconsumption\n over capital spending\n.\n \nTo illustrate, t\nhe proposed \nn\new fiscal \npowers for \nthe Welsh Assembly Government \nare being linked directly to \nthe upgrade \nof the M4 Motorway\n.\n \nWhilst i\nn London, the \nG\nreater \nL\nondon \nA\nuthority\n \n(GLA) \nsees fiscal decentralisation\n as \na key element \nof\n the London Infrastructure Investment Plan 2050.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\ne\ncentralisation\n of authority and resources from nation-state\ns to regions and localities \ncould \npose a \nchallenge\n to\n \nmacro \nspatial economic \nefficiency and equity\n.\n \nA highly unequal map of resources and prosperity could result. \nA narrow \ndefinition\n of f\niscal decentralisation\n, \nstemming \nfrom \na \nhighly competitive \nmodel of \nurban development\n, could \nharden the \ninequality between core and peripheral areas shaped by \nmarket processes, agglomeration ec\nonomies and increasing returns\n.\n If the geography of fiscal dec\nentralisation is \nfixed\n at too small a scale \nthere are risks of ‘tax flight’ as businesses and individuals \nseek the benefits of \nlower taxes in neighbouring cities or \nlocal \nareas.\n \n&#xa0;\n6\n.2\n              \nWe would \nc\naution policy-makers \nagainst \nseeing \nfashionable \n‘off the sh\nelf’ policy prescriptions as \ninstant\n \nremedies\n for \ntackling \nlow \ngrowth\n. Local context \nand historical paths of development shape\n, to a large degree,\n the socio-economic, political and cultural \ngeographies of \nparticular\n places\n, including cities and city region\ns\n.\n \nCertain s\ntrategies and policies may\n work in one particular place but may not be appropriate \nin\n others. \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nN\new local government finance arrangements\n \nhave been introduced \nin England and Wales\n,\n \nagainst a backdrop of real term reductions in local government \nformula/\ngrant funding of a magnitude not \nseen\n recently\n.\n In \nthe \nnew \nBusiness Rate Retention Scheme (BRRS), s\nafety net payments \nwill \nbe made to\n \nlocal \nauthorities \nwhose income drop\ns\n below baselin\ne fundin\ng. \nThis risks entrenching the inequalities between more and less prosperous places with different growth potentials. \nIn addition, t\nhe Government has encouraged authorities to pool BRRS to manage risks. \nCrucially, \nhowever\n, \ncouncils \nwill \nnow share\n the risk\ns\n \nof \nany overestimat\nions\n of business rates. \nA\ns a footnote, a\nccording to the National Audit\n Office\n, between 2006 and\n 2\n0\n11, the Office for Budget Responsibility overestimated the net yield of business \nrates in four out of five years\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7\n.1\n              \nThe ca\nll for greater fiscal decentralisation\n in England is taking place within \nbroader \ndebates about the constitutional \narrangements \nin \nthe UK.\n \nThe UK is out of step internationally and especially its cities and localities in England\n outside London\n. \nScotl\nand, Wales and London have \nexisting structures \nthat \nthe UK Government can \nnegotiate with and \ndevolve powers\n to. In \nEngland, \nbeyond \nLondon, \nthe \nrecipients of \npossible \nfiscal devolution\n are still to be \nfinalised\n. \nAlthough t\nhe Government see\ns\n C\nombined Authorities as bodies that \nit can \ndevolve\n powers and funding to\n, \nit is questionable \nwhether \nsuch structures\n \nrepresent \nradical \nconstitutional change\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7\n.2\n              \nThe Core Cities\n \nare proposing a new legally binding agreement between local and national go\nvernment \nto set\n out \nnew \nroles and responsibilities. Other changes include \nthe \nco-design of \npolicies\n that affe\nct\n cities\n.\n The LGA is \npushing \nfor multi-year budgets, new powers to raise bonds and ‘constitutionally-embedded’ local government.\n \n&#xa0;\n7\n.3\n              \nN\nations and cities/city regions compete \nwith each other \nbut \nalso \ncollaborate \nwhen there is a shared\n \nstrategic interest.\n \nLondon\n, for example,\n \nsee\ns \nthe objective\n of \nfiscal \ndecentralisation\n as a collective e\nndeavour\n with the Core Cities.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n.1\n              \nT\nhe London Finance Commission\n recommends that\n the full suite of property taxes (council tax, business rates, stamp duty land tax, annual tax on enveloped dwellings \nand capital gains (i.e. Mansion Tax) \nshould be\n \ndevolved \nto London.\n \nT\nhe \nCore Cities \nwant \nthe \ndevolution of property taxes\n; limited powers to raise taxes (e.g. a VAT supplement or hotel room tax)\n;\n \nthe \npossibility of a local business bank\n;\n and \nthe \nexten\nsion o\nf the\n single pot approach to capital funds.\n&#xa0;\n8\n.2\n              \nThe \nUK Government \nplans \nto \ndevolve\n,\n \nto the Welsh Assembly Government\n,\n \nlandfill tax and stamp duty \nland tax; and \nto \nlegislate \nfor a referendum \non \nwhether \na p\nercentage\n of \nincome tax should be devolved\n to the Welsh Assembly Government\n.\n&#xa0;\n8\n.3\n              \nOur view is that \nthe \nnature of the \narrangements for local authorities to retain busines\ns rates point\ns\n towards \nsome \nfurther \nlimited decentralisation\n of property taxes. However,\n given the economic context, political se\nnsitivities\n and Central Government influence over \nlocal\n taxation\n, \nany \nadditional \nfiscal decentralisation\n \nin England \nis likely to \nbe incremental\n in nature\n. \n&#xa0;\n8\n.4\n              \nGreater f\niscal autonomy\n \nshould \nnot intensify spatial disparities\n or \nimpact \nnegatively \nup\non those \nunable \nto \npay additional tax\n. \nTransfers and safety net systems should not be compromised and unpicked as part of greater decentralisation. \nI\nn the United States\n,\n \np\nroperty taxes \nare typically\n regressive\n,\n and\n poor\ner\n homeowners \npay more of their \nincomes in property taxes than any other group.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9\n.1\n              \nThe \nGLA \nis asking \nfor local authority \nborrowing limits (within the Prudential Code) \nto be relaxed \nwhilst the Core Cities \nwants the \nGovernment to raise the Housing Revenue Account borrowing cap.\n&#xa0;\n9\n.2\n              \nIn October 2010, \nHM Treasury made borrowing for councils more expensive by \nraising \nthe \nPublic Works Loan Board (\nPWLB\n)\n interest rate\n.\n \nHowever, the desire by the centre to \nencourage local institutional innovation\n for borrowing is potentially costly, uncertain and risky relative to\n HM Government\n. \nT\nhe UK Government could borrow \nat \na cheaper rate\n \nthan local\n authorities\n,\n but\n \ndeficit reduction \nis\n \nthe overriding objective of \nthe \nCoalition\n.\n \nNew forms, instruments or business models of debt finance need to be explored where Central and Local Government can work together/co-operate to reduce costs, pool risks and provide effective finance for investment – e.g. \nlike the kinds \nof guar\nantee\ns\n that HM Treasury is prepared to give London’s Government.\n&#xa0;\n9\n.3\n              \nFollowing the PWLB rate \nrise\n,\n \nlocal\n authority borrowing\n \nfell\n by 93 per cent\n.\n \nSubsequently, in \nthe \n2012 Budget\n,\n \nthe \nChancellor of the Exchequer\n \nannounced\n a 0.2 per cent\n decrease in \nthe \nPWLB rate\n. \nFurthermore, i\nn the 2012 Autumn Statement, the Government announced that it was \ncreating \na concessionary \nPWLB\n ‘Project R\nate\n’\n for LEP\ns\n. This was\n \nfollowed by a further announcement \nin \n2013 \nthat \ncheaper borrowing\n, \nof \nup to £400\n \nm\nillion\n,\n \nwas to be m\nade available \nfor \npriority \nlocal \ninfrastructure projects \nin Scotland and Wales\n. In England, LEPs and local authorities will have \nalso \naccess to \nan additional \n£800\n \nm\nillion\n of borrowing as part of \nthe \nnew \nGrowth Deals. \n&#xa0;\n9\n.4\n              \nThe UK Government \naccepts\n that the \nWelsh \nAssembly \nGovernment \nshould have new \ncapital\n borrowing arrangements\n subject to a\n proposed referendum on income tax powers.\n \nT\nhe Welsh Government \nwill \nalso \nbe offered \nearly access to limited capital borrowing \nin order to fund \nimmediate \nimprovements\n to the M4 M\notorway.\n&#xa0;\n9\n.5\n              \nThe relationship between devolved areas\n’\n borrowing powers and \nuse \nof \nthe UK Government balance sheet is\n also\n evident in \nLondon,\n \nwhere \nthe \nTreasury \nis providing \na \nguarantee \nto enable \nthe \nGLA \nto\n borrow £1\n billion\n \nfrom the \nPWLB to \nhelp \nfund \nthe Northern Line \nUnderground \ne\nxtension. \n&#xa0;\n9\n.6\n              \nUnder t\nhe Prudential Borrowing Framework (PBF) \nlocal authorities \ncan borrow for capital expenditure purposes without \nobtain\ning prior\n \nUK Government approval. \nWithin the PBF, local gov\nernment officers assess the sustainability of borrowing and set limits in\n line with the Prudential Code, which \nrequires \ncouncils \nto have the financial capacity to repay debt \nas \nb\norrowing is unsecured by assets\n.\n \nHowever, \nbecause \nPBF \nincrea\nses overall\n public sector borrowing, the\n Treasury \nretains the ability to \ncap\n PBF\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n10\n.1\n              \nFaced with \nhigher borrowing costs and \nchanges to the Housing Rev\nenue Account\n system\n \nsome \nlocal authorities \nsee\n \nbond issuance as a\nn alternative\n \nsource \nof finance\n.\n&#xa0;\n10\n.2\n              \nIn the U\nnited States\n, \nstates and cities have borrowed from \nthe \nmunicipal bond markets\n for many years\n. \nBy the end of \n2011, there were over one million \ndifferent municipal bon\nds outstanding in the US, in a\n total aggregate principal amount of more than $3.7 trillion.\n \nT\nhe \nGLA \nbecame\n the first UK local authority for s\neventeen years to issue bonds when\n, in 2011,\n it\n raise\nd\n £600\n \nm\nillion\n towards Crossrail\n.\n \nThe GLA \nneeds \nto borrow a total of £3.5\n billion\n, which is \nbeing \nsecured against \na \nbusiness rate \nsupplement.\n \n&#xa0;\n10\n.3\n              \nBond issuance\n \nsuit\ns\n \nbigger \nlocal authorities, which is why t\nhe \nLGA \nwants to create \na local authority collective bo\nnd agency \nfor \nall \nauthorities\n.\n \nHowever, \nthe municipal bond market has been\n \nrelatively \ninactive \nin the UK\n,\n and\n \ncouncils \nwill need \nexpert \nadvice \nand support \non how to \nengage with \na \nmodel that \nis \nmore complex\n and \nmore \ncostly\n than the PWLB.\n&#xa0;\n10\n.4\n              \nThe \nGLA, in its emerging\n London\n Infrastructure Investment Plan 2050\n,\n \nidentifies \ncrowd\n-\nfinancing as a way of \nproviding new \nfinance\n. \nThe \nAuthority\n is also exploring the \npossibility of \nhypothecated\n \ntaxes \nto deliver \nspecific \nprojects – subject to ballots\n. \nI\nn the United States\n \nvoters \ncan decide \nwhether local areas should \nlevy \ntaxes or\n borrow to fund capital projects\n or \nwhether the public or community sectors should own \ninfrastructure\n assets\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n10\n.5\n              \nThere \nis also \nrenewed interest\n \nin the UK \nin the merits of a\n Land Value Tax (LVT).\n Proponents \nargue\n that\n \na\n LVT could stabilise house prices\n and raise funds\n.\n At present, i\nncreases in land values usually come from external developments – such \nas \ninfrastructure – which\n,\n \nin the past\n,\n \nhave \nnot \nsought \na \nfinancial \ncontribution from \nthe land owner. \n&#xa0;\n10\n.6\n              \nOther \nfunding \ninitiatives\n include \nthe Community Infrastructure Levy and \ne\nvergreen \nf\nunds where \ncapital funding \nis loaned at or near commercial rates\n to public and/or private sector\n, paid back and subsequently\n re-invested in other\n proj\nects\n. A number of LEPs and \ncity regions \nare \ncreating\n Revolving Infrastructure Funds, \ndrawing on \n‘pump prime’ \nresources from \nthe \nRegional Growth Fund, Growing Places Fund, \nEuropean Regional Development \nFund\n,\n European Investment Bank,\n Enterprise Zones \nand Pe\nnsion Funds.\n \nCities and city regions are also turning to l\nocal authority pension funds\n to finance capital projects\n. \nBirmingham\n City Council is\n actively \nmarketing the city\n to\n \ninternational investors, specifically \nglobal \nsovereign wealth funds\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11\n.1\n              \nBoth the London Finance Commission and Core Cities are \nseeking \ngreater tax and borrowing powers\n within a framework that \nhas a neutral effect o\nn the remainder\n of local government finance (allowing for equalisation)\n.\n \nWe believe that \nfiscal decentralisation should\n be based on a robust assessment of the costs \nand benefits \nto \nindividual \ncities and local \nauthorities – a\nnd not undermine fiscal safety nets or transfers to less prosperous places with less growth potential. \n&#xa0;\n11\n.2\n              \nThe role of \nUK Government, working with cities, local authorities and LEPs should \nalso \nnot be\n overlooked\n. We think there is genuine\n merit in the C\nore Cities \nsuggestion of \na new constitutional agreement\n between Go\nvernment and local authorities. \n&#xa0;\n11\n.3\n              \nT\nhe \ntentative recovery \nof \nthe \nUK economy is geographically unbalanced.\n \nFiscal d\necentralisation\n to cities and city regions should \nbuild on the inherent \neconomic strengths of all cities and regions\n \nto the benefit of national economies, \nand \nnot \nexacerbate\n \n(inadvertently or otherwise) \ndisparities\n between different places.\n \n \nIf policy-makers are serious about the need for spatial balance in the economy and fostering a balanced \nrecovery, then fiscal decentralisation\n should itself incorp\norate a significant element of \ngeographical redistribution, directing greater resources\n towar\nds areas of greatest need.\n \n&#xa0;\n11\n.4\n              \nD\necentralisation\n alone may not generate an \nautomatic economic dividend. T\no\n \nmaximise the potential for \ncreating \nmore \nrounded \nand enduring \nlocal and urban growth, we would recommend \nthat \nGovernment \ncreates\n \nthe conditions \nfor\n more balanced territorial \ninvestment \nby introducing \na \nnew \nnon-competitive \nsub-national strategic (capital) investment framework for\n England. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n Kamal-Chaoui, L. and Sanchez-Reaza, J.
