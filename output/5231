Written Evidence Submitted by Keep Wales Tidydefault (KWTdefault)defaultBackgrounddefaultKWT is an independent National Voluntary Organisation with Charitable Status.
default&#xa0;
default We are 
defaultone of Wales’ largest and most effective environmen
defaulttal charities
default, 
defaultcovering the whole
default of Wales 
defaultand influencing a wide range of organisations and communities
default. Our approach leads to sustainable change
default 
defaultthrough 
defaultinfluencing behaviour and enabling individuals, groups and schools to take their own actions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur focus is on people 
defaultand their connections with the environment. 
defaultWe deal with far more than litter
default;
default 
defaultour work encompasses biodiversity, access and recreation, health improvement, 
defaultfood growing, beach awards, Eco-
defaultSchools, Young Reporter for the Environment and so forth. 
defaultOur work is underpinned by research and policy work 
defaultincluding; Local Environmental Quality Surveys and developing advice for Government and other stakeholders.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to the 
defaultforthcoming charge for plastic bags in England
default, KWT would like to put forward the following evidence
default based on 
defaultour experience in relation to 
defaultthe 
defaultSUCB 
defaultlevy in Wales.
default  
defaultKWT continues to support the 
defaultSUCB 
defaultlevy on the grounds that it both protects and improves our environment. 
default 
defaultIt has successfully reduced the consumption of carrier bags in Wales, and therefore the impact they have in manufacture and disposal (including litter). Meanwhile the proceeds of the levy are making a tangible difference 
defaultto
default many charitable causes, including environmental projects.
defaultThe 
defaultSUCB l
defaultevy came into being in Wales on 1
defaultst
default October 2011. 
defaultKWT
default was fully supportive of the Welsh Government in introducing the levy and the evidence below sets out our reasons for continued support
default,
default as well as suggestions moving forward. KWT understands that the W
defaultelsh Government
default is to review the policy in 
defaultNovember 2014
default, at which point KWT 
defaultwill s
defaultubmit 
defaultfurther evidence
default.
defaultIn terms of u
defaultsage
default, 
default8.1bn single-use carrier bags were used in the UK in 2012; a 1.3% rise on th
defaulte 
defaultprevious year. However, regional differences show that 
defaultin defaultWalesdefault carrier bag use fell over this defaultperiod by 76%default. 
defaultIn the same time frame, the number of bags used per person per month in Wales reduced from 7.4 to 1.8.
default W
defaultelsh Government
default information based on 13 
defaultretailers
default shows further reductions in carrier bag use of between 35-96%
default 
defaultafter the introduction of the levy
default. This range suggests that some retail sectors
default, 
defaultparticularly food service and fashion
default,
default are harder to tackle than others 
default- 
defaultand that targeted work may be needed for further improvements.   
defaultIn measuring the success of the scheme, the Welsh Government has commissioned research to understand the extent of the reduction in bag use generated
default,
default and to understand how the general public feels about the levy.  
defaultThe levy has been 
defaultseen to increase own bag use in Wales from 61% 
defaultto 82%
default.
default Over this period public support for the levy has also increased
default:
default from 59% to 80%
default. 
defaultK
defaultWT
default has observed a decrease in littered carrier bags through 
defaultour Local Environmental Audit and Management System 
defaultLEAMS
default 
defaultstreet
default data, albeit only marginal. In the full survey year prior to the introduction of the levy carrier bags were found on an average of 1.1% of each local authority’s streets. Since the introduction of the levy that figure has dropped to 0.9%. The percentage of streets littered with carrier bags has reduced in 12 of the 22 local authorities and remained the same in a further four.
defaultMeanwhile 
defaultKWT
default has long recognised that street-data is likely to significantly understate the extent of littered carrier bags. This owes to the physical properties of carrier bags which render them not readily degradable, meaning they persist for long periods in the environment and are easily transportable by weathe
defaultr, causing wide dispersal. Keep Wales Tidy 
defaultstaff and volunteers routinely remove bags that have blown in
defaultto trees and along river banks.
defaultProceeds from the ChargedefaultThe Waste (Wales) Measure 2010 gives Welsh Ministers the power create regulations which would impose duties on retailers on the destination of proceeds from the charge. However this has not been used; instead the W
defaultelsh 
defaultG
defaultovernment
default advocates a voluntary agreement
default and the success of 
defaultthis agreement is to be measured by meeting the principles that:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe net proceeds are passed on to good causes.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhere possible, the net proceeds will benefit Wales.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe small number of businesses across Wales found to be failing to enforce the charge has been seen as a marker of the scheme’s success
default. The proceeds from the charge are making a substantial difference in Wales, with 100s of thousands of pounds already being pledged to ‘good causes’
default.
defaultGoing ForwarddefaultKWT should like to see data on usage and street cleanliness continuously monitored. If support for the levy waivers, then it may be necessary to reinforce the messages which have, so far, succeeded in gaining support. It may also be beneficial to publicise the good causes that 
defaultbenefit 
defaultfrom the proceeds of the charge
default, including amongst retailers
default.
defaultE
defaultxperience from the Republic of Ireland suggests that as time goes on, people may get used to paying for bags and, as such, bag use may rise. Should this prove to be the case then consideration should be given to increasing the value of the charge. KWT has previously stated that a cost of up to 15p would be reasonable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, we’d like to
default include 
defaultinform
defaultation on 
defaultthe current debate in Wales relating to bags for life
default linked to the proposed Environment Bill.
defaultThe ‘Towards the Sustainable Management of Wales’ Natural Resources’ White Paper 
defaultproposes to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags
default.
defaultKWT agrees with this proposal due to the increased use and disposal of, for example bags for life, and the detrimental effect that these can have on the environment.
defaultHowever, we recognise the aims of the levy will have failed if the charge and distribution of funding goes on forever, as the key aim is change behaviour - reduce waste and litter and the negative environmental impacts.
