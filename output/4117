[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Madhav Khandekar[bold] (IPC0019)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]General Comments: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The latest release 
[normal](AR5) 
[normal]of climate change assessment by 
[normal]the UN Cl
[normal]imate Change Body IPCC
[normal] 
[normal]has once again stirred the ‘
[normal]global warming-human-CO
[normal]2
[normal]-extreme weather’ 
[normal]debate and 
[normal]the 
[normal]climate science community at large appears to be sharply divided about the role of
[normal] atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] on the earth’s climate and possible future adverse impact of changing climate on world humanity. 
[normal]Many articles
[normal], since the release of the IPCC SPM (Summary for Policymakers), have appeared
[normal] 
[normal]in various media, 
[normal]supporting the IP
[normal]CC view of the climate
[normal] that “
[normal]ear
[normal]th’s climate is warming and there is an urgent n
[normal]eed to curb human-CO
[normal]2
[normal] emission!”
[normal] Several prominent climate scientists and skeptics of the IPCC science have expressed disappointment over IPCC latest release lamenting the fact that “IPCC has NOT provided ade
[normal]quate explanation re: the pause in warming of the climate for past 16 years (and continuing!)
[normal]”
[normal]. 
[normal]In a scat
[normal]hing article, Ms Judith Curry (
[normal]a respected atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta USA) wrote: “
[normal]Kill the IPCC![bold] After years[bold] and billions (of dollars), IPCC[bold] has failed to document[bold] [bold]a link[bold] [bold]between [bold]human-CO[bold]2
[normal] emission and[bold] warming of the earth’s climate!”[bold]&#xa0;[bold]As this bitter debate continues unabated, it is important to closely look at the reality of climate change as revealed by observ
[normal]ations. Among some of t
[normal]he 
[normal]realities of climate change[bold] are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Climate of the Twentieth Century:[bold]Before we consid
[normal]er several other issues on the present climate change debate, it is important to look at the earth’s climate 
[normal]and growth of atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]for the twentieth century, for which best observational information is now available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When careful
[normal]ly analyzed, these observational lampposts
[normal] suggest that “
[normal]the lin
[normal]k between human-CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions and climate warming remains
[normal] questionable as ever!”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Issues Re:[bold] IPCC AR5 SPM-Summary for Policymakers[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Concluding Remarks:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The latest release of the IPCC AR5 SPM leaves lot to be desired! The SPM claims linkage between warming of the earth’s climate of the last fifty years with increasing concentrations o
[normal]f human-CO
[normal]2
[normal], 
[normal]but
[normal] provides NO substantive evidence 
[normal]to support this claim
[normal]!
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Further the SPM 
[normal]has 
[normal]fail
[normal]e
[normal]d to explain the hiatus in the warming for the last 16 years! 
[normal]Finally the SPM has totally ignored the reality of earth’s climate, which is that “The earth’s climate now appe
[normal]ars to be entering into a colder epoch!
[normal]”
[normal] With the approaching of the solar grand minima in the next decade or about, there is now a distinct possibility that the earth’s climate could see an onset of an 
[normal]Ice Age [bold]type climate [bold]in the next two to three decades
[normal]!
