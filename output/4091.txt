[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Contractual requirements of ESF through the SFA’s contracts are divorced from local priorities, and don’t adequately reflect specific targeted wards, vulnerable young people or characteristics. Consequently, there is very little local accountability through the current co-financing system, or evidence of NEET figures reducing over a three year period as a result of SFA commissioned activity.&#xa0;

[[[1.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Commissioners who are far from Birmingham and its NEET young people are awarding contracts to national providers who often have no knowledge or track record of work with NEETS in this city.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local Authorities are under a statutory duty to secure suitable and sufficient places in education or training, for all young people in their area aged 16-19 (and up to age 24 for those with learning difficulties or disabilities).  The current system of ESF co-financing through the SFA does not allow local authorities to discharge these legal duties effectively, as interventions for NEET young people are not specific enough to meet the needs and address the barriers of individuals.

[[[As the national landscape changes, with regards to a shift from national policy making to localism (ie LEPs/Core Cities), there is a clear role emerging for local authorities to take a strong and influencing lead to drive forward economic development, including the skills system.

For example ESF provider has not been able to respond to needs of young offenders; despite raising this issue being raised, it hasn’t been possible to influence a change.&#xa0;

The city could use commissioning as a key strategy that would influence the whole process.

Evidence (high NEET rates and youth unemployment) suggests this has led to market failures resulting in many hard to reach groups being excluded from mainstream provision. Further, because providers exercise certain freedoms it is quite possible that working with disadvantaged young people takes second place, as disadvantaged learners could be considered high risk groups in terms of success rates and resource intensive (ie propensity for profit) compared to young people who have already achieved a standard of education ie 5 GCSEs A*-C and have a high probability of completing their programme of study.]]]&#xa0;1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Birmingham requires a more nuanced system able to deal with the diversity and complexity of need which exists in the city...

[[[. ]]]&#xa0;2.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We often talk about young people in deficit terms. Perhaps rather than having low aspirations, life has taught many to have low expectations, and it is this that guides their behaviour. A successful approach must work with the entirety of the young person’s experience, accept the impact which this has on the most marginalised and seek to equip young people with the skills and resilient self-beliefs to exert control over their lives in order to override the negative effects of risk factors in their family, environment and personal history. Unless people believe they can produce the desired effects by their actions, they have little incentive to act or persevere in the face of difficulties. Evidence suggests that a more structured system with guaranteed outcomes following successful completion of certain ‘staging posts’ (such as within the German model) give a greater scope for young people to develop a positive sense of self and are empowered to achieve their own successes in the future. A structured approach works well for those young people who wish to follow a professional route (GCSEs – A levels – degree), so why not build in more structure to alternative routes? We need to get better at developing a sense of personal agency and self-belief among whose life experiences have negatively affected their expectations and beliefs. Achieving this for the most vulnerable and marginalised of our youth, who are most likely to be unemployed, and potentially be drawn into other activities which negatively affect them, their families and their communities requires a greater level of investment by highly skilled professionals. We also believe that the swiftest means to develop helpful beliefs and ‘workplace’ skills is achieved through socialisation in the work context and supported by mentoring and social support.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

Young people will not be aware of whether they fit the criteria for particular NEET provision. They will not know before starting whether this contracted provision is the best one for them because they won’t be clear on what contracted targets and milestones are, and could get caught out that they don’t know what counts as a ‘progression’. These matters are often not clear for referral staff either, and so they are wary of “trapping” a young person into a provision that is not best for them because of contract requirements.

To ensure good quality progression of route ways into employment, could employers themselves bid for ESF funding to enable them to provide the wrap around support needed and employment preparation courses for the vulnerable NEET cohort? If this helps generate employers to offer employment to those from the vulnerable groups, then this would be money well spent because final progression outcome would be committed to in the bid and quality progression into sustainable ETE is assured.
