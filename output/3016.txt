[[[Recommendations]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;17 October 2013&#xa0; Research by the Environment Research Funders’ Forum (2010) to identify the 15 most critical skills gaps the environment sector faces in the coming decade highlights fieldwork as one such critical skills gap.  In particular, specific skills such as species identification, sampling techniques, collection and recording protocols and methodologies, and technology use are in high need. Yet the ERFF found a decrease in the number of people available to conduct skilled field research which has meant that employers are finding it difficult to recruit individuals with fieldwork skills.
