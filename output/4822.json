"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the City of London Corporation [CST0052]&#xa0;What, if any targets, do you set for your Police Force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?Policing Plan Priority/Target Setting Process &amp; Performance MonitoringThe\n \nCourt of \nCommon Council \nis\n the Police Authority for the City of London Police and this function \nis delegated to and \nexercised by the Police Committee which \nprovides independent scrutiny and chall\nenge of the Force\n. \n(\nPlease note: The \nCity o\nf London Corporation does not have a Police &amp; Crime Commissioner)\n. \nThe \nPolice Committee in consultation with the City of London Police sets the Force’s priorities and measures annually. Workshops are held between\n November &amp; January each year and \nin the February - t\nhe draft Policing Plan \nfor the following year \nis agreed by the Police \nC\nommittee\n. \n \nOur Policing Plan priorities for 2013-14 are Counter-Terrorism, Economic Crime, Public Order, Crime Reduction, Road Safety and Antisocial Behaviour. The priorities are underpinned by a small number of performance measures or targets. Delivery of these targ\nets \nis\n monitored and scrutinised by the Force’s Performance Management Group \n(which is attended by Police Authority \nstaff\n, the Head of the Community Safety Team\n and \nthe Corporation’s Performance Management Team\n) and \nby \nthe Chairman of the\n Performance &amp; Res\nources Management \n(Police) \nSub-Committee\n.\n \nWhilst the Police Committee sets a target to reduce crime, this does not stipulate a numerical or percentage reduction. In addition, the Committee is working with the \nCity of London Police\n to consider how new cri\nme outcomes can support policing priorities next year. Currently, no specific targets have been set on detection rates.\n  This approach reduces the potential impact on our police recording crime practices.  \nImpact on Police Crime Recording PracticesThe \nimpact\n of using performance targets \non current police crime practices is minimal – as there are adequate checks \nand\n balances in place to ensure that police crime recording practices are robust.  Assurances are provided by the checks (set out below). In add\nition, a\nny in-year adjustments to the crime \nperformance \nstatistics are challenged by the Corporation and the Police Committee Members – particularly with regard to satisfaction statistics, the violent crime \nand\n acquisitive crime statistics. \n The Force’s AC\nPO team also routinely seek assurance through the commissioning of independent audits.  \nThe Force has embarked on a cultural change programme\n – \n“City Futures” – which aims to make the City of London Police \n“a worldwide centre of excellence for our policin\ng services”. \n Part of the programme of change is a focus on improving service delivery through the setting of robust \nservice \noutcomes – that will \nimprove service performance. The new arrangements will include a further strengthening of the Force’s police r\necording practices to ensure that they are robust\n and \ntransparent\n. \nHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? As a Police \nA\nuthority, there are a n\number of ways where we are assured about the reliability of our crime statistics.\n \nThe following checks \n(provide the Police Authority with a level of assurance that the crime statistics are reliable)\n:\nIndependent Audit commissioned by the ForceThe Force commissioned an independent audit of \nits \ncrime data in June 2013\n. This was\n carried out by a team who had previously worked for HMIC on \nD\nata \nQ\nuality inspections.  The outcome of this \nreview\n was \nreceived\n \nby our \nPerformance and Resource Management S\nub-committee\n (P &amp; RM Sub-committee) \nin September 2013 \nThe report \nconcluded that: \n‘There is clear evidence that ethical crime and incident data is of utmost importance within the City of London. ‘\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n ‘\nT\nhe City of London police maintains an impressively h\nigh standard of capturing reports of crime, thus ensuring such crimes are correctly classified. The force Crime and Incident Registrar remains a strong and powerful advocate for ethical decision making.’ \nThe Independent Auditors also commented favourably \non the \nForce’s \ngovernance\n arrangements -\n \nwhich ensured that \nthe quality of incident and crime recording remained an area of strategic focus.\nHMIC Review of Crime and Incident ReportsThe HMIC conduct\ns\n a regular review of Crime and Incident reports to ensure the correct and ethical reporting of both, and that incidents are correctly classified as crimes when necessary. The last COLP report was published in January 2012, and \nstated\n:\n“Crimes in the City o\nf London are generally recorded accurately and in accordance with National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS).” \n“\nThe City of London Police efficiently recorded and classified reports of crimes”. \nThe report concluded\n \n“\nsenior officers in the force were clear\nly committed to maintaining high standards of crime recording, and this was well supported by police committee. The force conducts comprehensive crime and incident audit programmes, the results of which are presented at regular crime performance meetings. \nThis means the force can have confidence in the crime figures it produces\n.”\nPolice Routine ChecksThe Force regularly reviews \nits\n \ncrime recording standards to supplement the HMIC inspection work. In addition, the\n Force’s\n integrity dashboard reported to \nthe\n Police Committee includes a\nn\n update on the monthly dip sampling of crime reports\n. This \nensure\ns\n standards are maintained.\nFuture City Corporation of London Internal Audit Checks The Corporation is currently considering introducing a further independent check of Crime Statistics through the Corporation’s Internal Audit Service.  The plan is to build it into their annual Police audit programme.  \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n \nThe P &amp; RM Sub-committee is a sub-committee of our Police Committee and its remit is to ensure the Force is efficient, effective and delivering value for money.\n"
