The current filtering arrangements have been in place for 9 years and work well with very few complaints about children viewing \n18 classified content\n on their mobile devices.  Customers who believe content or websites have been misclassified can email \nsafeguard@ee.co.uk\n.  This email box is forwarded to the Safeguard Product Manager and issues are dealt with within 48 hours.\nOur Digital Living website provides detailed information on our parental controls, the full list of the categories blocked for each setting and how to report abuse or misclassified content \nhttp://explore.ee.co.uk/digital-living/keeping-children-safe\nParental Controls - Fixed EE Home (our fixed business) now offers all\n new and existing broadband customers McAfee Family Protection software which is free of charge for 12 months.  Customers can install the software on up to 5 devices are protected even when they’re outside the home as the software sits on the computer.\nIt offers five predefined age settings (under 5, 6-8, 9-12, 13-15 and 16-18) and parents can also customise the settings, add or delete websites and set time restrictions.  It also provides activity reports detailing web activity and it will send email or text alerts if access to inappropriate websites is attempted.  It will also report on what information is being shared on social media sites and by instant messaging and blocks the downloading of music with explicit lyrics.  The software is easy to install and we have developed a help video with McAfee which is available on our safety website.\nWe actively promote parental controls at point of sale and at all points in the customer’s journey including in the Welcome Pack, in the router guide, in the customer’s first email after activation, in the Home Mover Pack and Online on our Digital Living Website.  Twice a year, as part of the EE Broadband Newsletter, we include information on the Family Protection Software to existing customers.  We will also send a dedicated email to all customers every 6 months highlighting the benefits of online security and parental controls.\nBy the end of the year all new broadband customers will be presented with a “splash page” when they open their browser for the first time which will force them to make a choice on whether to download the parental controls software.  If they choose to opt for parental controls they just click on the link provided which will take them straight to the McAfee download page.\nParental Controls – WifiEE offers both branded and white labelled Wi-Fi services to a range of corporate customers.  We are engaged in the UKCCIS (UK Child Safety Council) working group and we are committed to \noffering a Family Friendly Wi-Fi service.  All our hotspots currently block illegal child abuse images on the IWF list.  By the end of the year we plan to set Adult Content filtering as ‘on’ by default.   It is then up to the venue owners to actively choose to \ndisapply\n the filter if they want to.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
