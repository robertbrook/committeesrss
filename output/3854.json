"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Greater London Authority  (CYS 060)&#xa0;\nThank you for inviting us to submit evidence on cycling safety. We hope that your inquiry can help im\nprove the quality of the \ndebate on this issue. \n&#xa0;\n1. Is cycling safe?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nrate of cyclist fatalities has\n fallen dramatically in recent years. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSerious injury rat\nes have\n also fallen\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlthough it is possible to draw some conclusions from deaths over the medium term, it is much harder to draw any conclusions from relatively short-term events. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLondon’s cycle casualty rat\nes are comparable to, or better than, most equivalent foreign cities, though exact comparisons are difficult. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe concept of “subjective safety” is sometimes employed to argue against these empirical truths. We acce\npt the importance of this.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSome objective and empirical signs are also causing us growing concern.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCycling is far more likely to prolong your life than to end it; an\nd more likely to improve your health than to harm it.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCycling will even prolong other people’s lives. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat can central and local government do to improve cycle safety? &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSafety improvement is a partnership with many partners. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe take \na smart, targeted approach to safety. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe believe route improvements, including segregation, are essential to improve safety – but more so perceived safety. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTfL and the boroughs\n support and provide better training and advice for drivers and cyclists. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nMetropolitan Police\n, City of London Police and TfL \nare\n increasing enforcement \nagainst bad driving and cycling\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are promoting safety in a number of other ways. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChange takes time – and the roads are not just for cyclists. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government and EU need to act too.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur key \n“asks”\n from Whitehall include: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\nThere is a need to raise the quality of the debate. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe fear that the all-consuming focus on cycling deaths may be deterring cyclists. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBy the ve\nry act of trying to help cyclists, we are treated as if we have nationalised every accident.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSome of the assumptions in the debate are wrong.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEven the best infrastructure in the world cannot remove the responsibility to behave safely, or entirely immunise cyclists against harm\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe do not say that people should stop talking about safety. It is the number one deterrent to taking up cycling. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Lorries – and whether it is desirable or feasible to prohibit them from entering city centres at peak hours&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Mayor \nis acting to remove the most unsafe lorries from London.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are stepping up enforcement against dangerous HGVs. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe have a wide variety of programmes to mandate higher standards for lorries and drivers; and to encourage lorries and cycles to be more aware of each other. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are lookin\ng at different ways of shifting lorries outside of the peak\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nThere are two different ways of measuring cycle use. “Journeys” are where all or part of the journey was made by bike. “Trips” (about 181 million in London in 2011) are where the entire journey was made by bike. For instance, cycling to the station to get \na train would count towards the first figure but not the second. \n&#xa0;\n"
