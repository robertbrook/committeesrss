[normal]Hi there,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I live in Ravenglass in Cumbria and wish to bring to the notice of the 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]committee the lack of train services 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]to this community
[normal]in the early evening and none at all on a Sunday.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It takes about 2 hours to travel from Ravenglass
[normal] to Lancaster to then transfer to a major City train. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The last train in the evening to
[normal]Ravenglass leaves Lancaster before 4.30pm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the last 20 years I have only been able to book one return journey when taking holidays. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Almost all of the time I am 
[normal]forced to
[normal]to use my car instead of the train because of the limitations of the service provided.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have never use a bus in the county of Cumbria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Regards 
[normal]&#xa0;
