"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Shed Media Group [FBB0083]&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction:&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;FUTURE OF THE BBC INQUIRY&#xa0;Executive Summary:Shed \nM\nedia believes that the BBC holds a key and essenti\nal role within the TV landscape, \nfor viewers in the domestic and international marketplace \nand\n within the \ncreative industry.\n Many of the most successful television exports were init\niated on the BBC \nand m\nany successful UK production companies hold the BBC key to their\n achievements\n.  As such we are \nsupporter\ns\n of the BBC and the license fee\n, removing or reducing the licensee fee could have negative impacts for the broadcasting secto\nr\n in\n the UK\n - \nand \nfor \nUK creative industries globally. \nAfter a difficult few years for the BBC’s TV division, the new senior management and business leaders are showing signs of essential modernisation which should lead to greater efficiency both operationall\ny and in communications, decision making and commissioning.\n  \nShed Media \nrecognises that the BBC needs an \nappropriate and effective mechanism for accountability and governance\n and we \nbelieve that progress has been signalled by new management who we \nconsider \nhave the commitment to introduce and follow-through on change. \nT\nhe \nBBC\n \nshould \nbroadcast \nthe \nvery \nbest programmes it can regardless of whether they are produced ‘in house’ or from \nexternal producers.  A\ns such \nShed Media believes that the \n‘\nW\nindow \nO\nf Creative \nC\nompetition’\n should not act as a cap on external commissions\n (\nbar news and current affairs) and that ‘open competition’ will benefit the BBC\n and its viewers\n.  \nAs part of any reform of the commissioning system, Shed Media believes that the defini\ntion of \nan ‘\nIndependent Producer\n’\n should be amended\n.\nThe BBC’s achievements with regards to ‘Nations and Regions’ have been encouraging and we support and encourage further commitments from the BBC to represent its \ndiverse \naudience \nby commissioning\n new and \nre-commissioning \nestablished pr\nogramming\n from \nall\n areas of the UK. \nShed Media believes that the commercial revenue the Independent Production sector could contribute the BBC could be increased if the BBC’s Fair Trading and Commercial Guidelines a\nre updated to fit the nature of current of business practice  and rig\nhts ownership and exploitation.  Where the BBC operates its own commercial activities via BBC Worldwide , we believe these activities should be based on \nthe\n current remit, be commercially\n transparent and \noperate on \nan equal footing with the independent sector. \nShed Media believes that if the BBC do\nes\n invest in new technologies, such devices (such as the iPlayer) \nthen these technologies should be \ncomm\nercialised as fully as possible and tha\nt the BBC should work in partnership with external technology companies.\nResponse To The Inquiry Questions:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
