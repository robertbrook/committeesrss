defaultOverviewdefaultGeneral - Concerns of UK citizendefaultsdefault regarding the banking sector   default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe banking sector in general is
default one which has been a source of concern to many, not least with regards to the unprecedented levels of sharp practice, deceptions and fraudulent behaviours of recent times, much of which has been documented by many, including politicians and media, and re 
defaultwhich most, if not all, came to the attention of the UK and Northern Irish public, not through voluntary
default disclosure and
default transparency of the banks, but through the actions of others.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is the case that whistleblowing channels advised, or implied, by the b
defaultanks via disingenuous published Corporate Social Responsibility Statements do not function as it is implied they do, a position which is indicative on one where the offender is also the ‘policing’ body, a position which for obvious reasons does not work.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany cannot understand why regular laws which apply to the majority have not been seen to apply to those within the banking sector who set the corporate tone to which various deceptions and fraudulent behaviours (including bank officials providing inaccura
defaultte information under oath, falsifying of documents, etc
default)
default, activities which at one time few would have thought banks would engage in, have prevailed, do not appear to apply to senior banking sector officials and executives, with questions asked by many as t
defaulto why this may be.   
default&#xa0;
defaultMany UK citizens remain confused as to why ‘ordinary persons’ are subject to stiff punishment for what are often fairly minor misdemeanours, whilst bankers responsible for hugely significant misdemeanours impacting upon every man, wo
defaultman and child in UK, appear to have got off scot free, usually with huge financial packages of one sort or another intact, hedging those individuals from the negative impacts their behaviours helped to heap upon the majority of the nations citizens.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere
default is evidence to suggest that operating principles possibly assumed to apply mainly to corporate tone setting senior banking executives may be more prevalent amongst some bank employees further down the corporate chain, as some employees, mindful of the sta
defaultte of the economy and equally mindful of their own perceived job securities and future promotion prospects seek to consolidate their own positions via enthusiastic and compliant adherence to dubious operating principles and aims of the organisations which 
defaultemploy them.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have even been new (and annoying) industries formed on the foundation of banking sector sharp practices, with for instance, millions of people frequently harassed by telephone callers, pre recorded voice messages and SMS text messages
default relating to PPI, a sector which as stated, would not even exist had it not been for banking sharp practice on which it is founded. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the events of the past few years, some feel there is justification for an independent body to be established where a
defaultll persons or organisations, not just from a customer perspective, but from all backgrounds where direct and negative impact has been encountered as a result of banking sector sharp practices
default,
default and where any party who feels such sharp practices should be ex
defaultposed, can do so without fear of retribution brought about by any bank or combination of banks, or from any third party or parties engaged by any bank or banks in connection to same.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe Banking structure in Northern Irelanddefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe Northern Ireland Affairs call for evidence into the banking structure in Northern Ireland is welcomed by many (as is the recently announced banking enquiry in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) to be held at futur
defaulte dates, those dates as yet undecided).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe reason why ongoing or pending
default 
defaultbanking enquiries across the island of Ireland may be considered to be of interest to citizens of Northern Ireland / United Kingdom is because in Northern Ireland (and
default to a lesser degree
default on mainland UK) two of the Irish pillar banks are significant players, those banks being Bank of Ireland and the AIB (Allied Irish Banks) owned First Trust Bank (AIB in UK), whilst the Royal Bank of Scotland owned Ulster Bank is a major
default player across both jurisdictions of Northern Ireland and ROI .
default&#xa0;
defaultOf the 4 four 
default‘big four’default banks operating in Northern Ireland, one of them, Royal Bank of Scotland / Ulster Bank is 82% owned by the UK Taxpayer / UK Government following a circa £45 billion b
defaultail out in 2008, whilst following similar bailouts also in 2008 in ROI totalling circa €30billion, Bank of Ireland is partially owned by the ROI Taxpayer / ROI Government and AIB, owner of First Trust Bank in Northern Ireland is moreorless in full ownershi
defaultp of the ROI Taxpayer / ROI Government.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Northern Ireland, both ROI  banks, Bank of Ireland and First Trust Bank, are hugely influential in the banking affairs of Northern Ireland, are as Ulster Bank and Danske Bank (Northern Bank) a group of four whi
defaultch traditionally are recognised as 
default‘the big four’default in Northern Ireland banking, with one of the ROI banks, Bank of Ireland also additionally influential in NI and UK in connection to UK / NI Post Office savers via the fact that the bank is tied in with the 
defaultPost Office
default 
default(all NI and UK Post Office account holder statements are, unbeknown to many account holders, actually produced in Dublin, not in UK as many believe to be the case, with Post Office statements produced on Bank of Ireland premises and, in order t
defaulto acquire a UK postmark on all envelopes bound for NI or UK Post Office account holders,  transported via road each day from Dublin to Belfast in order to acquire a UK postmark for every NI / UK bound envelope, delivered into the main UK Royal Mail postal 
defaultfacility for Northern Ireland at Mallusk, Co Antrim), a position which previously, for reasons known to the parties in question, some UK savers, UK taxpayers, UK politicians, relevant 
defaulttrade 
defaultunion officials, etc, queried or raised concerns.
default&#xa0;
defaultOf the four ban
defaultks which make up ‘the big four’, in Northern Ireland
default,
default only one bank therefore is actually UK owned, whilst as stated, two are ROI owned and one
default, Danske Bank,
default Danish owned.
default&#xa0;
defaultThus banking in Northern Ireland is hugely affected, and to a lesser degree re UK, 
defaultby influences from outside of Northern Ireland / UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst there may be areas of general collaboration between banks within the UK banking sector, some understandable and acceptable perhaps, some not so i.e. Libor rate manipulations, etc, within the structure of the ‘big four’ banks in Northern Ireland ther
defaulte appears to be areas and levels of collaboration, or collusion, which may not ordinarily be expected to prevail in any circumstances, but which not only do such collaborations and collusions prevail, connected to the position are elements of sharp and une
defaultthical practices, and from which persons in Northern Ireland are victims of the practices referred to and from which the ‘big four’ 
defaultNI 
defaultbanks unethically derive financial benefit. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese practices are referred to below under several sub headings.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default-------
default------------------------------------------------------
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Purpose of the 2013 Northern Ireland Affairs Committee call fordefault evidencedefault on the banking structure in Northern Ireland Banking Enquirydefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe purpose of this enquiry is referred to in official parlia
defaultmentary terms of gathering 
default‘evidence on the banking structure in Northern Ireland’default, and referred to in other areas i.e. media sources such as BBC News
default as
default ‘a far reaching enquiry’default and
default default‘defaultNI banking practices under scrutiny’default, etc. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no doubt that a number of areas require close attention, some of these areas very much focussed in the minds of the public, and thus unavoidable (which may be why the bank(s) concerned have referred to same within their published submissions to th
defaulte NI Affairs Committee) i.e. the Ulster Bank IT debacles, rural and urban branch closures and the impact this has on those affected, etc.    
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, whilst volunteering information in relation to issues which the 4 NI banks are unable to influence the committee in terms of whether those issues are to be discussed or otherwise, there are areas of concern re which it is noted that none of the NI
default banks have made any reference to but which nevertheless need to be addressed, possibly by a body as influential as the NI Affairs Committee. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite implied principles in Corporate &amp; Social Responsibility Statements and in other areas, banks are not kno
defaultwn for their ‘openness and transparency’, with the general public becoming aware of most, if not all banking misdemeanours not as stated previously through well meaning and ethically minded disclosure by the banks, but through the efforts of others.
default&#xa0;
defaultI sug
defaultgest that it is important that the NI Affairs Committee looks not only at those issues which the ‘big four’ NI banks refer to within their submissions to the Committee, the published submissions covering what most observers would have expected from the ban
defaultks, but as is the case in investigative procedures, often it is what isn’t voluntarily referenced which requires some element of investigation.      
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default-------------------------------------------------------------
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFour NI Banks collaboration / collusionsdefault in reducingdefault operating costsdefault via unethical meansdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultA major part of the ‘structure’ of the traditional main ‘big four’ Northern Ireland banks (Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank, First Trust Bank and Ulster Bank) in relation to the retail branch and other office
defaults networks throughout Northern Ireland is a 
defaultsub structure relating to 
defaultcombined 
defaultoperating costs relating to the whole across Northern Ireland networks of the ‘big four’ NI banks, 
defaultthe purpose of which is to reduce individual / sole bank operating costs in 
defaultrelation to same and thus to derive the financial benefit from the collaboration referred to.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, it is in this particular area in which the 4 NI banks have not only collectively engaged in highly dubious and unacceptable practices of a nature which 
defaultno ethically operating organisation should ever engage, but in doing so it could be suggested that the circumstances have rendered the UK Taxpayer / UK Government (and the ROI Taxpayer / ROI Government) complicit in those same highly dubious, unethical and
default unacceptable practices. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are relationships which have or continue to prevail(ed) which would be considered by many to be ‘inappropriate’ and unacceptable, for reasons re which it must be assumed that the resultant financial benefits to each of the 
default‘big four’ NI banks were the overriding factor regarding why the relationships prevailed / prevail, but in connection to which, in consideration of a number of relevant factors, further benefits to individuals within ‘big four’ NI  banks cannot be discount
defaulted.  
default&#xa0;
defaultPractices referred to run contrary to those principles and standards referred to in a number of UK Government publications, including the most recent and highly relevant September 2013 HM Government published document entitled
default ‘Good Business - Imdefaultplementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights’ default(ref: Cm 8695), in which it is stated that this document, foreworded by The Minister of State for Business Innovation and Skills and The President of the UK Board of Trade, Right Honorable 
defaultDr Vince Cable MP and The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Rightt Honourable William Hague MP, 
defaultis
default 
default‘Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs by Command of Her Majesty (Queen Elizabeth II)’default.default&#xa0;defaultOf particular
default interest within this document is section in which reference is made to 
default‘the activities of UK State-owned, controlled or supported enterprises’default, a group to which the bailed out and currently circa 82% UK Taxpayer owned RBS, owner of the NI / ROI operating 
defaultUlster Bank, belongs.    
default&#xa0;
defaultWithin the banking sector there is no question that highly paid regulators did not regulate and law enforcement and Serious Fraud Office officers failed to enforce and to hold to account, with some of those who failed in their hi
defaultghly paid roles going on to ever better paid positions within those organisations they failed to regulate or hold to account
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultH
defaultowever it cannot be overlooked that it was banks which systematically committed frauds and various deceptions, aided and abetted
default possibly by ‘sympathetic’
default and / or compliant 
defaultentities from within ‘the system’.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would appear that where one, a combination of or all of the
default 
default‘big four’ NI banks and RBS have engaged in sharp practice and are challenged in connection to same, it is routine to, where responses are provided, 
defaultin connection to dubious procurement and related ‘processes’, 
defaultto use references such as 
default‘robust’ defaultand to ref
defaulter also to
default ‘independent audit(s’default) and 
default‘investigation’ defaultprocesses, with a consistent lack of evidence that such processes are actually carried out, a position which is followed by a consistent refusal to address any issues to which disingenuous and misleadin
defaultg information is provided.   
default&#xa0;
defaultTo date the citizens of UK and Northern Ireland, and indeed in a number of jurisdictions around the world, have seen little or no evidence of those within the banking sector who have committed or been complicit to sharp pra
defaultctices, deceptions, fraud, etc being held to account, with many of those individuals, or the banks they work for, continuing to operate along a very much business as usual basis, such is the lack of concern some appear to have regarding being held accounta
defaultble for any misdemeanours they may be connected to or complicit in.

defaultconsidering opening or moving bank accounts with ethical considerations to the fore, and to other entities.

defaultThere are 4 different levels of types of collusion relating to the 4 NI ‘big four’ banks which have prevailed as follows:

defaultCollusions between individual banks, a number of banks or all 4 banks and third
default party entities, in relation to suppression (gagging) of disclosures relating to procurement related and connected issues 
default&#xa0;
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInternal sole bank collusions between a number of officials or departments, going up to Chief Executive level, including in relation
default to brushing under the carpet details brought to the attention of Chief Executives and others regarding the unethical and unacceptable practices referred to, a position which is difficult to reconcile with actions expected to be executed in connection to t
defaulthe sort of sharp practices this communication alludes to as referred to within relevant regulatory body publications
default,
default and reality.  
default&#xa0;
default-------------------------------------------------------------
default&#xa0;
defaultOverviewdefault&#xa0;
defaultWhilst this communication relates to a specific service sector, it cannot be assumed that the ‘principles’ which apply within 
defaulta
default specific service sector are not repeated on the same basis in other areas, especially where  there are financial benefits to be 
defaulthad by either one, several or all of the ‘big four’ NI banks
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is evidence that some NI government bodies or individuals from within those bodies may be aware of practices and collusions alluded to within this document, but as in internal NI banki
defaultng circles, have may have chosen to take a ‘blind eye / turn the other way’ approach for reasons / agendas unknown, but possibly at best, due to general apathy
default 
defaultand lack of interest
default and concern, or at worst, due possibly to personal or other relationships i
defaultnvolving senior NI banking executives.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe citizens of Northern Ireland and UK (and of other jurisdictions i.e. Republic of Ireland) have the right to being able to avail of banking services provided by a bank or banks connected to which ethics and int
defaultegrity are unquestionable, where dubious and misleading practices relating to the implying of same and to general fitness and probity standards are not systematic, where third parties i.e. persons working for or providing services to the banks are not subj
defaultected to exploitations, including threats, intimidation, etc, and same re persons who may attempt to expose same and to have the banks acknowledge their complicity, etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom this position it is important, necessary even, that alternative organisations 
defaulti.e. credit unions, other banks, which may operate to levels of integrity and ethics which are higher than those of the traditional Northern Ireland ‘big four’ banks, are able to succeed and progress within the N
defaultorthern Ireland
default banking marketplace
default and to o
defaultffer real and proper choice to banking consumers in Northern Ireland
default, a position which may progress partly to the obstacles to moving bank account which prevailed previously having 
defaultrecently 
defaultbeen removed.
default&#xa0;
defaultI suggest that it is also important that, as referr
defaulted to previously, the NI Affairs Committee seeks to establish some form of 
defaultwhistleblowing facilitydefault for persons within or connected in any shape or form to the NI banking sector i.e. employee, service provider, employee of a service provider to the NI banki
defaultng sector, and not just bank customers, to be able to bring to the attention of 
defaulta relevant body which is completely independent of the banks themselvesdefault, misdemeanours and activities to which entities from within the NI banking sector may be complicit, and 
defaultin connection to which the banks, as has been the case previously and currently, not least as, despite having reference within disingenuous Corporate &amp; Social Responsibility Statements to the availability of 
default‘whistleblowing channedefaultldefaultsdefault’ which are in fact ineffective, the banks are no longer able to operate to an agenda designed to ensure that certain issues i.e. relating to sharp practices, are kept under the radar so to speak, and that there is no longer any sort of misplaced reliance 
defaultin some quarters on the ineffective whistleblowing channels of the banks, channels which, as stated, have been shown not to function as most non bank official individuals would expect, and deliberately so in some, possibly most instances.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no q
defaultuestion that any form of self policing system within the banking sector, for the purpose of this document within the Northern Ireland banking sector, and particularly in respect of the ‘big four’, Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank, First Trust Bank and Ulster B
defaultank, does not work, with such an arrangement shown to be open to abuse and self serving manipulations from within the banking sector.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is a position which is demonstrated by a significant number of acknowledgements to issues raised and assurances th
defaultat those issues will be followed up, only for them to be buried or subject to interference from third party entities, and by the range of tactics readily employed by the banks in relation to attacks of various sorts on the likes of whistleblower(s), a posi
defaulttion which cannot be reconciled with the 
default‘openness and transparency’default defaultand 
default‘high standards’default the banks refer to in disingenuous published Corporate &amp; Social Responsibility Statements and equally disingenuous annual reports and so called Codes of Practice.    
default      
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is a shameful indictment of the levels of integrity and principles of the Northern Ireland ‘big four’ banks, and especially so perhaps with regards to those executives at the top who lead by example and set the corporate tone of those banks whic
defaulth have and continue to participate in the sort of practices referred to, and who are aware of the prevalence of those practices, that all of the details declared within this communication to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee are true and factual.
defaultTher
defaulte are examples of senior NI bank executives i.e. at Chief Executive level, both in scenarios connected to their high profile banking sector roles and in other high profile non bank roles, implying certain principles, whilst in other areas allowing activiti
defaultes to prevail in their organisations and turning a blind eye to same, which cannot in any circumstances be reconciled with those implied principles.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are even examples within banking whereby it is bewildering to some, possibly to many, how when the
default backgrounds of some i.e. the connections and activities to which they have been connected, are considered by relevant regulatory bodies to attain ‘fitness and probity’ standards, in otherwords to be considered fit and proper to hold high office within fin
defaultancially regulated 
defaultorganisations such as banks, when ordinary business owners of much more modest enterprises would, in consideration of their backgrounds, be likely to regard those same individuals as wholly unsuitable i.e. to not be fit and proper, to be
default offered a position, any position, within their modest entrrprise.     
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are also examples re which it could be suggested the facts cannot easily be reconciled with responsibilities detailed within the general requirements and Fitness and Probity re
defaultquirements deemed to be necessary in senior bank executives i.e. at Chief Executive level, by the relevant UK (and ROI) regulatory bodies.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI look forward to providing whatever advice and assistance I am able to provide to the NI Affairs Committee in rela
defaulttion to the information provided in this document, and if required, to making available supporting evidential documentations to the Committee.
