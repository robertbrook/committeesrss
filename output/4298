defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe now move into the public session of our inquiry into the work of the Local Government Ombudsman
default.  
defaultOnce again, for the public record I must go through the formalities and ask members to declare their interests
default.  
defaultI am 
defaulta
default vice-president of the Local Government Association.
defaultDavid Heyesdefault: I have two members of staff who are local councillors.
defaultSimon Danczukdefault: My wife is a local councillor, and I have three members of staff who are local councillors.
defaultMrs Glindon:default My husband is a councillor i
defaultn 
defaultNorth Tyneside
default, and I have one member of staff who serves on the council.
defaultChris Williamson:default 
defaultI have a couple of members of staff who are elected members.
defaultMark Pawsey:default I have a member of staff who is a councillor.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat has put us
default on the record.  
defaultI thank our witnesses very much for coming
default.  
defaultIf you could give your names and 
defaulttell us 
defaultwho you are for the record, that would be helpful as a start.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI am Dr Jane Martin, the Local Government Ombudsman.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: I am Michael King, executive director of the Local Government Ombudsman. 
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default 
defaultThe LGO arranged for a staff survey to be conducted in November 2012, but I u
defaultnderstand that 
defaultwas not made available to the public i
defaultn its entirety.  Can you 
defaultexpl
defaultain why?
defaultDr Martindefault: O
defaultur staff are our absolutely greatest asset, and it is important to me that we make sure 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Local Government Ombudsman is a good place to work
default.  
defaultWe brought forward the timing of that staff survey, which was one of your recommendations, in order to get on with the work earlier than we had originally planned
default.  
defaultThe publication strategy for the survey was advised by independent facilitators who were running the whole exercise for us, and it was based on accepted practice
default.  
defaultWe shared all the
default findings with the key audience
default, namely our staff
default.  
defaultWe had face-to-face meetings with all staff across the organisation and shared the findings in full with them
default.  
defaultIndeed, we shared the finding
defaults
default in full with this Committee
default,
default because you were interested in it and it was one of your recommendations
default.  
defaultWe were also
default, of course,
default mindful of a duty of care to all staff given the confidential nature of the exercise, and w
defaultanted to ensure anonymity.  W
defaulte did not shy away from the 
defaultchallenges put to us and we 
defaultpublish
defaulted
default a p
defaultublic statement containing
default 
defaultfour key messages.  
defaultOne was 
defaultto reiterate the point about our dedicated staff
default.  
defaultThe 
defaultsecond was that 
defaultit be
defaultcame clear from the survey that 
defaultthere was some anxiety and a lot of uncertainty about the changes
default—i
defaultndeed, this was as we were about to launch into probably
default one of the biggest changes made 
defaultin the organisation
default.  
defaultWe also knew there was a need for greater engagement between management and staff, and much more effective leadership and management, which included reflecting on the working style and approach of the ombudsman
default.  
defaultI was very satisfied that the public statement we put out covered the key issues we found in the survey
default.  
defaultClearly, the most important thing now is to focus on what we did as a result of that.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default You mentioned 
defaultit was accepted practice to publish only part of it
default, but
default we live in an era when data are shared around very easily electronically
default.  
defaultI understand that a copy was sent to LGO Watch
default.  
defaultWhat steps had you put in place to prevent more wide distribution of the survey, and why were they not successful?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultWe were very mindful of 
defaultour 
defaultduty of care to all staff to ensure that full confidentiality was assured, but we wan
defaultted to be open with our staff. T
defaulthat was the mos
defaultt important thing to us—
defaultand we were
default.  
defaultWe recognised that, having done that, it
default was probably quite likely that—
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default You anticipated that 
defaultmight happen.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultWe understood it might have been a possibility
default.  
defaultAll I can tell you is that we were trying to make sure we published effectively, and that was what we did.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default 
defaultHave you carried out a similar survey in November 2013?
defaultDr Martindefault: W
defaulte are now in the process of conducting another staff survey.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default 
defaultHow do you intend to handle that? Do you intend to learn from the lessons of last time and accept that it will be in the public domain and publish in full
default, or do you intend to keep to 
defaultyour original strategy?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultWe have not had that discussion yet, but I would anticipate that, in the light of this, it would be stupid of us not to learn from lessons, so we will definitely consider how we might publish more widely.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default 
defaultAre there any preliminary findings that 
defaultperhaps 
defaultyou can share with us at the moment?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultNo, absolutely not
default.  
defaultIt is being held again by
default an independent facilitator, and
default I am waiting to hear the results.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: 
defaultTh
defaulte survey closed on Friday.  W
defaulte know that at the start of the final week
default,
default 67% of our staff had already participated, so we expect a similar level of engagement this time.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultTo make it clear for our records as well, on Friday Dr Martin and I had a conversation
default,
default and I felt it appropriate that we put the whole of the survey, with one small redaction, on the parliamentary website
default.  
defaultT
defaulto make it clear, t
defaulthat is now available for anyone w
defaultho wants to see it, and 
defaultwe all feel comfortable with that position.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultThat was an agreed position, and I completely understand.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Only two members have been
default present at mee
defaulttings since October last year.  I
defaults the commission quorate and operating within the provisions of the Local Government Act 1974?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultIt is quorate
default.  
defaultYou are absolutely right to p
defaultoint that out
default, and as chair I thought it was important to ch
defaulteck that.  We are quorate and 
defaultare operating effectively
default.  In terms of the 1974 Act
default, the legislation sets out that the Secretary of State should appoint one of the local commissioners, i.e. one of the local ombuds
defaultmen, as chair 
defaultand one as vice-ch
defaultair of the commission.  Anne Seex
default is currently in post as vice-chair of the commission and has not been able to attend for 12 months, so we are de fact
defaulto
default operating without a vice-chair.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultBut the meetings are still quorate.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultYes, indeed.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultThe external evaluator recommended that “ways should be urgently explored for the Ombudsman to be more visibly engaged as the leader of the organisation”
default.  
defaultSurely, if there is lack of leadership at the head of the organisation those are grounds for concern, are they not?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultYou are absolutely right that we should take that seriously
default.  
defaultThe external evaluation came after the staff survey which has already been refer
defaultred to.  It was quite clear
default that we were being challenged on the visibility of the ombudsman at that point, so it was something we already wanted to respond to.
defaultSince then, I have done a number of things
default.  
defaultFirst, particularly in response to the external evaluation, under the new leadership arrangements I now meet monthly with the executive team
default.  
defaultWe have delegated more responsibility down to the executive team to become a more open organisation
default.  
defaultI suppose that the best way to describe my role is as executive chair of the organisation, so we have monthly meetings to discuss strategy, performance and risk.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultBut anybody observing this will be astonished that you did not previously have monthly meetings with the executive team, will they not?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultPerhaps I can explain that we have been going through a period of change, so until the new arrangements came into place in
default about April of this year I had
default been chairing the corporate management team for probably 18 months on a regular monthly basis
default.  
defaultIt was a revision that was required, and we were very happy to make sure that happened
default.  
defaultI stress that we were very much responding to the staff survey, wanting to make sure that the role of the ombudsman was right and that 
defaultwe gave
default our senior team and our leadership group, which consists of
default our middle managers, 
defaultdelegated responsibility to work and help to shape the business.
defaultPerhap
defaults I may briefly describe one further arrangement.  
defaultI now also chair a monthly casework policy forum with my executive directors and legal people
default.  
defaultI am very confident that the organisation is ge
defaulttting very strong, 
defaultclear and consistent leadership from one ombudsma
defaultn heading up this organisation—
defaultnot only for the strategy in the commission but also for casework
default,
default which i
defaults very important.  That 
defaultwas on
defaulte of the concerns raised
default in the staff survey.
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultWith regard to your excellent leadership, from 2011-12 to 2012-13 your salary increased from £125,000 to £130,000 to £135,000 to £140,000, so you have had a significant pay increase
default.  
defaultIs that not right?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI had a pay increase of £10,000 on taking on the chairmanship.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultIt was an 8% pay increase.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI have not worked it out, but I will rely on your figures.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultHow can you justify that?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultMy salary is substantially less than that of the previous chair
default.  
defaultI hope that £10,000 for the significantly increased 
defaultresponsibility of chairing the Commission for Local A
defaultdministration, as well as fulfilling my duties as
default Local Government Ombudsman, will be 
defaultseen as proportionate.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: Beneath
default the ombudsman’s post
default,
default salaries are pegged to equivalent posts in the judiciary
default.  
defaultThat is how they are determined.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultI am curious to know why it has increased
default.  
defaultAccording to my notes, it has increased by
default 8%.  D
defaulturing these
default exceptionally difficult times
default it is unusual for any
defaultbody’s salary to increase.  T
defaulthe background is that cases during that time h
defaultave taken longer to complete; 
defaultmore are going over 12 months th
defaultan ever before.  Staff surveys are 
defaulta dog’s dinner and
default show absolutely appalling results; and t
defaulthe Select Committee’s report stands before us in terms of how the organisation has been run
default.  
defaultWhy would a 
defaultsalary increase be taking place?
default I do not understand it.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI am not sure your information is quite right
default.  
defaultI was appointed in 2010 as the Local Governmen
defaultt Ombudsman.  Mick is right that
default the salaries were pegged to judicial rates
default.  
defaultI have had no increase since then other than the increase to which I have just referred on bein
defaultg confirmed as chair.  
defaultI hope that
default 
defaultwhat you have seen from 
defaultour submissions to this inquiry and also what you hear today
default demonstrates that over
default the past 12 months we have taken huge 
defaultsteps in the right 
defaultdirection
default.  Our productivity is better,
default w
defaulte are exceeding all our targets and
default we have implemented one of the
default biggest change programmes 
defaultthe organisation has had 
defaultin over 40
default&#xa0;
defaultyears
default.  
defaultWhile I accept that when I appeared before you last time we were cha
defaultllenged quite substantially, 
defaultquite rightly, I hope I can now demonstrate that we have really made some
default changes and 
defaultare developing and moving in the right direction.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default 
defaultI want to ask about the independence of
default the external evaluators who were appointed.  In written evidence to us, it was suggested that, “in terms of public perception would the claim of being a fully independent external review hold more credence if all ‘auditors’ were drawn from a background of not having had any direct association with an LGO service?”  Is it not the case that all people appointed to the external evaluation team had had experience of ombudsmen schemes?  In that sense, how do you respond to the point that it really was not independent and you were appointing friends to evaluate yourself?
defaultDr Martindefault: I simply do not accept that.  The external evaluation team was appointed by the commission, and we also consulted with the chairman of the Ombudsman Association, because your recommendation was to make sure that the external evaluation took due recognition of the Ombudsman Association and its criteria.
defaultWe took the view that the external evaluation needed to be led by a team of people, particularly the chair, with considerable experience 
defaultof 
defaultand expertise in ombudsm
defaultanry, if I may use that word.  
defaultRichard Thomas, 
defaultwho chaired it for us, was 
defaultat the time
default also chair of the Administrative 
defaultJustice and Tribunals Co
defaultuncil.  He is 
defaultexperienced and understands 
defaultvery well how the administrative justice landscape works.  
defaultWe also felt it would be help
defaultful to have an academic who 
defaultknew the territory well, and we are pleased that Dr Richard Kirkham was able to participate.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default 
defaultDr Martin, do you think they might have been too close to the territory in order to take an independent view?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultThat was not the view we took
default.  
defaultWe understood that it was for the commission to appoint the external evaluation team, and that was what we did
default.  
defaultWe felt it was important to have a peer review from another colleague ombudsman, hence the Scottish ombudsman joined the team
default.  
defaultWe had a clear principle as to the kind of team we felt would be most appropriate.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default 
defaultDid you know these individuals personally?
default 
default Had you had extensive contact with these individuals before they were appointed as independent?
defaultDr Martindefault: I do not think I had
default.
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default If an 
defaultombudsman is to be independent of local government, what do you think their career background needs to be?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultThat is a very good question, and the external evaluators themselves made 
defaultthat point.  They suggested that in future 
defaultit wou
defaultld not be appropriate 
defaultfor an ombudsman also to have 
defaultworked formerly
default in local government
default.  
defaultAs it happens, I am the first ombudsman for some time who has not been a chief officer in a local authority, although I have worked with local government, so you will have to judge me on my own performance
default.  
defaultMy view, which I know is shared by the Department—because we have put the point to them on behalf of the external evaluation—is that you need the best can
defaultdidate for the job.  In my view, t
defaulthe best candidate for the job is somebody who can bring experience of and expertise in local serv
defaultice delivery, in whatever form it might be, and 
defaulthave an un
defaultderstanding of the administrative j
defaultustice landscape.
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default 
defaultCan I ask about the new framework document signed between you and DCLG? 
default 
defaultDo you think that has enhanced your independence or autonomy?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI would not say it 
defaulthas 
defaultenhanced our independence or autonomy
default.  
defaultThe background to the framework document is that we were operating under a grant memorandum which was some years out of date and needed to be refreshed
default.  
defaultWe were advised by the Permanent Secretary of DCLG that the appropriate way to regularise the situation as a 
defaultsponsor or organisation for DCLG
default was to agree
default a framework document 
defaultbased on the standard format for arm’s length bodies
default.  
defaultAs you yourselves have remarked, it took some time to agree that framework document
default.  
defaultPart of the reason for that was that we were having a number of discussions and drafts looking at the standard framework document to try to make sure it was fit for purpose 
defaultfor an ombudsman, so 
defaultsome changes
default were
default made.
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default 
defaultDo you think it has compromised your autonomy?
defaultDr Martindefault: I do not.  
defaultI 
defaultaccept and 
defaultagree with the view of the external evaluators that it is something that potentially could limit our autonomy, but thus far I cannot say it has.
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default 
defaultHow might it?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultInevitably, the framework document includes arrangements which are consistent with the Government’s spending and recruitment controls
default.  
defaultYou would
default expect that to be the case as they are accountable for public money.  
defaultWe have found that to be an administrative burden, and in some cases it has delayed the way in which we have been able to get on w
defaultith the transformation plan.  
defaultI am not sure that is something I should lay at the door of the framework document itself
default.  
defaultWe are working within a particular context, and I understand that.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default 
defaultDo you think that having your offices co-located with DCLG will help with the perception of your independence and autonomy?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultIt may not 
defaulthelp, but the negotiations 
defaultwe went into with DCLG were in the context of the current climate where we need to loo
defaultk at government-owned property.  I cannot recall the details—I 
defaultam sure we could get them for you
default, if you wanted them—but 
defaultit was 
defaultone of a number of options 
defaultwe considered.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: 
defaultIt is also important to recognise that our corporate headquarters are in 
defaultCoventry
default.  
defaultThat building is not shared with any Government Departments; it is an entirely stand
default&#x2011;
defaultal
defaultone building in which our 
defaultcorporate headquarters staff and senior management 
defaultare based.  
defaultThe only building we shar
defaulte with central Government is 
defaultthe
default one we share with the 
defaultHome
default Office, Audit Commission
default and a variety of other organisations
default.  
defaultThat is our satellite office in 
defaultLondon
default.  T
defaulthere is absolutely no question that our corporate headquarters are shared with 
defaultD
defaultCLG
default.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default I note that the second criterion of the O
defaultmbu
defaultdsman A
defaultssociation is fairness, so how do you respond to the concern that the LGO might be more willing to risk judicial review with small 
defaultorganisations rather than large
default ones with large budget
defaults—
defaultfor example
default,
default local authorities?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI might ask Mick to comment in a moment because he looks after our legal team
default.  
defaultClearly, if there is any public concern about fairness that is 
defaultalso 
defaulta concern to us, but judicial reviews form a very small part of our work
default.  
defaultI think there were 19 last year, which is about 1.1% of our cases
default.  
defaultThe important point is that we run a process whereby all parties, whether it is an individual complainant or a lo
defaultcal authority, can be clear 
defaultabout
default the evidence we are presenting and
default can challenge
default it.  
defaultWe have a process which allows for that.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: 
defaultI think
default this arose from a submission from a member of the public.  There
default was 
defaulta concern
default that perhaps the potential cost of judicial review might lead u
defaults to pull our punches.  
defaultI can give you an absolute assurance that that is 
defaultnot the case.  To stick with judicial review,
default to challenge one of our decisions i
defaults very much the final step 
defaultanybody would take
default.  
defaultWe recognise that that is not a realistic proposition, not least because the courts have made clear that the scope for challenging an ombudsman’s decision is very small
default.  
defaultOur focus is on making sure that people have the
default opportunity to engage with, 
defaultare consulted on and have the opportunity to challenge our decision al
defaultl the way through the process.  
defaultDuring an investigation
default,
default we will share any key documents with both parties to make sure they have sight of the evid
defaultence on which we are relying.  B
defaultefore we make a decision, both parties will be consulted on what we call a provisional view
default.  
defaultThat sets out the decision we are minded to make, and both parties at the same time will have the opportunity to comment on that view
default. We 
defaultwill take those comments on board 
defaultbefore making a final decision.
defaultOnce we 
defaulthave made a final decision, if the complainant or 
defaultcouncil comes back to raise new issu
defaultes, or to challenge a
default fault in the decis
defaultion, we have an internal 
defaultprocess where a different team manager who has not been involved in that case will re
defaultview it and, if necessary, reopen that decision.  Therefore, l
defaultong before anybody gets anywhere near judicial review there are multiple steps by which they can be involved in shaping the decision an
defaultd challenging it, if necessary.
defaultWhere somebody does issue proceedings for judicial review, there is a process called the pre-action protocol
default.  
defaultThat enables them to set out in advance the issues 
defaultin our decision 
defaultwhich they 
defaultthink are flawed.  
defaultWe take that very seriously
default.  
defaultEvery pre
default&#x2011;
defaultaction protocol letter goes across my desk
default.  
defaultWe have a case conference about it; we consider whether or not it raises serious doubts about the decision we have made
default.  
defaultIf it does, we will reopen that case
default.  
defaultSo far this year, we have had 13 pre-action protocol letters
default.  
defaultWe have considered every one of those in detail, and in two of those cases we have made the decision to reopen the 
defaultcase
default and look at it again, and that is exactly what has happened
default.  
defaultJudicial review is by no means the only way in which people can make sure they are involved in our decision making.
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default 
defaultThank you for explaining
default the 
defaultprocess
default.  
defaultOne of 
defaultt
defaulthe issu
defaultes is about the wide-ranging discretion a
defaultnd powers that 
defaultombudsmen have.  
defaultWhat impact do you think codification of the ombudsman’s discretion would have on the work?
defaultDr Martindefault: I
defaultt is the case that the courts support the wide discretion of the ombudsman, and that is the frame
defaultwork within which we work.  I
defaultt is important that we do not fetter our discretion
default, although
default we do consider each case on its merits
default.  
defaultWe would always make sure we 
defaultdo th
defaultat.  
defaultYou will be aware that, as part of our new business model, we now have a new assessment process and code which gives greater clarity about how we exercise our discretion.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: 
defaultOne of the things we have introduced as part of the new assessment process is a very clear code
default,
default which sets out the way in which we will make decisions 
defaultand 
defaultabout which investigations we will and will not undertake
default.  
defaultI hasten to add that that is not a new barrier we have put in place for the public
default.  
defaultThese are decisions we have 
defaultalways made.
defaultWe are trying
default to be much clearer and 
defaultmore 
defaultconsistent about how we make those decisions, and much more transparent with the public about t
defaulthe criteria on which we base those
default decisions
default.  
defaultThat code has been sent to every MP in the country
default.  
defaultIt has also been published on our website, so there is absolute transparency around how we will go about that process
default.  
defaultThe code sets out two different types of te
defaultst we use.  
defaultThe first is that there are legal restrictions on what we can and cannot look at
default.  
defaultFor example, if somebody has already been to court
default,
default we are prohibited from looking at that case, so they are all set out in the codes.
defaultThere i
defaults also a series of choices 
defaultwe have to make about the p
defaultroper use of public money and about which
default matters should be looked at by the ombudsman
default.  
defaultThey are more 
defaultto do with the discretionary matters 
defaultyou are talking about
default.  
defaultWe have tried to set out in much clearer terms than we have ever done before how we will make those decisions and consider things
default—for example, 
defaultwhat amounts to significant injustic
defaulte in a case.  The upshot 
defaultis that I believe we are making more 
defaultdecisions more clearly and 
defaultconsistently than we have ever done in the past.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default  
defaultDo you think there is any risk that by publishing deci
defaultsions based on what some claim i
defaults a m
defaultisunderstanding of their case—if they think it has been interpreted or decided incorrectly—it could be seen
default that the LGO is misinforming the public?
defaultMichael Kingdefault: 
defaultIs this in relation to the publication of all our decision outcomes?
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default If someone
default believe
defaults that the decision in their case is not correct and you publicise those findings, where do you get the 
defaultconfide
defaultnce to counteract the perception that it is the wrong decision, and 
defaultwrong
default information is
default being put forward 
defaultto uphold that decision
default?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultPerhaps it would help if I 
defaultfirst explained that
default we publish decisions only after we have given time for our internal review process
default.  
defaultWe will continue, as we always have, to give all bodies the opportunity
default.  
defaultThe provisional view stage is the most important 
defaultstage
default when all parties can challenge the evidence and findings
default.  T
defaulthat is the key point in the process
default.  
defaultHaving done that, when we issue our final statement, which I think is what you are referring to, we will always allow a three-
defaultmonth time span for a complainant
default to come back and have an internal review before we publish it, so we are not ruling out people coming
default to challenge any decision 
defaultwe have made
default.  
defaultThat continues to be the case
default.  
defaultHaving gone through any review process, we will publish.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: W
defaulte are the first ombudsman in the 
defaultUK
default to publish every single decision outcome on the website
default.  People can search that by
default local authority so they can see what decisions are made in their area
default.  
defaultThey can also search it by complaint category
default.  
defaultWe had a long discussion about whether we should publish every single outcome or just 
defaultthe ones that have been upheld.  We felt it 
defaultvery important, in order to give local councillors and the public a rounded vi
defaultew of what we do, to
default publish every decision
default.  
defaultThat is fair to local authorities as well, in that it shows the ones that we do not up
defaulthold as well as the ones we do.
defaultOf fundamental importance wa
defaults that we wante
defaultd to try to give the public
default information about what was likely to happen to their com
defaultplaint if they came to us.  T
defaulthey would be able to look at our website in advance, look up a complaint that might be like the one they were going to bring to us and have a reasonable expectation of how the ombudsman might deal with that
default.  
defaultThat was a decision to publish absolutely everything
default.  
defaultAt the moment, there are 1,800 decisions on our website
default.  
defaultWe will probably
default be
default publis
defaulthing
default about 12,000 decisions a year
default.  
defaultThat is the first ombudsman’s scheme in the 
defaultUK
default to do that.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default I will try and establish a bit more understanding of what you have just been talking about.  
defaultDr Martin, I think you referred earlier to a casework policy forum
default.  
defaultIs that where I would find the criteria being established for this new assessment code?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultIt would be, yes; that is the locus for our decision making around any ch
defaultanges to our casework
default.
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default 
defaultIf a very clear code has been published and it is much m
defaultore transparent and
default locked in, what is the need for a monthly casework policy forum?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultWe have to make sure that the framework within which all of our investigators are working under delegated authority is constantly updated, relevant and taking account of changes that may have happened, both legally and in terms of policy
default.  
defaultWe also want to make sure that we are monitoring casework itself
default.  
defaultWe look at
default progress on judicial reviews, so w
defaulte are looking at casework in the round.
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default 
defaultThat seems to me to be contrary to the idea of a very clear code
default that is more transparent, 
defaultis locked in and people can identify with
default.  
defaultWhat you describe sounds to me more like a movable feast.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: 
defaultPer
defaulthaps I can give the example of
default the assessment code
default that we have published.  I
defaultf there are any amendments to that, clearly we
default will
default publish those
default.  
defaultThe casework policy forum tends to pick up more
default of
default the day-to-day process and practice issues which might be giving our investigators difficulty
default.  
defaultTo give a recent example, one of our investigators asked whether they could bring an issue to the casework policy fo
defaultrum about
default changes in welfare benefits, and what sort of view the ombudsman would take on those cases
default.  
defaultShe was aware that a number of our investigators had the same type of case
default.  
defaultIt was a new issue for us to confront, so she wanted to get clarity on the view th
defaultat the ombudsman would take.
defaultAs to what
default we use the c
defaultasework policy forum for—
defaultthi
defaults is a significant improvement in the way we 
defaultwork
defaulted in the past—r
defaultather than investigators having to work their way through these new issues, perhaps coming to slightly different conclusions in different places, they can bring that issue to one place and get a clear view from the two executive directors and the
default ombudsman.  We then put out
default 
defaultthe 
defaultclear guidance
default to our staff: “When you 
defaultencounter a case like this, this is th
defaulte view we will generally take.”
defaultWe hope that over the years to come we will codify our practice in that way so we are much clearer
default and more consistent.  W
defaulte have just appointed a new legal team
default.  
defaultOne of the things I will be lo
defaultoking to them to do is to consider
default our guidance on jurisdiction, which is where this information would be held, and review it
default.  
defaultOnce we have got a revised guidance on jurisdiction, I see absolutely no reason why we would not be publishing that for public scrutiny as well.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default Do you plan to have
default an external review of the investigation process? 
default 
defaultIf you have already agreed to 
defaultcommission an external review of the quality framework and the timeliness of your
default decisions
default,
default would that encompass the new investigation process?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultAbsolutely
default.  
defaultWe will commission our i
defaultnternal auditors next year,
default as part of their programme
default, t
defaulto look at our performance a
defaultnd the quality of our work.  That will look at our new quality framework in which w
defaulte
default have seven new 
defaultstandards
default,
default because we recognise t
defaulthat we have made great progress
default and our productivity is much better
default.  
defaultWhat is equally important—I am sure you would agree—is that the quality of our work is also to a very high standard and is consistent in the way Mick has just explained.
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default 
defaultDid I hear you just say that you expect the review to happen next year?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default 
defaultCan you be more precise about when it might happen?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI hope the internal auditors will finish it by May 2014.
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default 
defaultYour internal auditors are going to do this review.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default 
defaultIs that the exte
defaultrnal review which i
defaults part of the recommendations you were addressing earlier this year?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultIt is
default.  
defaultOur auditors are external to the organisation, if I can put it that way.
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid Heyes:default 
defaultMaybe I have misunderstood my notes, but I thought that one of the recommendations was that another body with expertise in the world of ombudsmen would conduct the review.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultThere are two things here
default.  
defaultOne is an external review of our time tar
defaultgets and the timelines we use.  We would have those
default looked at by a peer ombudsman
default.  
defaultThat is what we are 
defaultconsidering
default at the moment, and I think that will be in place by the end of this yea
defaultr.  A
defaults to the external evaluation of our performance, our current p
defaultlan is for it to be conducted b
defaulty our internal auditors
default.  
defaultIt is quite consistent with the kind of work they have done for us in the past, and that is what we plan at the moment.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default 
defaultLast year
default,
default the LGO was accused of being 
default“
defaultdistinctly un
default-
defaultforensic
default”
default in 
defaultvalidating evidence 
defaultprovided by local authorities, so what have you done to change that?
defaultDr Martindefault: W
defaulthile recognising it is critical that the public have confidence in our processes and our impartiality, and want to ensure that the evidence we use is f
defaultair and properly validated, an ombudsman scheme is by definition not run
default in exactly the same way as the courts
default.  
defaultOur burden of proof is different, and the way we work is a more informal investigative process.
defaultThat said, I recognise that public confidence is absolutely critical
default.  
defaultIn introducing our new business model this year, we have made sure that we give clear guidance to staff who are inves
defaulttigating so
default they are clear about the evidence on which they are relying
default.  
defaultWe also make sure
default that the statements of reasons in 
defaultthe decisio
defaultns you were referring to before 
defaultset out the 
defaultevi
defaultdence we have relied on
default to arrive at our judgment
default.  
defaultOur default process is that we make sure the complainant can see any evidence we have relied on in coming to our decision.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: We have taken a 
defaultfew other steps
default.  All of our process manuals, 
defaultdescrib
defaulting
default how we will do every step of the process from intake as
defaultsessment, to 
defaultinvestigation and our statements of reasons
default,
default are published online, so our staff follow a 
defaultconsistent process, but 
defaultthe public can 
defaultalso 
defaultsee exactly what is expected and they can hold us to account.
defaultWe have appointed one of our experienced investigators to be a profes
defaultsional practice co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinator.  That is
default somebody who does the job, leading lots of initiatives to try to improve the way in which we do our day-to-d
defaultay practice.  She leads 
defaulta series of good practice seminars we have held for all staff
default.  
defaultOne of the recent ones looked at how we handle evidence and customer service
default.  
defaultA whole series of steps has been
default put in place to make sure 
defaultthe quality of the work we are doing is as good as it can be.
defaultTo go back to your original point as to whether we are robust in challenging evidence from local authorities, in October this year we published a report against Northumberland County Council
default.  
defaultDuring the course of t
defaulthe investigation, the council
default provided evidence to us to say that that they had acted on a particular aspect of the complaint
default.  
defaultNot only did our investigato
defaultr not accept that at face value, 
defaultwhich was the 
defaultaccusation, but 
defaulthe carried out a thorough and robust investigation into the facts
default.  
defaultHe found out that the information provided to us by the council was inaccurate, a
defaultnd that led to a
default report 
defaultagainst the county council that 
defaultwas critical not only of the admi
defaultnistrative failures in the case
default but also highlighted the fact that they had effectively supplied misleading information to the ombudsman
default.  
defaultNo doubt that will featur
defaulte in the annual letter for that 
defaultauthority at the end of the year
default.  
defaultThat is just one case, but I think that is typical of our practice
default.  
defaultWe do not take things at face value from loc
defaultal authorities; we 
defaultinvestigate thoroughly and forensically where that is required.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default 
defaultYou have just gone into depth 
defaultabout 
defaulthow you would probe a local authority for accurate information
default.  
defaultYou did it in that one instance, and obviously you knew that the information you had was incorrect
default.  
defaultDid you, or w
defaultould you in future, require
default written tr
defaultanscripts of the interviews from
default council officers?
default 
default How would you use those?
default 
default How can you always ensure that the information provided by the authority is acc
defaulturate
default?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultYou are quite right
default.  
defaultWe always have a note of any interview we take
default.  
defaultSometimes it will be a c
defaultomplete transcript while at other times
default it will be a note, but we will always have a note of any interviews
default.  
defaultThe job of our investigator is to conduct an investiga
defaulttion and 
defaultgather 
defaultthe evidence they need in order to
default come to a view
default.  
defaultSometimes they would inte
defaultrview a number of officials; at 
defaultother times
default,
default they would not because they have got sufficient information from elsewhere
default.  
defaultIt is done on a case-by-case basis.
defaultThe point Mick has made is very important
default.  
defaultWe now have a professional practice co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinator
default.  
defaultThis is a new post in the organisation
default.  
defaultWe now have a clear and consistent programme of good practice seminars
default.  
defaultOur executive director for investigations is working closely with ou
defaultr assistant ombudsman.  So am I.  I now meet with assistant ombudsmen on a monthly basis
default, as well as having a casework surgery with staff
default.  
defaultI hope you can see that we have accepted the challenges you put to us last time, and are working hard to make sure that our process has public confidence and is absolutely robust.
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default 
defaultYou said you 
defaultare
default publishing evidence
default.  
defaultIs that full disclosure of all evidence and invest
defaultigations
default?
defaultMichael Kingdefault: 
defaultIt is
default.  
defaultIn terms of publishing the outcome of a case, we have a template which sets ou
defaultt exactly what the decision is i
defaultn every case
default.  
defaultIn that there is a section which shows exactly what the investigators consid
defaultered, what the legal context is
default and how they have gone about doing their investigation
default.  
defaultThat is the same in every case outcome.
defaultIn terms of sharing with the complainant t
defaulthe information we have relied 
defaulton,
default it is fair to say that
default in the past we were sometimes reluctant to disclose the content of an investigation file
default.  
defaultThat came from the particular legal framework within which we were working
default.  
defaultWe have completely turned that on its head
default.  
defaultOur advice to staff now is that, where somebody requests information from their case file, our starting pos
defaultition is that we will disclose 
defaultevery single piece of information
default we have on that case file
default, unless it is subject to a Data Protection Act restriction, maybe because it has got confidential third-party information
default.  
defaultOur practice has moved from one which tended to be selective ab
defaultout disclosure of evidence in 
defaultour case files—traditionally, the ombudsman’s investigations were conducted in private
default—to a practice where we have 
defaultabsolute
defaultly
default open disclosure of the evidence we have relied on, and that now underpins our whole approach to investigations.
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Glindon:default 
defaultAre you now satisfied that what you a
defaultre doing will 
defaultshow the validity of the evidence
default you have gathered
default from local authorities
default?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI certainly hope so, but we never stand still; we 
defaulthave to continue to ensure 
defaultwe are
default doing a good job, and we will 
defaultdo that.
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default I
default want to ask about the complaints you receive about
default yourselves.  
defaultIn the 2012-13 annual report, of 
defaultthe 63 complaints you received that year it was agreed that in 13 cases you had not provided
default an appropriate level of service
default.  
defaultThat is quite a high proportion, is it not?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultWhen you consider that we deal with over 10,000 complaints a year, it is not a huge amount.
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultBut not everybo
defaultdy is complaining about you, so if more did 
defaultit would be an even higher proportion.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultI was just making the point that we do deal with a lot of complaints, but I accept the challenge.
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultWhat are you doing to encourage people to complain about you?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultWe are making our process absolutely clear
default.  
defaultThe most important thing is openness and transparency
default.  
defaultThat has to be ou
defaultr
default watchword, and we make it clear to people how they can challenge what we have done.
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default In that process of challenge
default, does the complaint go first to the officer who carried out the inquiry?
default 
default Is that right? 
default 
defaultWe have had comp
defaultlaints.  If I come to you because
default I am not satisfied with the way it h
defaultas been handled,
default my com
defaultplaint goes to the officer who handled my complaint.  
defaultIs that right?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultAll the inte
defaultrnal reviews are peer review
default, so they are conducted by a manager from another team; they are not conducted by the team where a complaint has been raised
default.
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default T
defaulthe external evaluation 
defaultsaid 
defaultthat that was not really appropriate and you should have an independent reviewer
default.  
defaultIs that right?
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultThey did
default.  
defaultWe have not completed that yet, but we are looking at how we can introduce an external evaluator in the way you have described
default.  
defaultWe are going to make a decision at the
default next meeting of the commission
default.
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultSo you are not satisfied with the way you handle complaints about your organisation.
defaultDr Martindefault: 
defaultWe recognise that we can always do better, as all public bodies can, and we take on board what the external evaluation suggest
defaulted.  
defaultIt is one of the recommendations we are now looking at, and we will make a decision at the next commission meeting
default.  
defaultI expect that we will decide to strengthen our processes by having an external person
default.  Many ombudsmen do have external reviews of their service complaints, and so it is right 
defaultwe should look at that.
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default When will the public expect to have an external body to look at complaints that they want to make about you?
defaultDr Martindefault: I would have thought by the end of this business year.  I do not make any promise, but it is a reasonable expectation.
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default By the end of March.
defaultDr Martindefault: By the end of March we should know.
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Let me ask about the stakeholder advisory forum that has been established.  How were participants selected to sit on your stakeholder advisory forum?  By the way, it sounds great.
defaultDr Martindefault: Thank you.  We invited all recent complainants to apply for membership.  We wanted one MP and invited all MPs to respond.  No one has responded yet, so if anybody is really interested in joining our advisory group, we would be delighted.  
defaultCoventry
default is not too far to go, so that invitation is still open.  We also invited a councillor and members from advocacy groups to join us.
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default All these people wrote in and you decided who should be on your forum.
defaultDr Martindefault: Yes, that is right but we had 150 complainants who were interested.  Obviously, we could not put all of them on the advisory group, but we retained them on an email network.
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default I am trying to establish how you selected them.  Did you choose the most difficult ones?
defaultDr Martindefault: Mick will tell you about the detail better than I can.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: We wrote to the last 4,000 people who had complained to us.  Of those, 150 came back and expressed an interest.  We asked them to tell us, on one side of a piece of paper, why they thought they could contribute something to the forum.  Because we were so overwhelmed with interest, we tried to pick people who had some other form of community involvement.  For example, one of the people is a street pastor.  
defaultWe tried to pick people who not only had been complainants but had some other wider civic role so that they could bring something extra.  In deciding who should be on the group, I can assure you that we did not look at their complaint outcome.  I chaired the first meeting of the group.  I can assure you that there is a majority of complainants on it, and there are certainly some very mixed views about their experience of our service.  Some people were incredibly positive about the service they had received from us at a difficult time in their lives, which was great to hear.  Other people were saying we made them work too hard and we did not explain clearly enough what the process was.  Some really valuable material came from that.  We are committed to doing it, and it felt like a really valuable experience.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default Perhaps I may look forward rather than back as we have done.  What are your views about the future landscape of the Local Government Ombudsman service more generally?  Last week, on Wednesday 27 November, the Legal Ombudsman said that “our complaints system is a mess”, and “t
defaulthe cost of maintaining all the myriad complaints schemes is startlingly high and efficiency levels low
default.”  Only two days later, on Friday, there was a ministerial statement saying we should aim to create an integrated public services ombudsman, such as exists currently in 
defaultScotland
default and 
defaultWales
default.  Do we have something to learn here from the devolved Administrations?
defaultDr Martindefault: We certainly have something to learn from the devolved Administrations.  I hope that what you have heard from us in the course of this inquiry has given you some confidence that at least this ombudsman service is offering good value for money, has made considerable cost savings, increased its productivity and taken a much closer look at the quality of what it does.  In my view, LGO is certainly fit for purpose to be efficient and effective in future.
defaultWe are aware that the Cabinet Office Minister, Oliver Letwin, has announced a review of ombudsmen.  We have written to him to say that we want to engage in that review.  We believe we have a lot to share with those who want to look at ombudsmen.  I am aware of the comments of the Legal Ombudsman and others.  We want to share our learning from transformation, because we are proud of what we have achieved over the past 12 months or so and will continue to achieve.  We also have 40 years’ experience of ombudsmanry—not myself you understand, but
default 
defaultthe organisation —and supporting local complaints handling.
defaultFor us, the important thing to remember is that the ombudsman is always at the apex of a system for local complaints handling, so it is important that any ombudsman in the future continues to amplify those messages.  I do not think that any reform is about the exponential growth of ombudsmen; it is not that we should be touting for business, but we should be looking at how we can support local complaints handling better in the future. Any reforms should focus on what is best for the public and how they can access a service.  We ourselves have a great slide to show how difficult it is for people to navigate the complaints maze, as we have called it.  It is difficult at the moment, so we absolutely want to engage in any process which looks at simplifying that.
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default To look backwards for a moment, what do you think these calls for reform tell us about the current structure of the ombudsman service generally?
defaultDr Martindefault: In one sense, you have to ask them, but I would summarise it as the system being too complex.  We know best about the local landscape.  You will be aware as we are that the local landscape is changing dramatically.  With a multi-agency environment, I imagine that for complainants it is increasingly complicated for them to understand how they can make a complaint, at a time when it is increasingly important for people to be able to make a complaint.  I would use the term “consumer democracy” to describe what we have at the moment, which is more and more reliance on local people to hold local services to account in a post-Audit Commission world.
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default Do you think there are some benefits for a single point of contact for a member of the public wishing to complain?
defaultDr Martindefault: Yes, I do—anything that is better, simpler and clearer for the public.  We can learn from the Welsh ombudsman in that regard.  You talked about our 
defaultUK
default colleagues.
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark Pawsey:default How do you think your organisation and the people currently working it would fit into such an organisation?  How would they respond to that kind of change, given the change you told us you have already gone through?
defaultDr Martindefault: You are quite right.  Change has to be managed very carefully and with absolute consideration.  I, for one, will not be rushing into anything, but, if a debate is about to happen, I want LGO to be part of it.  We have led the way with our intake service, for which Mick has responsibility.  Although we have mirrored a lot of good practice with our new model, we are leading the way with the codification of assessments.  We have a lot to offer.
defaultYou asked about staff.  The experience and expertise of our staff is a valuable commodity, and it is essential for LGO business continuity and anything that comes in the future.
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You have started producing thematic reports, which members of the Committee have received, covering a number of different areas where you have been looking at particular complaints.  Could you say briefly why you think they are beneficial to complainants, members of the public and local authorities, and what you hope to achieve by them?
defaultDr Martindefault: There are two kinds.  We now regularly produce what we call 
defaultAdult Social Care Matters
default, which is a themed report looking at those issues.  We also now produce one on children and young people’s complaints.
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You did one on homelessness.
defaultDr Martindefault: Yes, we produced one recently on homelessness, and in particular the inappropriate use of bed and breakfast accommodation for families and young people.  Only last week, we were looking at family foster carers and the way they were being unfairly treated by some local authorities.  This is an important part of our work.  Our founding legislation sets out that the ombudsman should not only deal with complaints but provide advice back to the sector, and not only about complaints handling but the improvement of local public administration and service delivery.
defaultIf I take the focus report that we published last week, we felt it really important to highlight the issues about family foster carers to increase public information and awareness, particularly at a time when increasingly we will be relying on the users of services to challenge the service 
defaultproviders and service deliverers.  Public information is increasingly important, and we hope to be able, through these focus reports, to add to that.
defaultWe also want to share good practice and remind local authorities of the statutory framework within which they work.  What we are adding to those focus reports now are key questions that councillors might wish to ask in scrutiny sessions, so that councillors and local authorities are holding all providers to account for the quality of the services being offered.  Last week we were in a meeting with the Care Quality Commission about the way we feed back our learning from complaints so we can also help to enrich their process and the quality of their intelligence.  We are very keen to continue doing this.  We feel we have a lot to offer so we can amplify and learn lessons from the complaints that come to us.
defaultMichael Kingdefault: The report on family values that we launched on Friday was about the lack of support that is sometimes given to friends and family who step in at short notice to look after children.  One of the things we are trying to achieve is to tell the human stories that lie behind the headlines, as we did with our report on bed and breakfast.  In that most recent report, we highlighted the case of a grandmother who had stepped in to look after her six-year-old grandson and ended up bankrupt because of the lack of financial support she got over a nine-year period.  Another case involved a man who stepped in to look after an unrelated child of his partner after she had committed suicide.  He lost his home, job and car while looking after that child.
defaultWe are trying to make sure that when people are holding local authorities to account, whether it be local authority members or the public, and people are making policy and legislation, they are informed by real experience people have of public services, and of when things go wrong.  We are not a regulator; we cannot see the whole picture, but we know we have some really valuable lessons from people’s human experience of service failure.  We just want to make sure we are sharing them, and that those voices are heard and inform public policy debates.
defaultChair:default On that very positive point—that there are lessons to be learned—it is probably an appropriate moment to conclude this evidence session.  Dr
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin and Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultKing, thank you very much for coming to give evidence to us.
