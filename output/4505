defaultINTRODUCTION
default&#xa0;defaultThis paper 
defaultshould be seen in conjunction with a submission from Global Radio. 
defaultIt focuses on the future of the BBC with regard to BBC Radio
default 
default3 and its exceptional role in broadcasting and commissioning classical music. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBBC Radio 3 holds a unique position in the British broadcasting landscape. Its strength in the past has been in its ability to use this unique position, with the safety net of generous public funding, to create bold, distinctive, brave programming, unfette
defaultred by the need to deliver audiences to advertisers. With a guaranteed income from the Licence Fee, BBC Radio 3 operates in common with other BBC services, without any fear of commercial failure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlone among any BBC radio or television service, it can be
default argued that BBC Radio 3’s uniquely guaranteed funding, along with the concentration of power in the hands of the station’s Controller, is unprecedented in any other area of broadcasting or the arts in the UK. Not only is this role editorially and financia
defaultlly responsible for the radio network, but the holder of the post is also the largest commissioner of classical music in the UK, controls the UK’s biggest live classical music festival (The BBC Proms) and is responsible for the five BBC Orchestras and the 
defaultBBC Singers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultposition of 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio
default 
default3 in the marketplace means that the 
defaultBBC occupies a potentially market-distorting role in terms of the commissioning, broadcast and promotion of live classical music in the UK, either on radio or via digital online b
defaultroadcasts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC must have great regard for the impact of 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio
default 
default3 on the market place and on the classical music eco-system in the UK. In future, 
defaultthe BBC should enforce far tighter content requirements on publicly subsidised services such as BBC Ra
defaultdio 3, with far greater regard to the overall competitive broadcast marketplace when programming changes are made. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny incursions into digital delivery of classical music by the BBC – either via Radio 3 or through other means should be closely monitored 
defaultand controlled. 
defaultAt present, these appear to be unfettered. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would also welcome a new funding mechanism, which allows a far wider dissemination of classical music content from orchestras funded by the Arts Council. This could be through a public service fund, provided by a proportion of the licence fee, which all
defaultows commercial services to broadcast cultural events (such as live classical music concerts). This mechanism would ensure that these events reach a far wider audience, thereby making the ratio of public subsidy to audience reached far more economically jus
defaulttifiable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy way of background, t
defaulthis submission
default examines 
defaultthe effect of 
defaultrecent programme changes at BBC Radio 3. It will argue that although each of these changes may on its own be regarded as being 
defaultrelatively 
defaultminor, 
defaultwhen taken 
defaultcumulatively over 
defaulta 
defaultsustain
defaulted period, they have 
defaultprofoundly affect
defaulted
default both the character and the content of BBC Radio 3’s service.
default In the process, this has resulted in a significant change to the classical music ra
defaultdio landscape in the UK, with the serious
default erosion of listener choice 
defaultin
default key dayparts 
defaultbeing the principal outcome. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a radio station that primarily broadcasts classical music, BBC Radio 3 operates in a market of two, with Classic FM its commercial radio competitor. 
defaultThese significant changes by BBC Radio 3 have the potential
default to radically alter the classical music radio marketplace in the UK
default to the detriment of its commercial rival
default.
default As yet, the BBC Trust has refused formally to examine the impact of these changes. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the amount of public money available to BBC Radio 3’s management, it is imperative that this funding is invested to augment and widen the artistic depth and breadth of classical music broadcasting in the UK, rather than in replicating the service alr
defaulteady provided by Classic FM, the BBC’s only commercial competitor in this area. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAccording to BBC Radio 3’s Service Licence, issued by the BBC Trust in July 2011:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultThe remit of Radio 3 is to offer a mix of music and cultural programming in order to engag
defaulte and entertain its audience… Radio 3’s programmes should exhibit some or all of the following characteristics: high quality, original, challenging, innovative and engaging, and it should nurture UK talent… The service should aim to educate audi
defaultences about
default music, broadcasting a
default wide range of programmes that expose listeners to new and sometimes challenging material they may not otherwise experience.
default”default 
defaultPROGRAMMING CHANGES
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe past few years have seen a series of major programming changes to the style and content of BBC Radio 3’s output. 
defaultThese changes have not been introduced all at once in one bold move. Rather, it is apparent that there has been a creeping 
defaultpopularisation
default o
defaultf BBC Radio 3’s output
default over the past few years
default, with the effect that
default the clear 
defaultgap between it and Classic FM has been
default gradually eroded, with the BBC station moving inexorably towards the position which has traditionally been occupied by its commercial comp
defaultetitor. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese 
defaultchanges 
defaulthave included (but are not limited to):
default&#xa0;

defaultRESPONSES TO BBC RADIO 3’s OUTPUT CHANGES
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultIn its Service Review of BBC Radio 3, published in April 2011, the BBC Trust says:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultWe are aware that there are ways in which Radio 3 could more actively target new 
defaultlisteners. In particular, it could pursue a far more populist approach by abandoning its commitment to a wide range of challenging music, or by playing much shorter excerpts of orchestral pieces. However, such an approach would significantly jeopardise and
default damage those elements that make Radio 3 distinctive and highly valued. Such a strategy would not be welcomed by either audiences or industry.
default”default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough it is clear to those intimately involved in classical music broadcasting 
defaultthat the character and conte
defaultnt of BBC R
defaultadio 3’s output has 
defaultin fact 
defaultbeen creeping towards that of Classic FM over the 
defaultpast couple of years, this 
defaulthas now been noticed both by the 
defaultwider 
defaultlistening public and by cultural commentators.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Voice of the Listener and Viewer says:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultWe 
defaultconsider that Radio 3 needs to be highly distinctive in comparison with Classic FM. At present the morning drive ti
defaultme is often indistinguishable f
defaultr
defaulto
defaultm the commercial station. The BBC should originate not copy.
default”default default&#xa0;
defaultOn January 10
defaultth
default 2011, Nicholas de Jongh wrot
defaulte in The Independent under the headline 
defaultRadio 3 – Low-brow, lightweight and losing its way?
default:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultThese days Radio 3 sometimes sounds as if intent on transforming itself into a superior version of Classic FM. The wretchedly low-brow three hours’ a night of li
defaultsteners’ requests during The Genius of Mozart festival sounds for the first ti
defaultme as i
defaultf the station were seriously dress-rehearsing to slip down-market.
default”default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn October 5
defaultth
default 2011, Sarah Spilsbury from the listeners’ group Friends of Radio 3 wrote in The Guardian:
default 
default&#xa0;
default“defaultThe BBC Trust agreed in February that Radio 3 must redouble its efforts to reach a “broader audience”. Indeed, for their recent report on the station’s performanc
defaulte, they sought the views of the broader public – most of whom do not listen to the station. Having ascertained that the non-listeners find Radio 3 
default‘slightly daunting at times’
default, Mr Wright has imported all the tricks of popular, downmarket broadcasting to he
defaultlp win over a new audience…
default&#xa0;
defaultPerhaps it will attract Classic FM listeners. But should the BBC be using public funds to provide a competitive alternative to a commercial station which has already staked out the territory as its own? Classic FM needs those l
defaultisteners to survive; the BBC does not. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn order to be less “intimidating”, Radio 3 has lowered its intellectual standards. Instead of critical insights, the guests, listeners, presenters, even performers, are encouraged to 
defaultshare personal feelings, memori
defaultes and tastes. Musical anal
defaultysis
default has been reduced to the occ
defaultasional concert interval talk, t
defaulthe same truncated morsels of longer works are played and replayed.
default”default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Daily Telegraph reported on 1
defaultst
default September 2011 that:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultRadio 3 is facing a growing backlash
default from listeners fed up with hearing the same pieces played repeatedly alongside an abundance 
defaultof excerpts rather than entire works. Ardent classical music fans are becoming increasingly frustrated with the station’s attempts to appeal to the mass market by 
defaultdiluting its content. Online message boards and forums have been buzzing with disquiet from listeners unimpressed with the steady influx of celebrity presenters, the regular phone-ins and audience participation.
default”default&#xa0;
defaultMichael White wrote in the Daily Telegraph
default on 3
defaultrd
default September 2011 under the headline 
default“
defaultRadio 3 is getting out of tune with its audience
default”
default:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultIn its search for that “wider public”, Radio 3 is edging ever closer to the comfortable banality of Classic FM. It uses celebrity presenters. It replaces inform
defaulted discussion with vacuous blather. It fills vast tracts of airtime with disc-jockey formats. It slips into Classic FM’s (commercially successful) routine of selling art as relaxation – as if Bach, Brahms and the other towering giants of music churned out 
defaultall those notes for tired executives to sleep through. Needless to say, no one at Radio 3 would admit this. For them, Classic FM is the elephant in the room, its existence barely acknowledged, 
defaultits influence denied. Roger Wright, the station’s controller, w
defaultill emphatically tell you that there’s no competition between the two, and no pressure for him to follow Classic’s lead. The truth is otherwise. Classic FM pulls an audience of around 5.7 million, while Radio 3 only manages 2.2 million. And that means pres
defaultsure – which Wright has never resisted with the vigour that certain of his predecessors (especially John Drummond) managed.
default”default 
default   
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 3
defaultrd
default October 2011, the Daily Telegraph radio critic Gillian Reynolds noted that
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default“default[Roger] Wright can plead he is obeying 
defaultorders from the BBC Trust to reach new audiences by making Radio 3 less formal.
default”default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile

default September that 
defaultBreakfast on Radio

default…
default&#xa0;
default“default…defaulthas become Radio 2.5,’ say listeners who accuse BBC of cultural vandalism… Many called for a 
defaultreturn to ‘pure and simple good music’, while others criticised the station’s creep into commercial territory saying the breakfast show sounded increasingly like rival network Classic FM.

default&#xa0;
defaultAnd o
defaultn 28
defaultth
default November 2013, Nicholas Lezard

default&#xa0;
default              
default“The sad decline of Radio 3 into Classic FM without adverts”.
default&#xa0;
defaultWHAT DO RADIO 3 LISTENERS SAY?
default&#xa0;
defaultBetter to understand the views of BBC Radio 3’s listeners, Classic FM commissioned YouGov to undertake research with a p
defaultanel of 1,086 Radio 3 
defaultlisteners at the end of March 2012.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultYouGov notes that there are clear indications in this research that 
default&#xa0;
default“default...
defaultsome listeners perceive that Radio 3 is becoming less specialised in its output and on occasion may be seen as imitating the output of oth
defaulter sta
defaulttions such as Classic FM.
default”default&#xa0;
defaultYouGov adds:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultA
defaultmong those dissatisfied with Radio 3, there appears to be a perception that presenters now try to cater for an audience with less sophisticated tastes and no longer try as hard to intellectu
defaultally challenge the 
defaultaudience.
default”default&#xa0;
defaultRadio 3’s remit is intended to extend far beyond being only a classical music station (unlike Classic FM, which only broadcasts classical music). However,
default the researchers comment that:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultF
defaultew listeners associate Radio 3 with representing jazz, d
defaultrama and religion well as part o
defaultf its overall remit i.e. this is
default the majority perception of where Radio 3 currently falls short. This implies that by over representing classical music, other, non-classical music based outputs are being und
defaulter represented.
default”default&#xa0;defaultOnly 58% of Radio 3’s listeners regard the station as being “original” and just 48% say that it is “innovative”.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is clear evidence in the research that Radio 3’s listeners believe that their station has recently moved closer to the output of Classi
defaultc FM, thereby reducing the choice 
defaultof styles of classical music radio stations 
defaultavailable to them
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default“defaultRadio 3 listeners enjoy the notion that this radio station specialises in classical music and appeals to a niche group of listeners, further echoed by close
default to 3 in 10 (29%) saying that the reason for their dissatisfaction is the dumbing down of content, trying to be more like Classic FM and
default playing more well-known music.
default”default&#xa0;defaultWhen YouGov questioned Radio 3 listeners specifically about the station’s programming 
defaultoutput, clear areas of dissatisfaction become apparent:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultAround 1 in 4 listeners perceive that Radio 3 does not play enough specialist/rare recordings of classical music (24%) or live
default classical music concerts (24%).
default”default&#xa0;
default“default22% of listeners think that there ha
defaults been a decline in the amount of less well known classical music that is played now compared to 12 months ago, with this increasing to 56% of dissatisfied listeners. 39% of listeners think that there is more popular classic
defaultal music being played (59% am
defaultong
default those that clai
defaultm that they will listen to less over the next 12 months and 64% among dissatisfied listeners), indicating a potential cause of their dissatisfaction.
default”default&#xa0;
default“defaultA quarter of all listeners have said that they have noticed a change to the frequency with which popular classics are played on Radio 3. Of these listeners, 
default86% claim that they are playing more popular classical music on Radio 3.
default”default&#xa0;default“defaultAmongst those less sati
defaultsfied with Radio 3 now compared to 12 months ago, 56% say that the quality of less well known classical music is lower compared to 12 months ago, while 44% think that the quality of popular classical music is lower compared to 12 months ago and 23% think t
defaulthe quality for contemporary classical music is lower.
default”default&#xa0;
defaultYouGov also looked at Radio 3 listeners’ perceptions of the station’s non-classical music output – an important part of the station’s remit. 50% of listeners fee
defaultl that Radio 3 is representing R
defaulteligion
default poorly; 38% say feel that the station is representing Drama poorly; 31% believe th
defaultat J
defaultazz 
defaultis represented
default poorly; 
default26% believe that W
defaultorld Music is represented poorly; and 19% believe that Arts and Ideas are represented poorly.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen it comes to the amount 
defaultof non-classical music broadcast on Radio 3, 27% of listeners feel not enough Jazz is being played; 22% of listeners feel not enough World Music is being played; 21% believe not enough Drama is being broadcast; 20% believe not enough Literature is featured
default and 19% believe that there is not enough Educational Content on the station. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs part of YouGov’s research into the BBC Radio 3 audience
default carried out in March 2012
default, the station’s listeners were offered t
defaulthe opportunity to make open-ended 
defaultobservations about
default the station’s programming. Many of these centred on the perception that BBC Radio 3’s output had moved towards th
defaultat of its commercial competitor:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultIn trying to appeal more to the traditional Classic FM listener, you’re alienating a lot of your dedicated listeners. I know a lot of people who used to listen to Radio 3 through most of the day and now regularly turn it off 
defaultwhen it becomes too populist
default.
default”default&#xa0;default“defaultStop trying to copy other radio stations. Radio 3 stood out from the rest a few years ago. Why do you feel the need to imitate Classic FM or Radio 2? I deliberately choose Radio 3 over Classic FM. Stop worrying about ratings and put the money into what y
defaultou do best.
default”default&#xa0;default“defaultGo back to being a station specialising in authoritative ways of playing and talking about classical music, and stop all the dumbing down.
default”default&#xa0;default“defaultMore excerpts rather than fuller pieces. Radio 3 should not try to become Classic FM.
default”default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultTHE BBC TR
defaultUST’S RESPONSE TO RADIO 3’s CHANGES
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC Management’s decision to make these changes 
default- and 
defaultthe BBC Trust’s decision to wave them thr
defaultough - has
default, in each case, served to reduce the choice of listening available to audiences.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC Trust’s Service 
defaultReview of
default BBC Radio 3, published in February
default 2011, admits that:
default&#xa0;
default“default…over recent years, BBC management has made changes to Radio 3 in order to make the station more accessible and welcoming to potential listeners, particularly in peak-time slots (breakfast a
defaultnd drive) as these are the key entry points for potential listeners.
default”default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, we would argue that BBC Radio 3’s management is plotting a course
default firmly towards the increasing
default popularisation of the service and a dilution of its core public service output.
default Crucially, these changes erode the choice available to listeners.  This view was echoed in submissions to the BBC Trust’s Service Review consultation by the Friends of Radio 3, 
defaultby 
defaultthe Voice of the Listener and Viewer, and 
defaultby 
defaultthe Incorporated Society of Mu
defaultsicians. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC Trust acknowledged that:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultBBC management…has changed the nature of the programmes during these hours.
default”default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough, the BBC Trust then goes on to describe this as:
default&#xa0;
default              
default“defaultLegitimate.
default”default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaultdisagree. T
defaulthe cumulative effect of the 
defaultalterations 
defaultmade to BBC Radio 3’s output, 
defaultwhen taken collectively
default, constitute a significant change to the service
default.
default 
defaultUnder its own rules, the BBC Trust should have undertaken a Public Value Test, includ
defaulting a market impact assessment before allowing BBC Management to und
defaultertake such a radical overhaul of one of its national networks. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is clear from the responses to BBC Radio 3’s programming outlined above 
default(and there are many, many more similar – and some rather more trenchant – views in chatrooms online) that the liste
defaultning public, critics and
default commentators have
default taken a very differen
defaultt view of these changes than that put forward by
default 
defaultthe 
defaultBBC Trust.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRather than pushing for BBC Radio 3 to maintain its distinctiveness, the BBC Trust’s Service Review instead appears to have a
defaultctively encouraged Radio 3 to become 
defaultmore defaultlike Classic FM. 
defaultIn
default a market of 
defaultjust 
defaulttwo 
defaultclassical music radio stations in the UK, the BBC has significantly changed the output on Radio 3 in pursuit of audiences, rather than with the aim of offering distinctive and original programming content. This lessening of distinctiveness is particula
defaultrly stark in the key morning dayparts, when listening to classical music on the radio reaches the largest number of people. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBack in 1992, 
defaultClassic FM introduced a new way of broadcasting classical music on UK radio. It complemented the style and content o
defaultf BBC Radio 3’s output at the time, providing a real point of difference. Given Classic FM’s success in building audiences for classical music radio, 
defaulttwenty years later, 
defaultthe BBC now appears to have decided to ape its commercial co
defaultmpetitor, abandoning much 
defaultof the
default distinctiveness in peak
default-
defaulttime
default 
defaulthours in the process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNo doubt, BBC Management will point to BBC Radio 3’s commitment to specialist off-peak programming, but 
defaultby so starkly changing
default 
defaultBBC Radio 3’s programming to that of
default a ‘ratings by day, reputation by
default night’ strategy in a market place
default of 
defaultjust 
defaulttwo, repres
defaulte
defaultn
defaultts a potentially serious threat to the ability of Classic FM to operate 
defaultas an 
defaulteffective commercial competitor. Classic FM is virtually unique in the classical music world in never having received a pe
defaultnny of public subsidy to fund its work; it also does not enjoy the certainty of a fixed income from the Licence Fee. 
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultNot only did the BBC Trust fail to implement a Public Value Test
default into the BBC Management’s changes to Radio 3’s output
default, but it also fai
defaultled to abide by its own ‘Competitive Impact Policy’, which requires the BBC ‘to minimise its negative competitive impacts on the wider market’.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC Trust is obliged under the terms of the BBC Agreement with DCMS to undertake a Public Value Test before
default a decision is taken to make a significant ch
defaultange to a BBC service. Although this is a decision for the Trust, the BBC Agreement requires the Trust before exercising its judgement to ‘investigate or otherwise inform itself of any facts or considerations wh
defaultich it considers potentially relevant’.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt appears that no such investigation took place. 
defaultRadioCentre 
defaultrequested further detail 
defaultfrom the BBC 
defaulton the proposed strategy to make Radio 3 more accessible and welcoming under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 
default(Letter, 24
defaultth
default February, 2011). In its re
defaults
defaultponse to the request, the BBC said:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultThe BBC did not undertake a significance assessment of making Radio 3 more accessible and welcoming. This is because it is not a new proposal, but ‘business as usual’: BBC Manag
defaultement has been seeking for some time to make its content more accessible and welcoming, and will continue to strive to do so. As such, no significance assessment was required.
default”default&#xa0;
defaultThis would suggest that the BBC Trust did not believe that a Public Value Test
default was appropriate because the change
defaults made to BBC Radio 3 took place 
defaultover a period of time, rather than at one single moment. However, the BBC Trust’s own protocols state that:
default&#xa0;
default“defaultA series of minor changes to a service licence may, cumulatively, require the 
defaultTrust to consider whether a further regulatory approvals process, such as a Public Value Test, is required.
default”default 
default              
default&#xa0;
defaultNot only should a Public Value Test have been undertaken, but also in failing to undertake a ‘significance assessment’ at all, the BBC Trust did
default not abide by the terms of the BBC Agreement with DCMS. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere must be an overhaul of how BBC radio services are held accountable for their remit. As set out in the submission fr
defaultom
default our parent company, Global Radio, a new set of duties that take precedence
default over the BBC’s public purposes will ensure BBC services do not encroach on their private sector competitors. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio 3, along with all BBC radio services, must have a tighter remit in future for which management are accountable. This new remit must re
defaultassert 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio
default 
default3’s duty to play specialist music throughout the schedule and ensure that the station does not duplicate content available on commercial services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA CHANGE OF BRAND POSITIONING
default&#xa0;
defaultClassic FM’s pure classical music proposition has been highly successful in building new audiences for the genre. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio 3 programming output continues 
defaultto be allowed 
defaultgradually to creep away from its responsibilities to non-classical music genre
defaults and peak
default-
defaulttime
default 
defaultcoverage of speech-based arts programme, the station now appears to be publicly acknowledging this move for the first time in its brand proposition.
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring 2013, it has 
defaultchanged its brand strapline to ‘The Home of Classical Music’
default. Gone is 
defaultany mention of other cultural or arts activities from its public-facing messaging.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis move in itself is worthy of investigation by the BBC Trust. Sadly, once again, the Trustees do not appear to be concerned about 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio 3’s downgrading of the statio
defaultn’s responsibilities to support wider arts and cultural programming. Once again, it appears that 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio 3 is being encouraged to use its public funding to chase ratings b
defaulty broadcasting classical music, which is well served by a commercial competitor
default, at
default the expense of the promotion of other music genres, which are not well-served by the commercial radio sector. 
default&#xa0;defaultA QUESTION OF COSTdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultYet further significant changes to BBC Radio 3’s programming output 
defaultwere discussed
default in the 
defaultDelivering Quality First 
defaultdocument, which was published by the BBC in October 2011. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese include
defaultd
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEach of these changes represents a furth
defaulter dilution of the essence that makes BB
defaultC Radio 3’s output distinctive from that of Classic FM. These changes further compound the radical nature of programming changes to the station. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven these 
defaultfu
defaultrther changes to BBC Radio 3
default’s output and the public re
defaultsponse to the changes, which have already taken place, it would be an appropriate moment for the BBC Trust to follow the procedures which it itself put in place and to undertake a full Public Value Test
default at the earliest opportunity
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe latest round of 
defaultprogramming changes have been blamed on the need for the BBC to reduce costs. However, an analysis of the BBC’s annual report suggests that BBC Radio 3
default has an annual programme content 
defaultbudget of £38.3 million
default. 
defaultIt additionally spends £5.3 million on distribu
defaulttion, with a further £10.7 million spent on infrastructure and support. The BBC defines this latter figure as including: Property; HR; Policy and Strategy; Finance and Operations; and Marketing. It is important to note that these figures do not include the
default cost of newsgathering or of BBC Radio 3’s online digital services, which are accounted for separately. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC orchestras and performing groups receive total funding of £23.4 million per annum for content, with a further £5.8 million of infrastructure a
defaultnd support funding. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen added together, BBC Radio 3 and the BBC orchestras and performing groups spend £61.7 million on content, £5.3 million on distribution and £16.5 million on infrastructure and support – giving a grand total of £83.5 million of expe
defaultnditure in the 2012-13 financial year – an increase of 
default£2 million on the previous year. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is a huge amount of money. 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio 3 cited the need to cut costs as the reason for the reduction in its commitment to specialist music programming from Septemb
defaulter 2013. However, given the scale of public money at 
defaultBBC 
defaultRadio 3’s disposal, there must surely be concern that the service is operating with a huge level of inefficiency for it not to be able to contain overall costs at a level that allowed these programme
defaults to continue. 
defaultFor this to be the case, we find it hard to believe that the stringent cost controls that would be in place in the commercial sector – out of commercial necessity - can possibly be being applied to a service that relies on a high level of gu
defaultaranteed public subsidy via the Licence Fee. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should also be noted that the live classical music market place already sees publicly funded orchestras in the geographic regions where the BBC funds additional orchestras. This is particularly the case in 
defaultLondon, Manchester and Glasgow
default, where it could be argued that the Licence Fee duplicates provision already funded via Arts Council England and the Scottish Government. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTHE CONCENTRATION OF POWERdefault&#xa0;defaultNowhere in the broadcasting or the arts world does
default so much power to spend such a large amount of public money rest in the hands of a single individual.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Controller of Radio 3 is responsible for the UK’s biggest broadcaster of live classical music; the biggest commissioner of classical music; the UK’s 
defaultbiggest classical music festival (the BBC Proms); and responsibility for no fewer than five orchestras. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo concentrate so much power in the hands of one individual
default 
defaulthas the potential to create
default an abuse of 
defaultthis market dominant position.
default 
defaultWe 
defaultremain concerned
default that this does not represent
default 
defaultthe best
default system for
default stewardship of a significa
defaultnt amount of licence fee money – and nor is it in the best interests o
defaultf creating a plural and diverse classical music ecosystem in the UK.
