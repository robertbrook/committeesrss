[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written submission from the [bold]Chartered Institution of Highways &amp; Transportation[bold] (LPG 64)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]CIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,000 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT members plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems and infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CIHT welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Committee’s call for evidence on Local Government Procurement. CIHT responses are based on inputs from members of our Procurement &amp; Delivery panel which has experience from across the local government H&amp;T sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1.[bold] 
[normal]To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1[bold]              
[normal]There can be a disconnect between the procuring authority and industry. This can arise in several ways;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2[bold]              
[normal]Procurement specialist are often blinded to opportunities with existing suppliers and send everything out to tender (as they cannot be criticised for this method of procurement).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3[bold]              
[normal]Linkages between purpose of highway services and the overall benefit of service is not clearly understood, therefore the focus is too often on reducing overall cost of services without recognising the actual value of the service. The relationship between cost and quality in evaluation of bids is often heavily skewed towards cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4[bold]              
[normal]The relationship between length of contracts and overall value for money does not correspond to the political and officer cycle in local authorities – changing priorities are not reflected well in contractual arrangements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5[bold]              
[normal]              
[normal]There have been successful longer term relationships and more effort needs to be made in understanding those successes and the factors behind them. These factors include;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2. Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1[bold]              
[normal]There is an attitude in most authorities that says we are special and therefore joint procurement's are not ideal for us. However, many authorities are taking some if not all of the standard methodologies developed by Highways Maintenance Efficiency programme 
[normal](HMEP)
[normal], a sector led, DfT sponsored programme and others. This is a positive trend and should be encouraged by all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold]              
[normal]PFI methodologies are the most efficient in the transport industry and lessons should be learned from these contracts. The downside is loss of control as the contract runs to a specification developed pre contract.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold]              
[normal]The good lessons from PFI have not been captured and lessons from ongoing projects are not being successfully monitored. The factors identified in the response to Q1 are reflected in the development of PFI contracts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4[bold]              
[normal]Whilst there are wider questions about the overall benefits of PFI in VFM, as a form of funding the highways sector is one where PFI has delivered successful improvements to service delivery in local government particularly in the street lighting and highways maintenance sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3. How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1[bold]              
[normal]Too many highways individuals involved in procurement in Local Authorities only do this task infrequently and therefore lack knowledge that is normally developed over time. Many of the most knowledgeable Individuals in Procurement are in the private sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold]              
[normal]Local Authorities should consider hiring these individuals to develop their procurements
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold]              
[normal]There are a plethora of “efficiency” initiatives from different sources in the construction sector that are creating significant wastage in the private sector responding to a large number of different frameworks created by different “efficiency” bodies, with no guarantee of any work coming out of them.  The number of authorities and regional bodies with different drivers around efficiency often mask the key purposes of services to meet customer needs with “efficiency” becoming the driver rather than a given in the delivery of public services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4[bold]              
[normal]An overall approach such as the HMEP programme identified above is a more appropriate way of achieving efficiencies in the highways sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4. To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1[bold]              
[normal]Most authorities don't understand the needs of their suppliers and market places. The more informed have recently been listening to organisations like HTMA and CECA to get a better appreciation before drafting their contract documents. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2[bold]              
[normal]Local Authorities do not appear to appreciate the costs of their tendering methodologies on the private sector, and the fact this all has to recovered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3[bold]              
[normal]The highways sector is one of the better sectors in local government and the HMEP initiative is adding wider value to the sector. Ultimately there are too many clients in the sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4[bold]              
[normal]Even when flexibility is written into contracts many authorities are reluctant to exercise the clauses as there is often little trust in the private sector - they believe they will lose out. The private sector in highways is generally very collaborative and looking for win win position.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q5. How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1[bold]              
[normal]Most Authorities are very good at ensuring regularity and propriety but as a result don't always get best value for money as they revert to safest positions at all times (e.g. Tender everything) rather than look for real VFM with current providers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6. Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1[bold]              [bold]As a membership organisation we are not able to comment sufficiently on this question.
