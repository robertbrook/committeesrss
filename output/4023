defaultI write on behalf of this association 
defaultand following a meeting of our supporters on 15
defaultth
default November 2013.  
defaultCornwall
default's Community Standards Association
default was founded in 1974 to voice concern about declining standards in society, particularly in relation to their effect on children and families.  Supporters meet bi-monthly and those attending our last meeting include a retired secondary school head teacher,
default a minister of religion, retired nursing professionals, parents and a local councillor.  We are of varying ages.

defaultIt has always been argued
default,
default 
defaultbut
default it is
default perverse not to acknowledge
default today
default,
default that watching sexual promisc
defaultuity and indulging in the portrayal of extreme violence contribute to the emergence of a violent society.  Numerous competent research projects have judged this to be so.

default              
defaultIt was our view
default, expressed in the 1970's and 1980's to the then British Board of 
defaultFilm Censors, that the industry's rather than the public's choice influenced the Board's decision
defaults
default and standards.  
defaultSo also with the BBC.
default  Reconsideration of the BBC Trust's role offers an opportunity to consider Lord Reith's original vision and aim to real
defaultise it more completely than at present.

defaultThe Prime Minister h
defaultas
default acknowledged that 
defaultGreat Britain
default is a Christian country.  History describes plenty of shortcomings but today international scholars such as Dr 
defaultVishal

default in his mammoth research

defaulto
defaultr
default 
defaultThe Book that made your world - How the Bible created the soul of Western civilisation
default, challenge
defaults
default Western nations to take their spiritual and moral foundations much more seriously as serious signs of decay threaten.

default              
defaultWe would like to make the following
default recommendations:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

defaultWe wish the BBC well and are sure that many would be reassured were the meretricious
default 
defaultto disappear along with 
defaultthe portrayal of 
defaultextremes of evil.  The world and this country are
default moving into a very challenging time.  People need to be helped to be serious and responsible at the expense of sensationalism.  The BBC's great value and past international reputation needs the Trust's help for this to be continued and, where damaged, res
defaulttored.
