[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by Cornwall’s Community Standards Association [FBB0031][bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.
[normal]              
[normal]I write on behalf of this association 
[normal]and following a meeting of our supporters on 15
[normal]th
[normal] November 2013.  
[normal]Cornwall
[normal]'s Community Standards Association
[normal] was founded in 1974 to voice concern about declining standards in society, particularly in relation to their effect on children and families.  Supporters meet bi-monthly and those attending our last meeting include a retired secondary school head teacher,
[normal] a minister of religion, retired nursing professionals, parents and a local councillor.  We are of varying ages.

[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]It has always been argued
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]but
[normal] it is
[normal] perverse not to acknowledge
[normal] today
[normal],
[normal] that watching sexual promisc
[normal]uity and indulging in the portrayal of extreme violence contribute to the emergence of a violent society.  Numerous competent research projects have judged this to be so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]It was our view
[normal], expressed in the 1970's and 1980's to the then British Board of 
[normal]Film Censors, that the industry's rather than the public's choice influenced the Board's decision
[normal]s
[normal] and standards.  
[normal]So also with the BBC.
[normal]  Reconsideration of the BBC Trust's role offers an opportunity to consider Lord Reith's original vision and aim to real
[normal]ise it more completely than at present.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]The Prime Minister h
[normal]as
[normal] acknowledged that 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal] is a Christian country.  History describes plenty of shortcomings but today international scholars such as Dr 
[normal]Vishal
[normal] 
[normal]Mangalwadi
[normal] in his mammoth research 
[normal]f
[normal]o
[normal]r
[normal] 
[normal]The Book that made your world - How the Bible created the soul of Western civilisation
[normal], challenge
[normal]s
[normal] Western nations to take their spiritual and moral foundations much more seriously as serious signs of decay threaten.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]We would like to make the following
[normal] recommendations:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]We wish the BBC well and are sure that many would be reassured were the meretricious
[normal] 
[normal]to disappear along with 
[normal]the portrayal of 
[normal]extremes of evil.  The world and this country are
[normal] moving into a very challenging time.  People need to be helped to be serious and responsible at the expense of sensationalism.  The BBC's great value and past international reputation needs the Trust's help for this to be continued and, where damaged, res
[normal]tored.
