defaultDoes tdefaulthe existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets defaultand ardefaulte defaultthey defaultbeing applied effectivelydefault?default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK requires primate species listed under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act (1976) to be licensed, although recent changes to the lists have reduced the number of species for which a licence is required
default, undermining
default protection to many primate species. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst not 
defaultdirectly 
defaultrelated to this question it is important for the Commons Select Committee to understand that illegal trade in wildlife has been strongly linked to other criminal activities such as the trafficking of weapons and drugs, and terrorism. 
defaultIn November 2012, then
default Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that illegal wildlife
default 
defaulttrade must be addressed at every level of the international community and declared illegal wildlife trade a national security issue. In May 2013, the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Crimi
defaultnal Justice agreed to a resolution calling on the nations
default 
defaultof the world to consider wildlife and forest crime a serious 
defaultform of organis
defaulted crime. Also in a May 2013 report to the United Nations Security Council, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon highlighted t
defaulthe potential link between poaching and 
defaultother transnational organis
defaulted criminal activitie
defaults. Therefore any system that purports to manage legal trade, a trade that is a driver for illegal trade, 
defaultmust ensure it
defaults’
default systems are applied and effective.
default The existing
default regulatory framework and Code of Practice 
defaultnot only 
defaultprovides inadequate protection 
defaultfor primates, it is also not effectively implemented; 
defaultRSPCA research on the DEFRA

defaultthat many Eng

defaultSdefaulthould defaultpeople defaultbe allowed to keep primates as pets and, if not, how a ban might be implemented.default&#xa0;defaultA wealth of evidence, supported by experts in primate health and welfare reject the view 
defaultthat 
defaultprimates can be kept as pets. Primatologists, conservationists, zoo professionals, 
defaultv
defaulteterinarians
default,
default primate
default 
defaultrescue organisations and other respected professionals s
defaultupport restricting the keeping of primates to those with highly specialised knowledge, skills and facilities appropriate
default 
defaultto the species
default, and only
default 
defaultfor purposes of conservation or sanctuary
default.
default Primates are highly intelligent animals with complex needs that can
default't be met in a home environment and can suffer greatly. 
defaultThere is considerable evidence to suggest that many keepers of pet primates lack the appropriate knowledge and/or facilities to adequately provide for their welfare. 
defaultSoulsbury et al., 2009 in their sc
defaultientific assessment of the suitability
default of primates as pets in the UK 
defaultconcluded that the practice should end.
default 
defaultOver half of all incidents involving primates reported to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the UK between 2001-2008, i
defaultnvolved species for which a license is not required, and over 60% involved 
defaultprimates
default housed on their own. One UK sanctuary reports that all of the primates transferred to them from private keepers are suffering from either physical or behavioural problems (
defaultor both) including stereotypic behaviours. Many exhibit a tendency to exhibit self-harming behaviour.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultTher
defaultefore we should be focusing on the second part 
defaultof the question, how should a ban be
default implemented. 
defaultClearly given the large number of primates in private ownership, professional facilities would be overwhelmed and unable to cope with an immediate ban. A more practical approach would be to have a ban with a grandfather clause which would allow current pri
defaultvate owners that are adhering to 
defaultthe 
defaultAnimal Welfare Act (2006) to keep their (non-breeding) primates. This app
defaultroach would stop the trade, phase out private keeping of primates as pets, and allow the worst cases, those that are not being kept according to t
defaulthe Animal Welfare Act (2006)
default, to find sanctuary
default in a suitable and professionally run facility.
