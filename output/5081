[normal]The extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the UK[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It 
[normal]has 
[normal]been 
[normal]estimated 
[normal]that 
[normal]2500-7500
[normal] primates 
[normal]are being 
[normal]kept by private individuals in the UK as pets (Soulsbury et al., 2009). 
[normal]However given tha
[normal]t markets for legal trade are inextricably linked to
[normal] illegal trade, indeed the legal trade can be a driver of the illegal trade, the numbers being traded and kept 
[normal]is likely 
[normal]to be
[normal] significantly underestimated.

[normal]Does t[bold]he existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets [bold]and ar[bold]e [bold]they [bold]being applied effectively[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK requires primate species listed under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act (1976) to be licensed, although recent changes to the lists have reduced the number of species for which a licence is required
[normal], undermining
[normal] protection to many primate species. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst not 
[normal]directly 
[normal]related to this question it is important for the Commons Select Committee to understand that illegal trade in wildlife has been strongly linked to other criminal activities such as the trafficking of weapons and drugs, and terrorism. 
[normal]In November 2012, then
[normal] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that illegal wildlife
[normal] 
[normal]trade must be addressed at every level of the international community and declared illegal wildlife trade a national security issue. In May 2013, the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Crimi
[normal]nal Justice agreed to a resolution calling on the nations
[normal] 
[normal]of the world to consider wildlife and forest crime a serious 
[normal]form of organis
[normal]ed crime. Also in a May 2013 report to the United Nations Security Council, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon highlighted t
[normal]he potential link between poaching and 
[normal]other transnational organis
[normal]ed criminal activitie
[normal]s. Therefore any system that purports to manage legal trade, a trade that is a driver for illegal trade, 
[normal]must ensure it
[normal]s’
[normal] systems are applied and effective.
[normal] The existing
[normal] regulatory framework and Code of Practice 
[normal]not only 
[normal]provides inadequate protection 
[normal]for primates, it is also not effectively implemented; 
[normal]RSPCA research on the DEFRA 
[normal]‘
[normal]Code of Practic
[normal]e for the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Human Primates
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]found 
[normal]that many Eng
[normal]lish local authorities are either unaware of the Code, or don't use it.

[normal]S[bold]hould [bold]people [bold]be allowed to keep primates as pets and, if not, how a ban might be implemented.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A wealth of evidence, supported by experts in primate health and welfare reject the view 
[normal]that 
[normal]primates can be kept as pets. Primatologists, conservationists, zoo professionals, 
[normal]v
[normal]eterinarians
[normal],
[normal] primate
[normal] 
[normal]rescue organisations and other respected professionals s
[normal]upport restricting the keeping of primates to those with highly specialised knowledge, skills and facilities appropriate
[normal] 
[normal]to the species
[normal], and only
[normal] 
[normal]for purposes of conservation or sanctuary
[normal].
[normal] Primates are highly intelligent animals with complex needs that can
[normal]'t be met in a home environment and can suffer greatly. 
[normal]There is considerable evidence to suggest that many keepers of pet primates lack the appropriate knowledge and/or facilities to adequately provide for their welfare. 
[normal]Soulsbury et al., 2009 in their sc
[normal]ientific assessment of the suitability
[normal] of primates as pets in the UK 
[normal]concluded that the practice should end.
[normal] 
[normal]Over half of all incidents involving primates reported to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the UK between 2001-2008, i
[normal]nvolved species for which a license is not required, and over 60% involved 
[normal]primates
[normal] housed on their own. One UK sanctuary reports that all of the primates transferred to them from private keepers are suffering from either physical or behavioural problems (
[normal]or both) including stereotypic behaviours. Many exhibit a tendency to exhibit self-harming behaviour.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ther
[normal]efore we should be focusing on the second part 
[normal]of the question, how should a ban be
[normal] implemented. 
[normal]Clearly given the large number of primates in private ownership, professional facilities would be overwhelmed and unable to cope with an immediate ban. A more practical approach would be to have a ban with a grandfather clause which would allow current pri
[normal]vate owners that are adhering to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Animal Welfare Act (2006) to keep their (non-breeding) primates. This app
[normal]roach would stop the trade, phase out private keeping of primates as pets, and allow the worst cases, those that are not being kept according to t
[normal]he Animal Welfare Act (2006)
[normal], to find sanctuary
[normal] in a suitable and professionally run facility.
