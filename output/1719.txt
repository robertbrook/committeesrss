&#xa0;STEM and gender experts Jan Peters and Sean McWhinnie consider the successes of past measures to improve the retention and advancement of women in academic STEM roles. Consideration is given to the impact of past measures, tendencies to reinvent the wheel and the UK’s strategic approach and positioning. Key points covered are:&#xa0;&#xa0;Government should strongly encourage learned societies to take a subject-view of their fields. In particular, engineering-related professional bodies to look more closely at the sectors in which they operate to understand cultures and careers in both industry and academia and stimulate new career pathways and training to help professionals transition between industry and academia as well as to help women (and men) better manage career and caring responsibilities.September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;               The Rising Tide: Report on Women in Science, Engineering and Technology, Engineering &amp; Technology Committee on Women in Science, London, 1994               Factors Affecting the Career Choices of Graduate Chemists, Royal Society of Chemistry, London, 2000 (http://www.rsc.org/images/Factors%20Affecting%20the%20Career%20Choices%20of%20Graduate%20Chemists_tcm18-12806.pdf); Recruitment and Retention of Women in Academic Chemistry, Royal Society of Chemistry, London, 2003 (http://www.rsc.org/images/Recruitment%20and%20Retention%20of%20Women%20in%20Academic%20Chemistry_tcm18-12807.pdf).               Women in University Physics Departments: A Site Visit Scheme 2003–2005, Institute of Physics, London, 2006 (http://www.iop.org/publications/iop/archive/file_42616.pdf)               The Winning Women to Science, Engineering &amp; Technology (1998).
