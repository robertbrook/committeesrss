"RCH0009&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Thanet District Council and Margate Task Force Partners&#xa0;\nEducation \nCommittee: \nResidential Children’s Homes – Submission of Written Evidence \n&#xa0;Thanet District Council is a local government district authority located on the northeast tip of Kent with a population of 134,186; 23% of this population are children aged between 0-18 years and approximately 338 of these children are classed as LAC (32% of these are the responsibility of other Local Authorities).  Of the 388 LAC:\n&#xa0;\n Thanet is a predominantly coastal area which is characterised by high levels of deprivation and its related problems – two of the wards (Margate Central and Cliftonville West) are amongst the most deprived in England.  Within these wards there are multiple high levels of risk, vulnerability and deprivation which are disproportionate to other areas within the County; all of which can cause additional safeguarding and welfare concerns when dealing with already vulnerable LAC.  \n&#xa0;\nWhen LACs are placed out of the area, they can be exposed to multiple risk factors he moment that they leave their home.   There are many challenges that are bought with these issues and agencies within the District are working hard together to overcome them, but the need continues to increase due to out of area placements and the transient nature of some wards.  The level of LACs that are in the District, combined with the growing number of out of area placements, cause significant concern for the local statutory.  A key issue for ourselves and the other statutory agencies within Thanet that are involved in community safety is that we are denied access to placement information on the basis of data protection by those that have it, meaning that we are unable to ensure that risks within these areas are tackled appropriately. \n \n&#xa0;\nPrior to 2009, Thanet had 22 residential children’s homes in the District.  Three were closed down, and there are currently 19 residential children’s homes still operating in the District.  Although we are aware of the number of homes in the area, because Ofsted own this information we are unable to pinpoint exact locations due to Ofsted being unwilling to give this information on the grounds of data protection.  We are also unable to determine the number of independent fostering services in the District; those operating are under no obligation to tell us that they are doing so.  We are currently working with them to progress our knowledge in a co-ordinated manner; again, this information is owned by Ofsted who will not disseminate it further.  This is the same situation for support services in Thanet provided for LACs after they leave care.\n&#xa0;\nThanet has the highest proportion of LAC in Kent, and almost a third of these children are from out of the county.  We have found that many outside agencies placing children from other counties and boroughs are not communicating with local service providers or carrying out adequate risk assessments which means that vulnerable children are often placed in what should be classed as high risk areas due to high numbers of ex-offenders (including registered sex offenders), people with mental health issues and vulnerable children that have had previous criminal involvement themselves.  For example, a LAC who had suffered from abuse from out of the area was placed in a residential children’s home in Cliftonville alongside a gang member associated with the perpetrators of the crime.  Another example is a small road in Cliftonville which has mental health facilities, children’s homes, independent fostering placements, a NEET facility and a house under suspicion of involvement in drugs and prostitution.  Placing vulnerable young people in areas such as this can lead to exacerbating their problems rather than resolving them and ultimately limits their life chances.  \n&#xa0;\nRecommendations for action by Government that Thanet District Council would like considered:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat in two tier authorities areas, both the County and District Councils are consulted and included within the statutory regulations.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere should be a greater clarification of roles and responsibilities of authorities in two tier areas in respect of the information that is held about children’s homes and looked after children, including the sharing of this information. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat if children are placed out of the area, they are within a distance that is manageable for the social worker of the responsible authority to maintain a regular contact with them; no more than a three hour round trip. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat registered homes already registered, but in an “at risk” area are assessed under the new regulations immediately.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would like to be assured that in areas where there is a two tier authority system that both the County level and District level Councils are notified when a home in the District has admitted a child to a placement or when they are discharged from their care.  When admitting a child to placement it would be preferential that both Councils and also the Police within a District are given notification prior to the placement occurring rather than retrospectively.  This will enable all involved to inform service planning and also allow us to keep a track on the number of LAC in the area. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat there are systems in place to enforce these regulations because although host authority’s are meant to be notified of LAC placements this has been lacking within the District; we would like there to be a reassurance that this is fully monitored and what the repercussions are for those that do not abide by this duty.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat there are amendments to the Schedule 5 (Regulation 30 (1)) that include the Police and hosting authority(ies) being notified when a child in the District goes missing from care – presently there is only a requirement to alert the Responsible Authority.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder Regulation 11 It would be permissible to also make the addition under this duty that the Registered Person is also able to formally request a review of the child’s placement at their home.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere needs to be clarification as to how the Responsible Authority is held to account so that reviews actually take place, and in liaison with the Police, Hosting Authority and the Registered Person at the home.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt would also be a suggestion to have the placing authority consult with the proposed hosting authority, responsible authority for Children’s Services, the Police and where applicable the localised Youth Justice Service when risk assessments are carried out.  We would like the opportunity for the hosting authority(ies) to be able to challenge the placement risk assessment. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAmendments to Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to place a statutory requirement upon the Responsible Authority to consider the crime and anti-social behaviour issues in a \nproposed hosting area and the implications that these may have for a vulnerable child – at present this is only the responsibility of the Hosting Authority. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere should be clear guidelines as to what the risk assessment should cover so that there is transparency for all involved and a recognised format for information.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStaff qualifications should be included in the annual risk assessment of the home.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA time limit on homes operating without a registered manager or locum of three months.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn ability for District and County Councils to liaise in the suitability of independent visitor recruitment due to the nature of issues we face in Thanet.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat the following are specified under Regulation 33:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn relation to local authority children’s homes Regulation 33 visits, there needs to be consideration around the conflict of interest that some staff may find themselves in if the authority allocate them to do this as they are responsible for the salary of the “independent” officer.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere should be a defined set of standards nationally for Regulation 33 visits, plus a standard format for this reporting.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt should be a necessary requirement for Regulation 33 independent visitors to have previous experience and knowledge of LAC.  It should be considered that this is a skilled position and the qualification level/knowledge level should reflect this.  It is important that they are able to relate to vulnerable children’s difficulties and has a level of empathy towards them with the ability to build positive relationships with staff, children, authorities and other statutory agencies.  It is also important that they have knowledge and experience for children with behavioural, learning or physical disabilities and how to communicate with them effectively. Their suitability for the post should be checked via DBS or police vetting and they should definitely understand the strict confidentialities involved in such a role and also be trained in child protection.   \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAction plans that result following Regulation 33 monitoring if there are any adjustments or additions to services that are required and that these are followed up within an agreed timeframe.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA definition from the DfE of sexual exploitation and what this definition would encompass.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA mechanism put into place so that established children’s homes may be moved to other nearby locations should the area that they are in decline and become unsafe or “high risk” to the children residing there.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn regard to independent fostering, we would suggest that consideration is given to LACs leaving foster care in line with the proposed changes for those leaving homes, including those entering support service accommodations; there is a need for an obligatory risk assessment about these types of decisions. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe holders of information on residential children’s homes should be able to share location details and consider this to be necessary information under data protection legislation when dealing with statutory agencies.\n&#xa0;\nWhether the DfE’s proposed reforms to the regulations of residential children’s homes are appropriate and sufficient:&#xa0;\nWe agree in principle that the proposed reforms to the regulations are appropriate; they are welcomed amendments and additions that have been made, particularly regarding out of area placements and risk assessments that will take into consideration the wider socio-economic environment in which the residential home is located.  It is paramount that the safeguarding and welfare of children is a priority and that there are robust measures in place to keep them safe from harm and ensure their life chances.  \n&#xa0;\nThere is not sufficient information given as to how the proposed amendments and additions to the regulations are to be monitored and what penalties will be put into place for those who do not adhere to the legislation.  In Thanet we have found that despite these regulations and the current rules stating a child should be placed no more than twenty miles away from their responsible home authority; we are concerned as to whether the London boroughs are being comprehensive enough in their assessment and rationale when they are placing LAC out of area.  \n&#xa0;\nWe also do not feel that the proposed reforms are sufficient in relation to the involvement of District Councils in two tier authority areas.  Thanet District Council is not responsible for Children’s Services and therefore is more often than not left out of the loop when vulnerable children and young people are placed in the District.  Given the complex and high risk issues that are within many of our most deprived wards where the children’s homes tend to be located, there needs to be a greater liaison and opportunity to input for the District authorities.  There have been occasions in which County are unaware of other serious issues within Thanet and have agreed to the placement of children in highly unsuitable areas due to a lack of communication or acknowledgement of the information that the District Council may hold.  There are also incidences of out of area children being placed in the area that County Children’s Services are not aware of due to it being an independent children’s home and we have only been made aware of their existence ourselves via a child protection concern made to one of our staff members about the home by one of these children.  When placing vulnerable children it is vitally important that \nall\n agencies serving the area have the opportunity to feed information into the risk assessment of a home and are able to provide their own knowledge of any issues or potential issues within the locality.  It is also important that the background of the children already residing at a home is taken into account within risk assessments.  Due to the placement of some out of area LAC into our most deprived, high risk communities there have been increasing problems regarding child sexual exploitation and missing children.   \n&#xa0;\nWhether the reforms are likely to prove effective or further measures are needed:&#xa0;Providing the amendments are enforced and monitored and that definitive timeframes are given within the regulations, we are hopeful that this will improve the collaboration between placing authorities and hosting authorities in conjunction with other statutory agencies.  For us this will only be the case if District authorities are given the opportunity to be part of the consultation with homes due to the different ground level knowledge of their localities that County level authorities will not be able to provide.  \n&#xa0;\nThere have been many occasions where children have not had any contact with their social worker because the journey from the responsible authority is unmanageable.  Responsible authorities also need to consider the resource implications upon host authorities if there are a significant numbers of LACs already in an area or if the children they are placing have complex issues that require a variety of support services\n \n.    \n&#xa0;\nWe also feel that fostering services should be subject to the same stringencies upon their services as children’s homes are, particularly regarding safeguarding, risk assessments of placements and independent monitoring.  As well as the issues that we have due to out of area placements, Thanet also has high numbers of independent fostering services and those that are classed as “support services” – there needs to be greater legislation put in place to ensure that these services are regulated and monitored. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n"
