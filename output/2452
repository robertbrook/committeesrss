defaultGentoo welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Work and Pensions Committee inquiry into support for housing costs in the reformed welfare system. 
defaultGentoo Group comprises a range of companies including three registered providers, construction, development
default and manufacturing companies and is based in Sunderland. 
default&#xa0;defaultOur response will first of all make a general statement on welfar
defaulte reform and will then address 
defaultthe Inquiry’s specific questions in turn.

defaultSummary of Key Points
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principle of reducing the 
defaultwelfare cost and getting people into work is laudable, however welfare reform is adversely affecting many of the most vulnerable in society without there being a viable work or income alternative in place.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany people affected by the under occupancy 
defaultcharge cannot move or if they do so it will be likely to be both disruptive for them and costly to the tax payer.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany landlords are putting a huge resource effort into assisting those affected by welfare changes. This is generating additional hidden cost
defaults however outwith the DWP projected savings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe direct payment element of universal credit is likely to cause major additional hardship and a spike in household debt for vulnerable people. The direct payment element
default of housing benefit 
defaultshould therefore be
default urgently reviewed.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2.0default              defaultGeneral Commentsdefault&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultWelfare Reform is a major issue for customers, landlords and wider society and we recognised this soon after the coalition Government came to power. Fundamentally it is difficult to argue against the tenet 
defaultthat it is not good for large sections of society to be wholly dependent on benefit. More than a quarter of all Government spending now goes on welfare which again cannot be a sustainable position. Equally however, for welfare reform to function effectivel
defaulty it needs the viable alternative to welfare of a vibrant and functioning economy into which formerly workless and benefit dependent households can enter. We have a fundamental problem therefore with the pace and impact of welfare reform in that punitive f
defaultinancial measures will be applied to a large section of society without a viable work alternative being in place. In the context of this inquiry, there will therefore be a fundamental impact on claimants in terms of putting at risk some of the most vulnera
defaultble people 
defaultin 
defaultsociety. 
defaultW
defaulte would 
defaulttherefore 
defaulturge the Government to re-think the timing and severity of welfare reform until such time as the economy is in a better state to accommodate it. 
defaultIn addition to impacts on households t
defaulthere will also be impacts on la
defaultndlords as they seek to deliver their objectives within an environment of increased service requirement versus i
defaultncreased income collection risk and this will be developed further as a theme in this response.
default  
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultHaving made these points however, Gentoo 
defaultis continuing to address this issue in a robust and focussed manner in order to minimise the impacts both to tenants and to the Group’s income streams. We will continue to prepare for future implementation of Universal Credit on the assumption that the int
defaultended changes and associated  timescales will go ahead as planned. Our response will cover many of the measures that we are putting in place to deal with these changes.

default3.1
default              
defaultWithin Gentoo we spent a considerable amount of time 
defaultand 
defaulteffort from the first soundings of welfare reform to assess the implications for both tenants and the land
defaultlord functions of the Group. Initial research by the University of Cambridge commissioned by ourselves and a consortium of registered providers under the banner of the Housing Futures Network 
default(
defaultincluding
default Gentoo
default, Riverside, Affinity Sutton and Places for Peo

default)
default in early 2012 came up with a number of initial findings:

default3.2
default              
defaultIn addition to the above findings
default,
default further research wit
defaulthin Gentoo in early 2013 
defaultrevealed the fo
defaultllowing amongst our own tenants -
default 4,384 of which  would be affected by the under occupancy charge:
default&#xa0;

default identified a household member with a disability  
default789 – 
default(

default)
default we
defaultre identified by an officer as having a potential vulnerability.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as the under occupancy charge, the Gentoo internal research into welfare reform identified impacts around the non dependent charge, be
defaultnefit cap, universal credit (
defaultin particular direc
defaultt payments
default)
default, service charges and council tax. In addition to modelling the internal impacts of these changes wider research conducted by the local authority identified that by 2014/15 there would be a reduction 
defaultin benefits across the City of 
default£54 million wi
defaultth associated impacts on households already at the lower end of the income scale.  
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultFaced with this mounting challenge
default,
default Gentoo therefore embarked on a programme of interventions to try and address the potential impacts of the welfare reform changes. T
defaulthese are summarised as follows.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultSo far we have seen an increase in the uptake of under occupancy moves 
defaultwith 81
default tenants having moved 
defaultas priority direct allocations and a further 89 tenants having mutually exchanged 
default 
defaultfor under occupancy reasons over the 
default4 month period April to
default July 2013. Whilst these figures
default 
defaultare not yet at a level whereby large numbers of people are moving, 
defaultthis is 
defaultnevertheless, 
defaultincreasing. In addition, we do not 
defaulthave sufficient properties coming available to allow a significant 
defaultnumber of
default 
defaultadditional 
defaultmoves to take place.
default This is therefore likely to add pressure on the allocations system as requests for under occupancy related moves inevitably increase. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultArrears have also started to increa
defaultse and the latest summary figures are that we 
defaulthave 1,940 customers who are under occupying and in arrears.
default&#xa0;
default Of the 1,940 customers; 900 were already in arrears pre under occupancy changes so effectively 1,000 have gone into arrears since the changes were implemented.
default&#xa0;
default 1,653 have increased their arrear
defaults (by £179,569) and 287 have reduced (by £44,299). The Group therefore has had an increase in arre
defaultars due to bedroom tax of £135,
default270.
default 
defaultWhilst significant, 
defaultthis has not been 
defaulta spike increase and 
defaultis more of an emerging trend
default.  A
defaultnecdotal evidence from 
defaultfront li
defaultne 
defaultstaff is indicating that this is due to increasing financial pressure on tenants which includes rising fuel, food and council tax contributions as well as welfare changes. 
defaultWe are seriously concerned that as the winter approaches and fuel costs rise furt
defaulther, coupled with the financial pressure of Christmas, many tenants will face severe hardship and vulnerability to debt in the coming months.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultFrom
default an organisational perspective, 
defaultwe are 
defaulttaking a view that welfare reform is a high strategic priority and
default services have therefore been adjusted to pri
defaultoritise welfare reform impacts before implementation rather than as a response to it. 
defaultWe have 
defaultalso 
defaultentered into discussion and briefings with local judges to inform them of the likely impacts of welfare reform a
defaultnd the potential for 
defaultan increase in 
defaultcourt cases 
defaultdue to arrears recovery
default. 
defaultWe are 
defaultoffering significantly more support a
defaultnd 
defaultadopting an 
defaultearly intervention role in terms of offering welfare and debt advice
default with a view to minimising court action due to arrears.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default7
default              
defaultIn summary, in terms of our approach to tenants, we feel we are implementing a wide range of interventions and service changes designed to counter the housing impacts of welfare reform as they currently stand. We do have further concerns however over 
defaultthe implementation of 
defaultdirect payments within Universal Credit
default and these will be dealt with in paragraph 5
default. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.0default              defaultThe implications of the changes to landlordsdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultWithin the initial assessment and modelling of welfare reform changes and the implications 
defaultfor landlords
default,
default a number of worst case scenario tests were explored within the Group. These covered the following areas of potential risk and financial exposures:
default&#xa0;
defaultCategorydefaultWorst case exposure £   defaultNon dependent deductions

defaulthttp://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/direct-payment-demo-figures.pdf
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultWithin these tests it became clear that there were material risk exposures around the under occupancy charge (if none of the reduction in benefit were subsequently met by tenants) and 
defaultUniversal Credit direct payments (working on the basis of the worst performing direct payment pilot
default which at the time of modelling was 88% - most recent worst performance is 91%
default)
default. So far the rent collection rates around under occupancy have not materialise
defaultd to any where near this level. We believe this is primarily due to a significant change in systems and processes for income management coupled with internal re-alignment of resource to address under occupancy charge impacts. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultOf far greater concern w
defaultill be the direct pa
defaultyment of housing costs through Universal C
defaultredit. This will have a far more widespread impact – we estimate around 9,400 households within Gentoo - and is difficult to predict in terms of impact. 
defaultWe
default accept the principle of switch
defaultback if 
defaultan arrears level is triggered
default. T
defaulthis could still allow 2-3 months of arrears to accrue 
defaulthowever 
defaultbefore a direct payment is stopped and even then it may only be a temporary switchback. 
default The reality of increased cost exposure is that landlords will have to re-
defaultadjust business plans to accommodate income loss. We accept that 
defaultit 
defaultis up to the landlord
default 
defaultas to 
defaulthow
default those costs will be allocated
default, however it is inevitable that some impact on development programme will be felt 
defaultin terms of available resource for cross subs
defaultidy, 
defaultparticularly when further hidden cost
defaults
default are factored in. e.g. costs of void repair and turnaround, increased court costs and allocation costs
default, increased aids and adaptation co
defaultsts
default.
default We are also further aware that even with the mitigation systems we have 
defaultput in place (discussed in paragraph 3.3) we may need to allocate more resource again to address the issues of direct payment and income management.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultAs a landlord we have also looked at the further impacts of under occupancy and in particular impacts 
defaulton tenants and landlords together with a critique of the overall under occupancy model and how it has been designed.
default 
defaultIn a separate piece of research, we are currently assessing the likely level of 
defaultsavings (to Government) generated by the under-occupation penalty, working with 3 other social landlords -  Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and Wigan and Leigh Housing - with support f
defaultrom the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York). This research is indicating that the proposed savings by DWP may have been significantly over stated by between a quarter and a third. Our study further confirms the DWP’s own assessment that “uncerta
defaultinty about likely claimant and landlord responses to the introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” (DWP 2012 p13). The overstating of the savings levels must therefore 
defaultalso 
defaultb
defaulte countered by the actual impacts on landlords
default both of which combine to further undermine the assumptions of the under occupancy model. 
default&#xa0;

default.5
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultThis research 
defaultalso 
defaultcompliments work being undertaken by the National Housing Federation, considering indirect c
defaultosts
default, the likes of which are stated in paragraph
default 
default4.3
default which
default should be taken into account in an overall assessment of the financial impact of the policy. These include potential extra net costs including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
default              
defaultWe accept that research is still underway to accurately 
defaultquantify these additional costs.
default 
defaultHowever, we
default believe that the whole premise of the under occupancy case for achieving £930 million over 2 years should now be subjected to renewed scrutiny purely on cost saving grounds let alone the wider poverty and vulnerability aspects of this policy.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.0default              defaultTredefaultatment of housing costs within housing benefitdefault&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultDespite many tenants in previous research stating that they would prefer the option to have the housing element of universal credit paid direct to landlords 
default–
default 
default( see Inside Housing research summary  
defaulthttp://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/most-tenants-want-housing-benefit-paid-direct-to-landlord/6517756.article
default) there is 
defaulta still a direction of travel towards payment of the Universal Credit including the housing element direct to tenants. This may not seem significant to those policy makers who think that the transition from weekly or fortnightly payments to a monthly payme
defaultnt will be smooth. We have serious concerns that the initial transfer to arrears payments will cause a debt spike that many people will find impossible to 
defaultretrieve.
default We are not yet convinced that adequate transitionary mechanisms are in place to deal with t
defaulthis and the early experience of discretionary housing payment administration does not convince us that a debt spike can be avoided. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultFurthermore
default,
default we have serious concerns this may lead to reliance on pay day lenders which is bad enough, but may well lea
defaultd to reliance on illegal money lenders which can lead to horrendous circumstance
defaults
default for already vulnera
defaultble people
default, not of all of whom will be captured within DWP vulnerability assessments
default. If there is any lee
defaultway to further make this point in an advance of th
defaulte national roll out of Univ
defaultersal Credit we will continue t
defaulto stress it. This could have serious personal consequences for vulnerable people and can and should be avoided.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultFinally, within the latest report of the demonstration projects
default released in May 2013
default, levels of payments by tenants have varied from 91% to 97% with an average collection rate of 94%. (
defaulthttps://www.gov.uk/g
defaultovernment/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228925/direct-payment-demo-figures-may-2013.pdf
default)
default              
defaultContrast this with Gentoo collection rates of over 99% and this would represent a significant income risk to the Group. Whilst this would only affect around a third of our tenants it nevertheless would be a material risk to our operations. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultFor these rea
defaultsons we would therefore urge DWP to re-consider the direct payment element of housing costs within Universal Credit or at worst give tenants the options to switch to landlord payments if they choose to do so.
