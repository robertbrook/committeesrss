[[[Background]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire precautionary salts 3008 km out of 8960km.  34%b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Has a defined network of footways that are treated – when resources are available.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cycle tracks are not routinely treated except as part of our severe weather response.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite significant reduction in overall highways budgets the winter service has been protected as well as increased to take account of inflationary pressures.  The winter service is financed for 85 turnouts and 2 snow days which this winter results in a budget of £4.65m with an Adverse Weather Reserve Fund of £1m.  For the winter of 2012/2013 the budget was set at £4.57m with a final outturn of £6.53m which has been fully funded by the county council out of financial reserves.

[[[Resilience]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire, like most authorities, is prepared for and copes with severe winter weather as demonstrated during the winter of 2012/2013.  However an extreme winter event on the scale of 1963, with its prolonged low temperatures and heavy snowfall, would cause massive disruption especially to food distribution especially due to "just in time" stock distribution.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire continues to be heavily involved in nationally implementing the Quarmby Review by its chairmanship of the National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG).i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Following recommendations contained within the Quarmby Review the NWSRG has become a sub group of the UK Roads Board (UKRB)ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Through its chairmanship of the NWSRG Lincolnshire has instigated a fundamental review of national highway winter maintenance practices which has resulted in the implementation of a completely new national code.  Appendix H, the Winter Code, of Well Maintained Highways was issued on the 18th September 2013 as announced by Norman Baker the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire reviews its winter maintenance plan annually and takes into account changes to national good practice and continues to explore alternative de-icing products and processes.

[[[What lessons have been learned since the winter of 2009-]]]

[[[2010?]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A major learning point has been a realisation by the public and industry alike that local highway authorities cannot do everything on their own in times of severe winter weather and that they need community help.  i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire has engaged with all tiers of local government from District Authorities, Parish Councils and Community Groups.  ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All these groups have been encouraged to engage with Lincolnshire County Council on mutual aid and self-help arrangements, although there has only been a 25% take up by Parish Councils to this process.iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Public engagement has been encouraged especially on snow clearance of carriageways and footways following clarity on the legal situation contained within the Quarmby Review.iv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mutual aid arrangements are also in place with all the main hospitals in the county including accident and emergency centres.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Public expectations would also appear to be becoming more realistic during severe winter weather events.  This has been helped by a more realistic and pro-active response from both local and national radio and TV. c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Like many authorities Lincolnshire has engaged with the travelling public by the use of Gritter Twitter as the main way of disseminating overnight operations and issues.

[[[How well ]]]

[[[prepared]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire through its external partners has placed 29 new replacement gritters into the fleet over the last two years. b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire has increased its salt stock holdings at the start of winter season from 23,000 tonnes to 35,000 tonnes.i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This equates to 87 runs at 20gms dry (400 tonnes) which is the maximum treatment for snow or 175 runs at 15gms pre-wet (200 tonnes) the average for precautionary salting. ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It also aims to keep a minimum stock holding of 10,000 tonnes at any one time during the winter.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 25% of the county is now precautionary salted utilising Agricultural Bi Products (ABP's) in the pre-wetting process – a UK first.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many changes have taken place over the last few years but further changes are required but unfortunately these are outwith the powers of local authorities to implement such as :i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Derogation of certain rules and regulations so that winter gritting can take place more effectively.  This would include the relaxation of drivers hours regulations by making winter gritting and emergency activity.ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Derogation of 28 tonne vehicles for winter activities which would increase the number of haulage and construction vehicles that could be utilised in severe weather with slot in spreaders.iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Continue with the practice of allowing dedicated winter maintenance vehicles to use rebated fuel (Red Diesel) for winter operations.September 2013&#xa0;
