[normal]WIDER ECONOMIC BENEFITS[bold]The KMPG claim[bold]KPMG, acting for HS2 Ltd, claim that the 
[normal]“Y” 
[normal]network, connecting 
[normal]London to Birmingham and Manchester and Birmingham to Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds will generate £15bn per year in Wider Economic Benefits, the so called WEBs.
[normal] This extraordinary value is circa 15 times higher than the annual value implied by the 
[normal]£
[normal]13.3b
[normal]n discounted value claimed in the October 2013 Economic Case
[normal].
[normal]The WEBS[bold]All these WEBs
[normal], or nearly all, should be assigned to the generated or new trips since 
[normal]the other trips, and most of their associated WEBs, would arise in the absence of the scheme.
[normal]Source documentation suggests that the proposal is forecast to generate 
[normal]circa 
[normal]98,800 new trips per day.
[normal] 
[normal]Dividing the £15bn by the 9
[normal]8,8
[normal]00
[normal] 
[normal]and by the 300 effective days in the year provides £5
[normal]0
[normal]0 per trip, or £1,
[normal]0
[normal]00 for a round trip.  Multiplying the £5
[normal]0
[normal]0 
[normal]by
[normal] the 1,460 million trips carried by Network Rail in 2011/12
[normal] generates circa £
[normal]73
[normal]0
[normal] 
[normal]b
[normal]illio
[normal]n, a sum equal to half the nation’s GDP; clearly an impossibility, implying that the £15bn is wildly optimistic.
[normal]  
[normal]Alternatively the WEBs could be assigned to the gener
[normal]ated business and commuter trips alone.  
[normal]Sources
[normal] suggest these are to 
[normal]number circa 3
[normal]7
[normal],000 per day.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Dividing the £15bn by 3
[normal]7
[normal],000 and the 300 days in the year yields £1,
[normal]350
[normal], or £2,
[normal]70
[normal]0 for a round trip.  Multiplying the £1,
[normal]35
[normal]0 by the nation’s business plus 
[normal]commuting trips provides an absurd £1
[normal]4
[normal],
[normal]3
[normal]00 billion,
[normal] some ten times the nation’s actual GDP, illustrating again how ludicrous it is that anyone should ever believe that the proposal could generate WEBs worth £15bn per year.
[normal]Note particularly 
[normal]that (a) these
[normal] extraordinary WEBs are in excess of what would have arisen had the new passengers stayed in their offices or at home or gone elsewhere (b) that the new passengers are supposedly generated by reductions in journey times of 30 to 60 minutes
[normal] (c) pre-existing trips on the West Coast Main line should have WEBs substantially above, perhaps double, those of the new and marginal trips
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]That leaves HS2 Ltd to either (a) explain why a High Speed Rail trip, generated merely because a journey has be
[normal]en shortened somewhat, should provide vastly more benefits than any other journey on the rail network ever could – a task made doubly difficult because
[normal], as above, 
[normal]the benefits from a generated, or marginal, trip should be lower
[normal] 
[normal]than 
[normal](perhaps half) 
[normal]those as
[normal]sociated with a pre-existing trip or (b) to throw the analysis into the waste paper basket.

[normal]We would have preferred to use the latest data available

[normal].  We received

[normal]must be

[normal]E.g. (i) add carriages and expect passengers to wa

[normal]Those dubious items total

[normal], thereby destroying the “economic case
[normal]”.
[normal]K[bold]ey and hidden assumptions.[bold]E
[normal]mbedded within the a

[normal]ly
[normal]s
[normal]is 
[normal]are two key assumptions, namely
[normal]:
[normal](1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]GDP drives growth in demand
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This assumption is difficult to sustain when it is realised that GDP grew, in real terms, by 160% between the 1955 and 1995 but that 
[normal]rail use grew not at all.  The implication is that the extraordinary growth since1995 is due to the razzamatazz of privatisation, aided by vast subsidies from the public purse; nothing at all to do with GDP and not likely to be sustained..

[normal]A [bold]fundamental flaw.[bold]The analysis depends on the so 
[normal]called ‘Willingness to Pay Calculus’ 
[normal]developed 
[normal]by Professor Sugden of the University of Ea
[normal]st Anglia.  
[normal]That 
[normal]‘
[normal]calculus
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]enables the incremental fares
[normal], namely the 
[normal]HS2 fares minus those lost to HS2 by the rest of the ra
[normal]i
[normal]lway
[normal], 
[normal]to be subtracted from costs and for the difference to be 
[normal]compared with the benefits.  
[normal]The problem is that the theory reduce
[normal]s to the absurd when it is realised that changing the eco
[normal]nomic 
[normal]boundary of the scheme (a matter that can be done at the stroke of a pen) 
[normal]would
[normal] change
[normal] the incremental fares.  
[normal]E.g. if we a
[normal]ssume the rest of the railway is proper
[normal]l
[normal]y privatised 
[normal]then 
[normal]the increm
[normal]en
[normal]tal fairs rise to the full HS2 fares.  
[normal]Alternatively w
[normal]iden the boundary to capture losses suffered by the airlines and the increm
[normal]en
[normal]ta
[normal]l
[normal] fares are reduced
[normal].
[normal]T
[normal]he correct place to draw 
[normal]the 
[normal]boundary is round the nation as a whole, not the Gove
[normal]rnment as pretended
[normal] in this analysis
[normal].  When th
[normal]e bou
[normal]ndary is 
[normal]so widened 
[normal]the incremental fares fall to zero since every pound spent on the railway is a pound lost elsewhere.
[normal]Striking out the
[normal]se
[normal] fares would of course destroy the economic case for this scheme and for all railway
[normal] 
[normal]projects
[normal].
[normal]P[bold]enalties.[bold]Our view is that penalties should be imposed upon those who have led these studies, irresponsible as they are in all their detail
[normal] - putting tens of billions of P
[normal]ounds at risk. 
[normal]At the least nobody should ever again believe data produc
[normal]ed by ARUP, Atkins, HS2
[normal] Ltd
[normal], Greengauge or Network rail in connection with HS2, or any other railway project.  These people have
[normal], in our opinion,
[normal] shamelessly misrepresented this scheme so misleading the Government on a mammoth scale, a sentiment taken f
[normal]rom
[normal] Stewart Joy’s book, 
[normal]‘
[normal]The Train that ran Away
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]C[bold]onclusion.[bold]Against that background we can
[normal]vas 
[normal]for a more straight
[normal] 
[normal]forward approach, namely if it makes a financial loss, particularly if the loss is in the tens of billions, do not build it

[normal] The 13.3bn is the sum of the discounted values out to the year 2093.  It equates to circa £1 bn per year
[normal] if the WEBs are held constant in real terms
[normal] year to year
[normal].
[normal]. 
[normal]The Economic Assessment of January 2012 provides, at paragraph 3.2.1, 270,000 trips per day in and out of 
[normal]London
[normal] plus 110,000 inter-regional trips, a total of 380,000.  Table 12 of the October 2013 Economic case provides 26% of trips as new, or generated. 
[normal] Hence we have 98,800 generated.  £15bn divided by 98,800 and by 300 days provides £506 or £1,012 per round trip.  Note the 26% is higher than the 24% cited in Table 2 of the January 2012 assessment.
[normal]. 
[normal] The ORR stats provide 1,460 million network rail jou
[normal]rneys in 2011-12.  1,460 million times £500 
[normal](the supposedly WEB associated with each generated trip) 
[normal]provides £730 billion, roughly half the nation’s GDP
[normal].
[normal]. 
[normal] The Demand and Appraisal report for HS2 to the 
[normal]West Midlands
[normal], WS Atkins, April 2012, provides at,
[normal] paragraph 6.4.8, that 30% of trips are business trips.  We have from note 1 above 98,800 generated trips.  Hence there are likely to be 98,800 x 0.3 = 29,640 
[normal]generated[bold] business trips.

[normal]able 0407
[normal] of the

[normal]S
[normal]urvey
[normal] provides 5% of trips purposes
[normal] as commuting and 19% as business for journey lengths between 100 and 150 miles, and 3% and 19% respectively for lengths between 150 and 250 miles.  That suggests that business plus commuter trips via HS2 may amount to the business trips plus 25%, providin
[normal]g 37,050. 
[normal]. 
[normal] National Travel Survey
[normal], NTS, 
[normal]data provides 177 commuter trips and business trips per head by all modes in 2012
[normal].  Multiplying by the population of 60 million and by the £1,350 per generated business plus commuter trip estimated above provide
[normal]s an absurd £14,300 billion.
[normal]. 
[normal] The classical argument is that the first trip to be generated by a reduction in journey time, or cost, enjoys the same benefit as do pre-existing trips but that the last trip so attracted is entirely marginal and hence takes no benefit from the cost reduc
[normal]tion.  Hence the benefit assigned to each generated trips is typically half that assigned to each pre-existing trip.  This argument may apply equally to the WEBs..
