[normal]Could we please place on record the support of this organisation, (Bradford HF Walking and Social Club), for the 2 clauses proposed by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lane Alliance, to be included in the above Bill, that is:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.   All unsealed Byways Open to all Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.   When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.[bold]&#xa0;
