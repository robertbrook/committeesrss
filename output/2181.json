"&#xa0;\nUK Chamber of Shipping – Written evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;The UK Chamber of Shipping is the trade association and voice for the UK shipping industry, representing ships of more than 28 million gross tons from 140 members from across the maritime sector.\n&#xa0;\nGeneral principles&#xa0;The UK Chamber of Shipping supports the De-regulation Bill and was happy to engage positively with the Government’s Red Tape Challenge.  We share, absolutely, the Government’s desire to reduce the burden on industry that regulation can represent.  Indeed, we provided a ‘Red Tape Challenge champion’ to work with the Department for Transport on this common aim. What is needed – especially in shipping – is a process that projects clarity, is proportional to the objectives of the regulation in question, is practical in its implementation, and recognises the particularities of the shipping sector.  \n&#xa0;\nWhile espousing ‘better regulation’ or ‘de-regulation’ principles, in many areas the shipping sector nevertheless needs regulation.  Shipping cannot operate without complying with the standards set internationally on a global basis through such organisations as the UN’s International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization.  For nearly a century, regulations have been developed and established governing shipping specifically, which enable ships to operate between different countries across the world.  Indeed, the shipping industry has even accepted – together with governments – that this law can be applied by the authorities of one country on units belonging to another country, subject to specific rules (ie port state control).  \n&#xa0;\nThe existence of this substantial body of international legislation creates a strong encouragement to individual countries tempted to establish their own unilateral requirements not to do so.  Without a common, globally accepted, set of standards, shipping would be faced with massive confusion and administrative burdens from having to meet a myriad of different sets of regulations in different legal structures and languages.\n&#xa0;\nFor this reason, much of the regulatory agenda for shipping in individual states is regarded by industry as positive because it stems from legislation which has been promulgated – often with the full involvement and support of its own government – by consensus in international organisations. This is true in the UK as elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK Chamber considers that, in this, Government should seek as far as possible to minimise the burdens on industry and to set in place processes which will pre-empt and avoid the need for de-regulation or ‘better regulation’ exercises in the future.  Specifically, the industry has supported the Government’s endeavours to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSpecific comments&#xa0;&#xa0;We support the logic of this change, which largely brings the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) into line with the Merchant Shipping (Accident Reporting &amp; Investigation) Regulations 2012.\n&#xa0;\n These were outlined in Marine Guidance Note No. 458 issued last year and no concerns have been raised on this particular issue.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe support this new power for the reasons given in the General Principles above.  It will simplify the adoption of generally accepted international instruments and avoid the bureaucracy and potential for confusion that can arise from trying to reproduce the original intention in separate national legislation.  It will have the advantage of allowing the UK to accede to the instruments in question more rapidly where that is desired and of allowing the legislation to be updated fully as time passes and the original international instruments are subject to amendments.  It usefully also allows for any changes to be subject to overview and tacit acceptance or active modification by Her Majesty’s Government, as it may decide on each occasion.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK Chamber would be happy to expand on this reasoning if that would be helpful.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is an accepted principle in both international and national maritime legislation that all new regulations must be subject to an economic impact and cost-benefit analysis, in order to ensure that there is an explicit and demonstrated need for the legislation which is supported by clear evidence of the cost and benefit.  The UK Chamber therefore supports a specific reference in this context to ‘the desirability of promoting economic growth’ and taking action which is proportionate.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe UK Chamber of Shipping \n16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
