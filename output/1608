[normal]Car owners are privileg
[normal]ed that they do not have to plan their 
[normal]day around how they are going to get to their venue. Usually the people who do not have their own transport have the weakest voice 
[normal]in council affairs, and seldom have the knowledge or ability to 
[normal]suggest a bus service 
[normal]is introduced.
[normal] 
[normal]Often
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]orse than this is when a service which has been running for a year or more and is suddenly cut because it is no longer viable. 
[normal]The passengers which did use the service are 
[normal]left with little option of how to resume their 
[normal]normal life and
[normal] public service loses 
[normal]it’s
[normal] credibility. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]It is easy to run a service around connecting villages which then leads to a major town 
[normal]and hope that anyone who wishes to use this facility can get to a bus stop near to where they live. It is more difficult to
[normal] 
[normal]serve a community which is off the beaten track but still have the same needs as everyone else. 
[normal]One of our
[normal] local villages has
[normal] fought vigilantly 
[normal]to keep their once a week service into the local town. This village was fortunate that it had a go
[normal]od voice in their community 
[normal]and a strong spirit to see it through. Other bus 
[normal]cuts have not been so lucky. The people who use this once a week service are mainly concession holders 
[normal]therefore little money is collected, however it is well 
[normal]used and they are ab
[normal]le to make appointments etc around the time they have in town. 
[normal]There is a lack of low floor,
[normal] easy accessible buses on t
[normal]he market which have
[normal] 16seats or less. It is quite easy to supply a bus with only 16sts 
[normal]but it probably won’t have the features which are
[normal] necessary for disabled access or pushchairs etc. 
[normal]The cost of buying these buses are usually about the same as bigger 28seat
[normal] 
[normal]Plaxton
[normal] Darts etc. Therefore it is more viable for the operator to purchase a larger bus and 
[normal]use it on a more profitable
[normal] busy route
[normal]. 
[normal]Government may think about helping operators to source and purchase these type of buses and 
[normal]use them on less profitable routes which serve smaller communities?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]The most important factor of public transport is reliability. The bus service needs to be 
[normal]planned so that connections can be made, doctor’s surgeries etc. are accessible and that there is a return service available. Timetables should be readily available, on bus stops as well as on the buses.
[normal]It is better to not introduce a service than to do s
[normal]o then cut it after a short time. 
[normal]The travelling public need to be certain the bus is running before making preparations to use it
[normal] . Any change to timetables etc need to be planned well in advance and advertised as such. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]In our area there has been so 
[normal]many cuts in local government 
[normal]projects that there is little hope left that a service such as a new local bus route may be available. 
[normal]If it was suggested to local P
[normal]arish Councils
[normal] meetings then an answer from local opinion could be sought
[normal]. This 
[normal]would be especially appreciated 
[normal]as it seems that many of these rural villages are grown in size but not in amenities.
[normal]We operate services both in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] and find there is a difference in usage of the travelling passengers. In 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] 
[normal]the distances are not great 
[normal]yet people seem to use the buses far more than in 
[normal]England
[normal]. Times of the buses are more frequent and 
[normal]both passengers and the buses are more reliable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. People in isolated communities should not be expected to rely on taxis 
[normal]or 
[normal]community transport for their daily needs. 
[normal]Taxis
[normal] are only available at times which suit the operator and this may not be the time the passenger is 
[normal]wanting 
[normal]to travel. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Funding local tra
[normal]nsport is easy where there is knowledge that the bus route will be u
[normal]sed and viable. Routes which are new and maybe 
[normal]used only occasionally are a big risk, not just for the person funding the bus but also for the travelling passenger who may find it 
[normal]very useful and then fall into the trap of starting to depend on it. 
[normal]In 
[normal]Sco
[normal]tland
[normal] some of our services are connecting from villages to a main bus rout
[normal]e and this works well for the passenger and the council as there is no need to continue the through journey with two buses. 
[normal]We have villages around our
[normal] area which are more populated
[normal] in the summer as there are caravan sites and hotels
[normal] nearby
[normal]. A route which serves the local community all year and yet may only need subsidising in the winter 
[normal]woul
[normal]d be feasible and become a reliable and used 
[normal]service. 
[normal]The introduction of the free concessi
[normal]onary fare travel has 
[normal]had a detrimental effect on public transport in isolated communities. The formula which
[normal] dictates reimbursements to the operator works well in built up communities 
[normal]where there are many people travelling, 
[normal]eg
[normal] town services. However in ru
[normal]ral areas where there are few passengers and the majority are concessionary pass holders 
[normal]there is little incentive for an operator to introduce a new service as the fares taken will only equate to about 33% of the appropriate fare
[normal]. This coupled with the decreasing 
[normal]reimbursement 
[normal]of fuel duty rebate is a major factor of
[normal] why
[normal] fewer services
[normal] are
[normal] being 
[normal] 
[normal]introduced or even 
[normal]speculated.
[normal]A route which is planned, 
[normal]advertised and activated then becomes used and relied on. It is then cut for th
[normal]e winter which immediately loses credibility 
[normal]for the people who need it most.
