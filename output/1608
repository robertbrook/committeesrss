defaultCar owners are privileg
defaulted that they do not have to plan their 
defaultday around how they are going to get to their venue. Usually the people who do not have their own transport have the weakest voice 
defaultin council affairs, and seldom have the knowledge or ability to 
defaultsuggest a bus service 
defaultis introduced.
default 
defaultOften
default 
defaultw
defaultorse than this is when a service which has been running for a year or more and is suddenly cut because it is no longer viable. 
defaultThe passengers which did use the service are 
defaultleft with little option of how to resume their 
defaultnormal life and
default public service loses 
defaultit’s
default credibility. 
default&#xa0;
default2. 
defaultIt is easy to run a service around connecting villages which then leads to a major town 
defaultand hope that anyone who wishes to use this facility can get to a bus stop near to where they live. It is more difficult to
default 
defaultserve a community which is off the beaten track but still have the same needs as everyone else. 
defaultOne of our
default local villages has
default fought vigilantly 
defaultto keep their once a week service into the local town. This village was fortunate that it had a go
defaultod voice in their community 
defaultand a strong spirit to see it through. Other bus 
defaultcuts have not been so lucky. The people who use this once a week service are mainly concession holders 
defaulttherefore little money is collected, however it is well 
defaultused and they are ab
defaultle to make appointments etc around the time they have in town. 
defaultThere is a lack of low floor,
default easy accessible buses on t
defaulthe market which have
default 16seats or less. It is quite easy to supply a bus with only 16sts 
defaultbut it probably won’t have the features which are
default necessary for disabled access or pushchairs etc. 
defaultThe cost of buying these buses are usually about the same as bigger 28seat
default 
defaultPlaxton
default Darts etc. Therefore it is more viable for the operator to purchase a larger bus and 
defaultuse it on a more profitable
default busy route
default. 
defaultGovernment may think about helping operators to source and purchase these type of buses and 
defaultuse them on less profitable routes which serve smaller communities?
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultThe most important factor of public transport is reliability. The bus service needs to be 
defaultplanned so that connections can be made, doctor’s surgeries etc. are accessible and that there is a return service available. Timetables should be readily available, on bus stops as well as on the buses.
defaultIt is better to not introduce a service than to do s
defaulto then cut it after a short time. 
defaultThe travelling public need to be certain the bus is running before making preparations to use it
default . Any change to timetables etc need to be planned well in advance and advertised as such. 
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultIn our area there has been so 
defaultmany cuts in local government 
defaultprojects that there is little hope left that a service such as a new local bus route may be available. 
defaultIf it was suggested to local P
defaultarish Councils
default meetings then an answer from local opinion could be sought
default. This 
defaultwould be especially appreciated 
defaultas it seems that many of these rural villages are grown in size but not in amenities.
defaultWe operate services both in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultScotland
default and find there is a difference in usage of the travelling passengers. In 
defaultScotland
default 
defaultthe distances are not great 
defaultyet people seem to use the buses far more than in 
defaultEngland
default. Times of the buses are more frequent and 
defaultboth passengers and the buses are more reliable. 
default&#xa0;
default5. People in isolated communities should not be expected to rely on taxis 
defaultor 
defaultcommunity transport for their daily needs. 
defaultTaxis
default are only available at times which suit the operator and this may not be the time the passenger is 
defaultwanting 
defaultto travel. 
default&#xa0;
default6. Funding local tra
defaultnsport is easy where there is knowledge that the bus route will be u
defaultsed and viable. Routes which are new and maybe 
defaultused only occasionally are a big risk, not just for the person funding the bus but also for the travelling passenger who may find it 
defaultvery useful and then fall into the trap of starting to depend on it. 
defaultIn 
defaultSco
defaulttland
default some of our services are connecting from villages to a main bus rout
defaulte and this works well for the passenger and the council as there is no need to continue the through journey with two buses. 
defaultWe have villages around our
default area which are more populated
default in the summer as there are caravan sites and hotels
default nearby
default. A route which serves the local community all year and yet may only need subsidising in the winter 
defaultwoul
defaultd be feasible and become a reliable and used 
defaultservice. 
defaultThe introduction of the free concessi
defaultonary fare travel has 
defaulthad a detrimental effect on public transport in isolated communities. The formula which
default dictates reimbursements to the operator works well in built up communities 
defaultwhere there are many people travelling, 
defaulteg
default town services. However in ru
defaultral areas where there are few passengers and the majority are concessionary pass holders 
defaultthere is little incentive for an operator to introduce a new service as the fares taken will only equate to about 33% of the appropriate fare
default. This coupled with the decreasing 
defaultreimbursement 
defaultof fuel duty rebate is a major factor of
default why
default fewer services
default are
default being 
default 
defaultintroduced or even 
defaultspeculated.
defaultA route which is planned, 
defaultadvertised and activated then becomes used and relied on. It is then cut for th
defaulte winter which immediately loses credibility 
defaultfor the people who need it most.
