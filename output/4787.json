"&#xa0;\nFurther written evidence from Chris Hobbs [CST0043]&#xa0;Please note this is my second evidence submission to the Public Administration Select Committee which I have compiled in relation to the \nfurther hearing in relation to \nalleged crime\n figure manipulation by police\n. I understand that this hearing will be \nheld on the 8\nth\n of January 2014 during which\n evidence will be heard from Stephen \nGreenhalgh\n, \nSir \nBernard Hogan-Howe, Tom Winsor and Olivia \nPinkney\n. \n \nI hope this submission will be available to PASC members before the hearing as it anticipates some of the \nassertions that will be made by those appearing before it and provides additional disturbing information obtained from serving front line officers.\nAs the hearing progresses \nthere will be reassurances \nfrom the Met representatives that\n wi\nll doubtless involv\ne \nphrases which will include the words ‘robust’, \n‘rigorous, \n‘integrity’ and \n‘\ncrime registrar.\n’\n Stephen \nGreenhalgh\n will probably repeat the assertion that his own auditors will be ‘looking at the books’ to determine that\n the recording of crime is \naccurate. \nRank and file officers know only too well that the ‘devil lies in the detail’ and that only by examining the minutiae in the body of the crime reports, will it be possible to detect dubious crime recording. This will vary from borough to borough within th\ne Met and quite possible from supervisor to supervisor. Those, such as outside auditors, not familiar with police parlance, procedures and the law will not be able to detect such nuances.\nThose in the best position to articulate dubious practices are front\n line rank and file officers who take reports from the public. \nMost will now not even attempt to ‘buck the system’ and will simply record the entry as they know the crime managers will wish it to be recorded. Thus robbery will frequently be recorded as the\nft person unless the circumstances make it impracticable to do so. \nThis would be the case in the event of serious injury or clear evidence of a weapon\n,\n such as a knife\n,\n being used. \nThe most recent Met staff \nsatisfaction \nsurvey,\n as the Commissioner would h\nave to agree, shows an alarming lack of confidence by rank \nand file\n \nofficers in\n Met ACPO ranked management. The figures would probably be worse were it not for the fact that many officers do not trust the ‘guaranteed anonymity’ of such surveys. Similar res\nults can be seen in respect of many other UK forces.\nEven allowing f\nor doubts by officers in relati\non to\n anonymity, it would perhaps be a\nn interesting exercise for the Met C\nommissioner \nor MOPAC \nto conduct an \nonline independent survey \namongst \nfront line rank and file officers as to a) whether they believe crime figures are manipulated b) their ‘evidence’ for such a belief. \nLast year, whilst in a \nLondon \np\nound shop, I became aware of a commotion and realised that a young male was complaining tha\nt his phone had been stolen by stealth. One of the two suspects had left the store with the phone. The young male attempted to detain the other and was punched in the face causing a visible bleeding wound. I saw the suspect flee the shop as I \nwas \ntelephoni\nng police. \nI drove round in a police vehicle looking for the second suspect without success. I was i\nnformed by the officer \nthat the matter would be recorded as a \n‘\ntheft and assault\n’\n rather than the more \nserious robbery\n. I later checked the definition of r\nobbery together with several ‘case stated’ \nhearings \nand there is no doubt that this incident comfortably comes within the robbery definition. \nP\nresumably this ‘theft and assault’ would be buried within the ‘theft other’ figures rather than \namongst those ca\nrrying \nthe ‘theft person’ definition.\n It is ‘theft person’ category \nhowever \nwhere front line office\nrs\n allege many robbery offences are placed. As can be seen\n from Attachment 1\n,\n there were nearly 50,000 \n‘\ntheft person\n’\n reports and given the different variations in policy amongst boroughs and individuals, these would have to be examined in depth to separate \nrobbery offences from \nthe genuine theft p\nersons, \ni.e.\n ‘phone \nsnatches’ and\n \npick pocketing/’dipping’ \noffences,\n which\n is another strand of ‘theft person\n;\n’ \nthat is of course \nwhere such thefts are not entered into ‘property lost in the street’ records. \nTo a non police auditor, it may well be that placing crimes, such as the one I partially witnessed, into the lesser categ\nory, would be quite acceptable. \nRecently\n I spoke to two officers who have\n spent some years on a local plain clothes squad dealing with street robberies.  \nThey were quite used to recording robberies as lesser offences but pointe\nd out that when a suspect fo\nr a robbery offence\n,\n \nwhich would\n normally be reported as a theft person or theft and assault, was actually arrested at or near the scene, then the offence would be recorded as a robbery as it would show a \nmore serious \nrobbery clear up. \nThe next piece of i\nnformation from the officers stretched my credulity to the limit. The fact that one officer is a personal friend who joined the Met just weeks before me is the only reason why I feel confident \nto include it\n as fact. \nIt would seem that if a suspect is arre\nsted for a street robbery then not only is the individual robbed shown as the victim, but also included are his/her companions or other witnesses in close proximity to the incident, thus this would show as two, three, four robbery ‘clear ups’ as opposed to\n one. \nThis would not apply where \nthe suspect was not apprehended. T\nhe\n individual robbed would be shown as the only victim with the possibility that the robbery could be recorded as a theft person or theft assault. \n Witnesses would not be included as victi\nms. \nSadly, such is the climate of fear within the Met that exists in relation to any officer who be considered a ‘whistleblower\n,\n’ I am unable to name even the borough \nwhere \nthese of\nficers perform duty \nin case this leads to their identification. \nWhilst ACPO ranked officers and PCC’s will officially ‘deplore’ any crime figure manipulation and \nwhereas \nthe Home office have ‘abolished’ targets, huge pressure exists on Met borough commanders \nof Chief Superintendent rank \nto reduce crime figures. \nTales \nof ‘wire type’ grilling administered by certain known ACPO officers \nabound throughout the Met and \nare far too common to be\n \ndismissed as \n‘Chinese whispers.’ Chief Superintendent’s have been reduced to tears and indeed removed from their post\ns\n for failing to\n bring those figures down. Bewildered officers at one west London borough came under the command of th\nree Chief Superintendents during a period of \nseveral weeks\n.\nThis inevitably leads to downward pressure by Chief Superintendents upon their police supervis\nory managers \nwho themselves feel that it is incumbent upon them to reduce crime figures if they wish to remain in post and/or advance their careers.\nThe question of ‘\nwhistleblowing\n’ and indeed any conscientious form of \ndissent,\n as illustrated by the previo\nus \nPASC hearing\n,\n is clearly linked to the manipulation of crime figures. The assertion in the \nMet’s\n recently\n issued code of conduct in respect of pro\ntection of \nwhistleblowers\n has been\n greeted with derision by rank and file officers.\nI have absolutely no do\nubt that if the question of ‘\nwhistleblowing\n’ was added to any crime figure manipulation survey, as described above, more that 90% of rank and file officers would state that they would not have any faith in the syst\nem other than in the most obvious \ncases (m\noney being accepted from criminal elements in return for ‘favours’ or indeed money accepted from journalists). \nThe key question is how crime figure manipulation can be identified and dealt with given the fact that dubious practises have continued for deca\ndes. Using \n police officers or police staff as crime registrars, hiring independent auditors who are unfamiliar with the vagaries of police crime reporting  using police or PCC funds or even \nutilising \nHMIC staff again who in all probability will be equally\n unfamiliar with the above mentioned vagaries, will do little to inspire confidence.\nThe answer perhaps lies with those former and current officers who have previously given evidence of crime figure manipulation and together with those of ACPO rank who \nuse\n both overt and \ndubious \nfurtive\n methods to discourage whistleblowers whilst publically stating the opposite.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
