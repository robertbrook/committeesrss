[[[Supplementary written evidence from The Children’s Society]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Further to The Children’s Society’s written submission to this inquiry and following the oral evidence session on 27 October this note includes some additional information and recommendations for consideration of the Committee.

[[[Key recommendations]]]2.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The need for wider reform of the care system]]]2.1.1.              The proposed reforms address important issues of significant concern that were highlighted by the joint inquiry into children missing from care conducted by the APPG for runaway and missing children and adults and the APPG for looked after children and care leavers. 2.1.2.

[[[Recommendation:]]]

[[[ We believe that in order for these changes to be effective and to address the reasons why so many children experience a great number of unsuccessful placements, both in foster carer and children’s home]]]

[[[The need to improve access to advocacy services]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Legislation and statutory pieces of guidance on looked after children and care leavers require the provision of advocacy services to help children participate in the decision-making process. The APPG on looked after children and care leavers recently published a report about entitlements for looked after children and care leavers. The report highlighted that that very few looked after children and care leavers feel that they have all the information they need about their entitlements. Only 29% of children in care and 17% of care leavers feel that they have all the information they need. Many children are not told about their entitlement to advocacy support and not all local authorities are commissioning such services. Two pieces of guidance that relate to the provision of advocacy services locally – ‘National Advocacy Standards (2002) and Get it Sorted: Guidance on Providing Effective Advocacy Services for Children and Young People making a Complaint under the Children Act 1989’- are out of date and appear to be archived on the DFE website.2.2.3     The proposed reforms will be more effective if steps are taken to ensure that children’s needs are at the centre of the decisions made about their placements and that children’s wishes and feelings are taken into consideration when decisions are made, including through the support of an independent advocate. 2.2.4

[[[Children who run away or go missing from care]]]2.3.2               The police have been rolling out new definitions of ‘absent’ and ‘missing’ people since April 2013. We have expressed concerns that the implementation of the new definitions was not underpinned by an evaluation of how children classified as ‘absent’, including children running away from children’s home or foster care, will be safeguarded under the new definition of ‘absent’. The University of Portsmouth has recently published research looking at how children ‘classified’ as ‘absent have been safeguarded in police forces where the new definitions have been implemented.&#xa0;(

[[[f]]])2.3.3                The report highlights issues of concern which include that that risk assessments are not robust enough, the police do not routinely ask whether a child is on a child protection order and if they are vulnerable and, there is little involvement of Missing Persons Co-ordinators. The report also highlights the lack of training for call centre staff and other staff dealing with missing children around the signs of child sexual exploitation. 2.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;     The government has recently published a draft Anti- Slavery bill. We believe that the bill offers an opportunity to address the needs of trafficked children. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ support separated children and ensure that they have their voices heard in decisions that affect them in care and legal processes. ]]]

[[[They should ensure]]]

[[[ that these children are placed in appropriate placements that meet their needs.  ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1                             We welcome the proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes. We believe these reforms can contribute to making residential children’s homes safer places and improve protection measures for vulnerable children placed there, such as children who are at risk of child sexual exploitation and children who run away or go missing from care.3.2.                             The proposed reforms address important issues of significant concern that were highlighted by the joint inquiry into children missing from care conducted by the APPG for runaway and missing children and adults and the APPG for looked after children and care leavers. We believe that in order for these changes to be effective, they must form part of a more comprehensive programme of change that is focussed on improving support for children in care and underpinned by a wider programme of reform to improve placement stability for children in care and to ensure a greater focus on and scrutiny of how the needs of individual children are met.3.3.                We welcome the requirement for staff working in children’s homes to be adequately trained, but recommend that these proposals need to be strengthened further. Staff should be required to obtain qualifications and have adequate training around managing risks, dealing with challenging behaviour and listening to and communicating with children before they are recruited to work in children’s homes. 3.4.                The focus on children’s homes and children placed out of authority in children’s homes is welcome, but we believe that the reforms should be extended to cover children in foster placements, particularly out of authority placements. 3.5.                            It is important that Ofsted have appropriate oversight and monitoring of how the changes are implemented by local authorities through single looked after children and child protection inspection. 3.6.                            Children's wishes, views and experiences must have greater prominence in the proposed reforms through improved access to advocacy in statutory reviews and independent return interviews following running away episodes. 3.7.

[[[              ]]]

[[[              ]]]The specific needs of trafficked children are not adequately considered in these reforms. We believe that the government should implement changes to protect and safeguard these vulnerable children. They should do this by: establishing a national system of data collection on trafficked children; providing training to staff in residential care homes regarding the indicators of trafficking and how to support trafficked children; developing a system of independent trusted adults to support separated children and ensure that they have their voices heard in decisions that affect them in care and legal processes; and ensuring that these children are placed in appropriate placements that meet their needs.
