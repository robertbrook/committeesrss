              
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from[bold] [bold]Preseli Rural Transport Association and [bold]Capital Traffic Management Limited[bold] (TIC 057)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome the Committee’s interest in ensuring access to adequate passenger transport services by people in isolated communities where operating scheduled bus 
[normal]or waterborne 
[normal]service
[normal]s, say, 
[normal]would 
[normal]be uneconomic and 
[normal]rarely
[normal] justified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]In such areas, there are many who are prevented from participating fully in education, training, employment and social 
[normal]activity 
[normal]because they lack access to a motor vehicle.  This problem acutely affects the young, the elderly 
[normal]and disable
[normal]d people of all ages, denying them the contribution they could make to community life.
[normal] 
[normal] Those with mental health problems may have these exacerbated by isolation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Communications (telephone, cellphone
[normal], internet access, information
[normal]) may also 
[normal]be lacking
[normal] or 
[normal]of poor quality
[normal] in remote areas
[normal], creating issues of 
[normal]their
[normal] own, 
[normal]and 
[normal]with consequences for 
[normal]access to 
[normal]transportation services.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]A range of transportation needs are apparent.  These include emergency transport,
[normal] 
[normal]transport
[normal] to medical services
[normal], commuting, 
[normal]shopping, visiting friends and relations, 
[normal]and 
[normal]accessing long distance travel, 
[normal]or 
[normal]recreation and leisure
[normal] facilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]E
[normal]mergency
[normal] transport in remote areas is provided by Air-Sea Rescue
[normal] (ASR)
[normal], the Air Ambulance, Royal National L
[normal]ifeboat 
[normal]I
[normal]nstitute (RNLI)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Coastguard
[normal],
[normal] mountain rescue, 
[normal]blue light services
[normal] and other organisations.  
[normal]Response times are often significantly longer than in urban areas and 
[normal]t
[normal]he Committee may wish, for the purposes of the Inquiry
[normal] or 
[normal]otherwise
[normal], 
[normal]to review the adequacy of their coverage
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]We assume that 
[normal]d
[normal]aily or frequent commut
[normal]ers 
[normal]would not choose to live in remote areas without the assurance of good access
[normal] by
[normal] 
[normal]car or scheduled ferry, bus or rail service
[normal].  
[normal]However, it would surely be undesirable were 
[normal]people 
[normal]to 
[normal]be forced out 
[normal]by lack of ac
[normal]cess to 
[normal]a 
[normal]motor vehicle or public transport service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Provision of
[normal] 
[normal]transportation 
[normal]services 
[normal]in remote areas 
[normal]is 
[normal]i
[normal]nherently expensive b
[normal]ecause of the distance
[normal]s
[normal], the low population density and hence 
[normal]their 
[normal]limited 
[normal]and spasmodic 
[normal]take-up
[normal], low 
[normal]utilisation
[normal] 
[normal]of equipment 
[normal]and high 
[normal]fuel costs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Organisations seeking to plug the gap
[normal]s
[normal] are invariably based on volunteers
[normal], charitable 
[normal]donations, 
[normal]uncertain 
[normal]local government grants
[normal] 
[normal]and/or low-paid staff
[normal] along with Concessionary Fares Rebates
[normal].  The continuity and reliabi
[normal]lity of the services offered may be 
[normal]              
[normal]undermined by intermittent and
[normal]/or
[normal] low 
[normal]cashflow and therefore 
[normal]staffing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Few local CTAs or groups wanting to form CTAs will have the resources to prepare 
[normal]submissions to the Inquiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]The reliance that 
[normal]remote 
[normal]communities 
[normal]have
[normal] on 
[normal]the available
[normal] paratransit
[normal] services is often extreme.  Over-provision is never an issue, though there may 
[normal]occasionally 
[normal]be some duplication
[normal] and often spare capacity
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]With the rising costs of fuel and car use, the essential nature of 
[normal]lifeline service provision should be recognised
[normal],
[normal] and positively rather than passively supported.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]It is a fortunate characteristic of many isolated communities that neighbours assist each other informally as a matter of course.    
[normal]However, such assis
[normal]tance can never be taken for 
[normal]granted, with age, infirmity, 
[normal]absence
[normal], demands of emp
[normal]loyment and others they care for 
[normal]creating uncertainty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]              
[normal]Our submission canvasses some potential solutions to 
[normal]easing 
[normal]the 
[normal]physical and social 
[normal]isolation 
[normal]and 
[normal]conseq
[normal]uential 
[normal]loneliness
[normal], 
[normal]the decline in 
[normal]mental health
[normal], 
[normal]lack of healthcare access
[normal] and other problems that afflict
[normal] many small communities
[normal] located largely 
[normal]on the fringes of the 
[normal]mainland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]In cities and towns
[normal], 
[normal]where many of our 
[normal]decision-makers, 
[normal]employment and major fac
[normal]ilities 
[normal]are located, most have a choice of a range of transportation modes
[normal], routes
[normal] and services available.
[normal]  
[normal]In 
[normal]areas not well served by 
[normal]public transport
[normal], 
[normal]most 
[normal]may 
[normal]walk or cycl
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many h
[normal]ouseholds do
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]o
[normal]t 
[normal]usually 
[normal]require
[normal] a second car (or a car at all) to 
[normal]reach
[normal] their employment, medical appointments, 
[normal]shopping
[normal] centres, 
[normal]education facilities, leisure opportunities or social events.  
[normal]The 
[normal]rest of the household 
[normal]tend to 
[normal]walk, bus or cycle
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Families, 
[normal]friends 
[normal]and neighbours
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]often avail
[normal]able to support each other in illness and older age. 
[normal] 
[normal]Families without a car a
[normal]vailable 
[normal]can often visit by bus or on foot to help out when needed. 
[normal] 
[normal]Isolation happens, but not often 
[normal]through lack of access to a car or alternatives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]B
[normal]usinesses in urban areas are unlikely to struggle to find a range of employees, unless they are looking for very specialist skills or knowledge
[normal], or customers
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Many people will be able to reach the workplace, even on a shift basis, with or without their ow
[normal]n transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]This 
[normal]extensive 
[normal]flexibility allows people to adopt least-cost strategies (
[normal]eg.
[normal] 
[normal]trip-specific modal choice
[normal]) 
[normal]for personal transportation (or have no choice, as in the case of young people)
[normal].  
[normal]Walking and cycling 
[normal]is 
[normal]more practical
[normal].  
[normal]Public transport services tend to be frequent, though often under-utilised in off-peak hours.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While p
[normal]rivate motorin
[normal]g is increasingly expensive, especially over the relatively short distances that cars are typically used 
[normal]in cities and towns 
[normal](&lt; 8km)
[normal], it m
[normal]ay remain
[normal] dominant until Peak Oil begins to bite.
[normal]  Electric vehicles 
[normal]may 
[normal]never be a solution for most people
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]ougher economic conditions are unlikely to cost many people in urban areas their jobs, their ability to g
[normal]o shopping or
[normal] visiting friends or fami
[normal]ly.
[normal]  However, Councils should be require
[normal]d to identify 
[normal]areas where transport provision is poor, and ensure that access is available 
[normal]to all 
[normal]by public 
[normal]transport
[normal] 
[normal]or a 
[normal]viabl
[normal]e
[normal] community-
[normal]based alternative
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]In rural and other remote areas, the picture is 
[normal]altogether different.  This is not due to
[normal] a difference in the people - it i
[normal]s just geography. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For most people, it is too far to walk to shops, doctors, leisure centres and, in many cases, to 
[normal]visit relatives.  Most country roads do not have any kind of fo
[normal]otpath or street lighting.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cycling is an option for some people on some journeys, but most country 
[normal]roads are not safe 
[normal]for cyclists.  Places people want to or need to visit on a 
[normal]regular
[normal] basis are not often close enough to make cycling a viable option. 
[normal]Bus
[normal]es are often not viable in remote 
[normal]areas
[normal].  Where dependent on central g
[normal]overnment funding, 
[normal]many 
[normal]financially supported services have 
[normal]faced major 
[normal]cut
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Where buses do 
[normal]operate
[normal], services are unlikely to run in the evening
[normal],
[normal] and there is often nowhere sheltere
[normal]d and safe to wait. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Many
[normal] rural centres – lar
[normal]ger villages and small towns – now have limited public transport.  However, accessing them from the surrounding area is still difficult on foot or by bicycle
[normal],
[normal] as the distances are often significant
[normal].  S
[normal]afe
[normal] roads for pedestrians and cyclists 
[normal]typically do not begin until
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal]in the town or village. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]People and businesses in 
[normal]remote
[normal] areas have the same 
[normal]transportation requirements
[normal] as people in urban areas
[normal].  Unless a car 
[normal]is 
[normal]available though, 
[normal]access 
[normal]to good
[normal]s and services will be restricted, often severely. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Rural businesses are less likely to be able to 
[normal]recruit 
[normal]suitable employees.  Potential workers 
[normal]without access to a car may find some areas
[normal] and employment
[normal] completely inaccessible, and other areas only at restricted times of the day. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]Put simply, people and businesses in rural areas without ready access to a car whenever 
[normal]required 
[normal]suffer 
[normal]a 
[normal]lack of opportunity economically, socially and in accessing heal
[normal]th and care services.
[normal]  
[normal]Because 
[normal]of 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]ageing population and the increasing cost of motoring threatening car access to more households, 
[normal]remote areas are being depopulated
[normal], especially of younger 
[normal]people
[normal] and becoming even more isolated.  There is 
[normal]no foreseeabl
[normal]e possibility of a change in this trend. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Closing services and facilities due to Government funding cuts have disproportionately more impact in 
[normal]remote 
[normal]areas where the next service or facility may be completely out of reach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]One option is to take 
[normal]the goods and services to isolated communities. Many people in rural areas shop online, but this threatens local businesses, reduces choice and removes the opportunity for social interaction and community 
[normal]development.
[normal] Older and more vulnerabl
[normal]e people often
[normal] do not have 
[normal]this option.
[normal] 
[normal] Some people e-commute
[normal], which works well for some
[normal], but 
[normal]it 
[normal]increases 
[normal]of the 
[normal]isolation
[normal] of the remainder
[normal], severely limits job opportunities and does not achieve the same social benefits most working people enjoy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mobile libraries, 
[normal]hairdressers and so on provide excellent services, but 
[normal]they are 
[normal]delivered in 
[normal]a
[normal] way 
[normal]that is
[normal] necessarily limited
[normal].  They 
[normal]do not provide all 
[normal]the social benefits of visiting 
[normal]premises and meeting other people, or 
[normal]identifying
[normal] the full range of services available.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q1[bold]              [bold]How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1.1
[normal]              
[normal]In the first place, the authorities should 
[normal]accept
[normal], as the Chair of the Committee says, 
[normal]that…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]People from different communities across the UK should have access to adequate transport services
[normal] 
[normal]Louise Ellman MP
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]This immediately establishes 
[normal]the legitimacy of 
[normal]a lower bound 
[normal]in
[normal] demand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]While this demand will be at a 
[normal]much
[normal] more
[normal] reduced
[normal] level in isolated rural, coastal and island communities than in towns and cities, 
[normal]the same types of requirements other than 
[normal]for 
[normal]daily commuting can be 
[normal]safely 
[normal]assumed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1.2
[normal]              
[normal]We propose that systematic surve
[normal]ys are undertaken of a sample of such communities to identify all 
[normal]the 
[normal]travel requirements they generate, including those at present unfulfilled.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]The team 
[normal]that authored this submission would be ideally pl
[normal]aced to carry out such research, 
[normal]              
[normal]preferably 
[normal]in 
[normal]co
[normal]operation
[normal] with
[normal] other paratransit providers
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1.3
[normal]              
[normal]This is not to suggest that all transportation demands will be realisable or should be 
[normal]all 
[normal]financed by central and/or local authorities.  Even favoured city dwellers do not expect that, especially as costs
[normal] are rising for all motorised modes.
[normal]  
[normal]Neither do they expect fast travel, given 
[normal]our over-reliance on the least efficient mode – cars.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Peak Car
[normal] might well be bringing despair to motor manufacturers, but that simply shows they are failing to respond to the
[normal] market and 
[normal]not 
[normal]producing 
[normal]affordable 
[normal]mass transit vehicles!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1.4
[normal]              
[normal]In the case of urban and suburban areas with poor transport connections, questions should be asked of Councils procuring transport services as to why some areas are not well served.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Recen
[normal]t changes to bus operator grants and cuts in local authority finances have forced both parties to review services and any subsidies that were provided, vis-à-vis other possibly more pressing claims
[normal] on their stretched budgets
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The reduction in public sup
[normal]port appears to have marginalised some 
[normal]urban communities
[normal], reducing their access to community and social life and their employability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2[bold]              [bold]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with [bold]disabilities, older people, young [bold]people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2.1
[normal]              
[normal]To the extent they are provided by local initiatives, the latter appear to be struggling to meet those varying demands, given their 
[normal]often 
[normal]high cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Nevert
[normal]h
[normal]eless, the fundamental legitimacy of those demands 
[normal]require
[normal]s
[normal] us to address all the issues such client groups give rise to.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3[bold]              [bold]What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated [bold]communities? How can these challenges be overcome?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Cost, and the variability of demand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3.2
[normal]              
[normal]It would be unfair to impose such requirements on commercial operators, and provided that community-based initiatives were well-suppo
[normal]rted financially
[normal], prob
[normal]ably unnecessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3.3
[normal]              
[normal]It would be reasonable
[normal] 
[normal]for isolated communities to have access to 
[normal]ferry ports, 
[normal]railheads and 
[normal]              
[normal]bus stops where rural and island 
[normal]providers
[normal] 
[normal]could safely leave passengers for the
[normal]ir
[normal] onward 
[normal]              
[normal]journeys.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]This may 
[normal]mean the construction
[normal] of a shelter, and 
[normal]be 
[normal]further 
[normal]facilitated by 
[normal]the provision of 
[normal]better 
[normal]real-time and other passenger information in remote locations
[normal] – which is especially proble
[normal]matic where there is no cellular tele
[normal]phone or data signal
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While we would be reluctant to support any further retrenchment of scheduled bus and rail 
[normal]services anywhere, there may be, albeit probably limited, 
[normal]potential in shortening the routes and/or reducing the frequencies of the latter where community initiatives
[normal] could fill the gap, switching the available funding accordingly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3.4
[normal]              
[normal]It 
[normal]is probably the case
[normal] that
[normal] (financially-supported)
[normal] community transport associations are better placed to provide transport ser
[normal]vices to isolated communities than (subsidised) 
[normal]commerc
[normal]ial operators.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Community transport is cost-
[normal]effective, responsive and non-profit making, but it must be financially viable and, as importantly, financially stable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4[bold]              [bold]How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in [bold]isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Given their very limited resources, it is unsurprising that many local needs are not currently being met.  
[normal]              
[normal]Some Councils have been supportive to the extent their constrained budgets a
[normal]llow, while others do not assist community transport in any way.  Local CTAs have found it impossible to engage with 
[normal]many of 
[normal]the latter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Community transport associations do not waste their scarce and precarious funding.  Much administrative time is 
[normal]spent in scrambling for limited funds, often from a wide variety of sources.  This makes planning ahead very difficult, and expansion to better meet existing needs virtually impossible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4.3
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Preseli
[normal] Rural Transport Association
[normal] (Green Dragon Bus)
[normal], for
[normal] example,
[normal] secures funding from 
[normal]Concessionary 
[normal]T
[normal]ravel rebate
[normal]s, a 
[normal]Service Level Agreement (with Pembrokeshire County Council), 
[normal]a 
[normal]service bus route (for Ceredigion 
[normal]County Council), various grants
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]European rural area 
[normal]funds.  Small or very small amounts come
[normal] from 
[normal]membership fees, mileage contribution and donations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4.4
[normal]              
[normal]The best way to support transport associations that have shown themselves to be well-supported 
[normal]by the local 
[normal]community
[normal] would be by way of grants…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- to develop their websites (preferably usin
[normal]g a template that would fit readily within 
[normal]the portals of transport information providers)
[normal] and telephone support for those without internet access
[normal]- to assist with procurement of vehicles
[normal], insurance
[normal] and maintenance
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- to market their services within their 
[normal]area of operation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- to encourage their use by tourists
[normal] and recreational travellers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q5[bold]              [bold]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Taxis could and should 
[normal]occupy a very different role tha
[normal]n
[normal] hitherto in the UK.  
[normal]They ought to complement other public and community transport services, such as buses in low-density areas, and at off-peak times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They should be cheaper
[normal] to hire
[normal], while at the same time 
[normal]ensu
[normal]ring 
[normal]that 
[normal]their drivers 
[normal]obtain 
[normal]a reasonable income.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q5.2
[normal]              
[normal]An imaginative assessment should be made of their potential in urban, rural and remote areas before this question should be answered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q5.3
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]t 
[normal]is probably much 
[normal]cheaper to provide taxis and other demand-responsive transport 
[normal]services 
[normal]to isolated communities than scheduled bus or rail services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6[bold]              [bold]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6.1
[normal]              
[normal]Lack of cent
[normal]ral and local government commitment over time
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Community Transport organisations have no certainty of funding beyond a year or two for most funding sources
[normal],
[normal] putting service development, provision and employment at constant risk
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7[bold]              [bold]How can these s[bold]ervices be made more affordable?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7.1
[normal]              
[normal]The real opportunity is to invest properly in 
[normal]remote area
[normal] transport, through supported public transport, community transport, car clubs, scooter hire for young people, Dial-A-Ride for the older and more frail, and other Community Transport solutions such as Country Cars, community minibus hire, taxi and car shar
[normal]ing and other local and national schemes for those without access to a car when they need to travel. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Community transport associations endeavour to provide an appropriate range of services to 
[normal]the extent their finances permit
[normal], but 
[normal]these
[normal] are patchy at best
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7.2
[normal]              
[normal]Greater take-up of such services will reduce their 
[normal]per capita
[normal] cost
[normal], which is bound to occur as car use continues to decline
[normal] and the population ages and becomes more 
[normal]infirm
[normal].  However, we contend that affordability is not the issue.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]The focus mu
[normal]st be on adequate provision to ensure a reasonable level of access and mobility for all
[normal], now and in the future
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]There is much national and local Government rhetoric regarding equal access to services, ensuing equal opportuniti
[normal]es for all 
[normal]in education, employment, business development, social and health care and so on. 
[normal] But n
[normal]one of these can be addressed without proper access to transport in 
[normal]remote
[normal] areas,
[normal] where the largest 
[normal]defici
[normal]ency 
[normal]lies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no point in having the best h
[normal]ospital, factory or school if people cannot get to them and home again safely and affordably. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Adequate
[normal] 
[normal]public and community 
[normal]t
[normal]ransport provision enables remote
[normal] communities to be
[normal]come more 
[normal]economically sustainable, reduces isolation, ensures access to
[normal] goods and services, reduces mental health problems and difficult
[normal]ies
[normal] in accessing 
[normal]medical services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It ensures 
[normal]access for people and businesses to earn money and contribute to the economy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]The Inquiry is timely, in that
[normal] transportation costs will continue to rise, and existing services will continue to be threatened.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Access and mobility that urban dwellers currently take for granted are a quantum leap above that available to people is isolated communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Access to job
[normal]s, services, health care and a social life is critical to
[normal] both
[normal] physical 
[normal]and mental health. 
[normal] To our ageing population
[normal], isolation
[normal] is a challenge.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In some rural areas, suc
[normal]h as s
[normal]outh
[normal]w
[normal]est Wales
[normal],
[normal] younger people are moving out to find employment and older peop
[normal]le are moving in to retire
[normal].  T
[normal]he ageing of the population is accelerated
[normal], 
[normal]exacerbating the problem where car
[normal]-
[normal]less living is already least
[normal]-well
[normal] provided for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]In many areas, there is no support for community transport from Councils.  Local groups 
[normal]seeking assistance to establish community transport have often been unable to find anyone in the Councils to engage with.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]We suspect that there may be few 
[normal]submissions to the Inquiry from local CTAs, potentially undermining the Committee’s objectives
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]We understand that very few local CTAs would have the resources available to apply to 
[normal]preparing 
[normal]a submission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]To periodically survey
[normal] remote populations as to their mobility and access requirements, and

[normal]additional and long-term

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]              
[normal]To 
[normal]regularly survey Councils as to the extent of their support 
[normal]for community transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Note[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]The submitting organisations propose to apply for funding
[normal]…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]- to survey a sample of remote areas to identify typical transportation requirements
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- to survey community transport associations
[normal],
[normal] and groups intending to e
[normal]stablish a CTA
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]- to survey Councils and their support for community transport
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- 
[normal]to research and
[normal] produce a best practice manual
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]We would be pleased to discuss this proposal further with the Committee if requested.
