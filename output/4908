[normal]Submission from the London Assembly[bold] (FDC12)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The London Assembly comprises 25 politicians who are elected to hold the Mayor of London to account and investigate issues of 
[normal]importance
[normal] to Londoners.  London Assembly Members are elected at the same time as the Mayor. Eleven represent the whole capital an
[normal]d 14 are elected by constituencies.  The London Assembly carries out investigations into issues through cross-party committees, which often look at long-term issues facing London.  
[normal]It also holds the Mayor to account through monthly Mayor’s Question Time me
[normal]etings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he London Assembly welcomes the 
[normal]CLG Committee’s inquiry into fiscal devolution to cities and city regions. This follows the work undertaken by the London Finance Commission 
[normal](LFC) 
[normal]and the publication of its 
[normal]final report, 
[normal]Raising the Capital
[normal], 
[normal]o
[normal]n
[normal] 1
[normal]5 May 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]That report 
[normal]examine
[normal]d
[normal] the potential for greater devolution of both taxation and the control of resources in London an
[normal]d
[normal] develop
[normal]ed
[normal] options to improve 
[normal]the city’
[normal]s tax and spending arrangements
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It recommended that London government should retain bu
[normal]siness rates and take full control over council tax and stamp duty land tax
[normal]. 
[normal]It also proposed that the yields from such taxes should be offset by a corresponding reduction in grant to ensure any changes be 
[normal]fiscally neutral for the Exchequer
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The intention 
[normal]is that with such additional powers, the city can
[normal] fund 
[normal]infrastructure both to cater for the 
[normal]expansion 
[normal]already forecast for its population and economy,
[normal] 
[normal]and to promote additional economic growth. 
[normal]The report
[normal] also called
[normal] for a relaxation of
[normal] restrictions on bor
[normal]rowing for capital
[normal] 
[normal]investment within prudential rules
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The London Assembly is unanimous in 
[normal]its support of
[normal] the 
[normal]principles and detailed recommendations put forward by the London Finance Commission
[normal]. John Biggs, AM, represented the Assembly on the LFC and w
[normal]e 
[normal]have also 
[normal]had extensive discussions on the proposals with Professor
[normal] 
[normal]Tony Travers, who chaired the Commission, 
[normal]when he 
[normal]appeared in front of the London Assembly 
[normal]on 5 June 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Were the London Finance Commission recommendations to be implemented, it woul
[normal]d give the
[normal] London Mayor 
[normal]enhanced powers over taxation and borrowing. 
[normal]The Assembly is firmly of the view that 
[normal]this would need to be balanced by enhanced 
[normal]local accountability
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] LFC report 
[normal]recognises this
[normal]: 
[normal]“If the Mayor assumed substantial additional taxat
[normal]ion responsibilities it would be necessary to review the Assembly’s powers with a view to enhancing them
[normal].
[normal]” 
[normal]This was reinforced by Professor Travers who told the 
[normal]Assembly
[normal] that “
[normal]the Assembly’s powers need to be strengthened pro rata
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Assembly would 
[normal]seek a
[normal]dditional responsibilities in respect of 
[normal]both
[normal] taxation and borrowing
[normal]. 
[normal]It has 
[normal]set up a 
[normal]Financial Devolution Working Group 
[normal]t
[normal]o 
[normal]develop more detailed proposals
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]Assembly
[normal] 
[normal]powers with respect to
[normal] 
[normal]council tax, stamp duty land 
[normal]tax, business rates
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]other ta
[normal]xes, 
[normal]Tax Increment Financing schemes and the Mayor’s infrastructure plan. 
[normal]The Assembly
[normal] 
[normal]would 
[normal]certainly 
[normal]seek the 
[normal]ability to amend any new tax proposals by the Mayor 
[normal]in the same way that it currently amend
[normal]s
[normal] the Mayor’s budget
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Assembly support
[normal]s
[normal] the application of the principles developed by the London Finance Commission to other English cities. 
[normal]However, 
[normal]it is n
[normal]ot for the Greater London Authority
[normal] or the London Assembly to 
[normal]define 
[normal]the 
[normal]precise geographical and accountability arrangements that would 
[normal]be appropriate for
[normal] such
[normal] 
[normal]devolution. That is an issue for the 
[normal]people and representatives of 
[normal]each locality to decide. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Assembly
[normal] 
[normal]would 
[normal]urge the Committee to 
[normal]give detailed consideration to 
[normal]the 
[normal]need for proper 
[normal]governance and 
[normal]local 
[normal]accountabilit
[normal]y 
[normal]i
[normal]n 
[normal]the event of
[normal] fiscal devolution to English cities. In London, i
[normal]f the recommendations of the 
[normal]LFC
[normal] were implemented, the 
[normal]Mayor 
[normal]would see a substantial increase in tax raising and 
[normal]borrowing 
[normal]powers. 
[normal]Such
[normal] an expansion of the executive’s role and function sho
[normal]uld be effectively balanced by 
[normal]strengthened accountability via
[normal] 
[normal]the London Assembly.
