[[[Responses to Questions]]]Responses have been provided to questions that are pertinent to PML’s research and expertise.What types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? &#xa0;What contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?Are there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?&#xa0;For further information, please see http://www.pml.ac.uk/media/news_highlights/qics_update.aspx &#xa0;What are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? &#xa0;Are there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe? &#xa0;&#xa0;How have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts? Is the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?Could the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?&#xa0; What are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
