"&#xa0;\nFurther Written evidence submitted by Monica Waud (LGO18)&#xa0;\nSummaryThe current procedures used by the Ombudsman do not ensure fairness\n and that reassurances provided in the evidence provided in the session on 2 December 2013 do not address the criticisms of the system made by me and others.  A further look at the soundness of the method of evidence gathering used by the Ombudsman and the\n availability of evidence to complainants is essential if the Ombudsman is to meet the test of fairness.\n&#xa0;Evidence regarding fairness given by Dr Martin and Mr King on 2 December 20131.1 I write again in my personal capacity as someone who has had persona\nl dealings with the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) intermittently since 1994.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 I have read the oral evidence given by Dr Martin and Mr King and believe there have been some misunderstandings regarding my previous written evidence which I wish to corr\nect.  I also wish to supply \nfurther \nevidence regarding what happens in practice from the complainants’ standpoint because I believe the\n Select Committee (CLG)\n may still \nbe unaware of the lack of fairness in the procedure.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n3\n Mr King\n,\n in response to Q 35\n,\n states that “During an investigation, we will share any key documents with both parties to make sure they have sight of the evidence on which we are relying”.  \nIn 2005 I requested sight of the documents relating to my complaints that were held in the Ombu\ndsman’s files and was told by an Assistant Ombudsman, Mr R Stephen, that “Under the Local Government Act 1974 (section 32(2)), the Ombudsman is not permitted to disclose any information obtained in the course of, or for the purposes of, the investigation o\nf a complaint, unless he or she considers it is necessary for the purposes of the investigation”.  I complained to the Information Commission which confirmed that the Ombudsman did not have to release these d\nocuments.  \nI have\n therefore\n never had sight of e\nvide\nnce collected by the Ombudsman from \noriginal sources such as \nindividual council officers\n \nbut \nwhich have been\n relied upon by \nthe Ombudsman \nwhen reaching a decision.  It is my understanding that all complainants are prevented from seeing such documents. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.4 Mr King goes on to say “Before we make a decision, both parties will be consulted on what we call a provisional view. That sets out the decision we are minded to make, and both parties at the same time will have the opportunity to comment on that vi\new.” \n \nThis provisional view is arrived at when a \nLocal Authority \n(\nLA)\n \n- \nin my\n experience the Chief Executive - \nhas written back to the Ombudsman giving a response which, if accepted by the Ombudsman, means \nthat no further investigation is carried out by \nthe Ombudsman\n.  The response from the \nLA\n \nis therefore hearsay because the Chief Executive relies on the Strategic Director who in turn relies on the Head of Department.  \nThis means that the \nOmbudsman and the \ncomplainant never get to see what \nactual \nevidenc\ne/original sources have been relied upon by the Chief Executive\n and other senior officers\n when compiling his response\n if it relates to oral evidence from officers\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.5 In my earlier submission, I was suggesting at paragraph 2.3 that LAs were required to\n append transcripts of interviews with the officers which took place as part of the LAs own \ninternal\n investigation of a complaint\n.  This should include all interviews that had taken place from the first time the complainant lodged a complaint with the LA r\night up until the complainant reached the end of the LA’s complaint procedure.  The inclusion of these documents providing evidence from original sources \nwould prevent the Chief Executive or any other senior officer responding on the basis of wishful think\ning as took place in my case\n.  In addition,\n it would also show \nwhether \nan\ny\n investigation \nhad actually been \ncarried out which my case\n would have been useful because it had not\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n \nAfter the Provisional View stage\n referred to by Mr King\n, if the Ombudsman d\necides to \nvisit the Council and interview officers\n rather than discontinue the investigation on the basis of the Chief Executive’s response,\n \nthe secrecy \n(upheld by the Information Commission) \nsurrounding the\n evidence\n gathered by the Ombudsman means\n \ncomplai\nnants\n do not know which officers were interviewed, what \nthey said or whether their evidence was reliable.  \nIt is therefore impossible \nfor complainants \nto challenge the \nactual \nevidence in a way that could be considered fair.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n7\n \nIn my case, the \nLA\n mislead \nthe LGO over a number of years and the Head of Department within the LA, who \nunder the LA’s complaints procedure was required to mak\ne the first response to my complaints to the LA itself, always rebutted my complaints.  \nHis \nfirst response became a template that was \nreplicated \nas my complaint progressed through the LA’\ns internal complaints procedure until\n it w\nas\n endorsed by the Chief Executive at the final stage and then\n \nbecame \nthe \nLA’s official position \nonce the Ombudsman bec\name involved.  \n&#xa0;\n1.\n8\n What appears particularl\ny unfair\n is that the\n Head of Department \n‘investigating’ my complaint \nwas implicated in the causation of the maladministration complained of and yet\n the LA procedures\n permitted \nhim \nto ‘investigate’ himself and ot\nher more junior members \nof his department\n over whom he had managerial responsibility\n.  The Chief Executive then perpetuated \nhis \nnarrative\n to the Ombudsman. \n&#xa0;\n1.\n9\n In response to \nQ48 \nregarding the validating of evidence provided by local authorities, \nDr \nMartin\n: claims to ensure that the evidence used is “fair and properly validated”.  \nMr King states “we investigate thoroughly and forensically where that is required”.  \nI do not accept either of these statements.  \nT\nhe Ombudsman \ndoes not consider she\n should\n \nre-open my complaint\n \ndespite it now being known that\n the LA failed to carry out\n its\n own \ninternal investigation \nby someone not involved in the maladministration\n and failed to document any investigation at all\n.  The only thorough and forensic examination of \nthe facts was carried out by a new\n basic grade LA\n officer \nwho could not comprehend the viewpoint taken by the CEO\n (which is still accepted by the Ombudsman)\n and the new officer took advice from \nthe Legal Services Manager\n who disagreed with the CEO\n.  I\nt is the \nresponsibility \nof \nthat\n Legal Services Manager \n(\na qualified solicitor unlike the CEO\n)\n to provide advice to the LA on this matter.  This conflict\n \nis \nundeniable proof of the maladministration\n but the Ombudsman refuses to look into the conflict and as\n recently as 6.12.13. \ntold me \nthat as extensive an investigation as necessary \nwas \ncarried out\n prior to the appointment of the officer who uncovered the true facts with the advice from the Legal Services Manager.  \nThis officer\n has told me that no-one has ev\ner asked him about the matter in relation to my complaints to the LA.\n  There can be no doubt in my case that the Ombudsman has been misled but then in the face of the undeniable conflict refuses to admit that the investigations were not as thorough as nece\nssary. \n1.10 In Q 49 Dr Martin is asked whether she would “require written transcripts of the interviews from council officers” and she replies by referring \nonly\n \nto the interviews carried out by the Ombudsman.  \nI have explained the reasons for my suggestio\nn at 1.5 above and I firmly believe they would help everyone.\n1.11\n I omitted \nsuggesting \nthat the transcripts of the interviews carried out by the Ombudsman were appended because I knew that this \nsuggestion \nwould be rejected by the Ombudsman \nciting \ncurrent \nlegislation.\n1.12. I hope that the CLG will be able to pursue my points regarding fairness because it is no-one’s interests for maladministration to be allowed to continue in even one case especially when LA funds are as limited as now.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n17 December 201\n3\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
