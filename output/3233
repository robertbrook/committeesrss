[normal]Written evidence submitted by Bexley Natural Environment Forum[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]T[bold]he umbrella body for Friends of Parks and Open Spaces groups, local wildlife experts and conservationists and sustainability campaigners in the Borough. We work to protect, restore and enhance habitats and biodiversity across [bold]the London Borough of [bold]Bexley.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are submitting evidence because our area is always under considerable development pressure. We have close dealings with the local authority on biodiversity, and are leading on implementation of some of the Council’s BAP policies. We have made detailed submissions on recent strategic planning documents (the LDF and DPAS). We believe that we have some insights into the importance for wildlife of sites not necessarily recognised in this regard, and of the potential limitations faced by local authorities in regard to effectively managing any ‘off-setting’ scheme.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We were aiming to respond to the Government’s consultation questions with a deadline of 7
[normal]th
[normal] November, but only recently became aware that the Environment Audit Committee was conducting its own inquiry with a rather earlier deadline and on somewhat different terms, hence this tardy input. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]i) An off-setting scheme may have some short-term merit in ‘mitigating’ accumulated damage from ‘development of ‘low biodiversity value’ sites.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii) We submit that the main reason for biodiversity loss is an unsustainable ecological footprint driven by economic policies based on the aim of never-ending resource consumption growth, coupled with a failure to address the issue of human numbers in the round (and not simply immigration). We note that as a signatory to the Aichi targets, the Government is committed to addressing this. We await, without any great optimism, serious and credible legislative proposals for doing so. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iii) In this wider context, off-setting is simply a policy to try and cram more wildlife into ever less space. We do not believe that this can deliver no net loss of biodiversity in the longer term.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iv) By fostering the idea that chunks of nature can simply be re-located or re-created elsewhere, an off-setting scheme may have the effect of undermining the protected status of ‘higher value’ (and not just statutory) sites, particular in areas of high land prices, and this could increase disconnect from nature, particularly towards city centres. ‘Mission creep’ must be avoided, and such sites must have cast iron protection from ‘development’.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]INTRODUCTION [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1) 
[normal]Whilst we agree that attempts should be made to try and make up for damage done to biodiversity 
[normal]once the powers that be have determined that something is a  
[normal]‘
[normal]necessary 
[normal]development’, we have a number of serious concerns about the scope and operation of any ’biodiversity off-setting’ scheme.

[normal]which we believe addresses many of the fundamental issues, and casts considerable doubt on the ability of ‘biodiversity off-setting’ to deliver the touted outcomes.

[normal]contribution

[normal]Woodfiled
[normal] in ‘British Wildlife’ , Vol. 25, No. 1, October 2013
[normal], pp64-65.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]OPERATION OF ANY SCHEME[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2) If the Government does roll out a national scheme it should be mandatory.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3) There should be a common standard, so that it is possible to properly assess and compare outcomes, and to avoid Councils scrabbling to ‘attract’ more developers by having less stringent requirements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4) There should, however, be allowances made for the fact a that a relatively ‘poorer’ suite of sites are likely to be found, from a biodiversity point of view, towards the centres of urban areas, otherwise we fear that these will be cleared of green/
[normal]brownfield
[normal] spaces with any wildlife interest, since this will be deemed disposable when set against ‘richer’ areas elsewhere. 
[normal]Buglife
[normal] has recently highlighted the loss of a large proportion of biodiversity-rich 
[normal]brownfield
[normal] sites within the Thames Gateway, and even more so London. It is not clear that such sites are receiving adequate survey effort, protection and designation from Local Authorities, and this needs addressing before such sites are deemed to be expendable.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5) A development application should be assessed on its own merit against the potential loss of biodiversity, with only the on-site retention dealt with initially. If the application is approved and there 
[normal]is residual environmental impact that cannot be mitigated in any other way
[normal], 
[normal]only 
[normal]then should an off-set be discussed and agreed with a competent body. We fear that if off-setting is agreed/ publicised beforehand, then any objections may be ‘bought off’’ with promises that may be over-played and unrealistic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6) We are not confident, from our own experience, that Local Authorities will have the expertise, or if they do the person hours, to properly assess the required offsets. In practice much of this work is likely to be dealt with by the planning departments, which are largely driven by concerns about concrete and tarmac, and hereabouts appear to rank higher in the scheme of things than overloaded biodiversity staff  in the weighting of decisions. If the actors remain largely as in current planning applications, then the developers are probably going to pay ‘ecological consultants’ as intermediaries to come up with an offset proposal. We have not been impressed by the quality of recent consultant’s reports relating to developments in our area, which are often formulaic and cover only a brief snap-shot in time of a particular site. It has to be remembered that they are in the pay of ‘developers’, but their reports seem to be accepted all too readily by Council Officers who lack the time or knowledge to counter errors, omissions and patently unrealistic promises as to mitigation outcomes.  Options that may suit commercial clients but not wildlife, and that conveniently fail to point out or adhere to what is best practice in respect of translocations, have sailed by without challenge from within the Council. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7) 
[normal]Page 14 of the green paper states that ‘It has been suggested the pilot metric can be applied to a site in as little as 20 minutes.’ This may be true of a very small site that was recently a tennis court or 
[normal]somesuch
[normal], but otherwise we find this a cavalier statement that belies the 
[normal]Government’s real attitude to biodiversity, and is ignorant of the fact that even small unpromising-looking sites can turn up ‘interesting’ species if properly studied on a year-round basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8) Will the Government provide the necessary finance to LAs to do the job properly, and if they do, will this not simply be funding yet another scheme that is actually about further retrenchment of wildlife - at a time when LAs like ours lack the funding to do much pro-active work to meet the objective (e.g. Bexley’s Parks and Open Spaces strategy) of actually increasing biodiversity in their areas?  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9) When assessing development applications, we believe that there is inadequate emphasis on the potential of supposedly ‘low value’ threatened sites to restore ground-level habitat linkage, and to harbour more and rarer species than they do now with suitable management, or by just being left to do their own thing. We note that in a planning system already heavily biased towards the concrete and tarmac merchants, with no third party right of appeal, the ‘worth’ of open spaces is effectively judged on the basis of what is there now, rather than what could be. On the other hand, planning applications are often approved on the basis of all sorts of essentially speculative claims about the future benefits in terms of jobs and money rather than what exists at the moment. This needs rectifying. In the off-setting context the ‘corridor’ and ‘potential’ factors should be built into an off-setting metric in some way.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10) Any scheme which requires a ‘market’ of traded off-set sites is likely to favour organisations or individuals with money, and any conservation groups they might bring in to do the managing will be beholden to them and less likely to object to further off-setting schemes. Indeed you are creating a financial ‘pull’ for destroying sites as well as a ‘push’ from development proposals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11) ‘Development’ target sites and potential ‘off-set’ land values are likely to be higher if located within urban areas, which may price out conservation groups from controlling such sites themselves, and lead to towns and cities being cleared of wildlife land, including ‘higher quality’ sites, despite the nominal increase in theoretical offset costs for attempts at creating ‘equivalent’ habitat elsewhere. This could further estrange large numbers of people from a connection with nature, so that there is less political pressure to protect it further down the line.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12) The proposals risk creating tensions between nature conservation organisations, with some wanting to protect Site A and others preferring to abandon it, take the off-set monies and run to improve Site B, which they happen to manage. This may be convenient for Councils and the Government, but not wildlife.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]) A starting point in determining what sort of sites should be protected ‘as of right’, a
[normal]nd not be subject to off-settin
[normal]g, would be SINCs. Whilst there are objective criteria, nevertheless there appears to be a tendency for Councils closer to central London to designate sites that would not be selected further out. That would go some way to overcoming the risk that inner cities get cleared of open wildlife land (point 10 above).
[normal] However, SINCS are not necessarily the only sites of biodiversity value ranking below SSSIs. In Bexley there are a number of allotment sites containing UK/London/Bexley BAP species, and some that would merit SINC designations were it not Council policy not to grant SINC status to allotments. By contrast, other London  Boroughs have designated a number of allotment sites as SINCs. This concerns us given Bexley’s recent performance on translocations, which has flown in the face of clear best practice guidance. 
[normal]Biodioversity
[normal] ‘off-setting’ carries the risk of promulgating the message that translocations are fine as long as the developer claims they can’t retain species on site. The Council can then gain twice, first if every last corner of the site they own  is covered in buildings to maximise tax revenue and then gain again from payments for so-called ‘habitat improvements’ if it happens to own the site (say a SINC), to which it agrees animals should then be 
[normal]translocated
[normal], all the while claiming in public that it is doing a ‘good thing’ for biodiversity.      
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14) We are extremely concerned about the scope for ‘mission creep‘, with various interests seeking to extend ‘off-setting’ to ever higher ‘value’ sites. We have already seen an example of 
[normal]this in Medway, with an important Nightingale population. Legislation needs to be very tightly drawn to preclude this sort of thing happening.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CONTEXT MATTERS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]15) T
[normal]he overall tenor (or ‘world view’) of 
[normal]any legislation i
[normal]s critically important in guiding the sort of approach decision-makers are likely to take, and the weight they will give to potentially competing interests.
[normal] We are profoundly uneasy about this further monetisation / 
[normal]commodification
[normal] of nature which, in our opinion, will further entrench the prevailing materialism-is-God approach, and down-grade its importance in the public mind by giving the misleading impression to those less well informed that it can simply be swopped out, traded and re-created at will.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16) We assume that all members of the committee have read the State of Nature report:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]http://www.rspb.org.uk/stateofnature
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DEFRA’s own latest biodiversity indicators report likewise presents a worrying picture, with a significant proportion showing a decline or no improvement:
[normal]   
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/252995/BIYP_2013.pdf
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our opinion the breadth and depth of this crisis suggest that the problems will not be tackled simply by an ever-lengthening series of ‘interventions’ to one part of the ‘death by a thousand cuts’ machinery or another. They are clearly the result of an insidious and wide-scale gross over-consumption of resources, which is currently built into the heart of what is seen as ‘progress’. The goal of conventional ‘economics’ is, in fact, to liquidate ‘natural capital’ and non-renewable resources at an ever faster rate, and to build on ever more land, indefinitely. This is clearly not sustainable, and we should not be surprised that the result of this is major biodiversity loss and homogenisation of habitats and species assemblages. The conceits and temporary conscience-salving ‘fixes’ of ‘mitigation’ and ‘biodiversity off-setting’ are just that. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17) The scientific reality is that 
[normal]in June 2012 the world’s 105 science academies – including the Royal Society, the UK’s national academy of science 
[normal]- 
[normal]produced a statement highlighting the global challenges of population and consumption and calling upon world leaders to take decisive action. 
[normal]http://royalsociety.org/news/iap-population-consumption/
[normal]The Royal Society made it clear that ‘The 
[normal]most developed and the emerging economies must stabilise and then reduce material consumption levels’ 
[normal]to save the Earth from a "vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills".
[normal]The Global Footprint network reckons the UK’s consumption is more than three times its 
[normal]biocapacity
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/trends/united_kingdom/
[normal]The onus is clearly on the UK, as the sixth richest in the world, and grossly over-consuming, to significantly cut resource consumption. 
[normal]18) H
[normal]aving failed to halt biodiversity loss by the previously
[normal] 
[normal]agreed date of 2010, the UK Gov
[normal]ernment
[normal], among many others, is now signed up to ‘the Aichi Targets’ set out in the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity
[normal] 
[normal]2011–2020 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]http://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/2011-2020/Aichi-Targets-EN.pdf
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Target 4: By 2020, at the latest, Governments, business and
[normal]stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have
[normal]implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption
[normal]and have kept the impacts of use of natural resources well
[normal]within safe ecological limits.
[normal]But t
[normal]he 
[normal]Government and official 
[normal]‘
[normal]opposition
[normal]’
[normal] prefer to ignore this and carry on bleating about ‘economic recovery’ through a return to ‘growth’.  
[normal]The priority should now be to repair the damage as best we can and not accelerate it further. That means setting out on an equitable contraction and convergence path to a one-planet economy, with investment re-directed to restoring natural capital and not destroying it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19) We note that the 
[normal]Guidance for
[normal] 
[normal]Local Authorities on
[normal] 
[normal]Implementing the
[normal] 
[normal]Biodiversity 
[normal]Duty (
[normal]DEFRA May 2007) 
[normal]emphasises this in stating that
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5. Conserving biodiversity includes restoring and enhancing species populations and habitats, as well as protecting them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]as set out in section 40 (3) of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Instead, the fundamental logic of an ‘off-setting’ approach is that an attempt is made to push ever more wildlife into ever less space.
[normal] 
[normal]Whatever the short-term gains might be (from increasing the carrying capacity of an ‘offset’ site that has probably already been depressed by human activity), in the long term you cannot keep doing this and hope to protect and increase biodiversity. ‘Off-setting’ 
[normal]boils down to robbing Peter to pay Paul. Nowhere is it made clear how this will result in ‘no net biodiversity loss’ in anything but the short term, 
[normal]so we find the Gove
[normal]r
[normal]nment’s claim that ‘biodiversity off-setting’ will deliver this outcome to be wantonly specious. 
[normal]In any event, as the State of Nature report says, there had already been significant biodiversity losses before we started measuring it, so taking today as a target point lacks the required ambition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20) In conclusion, an off-setting scheme may have limited short-term benefit 
[normal]in replacing
[normal] some of the features of
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]less important
[normal]’
[normal] sites
[normal], but unless ‘higher value’ 
[normal]sites 
[normal]are absolutely protected from ‘essential development’, and we address our total footprint, then it will be a 
[normal]distraction
[normal] and could undermine the status of ‘protected’ sites.
