defaultThe 
defaultDefence 
defaultCommittee’s work during the period since Easter 2012 has continued to focus strongly on continuing operations in Afghanistan and preparations for the drawdown of the UK military 
defaultcommitment in 2014.
default 
defaultWe
default published 
defaulta
default major report on 
defaultSecuring the Future of Afghanistan 
default in March 2013; during the course of this inquiry 
defaultwe
default 
defaulttravelled to
default Afghanistan in November 2012, visiting Kabul and Helmand. 
defaultWe are
default also conducting another visit to Afghan
defaultistan
default and Pakistan
default in the autumn of this year.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to focussing on ongoing operations, we have also been looking ahead to
default the 2015 Strateg
defaultic Defence and Security Review
default (SDSR)
default, continuing to assess the
default success and 
defaulteffect
defaults
default of implementation of the
default 2010 SDSR and assessing em
defaulterging threats such as cyber
default, which will form an important part of the next Review. We have also focussed on 
defaultthe operation
default of the Armed Forces Covenant
default and how the Ministry of Defence is managing within its financial settlement, 
defaultin particular scrutinising steps taken to improve the efficiency of its equipment 
defaultacquisition
default. 
defaultWe
default visited Washington in May this year in the context of 
defaultour
default 
defaultwork on preparing for the next SDSR and 
defaultour
default work on Afghanistan.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default also completed a major report o
defaultn the 
defaultdefence 
defaultimplications of Scottish independence
default with the intention of helping to inform debate in the run-up to the referendum next year.
default 
defaultWe visited Scotland d
defaulturing the course of this inquiry
default.
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Defence Committee has on a number of occasions in the past held seminars to discuss its future programme. The last of these sessions was held at the 
defaultRoyal United Services Institute (RUSI) in Oc
defaulttober 2012, and provided an opportunity for 
defaultus
default, 
defaultour
default staff and specialist advisers, to engage with academics and others including the Chief of 
defaultthe 
defaultDefence Staff to identify a programme for the remainder of the Parliament. 
default 
defaultWe
default took the unusual step of publis
defaulthing 
defaultthis programme in a press release on 10 December 2012 with the intention 
defaultof
default stimulating comment and engagement with outside bodies
default and commentators
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have
default not had occasion to commission specific pieces of research, but 
defaultwe 
defaultcontinue to receive treme
defaultndous support from RUSI. In the context of ongoing work on 
defaultTowards the next Defence and Security Review, 
defaultthe Committee has been extremely grateful for work 
defaultundertaken
default by RUSI to encourage academics to engage with the inquiry and contribute material, some o
defaultf which may be used as evidence.
default 
default 
defaultIn approaching this 
defaultwork we
default decided to pursue four different strands of inquiry that will feed into 
defaulta
default major 
defaultpiece of 
defaultwork next year on the SDSR. Each of these strands – which are initially “paper-based” inquiries -  is bei
defaultng led by different Member
defaults
default of the Committee who will act as “rapporteur
defaults
default”.
default The
default reports on the
defaultse strands will be drawn together with other material to inform a major report next year. This represents a new long-term strategic approach for the Committee.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultW
defaulte have
default for some time adopted the practice of holding formal planning meetings prior to the commencement of each inquiry with the intention of identifying 
defaultfrom whom we want to take 
defaultevidence, 
defaultwhat 
defaultwe are
default seeking to achieve and ensuring that proper considerat
defaultion has been given to the timing of publication
default of reports
default. 
defaultAs part of our development of a long-term communications plan, we held a briefing for Defence editors to
default accompany the launch of 
defaultour
default forward programme in December 2012.
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commi
defaultttee has taken a number of steps to explore di
defaultfferent ways of taking evidence as well as engaging with a wider audience. In the context of
default our
default inquiry into 
defaultFuture Army 2020
default, 
default the Army Rumour Service 
default(AR
defaultS
defaultSE) 
defaultis hosting
default a web forum seeking views on 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment
default’s plans for the future of the A
defaultrmy, with the intention of informing questions for 
defaultour
default evidence sessions.
default It is often difficult for 
defaultus
default to obtain the views of Service personnel on matters that affect them and the forum 
defaultprovided an invaluable oppor
defaulttunity to do so
default. 
defaultWe are extremely grateful to the House of Commons Digital Outreach Team for their help in setting up the forum and using it to 
defaultprovide ongoing help in engaging 
defaultS
defaultervice personnel wi
defaultth wider parliamentary activities. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default took
default oral evidence
default from children, parents and teachers
default at Wellington Academy, Tidworth,
default as part of 
defaultour
default inquiry into the 
defaultArmed Forces Covenant
default in Action?
default: Educating the children of Service Personnel
default. 
default We would like to put on record again our gratitude firstly to the children
default, parents and teachers we met and also to the school authorities for facilitating this session. 
defaultWe
default also made use of web for
defaulta
default hosted by the NAO 
defaultto
default solicit evidence from Service p
defaultersonnel
default and their families
default directly in relation to 
defaultthis 
defaultinquiry 
defaultand also our i
defaultnquiry 
defaultinto the 
defaultArmed Forces Covenant
default in Action?
default: Education of Service Personnel
default.
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default 
defaultundertook professional 
defaulttraining on 
defaultimproving questioning techniques
default. 
defaultWe
default held 
defaulttwo
default session
defaults with a trainer
default, analysing some of 
defaultour
default past performances 
defaultin questioning high profile witnesses, and working to identify which approaches to questioning worked best
default.
default This was a challenging and worthwhile exercise which we hope has had a positive impact on our 
defaultwork
default.
default It has also inspired us to hold regular private “wash-up” sessions after each evidence session to discuss the effectiveness of the session and identify what needs to be followed up in future sessions or in writing.
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have taken a number of steps to contribute to the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill (further details are provided in p
defaultaragraph
defaults 22-23
default below). 
defaultWe note that f
defaultour Members of this Committee were
default appointed to
default the Public Bill Committee exam
defaultining the Bill. 
defaultT
defaulthis undoubtedly contributed to the expertise of the Committee scrutinising this imp
defaultortant piece of legislation
default and, indeed, 
defaultprovided valuable insights for the Members involved
default. However, we do note that
default t
defaulthe burden placed on th
defaulte
default Members 
defaultconc
defaulterned 
defaultwas considerable and allowances h
defaultad to be made in scheduling our 
defaultprogramme.
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default agreed to appoint Gisela Stuart as
default an
default informal rapporteur 
defaulton
default the FCO Balance of Competences Review: Foreign Policy Report.
default She maintained a wa
defaulttching brief for the Committee on this work.
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have been mindful of the Liaison Committee’s recommendations on keeping reports short and accessible without too many recommendations.
default However, 
defaultwe have
default otherwise decided against altering the general style of 
defaultour
default reports, including the manner in which recommendations are highlighted.
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere have been a number of occasions on which 
defaultwe have
default taken further action pursuant 
defaultto Government res
defaultponses to 
defaultour
default reports. 
defaultWe
default criticised the Government response to 
defaultour
default report on 
defaultthe 
defaultArmed Forces Covenant in Action?
default:
default Military Casualties
default, specifically in the areas of Service family support and the long term needs associated with brain injury. 
defaultWe
default issued a press notice highlighting these deficiencies and followed up these matters with Ministers via correspondence and a progress review after six months. Similarly, following receipt of the Government response 
defaultto our
default report
defaults on
default 
defaultFuture 
defaultMaritime Surveil
defaultlance
default, 
defaultDefence and Cyber-
default security
default and 
defaultOperations in Afghanistan
default, 
defaultwe wrote
default to
default the MoD to highlight areas where the response
defaults
default failed to address particular conclusions and recommendations.
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have
default for some time adopted the practice of holding a re
defaultgular follow-up of 
defaultour
default reports, 
defaultsix months after publication of the Government response. 
defaultWe wish to place on record the MoD’s readiness to assist 
defaultus
default in this work, including its submission of a follow-up paper on 
defaultour
default report on 
defaultFuture 
defaultMaritime Surveillance
default b
defaultefore it had actually been commissioned 
default(as noted above, we had been critical of the initial Government response)
default. 
defaultWe also note the very full and constructive follow-up paper that was provided by the MoD on 
defaultour
default report on 
defaultThe Armed Forces Covenant in Action
default?: Accommodation.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the process of following up our report from February 2012 into 
defaultDeveloping threats: Electro-magnetic pulses
default, the Committee initiated a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the threats posed by a possible space weather event or
default an
default attack 
defaultcausing an
default electro-magnetic pulse 
defaultevent
default. We were concerned that analysis of this emerging threat should be given a high priority within Government
default; we have published correspondence arising from our meeting with the Prime Minister, detailing actions
default that he has taken in response to the session, on our website. 
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have taken steps to apply for debates in backbench time, securing a debate 
defaultin the House 
defaulton Armed Forces Personnel on 6 December 2012.
default This debate was centred around a number of the 
defaultCommittee’s publications, including its reports on 
defaultThe Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Military Casualties; The Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Accommodation; and  the Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2010-11
default and evidence taken on the wor
defaultk of the Service Complaints Commissioner of the Armed Forces. Further details of 
defaultour
default contribution to informing debate in the House and in Westminster Hall is provided at paragraph 
default28
default.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are currently engaged in a series of strands of activity building towards a major report in 2014 
defaultto inform
default the next Strategic Defence and Security Review. Whilst this document is now produced within the Cabinet Office, it
defaults significance for the
default identification of threats to the UK and
default decisions relating to the allocation of resour
defaultces within Government will be fundamental. It will therefore have a key role in determining the future of the 
defaultA
defaultrmed 
defaultF
defaultorces after 2015, and 
defaultwe hope 
defaultto have a significant input into the process.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur report on 
defaultDefence and Cyber-Security
default has formed part of our important analysis of the emerging threats to UK security. 
defaultThe 
defaultinquiry explored whether the high profile given to the cyber-threat in the UK is m
defaultatched by a coherent plan and chain of command in the event of a major cyber-attack on our national infrastructure or our national interests.
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe undertook a major report into 
defaultFuture Maritime Surveillance
default in response to the decision announced in the 
defaultSDSR 2010 to cancel the Nimrod MRA4 programme. Rather than revisit the cancellation of Nimrod, we  examined the implications of the decision for future maritime surveillance capabilities and assessed how the resultant capability gap would be managed. This 
defaultincluded an assessment of the strategic requirements for military and non-military maritime surveillance capabilities, the various ways they are provided currently and in the future and how this would be incorporated into work on the next National Security
default Strategy and next Strategic Defence and Security Review. A particular area of focus was cross-government cooperation, including the work of the Maritime Security Oversight Group and the National Maritime Information Centre.    
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe continue to place a high priority on our work in scrutinising the Ministry of Defe
defaultnce’s Annual Report and Accounts, and the Department’s Estimates. The Report on 
defaultthe 
defaultMinistry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2011-12 highlighted
default the repeated qualification of the MoD Accounts; weak financial management information and the paucity of information provided in the Annual Report.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur reports on the MoD’s supplementary estimate for 2012-13 and its main estimate for 2013-14 noted 
defaultthe im
defaultportance of the Treasury continuing to fund the additional costs of operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere and welcomed the use of the Budget Exchange Mechanism.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have not had any draft Bills to consider during the period covered by this 
defaultmemorandum
default.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur
default work has contributed to informing the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill. 
defaultThe Committee’s report on 
defaultDefence Acquisition
default was tagged on the Order Paper to the Second Reading debate on the Bill wh
defaultich provides for a
default legislative framework for the establishment of a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GoC
defaulto
default) 
defaultbody
default to manage defence acquisition
default. 
defaultOur
default inquiry 
defaultraised a number of 
defaultimportant 
defaultquestions
default around the proposals,
default particularly relating to future go
defaultvernance; 
defaultwhether problems would arise if a non-UK company were given responsibility for UK defence acquisition
default;
default and whether sufficient consultation with allies had taken place.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Bill also provides for reforms of the UK Reserve Forces. The Committee i
defaults currently undertaking an inquiry into 
defaultFuture Army 2020
default, and the Government’s plans to increase its reliance on 
defaultR
defaulteserve 
defaultF
defaultorces. Whilst the Committee is unlikely to have reported before this Bill leaves the Commons, we anticipate that the evidence that it 
defaulthas so far taken will help to inform debate, and we will be asking for this to be tagged to the Order Paper
default for the report stage and third reading debates
default.
default 
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Armed Forces Act 2011 
defaultplaced a requirement on the Secretary of State 
defaultfor Defence to make an annual statement to Parliament on the operation of the military covenant. This was the first legislative commitment pertaining to services provided to support service personnel. 
defaultWe have
default undertaken a series of inquiries 
defaulton the theme o
defaultf
default 
defaultThe Armed Forces Covenant in action?
default, examining military casualties, accommodation, education of 
defaultS
defaultervice personnel and the education of children of 
defaultS
defaultervice personnel. 
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDefence Committees have taken a keen interest for many years in the operation and effectiveness of the Service complaints process and the work of the Service Complaints Commissioner for the Armed Forces which was established under the Armed Forces Act 2006
default. 
defaultWe
default conducted a
defaultn
default  inquiry into the work of the Commissioner, concluding that there was a lack of confidence among Service personnel in the complaints system and that the system was not working effectively or efficiently. 
defaultWe
default also examined the role of the C
defaultommissioner and recommended that the 
defaultrole
default should change to
default that of
default an Armed Forces Ombudsman. As a consequence of 
defaultour
default report and the Commissioner’s annual report, discussions are ongoing between the MoD and the Commissioner to revise her role and to improv
defaulte the efficiency and effectiveness of the Service complaints system.
default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have
default been asked for a
default formal
default opinion by the European Scrutiny Committee on 
defaulta Commission Communication on 
defaultTowards a more competitive and efficient defence and security
default sector
default.
default 
defaultWe have
default undertaken to provide this opinion by the end of October.
default28.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have
default not been required to undertake a formal pre-appointment hearing during the period covered by this paper
default, although we are expecting to hold a pre-appointment hea
defaultring with the proposed new Service Complaints Commissioner in the near future
default.
default We have also
default held 
defaultevidence sessions
default with
default the new Chief of 
defaultthe 
defaultDefence Staff
default and
default the 
defaultnew Permanent Under Secretary at the Ministry of Defence.
default 
default29.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to the debates and tags mentioned above, 
defaultour
default report on Future Maritime Surveillance was the subject of a debate in Westminster Hall in February this year.
default Evidence taken by the Committee during its inquiry on 
defaultFuture Army 2020
default was tagged to the 
defaultdebate on Defence Reforms allocated by the Backbench Business Committee, initiated by John Baron MP.
