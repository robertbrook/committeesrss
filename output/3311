[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Defence 
[normal]Committee’s work during the period since Easter 2012 has continued to focus strongly on continuing operations in Afghanistan and preparations for the drawdown of the UK military 
[normal]commitment in 2014.
[normal] 
[normal]We
[normal] published 
[normal]a
[normal] major report on 
[normal]Securing the Future of Afghanistan 
[normal] in March 2013; during the course of this inquiry 
[normal]we
[normal] 
[normal]travelled to
[normal] Afghanistan in November 2012, visiting Kabul and Helmand. 
[normal]We are
[normal] also conducting another visit to Afghan
[normal]istan
[normal] and Pakistan
[normal] in the autumn of this year.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to focussing on ongoing operations, we have also been looking ahead to
[normal] the 2015 Strateg
[normal]ic Defence and Security Review
[normal] (SDSR)
[normal], continuing to assess the
[normal] success and 
[normal]effect
[normal]s
[normal] of implementation of the
[normal] 2010 SDSR and assessing em
[normal]erging threats such as cyber
[normal], which will form an important part of the next Review. We have also focussed on 
[normal]the operation
[normal] of the Armed Forces Covenant
[normal] and how the Ministry of Defence is managing within its financial settlement, 
[normal]in particular scrutinising steps taken to improve the efficiency of its equipment 
[normal]acquisition
[normal]. 
[normal]We
[normal] visited Washington in May this year in the context of 
[normal]our
[normal] 
[normal]work on preparing for the next SDSR and 
[normal]our
[normal] work on Afghanistan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We
[normal] also completed a major report o
[normal]n the 
[normal]defence 
[normal]implications of Scottish independence
[normal] with the intention of helping to inform debate in the run-up to the referendum next year.
[normal] 
[normal]We visited Scotland d
[normal]uring the course of this inquiry
[normal].
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Defence Committee has on a number of occasions in the past held seminars to discuss its future programme. The last of these sessions was held at the 
[normal]Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in Oc
[normal]tober 2012, and provided an opportunity for 
[normal]us
[normal], 
[normal]our
[normal] staff and specialist advisers, to engage with academics and others including the Chief of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Defence Staff to identify a programme for the remainder of the Parliament. 
[normal] 
[normal]We
[normal] took the unusual step of publis
[normal]hing 
[normal]this programme in a press release on 10 December 2012 with the intention 
[normal]of
[normal] stimulating comment and engagement with outside bodies
[normal] and commentators
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have
[normal] not had occasion to commission specific pieces of research, but 
[normal]we 
[normal]continue to receive treme
[normal]ndous support from RUSI. In the context of ongoing work on 
[normal]Towards the next Defence and Security Review, 
[normal]the Committee has been extremely grateful for work 
[normal]undertaken
[normal] by RUSI to encourage academics to engage with the inquiry and contribute material, some o
[normal]f which may be used as evidence.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]In approaching this 
[normal]work we
[normal] decided to pursue four different strands of inquiry that will feed into 
[normal]a
[normal] major 
[normal]piece of 
[normal]work next year on the SDSR. Each of these strands – which are initially “paper-based” inquiries -  is bei
[normal]ng led by different Member
[normal]s
[normal] of the Committee who will act as “rapporteur
[normal]s
[normal]”.
[normal] The
[normal] reports on the
[normal]se strands will be drawn together with other material to inform a major report next year. This represents a new long-term strategic approach for the Committee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]e have
[normal] for some time adopted the practice of holding formal planning meetings prior to the commencement of each inquiry with the intention of identifying 
[normal]from whom we want to take 
[normal]evidence, 
[normal]what 
[normal]we are
[normal] seeking to achieve and ensuring that proper considerat
[normal]ion has been given to the timing of publication
[normal] of reports
[normal]. 
[normal]As part of our development of a long-term communications plan, we held a briefing for Defence editors to
[normal] accompany the launch of 
[normal]our
[normal] forward programme in December 2012.
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Commi
[normal]ttee has taken a number of steps to explore di
[normal]fferent ways of taking evidence as well as engaging with a wider audience. In the context of
[normal] our
[normal] inquiry into 
[normal]Future Army 2020
[normal], 
[normal] the Army Rumour Service 
[normal](AR
[normal]S
[normal]SE) 
[normal]is hosting
[normal] a web forum seeking views on 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government
[normal]’s plans for the future of the A
[normal]rmy, with the intention of informing questions for 
[normal]our
[normal] evidence sessions.
[normal] It is often difficult for 
[normal]us
[normal] to obtain the views of Service personnel on matters that affect them and the forum 
[normal]provided an invaluable oppor
[normal]tunity to do so
[normal]. 
[normal]We are extremely grateful to the House of Commons Digital Outreach Team for their help in setting up the forum and using it to 
[normal]provide ongoing help in engaging 
[normal]S
[normal]ervice personnel wi
[normal]th wider parliamentary activities. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We
[normal] took
[normal] oral evidence
[normal] from children, parents and teachers
[normal] at Wellington Academy, Tidworth,
[normal] as part of 
[normal]our
[normal] inquiry into the 
[normal]Armed Forces Covenant
[normal] in Action?
[normal]: Educating the children of Service Personnel
[normal]. 
[normal] We would like to put on record again our gratitude firstly to the children
[normal], parents and teachers we met and also to the school authorities for facilitating this session. 
[normal]We
[normal] also made use of web for
[normal]a
[normal] hosted by the NAO 
[normal]to
[normal] solicit evidence from Service p
[normal]ersonnel
[normal] and their families
[normal] directly in relation to 
[normal]this 
[normal]inquiry 
[normal]and also our i
[normal]nquiry 
[normal]into the 
[normal]Armed Forces Covenant
[normal] in Action?
[normal]: Education of Service Personnel
[normal].
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We
[normal] 
[normal]undertook professional 
[normal]training on 
[normal]improving questioning techniques
[normal]. 
[normal]We
[normal] held 
[normal]two
[normal] session
[normal]s with a trainer
[normal], analysing some of 
[normal]our
[normal] past performances 
[normal]in questioning high profile witnesses, and working to identify which approaches to questioning worked best
[normal].
[normal] This was a challenging and worthwhile exercise which we hope has had a positive impact on our 
[normal]work
[normal].
[normal] It has also inspired us to hold regular private “wash-up” sessions after each evidence session to discuss the effectiveness of the session and identify what needs to be followed up in future sessions or in writing.
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have taken a number of steps to contribute to the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill (further details are provided in p
[normal]aragraph
[normal]s 22-23
[normal] below). 
[normal]We note that f
[normal]our Members of this Committee were
[normal] appointed to
[normal] the Public Bill Committee exam
[normal]ining the Bill. 
[normal]T
[normal]his undoubtedly contributed to the expertise of the Committee scrutinising this imp
[normal]ortant piece of legislation
[normal] and, indeed, 
[normal]provided valuable insights for the Members involved
[normal]. However, we do note that
[normal] t
[normal]he burden placed on th
[normal]e
[normal] Members 
[normal]conc
[normal]erned 
[normal]was considerable and allowances h
[normal]ad to be made in scheduling our 
[normal]programme.
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We
[normal] agreed to appoint Gisela Stuart as
[normal] an
[normal] informal rapporteur 
[normal]on
[normal] the FCO Balance of Competences Review: Foreign Policy Report.
[normal] She maintained a wa
[normal]tching brief for the Committee on this work.
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have been mindful of the Liaison Committee’s recommendations on keeping reports short and accessible without too many recommendations.
[normal] However, 
[normal]we have
[normal] otherwise decided against altering the general style of 
[normal]our
[normal] reports, including the manner in which recommendations are highlighted.
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There have been a number of occasions on which 
[normal]we have
[normal] taken further action pursuant 
[normal]to Government res
[normal]ponses to 
[normal]our
[normal] reports. 
[normal]We
[normal] criticised the Government response to 
[normal]our
[normal] report on 
[normal]the 
[normal]Armed Forces Covenant in Action?
[normal]:
[normal] Military Casualties
[normal], specifically in the areas of Service family support and the long term needs associated with brain injury. 
[normal]We
[normal] issued a press notice highlighting these deficiencies and followed up these matters with Ministers via correspondence and a progress review after six months. Similarly, following receipt of the Government response 
[normal]to our
[normal] report
[normal]s on
[normal] 
[normal]Future 
[normal]Maritime Surveil
[normal]lance
[normal], 
[normal]Defence and Cyber-
[normal] security
[normal] and 
[normal]Operations in Afghanistan
[normal], 
[normal]we wrote
[normal] to
[normal] the MoD to highlight areas where the response
[normal]s
[normal] failed to address particular conclusions and recommendations.
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have
[normal] for some time adopted the practice of holding a re
[normal]gular follow-up of 
[normal]our
[normal] reports, 
[normal]six months after publication of the Government response. 
[normal]We wish to place on record the MoD’s readiness to assist 
[normal]us
[normal] in this work, including its submission of a follow-up paper on 
[normal]our
[normal] report on 
[normal]Future 
[normal]Maritime Surveillance
[normal] b
[normal]efore it had actually been commissioned 
[normal](as noted above, we had been critical of the initial Government response)
[normal]. 
[normal]We also note the very full and constructive follow-up paper that was provided by the MoD on 
[normal]our
[normal] report on 
[normal]The Armed Forces Covenant in Action
[normal]?: Accommodation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the process of following up our report from February 2012 into 
[normal]Developing threats: Electro-magnetic pulses
[normal], the Committee initiated a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the threats posed by a possible space weather event or
[normal] an
[normal] attack 
[normal]causing an
[normal] electro-magnetic pulse 
[normal]event
[normal]. We were concerned that analysis of this emerging threat should be given a high priority within Government
[normal]; we have published correspondence arising from our meeting with the Prime Minister, detailing actions
[normal] that he has taken in response to the session, on our website. 
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have taken steps to apply for debates in backbench time, securing a debate 
[normal]in the House 
[normal]on Armed Forces Personnel on 6 December 2012.
[normal] This debate was centred around a number of the 
[normal]Committee’s publications, including its reports on 
[normal]The Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Military Casualties; The Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Accommodation; and  the Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2010-11
[normal] and evidence taken on the wor
[normal]k of the Service Complaints Commissioner of the Armed Forces. Further details of 
[normal]our
[normal] contribution to informing debate in the House and in Westminster Hall is provided at paragraph 
[normal]28
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are currently engaged in a series of strands of activity building towards a major report in 2014 
[normal]to inform
[normal] the next Strategic Defence and Security Review. Whilst this document is now produced within the Cabinet Office, it
[normal]s significance for the
[normal] identification of threats to the UK and
[normal] decisions relating to the allocation of resour
[normal]ces within Government will be fundamental. It will therefore have a key role in determining the future of the 
[normal]A
[normal]rmed 
[normal]F
[normal]orces after 2015, and 
[normal]we hope 
[normal]to have a significant input into the process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our report on 
[normal]Defence and Cyber-Security
[normal] has formed part of our important analysis of the emerging threats to UK security. 
[normal]The 
[normal]inquiry explored whether the high profile given to the cyber-threat in the UK is m
[normal]atched by a coherent plan and chain of command in the event of a major cyber-attack on our national infrastructure or our national interests.
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We undertook a major report into 
[normal]Future Maritime Surveillance
[normal] in response to the decision announced in the 
[normal]SDSR 2010 to cancel the Nimrod MRA4 programme. Rather than revisit the cancellation of Nimrod, we  examined the implications of the decision for future maritime surveillance capabilities and assessed how the resultant capability gap would be managed. This 
[normal]included an assessment of the strategic requirements for military and non-military maritime surveillance capabilities, the various ways they are provided currently and in the future and how this would be incorporated into work on the next National Security
[normal] Strategy and next Strategic Defence and Security Review. A particular area of focus was cross-government cooperation, including the work of the Maritime Security Oversight Group and the National Maritime Information Centre.    
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We continue to place a high priority on our work in scrutinising the Ministry of Defe
[normal]nce’s Annual Report and Accounts, and the Department’s Estimates. The Report on 
[normal]the 
[normal]Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2011-12 highlighted
[normal] the repeated qualification of the MoD Accounts; weak financial management information and the paucity of information provided in the Annual Report.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our reports on the MoD’s supplementary estimate for 2012-13 and its main estimate for 2013-14 noted 
[normal]the im
[normal]portance of the Treasury continuing to fund the additional costs of operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere and welcomed the use of the Budget Exchange Mechanism.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have not had any draft Bills to consider during the period covered by this 
[normal]memorandum
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our
[normal] work has contributed to informing the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill. 
[normal]The Committee’s report on 
[normal]Defence Acquisition
[normal] was tagged on the Order Paper to the Second Reading debate on the Bill wh
[normal]ich provides for a
[normal] legislative framework for the establishment of a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GoC
[normal]o
[normal]) 
[normal]body
[normal] to manage defence acquisition
[normal]. 
[normal]Our
[normal] inquiry 
[normal]raised a number of 
[normal]important 
[normal]questions
[normal] around the proposals,
[normal] particularly relating to future go
[normal]vernance; 
[normal]whether problems would arise if a non-UK company were given responsibility for UK defence acquisition
[normal];
[normal] and whether sufficient consultation with allies had taken place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Bill also provides for reforms of the UK Reserve Forces. The Committee i
[normal]s currently undertaking an inquiry into 
[normal]Future Army 2020
[normal], and the Government’s plans to increase its reliance on 
[normal]R
[normal]eserve 
[normal]F
[normal]orces. Whilst the Committee is unlikely to have reported before this Bill leaves the Commons, we anticipate that the evidence that it 
[normal]has so far taken will help to inform debate, and we will be asking for this to be tagged to the Order Paper
[normal] for the report stage and third reading debates
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Armed Forces Act 2011 
[normal]placed a requirement on the Secretary of State 
[normal]for Defence to make an annual statement to Parliament on the operation of the military covenant. This was the first legislative commitment pertaining to services provided to support service personnel. 
[normal]We have
[normal] undertaken a series of inquiries 
[normal]on the theme o
[normal]f
[normal] 
[normal]The Armed Forces Covenant in action?
[normal], examining military casualties, accommodation, education of 
[normal]S
[normal]ervice personnel and the education of children of 
[normal]S
[normal]ervice personnel. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Defence Committees have taken a keen interest for many years in the operation and effectiveness of the Service complaints process and the work of the Service Complaints Commissioner for the Armed Forces which was established under the Armed Forces Act 2006
[normal]. 
[normal]We
[normal] conducted a
[normal]n
[normal]  inquiry into the work of the Commissioner, concluding that there was a lack of confidence among Service personnel in the complaints system and that the system was not working effectively or efficiently. 
[normal]We
[normal] also examined the role of the C
[normal]ommissioner and recommended that the 
[normal]role
[normal] should change to
[normal] that of
[normal] an Armed Forces Ombudsman. As a consequence of 
[normal]our
[normal] report and the Commissioner’s annual report, discussions are ongoing between the MoD and the Commissioner to revise her role and to improv
[normal]e the efficiency and effectiveness of the Service complaints system.
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have
[normal] been asked for a
[normal] formal
[normal] opinion by the European Scrutiny Committee on 
[normal]a Commission Communication on 
[normal]Towards a more competitive and efficient defence and security
[normal] sector
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We have
[normal] undertaken to provide this opinion by the end of October.
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have
[normal] not been required to undertake a formal pre-appointment hearing during the period covered by this paper
[normal], although we are expecting to hold a pre-appointment hea
[normal]ring with the proposed new Service Complaints Commissioner in the near future
[normal].
[normal] We have also
[normal] held 
[normal]evidence sessions
[normal] with
[normal] the new Chief of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Defence Staff
[normal] and
[normal] the 
[normal]new Permanent Under Secretary at the Ministry of Defence.
[normal] 
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to the debates and tags mentioned above, 
[normal]our
[normal] report on Future Maritime Surveillance was the subject of a debate in Westminster Hall in February this year.
[normal] Evidence taken by the Committee during its inquiry on 
[normal]Future Army 2020
[normal] was tagged to the 
[normal]debate on Defence Reforms allocated by the Backbench Business Committee, initiated by John Baron MP.
[normal]October 2013
