"              Written evidence submitted by BIS Sustainability Champion&#xa0;\nThe committee were keen to see the formal terms of reference of both my role as BIS sustainability champion and the recently formed BIS sustainability committee which I chair. These terms of reference are attached at Annex A.\n&#xa0;\nThe committee also asked whether sustainability training was provided by BIS. As my answer on the day indicated, the department does not provide bespoke sustainability training to staff. However, training is available for staff involved in the policy making process, for example on how to construct impact assessment drawing on HMT’s green book. This includes reference to the need to consider economic, social and environmental impacts. DECC run modules on a variety of aspects of carbon, climate change and energy, which are open to all civil servants. I also understand that DEFRA are working with civil service learning to develop an e-learning module on sustainability. \n&#xa0;\nI also include a copy of the Regional Growth Fund application form. The form is attached at Annex B (an\nd has been sent electronically)\n The guidance for the document is embedded electronically by hovering over the specific questions. The relevant question in this case is I02, where the following pop-up appears “e.g. benefits to the environment, improvements to transport networks and journey times, scientific advances”. The application form itself is designed to be light touch and is therefore deliberately concise. However, applicants are expected to submit a supporting document alongside their bid in which they articulate the case for supporting their bid. As my colleague, Alex Wilson, said in giving evidence to the committee, the overarching objective of the appraisal, in line with HMT green book guidance, is to fairly set out all of the costs and benefits of each project on an appropriately discounted and risk adjusted basis. \n&#xa0;\nFinally, I attach a copy of all eleven sector strategies as well as the analysis paper published on 11 September alongside the Industrial Strategy Summit.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex ABIS Sustainability Champion terms of reference&#xa0;\nThe following terms of reference were signed off by the BIS Operations Committee at the beginning of August 2013. \n&#xa0;\nThe BIS Sustainability Champion has been appointed by the Executive Board in order to provide the visible leadership to ensure that the Department fulfils its sustainability commitments and embeds sustainability in its policy making. \n&#xa0;\nThe Sustainability Champion will: \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure appropriate levels of governance and decision making are in place to deliver on BIS’s sustainability commitments (operational and policy);\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair the BIS Sustainability Committee with DG Finance and Commercial;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRepresent BIS in wider cross-government sustainability fora;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChampion and support the sustainability related initiatives and activities of the voluntary BIS Green Guardians network;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReport regularly through the Sustainability Committee to the Operations Committee and Executive Board on progress and performance.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBIS Sustainability Committee&#xa0;\nThe following terms of reference were signed off by the BIS Operations Committee at the beginning of August 2013 and issued following a the first meeting of the Sustainability Committee at the beginning of September 2013. \n&#xa0;\nRemitThe purpose of the Sustainability Committee is to support the Executive Board in providing leadership, co-ordination and guidance to BIS in fulfilling the Department’s sustainability commitments as set out in the Business Plan and Greening Government commitments and embedding sustainability principles in BIS policy making.\n&#xa0;\nThe Director General Finance and Commercial is accountable to the Executive Board for the Department’s sustainability performance, supported by the Board appointed Sustainability Champion. The Committee reports to the Executive Board through the Operations Committee, who act on behalf of the Executive Board. \n&#xa0;\nThe Department’s sustainability commitments fall under three themes: policy, operations and procurement. Each of these themes is represented through SCS level membership on the Committee. The Committee also has representation from the voluntary BIS Green Guardians network.\n&#xa0;Definition of SustainabilitySustainable development means encouraging economic growth while protecting the environment and improving our quality of life - all without affecting the ability of future generations to do the same. \nThe Sustainability Committee will oversee how BIS takes account of sustainable development as a part of how it develops its policies, how it runs its operations and how it buys its goods and services. \nTaking account of sustainability in policy making includes considering environmental, social and economic impact of policy. Achieving sustainability also includes policies that contribute to economic rebalancing – across sectors and places, moving to a low carbon economy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster resilience, and resource efficiency.\n&#xa0;MembershipBIS Sustainability Champion (Chair)\nDG Finance and Commercial (Board Sponsor)\n              \nHead of Procurement, Shared Business Services (Procurement)\nDirector of Property Asset Management (SBS) \nHead of BIS Better Regulation Unit (Policy)\nHead of Green Economy Unit (Policy)\nHead of Business Planning (Policy)\nHead of \nBIS Ways\n of Working unit (Policy and Operations)\nRepresentative of the BIS Green Guardians Network\nSustainability Co-ordinator (Secretary)\n&#xa0;Responsibilities/activitiesThe BIS Sustainability Committee will: \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
