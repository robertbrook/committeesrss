"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nLincolnshire \nCounty Council\n (WRT 001)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBackgrounda)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLincolnshire precautionary salts 3008 km out of 8960km.  34%\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHas a\n defined network of footways that are treated – when resources are available.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCycle tracks are not \nroutinely \ntreated\n except as part of our severe weather response.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite significant reduction in overall highways budgets the winter service has been protec\nted \nas well as\n increased to take account of inflationary pressures\n.  \nThe \nw\ninter s\nervice\n is\n financed for 85 turnouts and 2 snow days which this winter \nresults in\n a budget of\n £\n4.65\nm\n with a\nn\n \nAdverse Weather \nReserve Fund\n of £1m\n.\n  For\n the \nwinter\n of 2012/2013 the budget \nwas \nset \nat\n £\n4.57m with a final outturn of\n £6.53m\n which has been fully funded by the county council out of \nfinancial \nreserves.\n2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResiliencea)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLincolnshire, like most authorities, is prepared for and copes with severe winter weather as d\nemonstrated during the winter of 2012/2013.  However an extreme winter event on the scale of 1963\n,\n with its prolonged low temperatures and heavy snowfall\n,\n would \ncause massive disruption especially to food distribution \nespecially \ndue\n to \"just in time\" stock\n distribution.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLincolnsh\nire continues to be heavily inv\nolved in nationally implementing the \nQuarmby\n Review by its chairmanship of the \nNational Winter Service Research Group (\nNWSRG\n)\n.\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing recommendations contained within the \nQuarmby\n Review the \nNWSRG ha\ns become a sub group of the \nUK Roads Board (\nUKR\nB)\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough its chairmanship of the NWSRG Lincolnshire has instigate\nd\n a fundamental review of\n national\n highway winter\n maintenance practices which\n has resulted in \nthe \nimplementation of \na \ncompletely new national \ncode.  Appendix H, the Winter Code, of Well Maintained Highways was issued on the \n18th\n \nSeptember 2013\n as announced by\n Norman Baker the \nParliamentary \nUnder\n Secretary of State for Transport\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLincolnshire review\ns\n its winter maintenance plan annually and take\ns\n into ac\ncount \nchanges to \nnational good practice and continues to \nexplore\n alternative\n de-icing products and processes.\n&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat lessons have been learned since the winter of 2009-2010?a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA major learning point has been a realisation by the public and industry \nal\nike \nthat l\nocal \nhighway \nauthorities cannot do everything on their own in time\ns\n of severe winter weather and \nthat \nthey need community help.  \ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLincolnshire has engaged with all tiers of local government from District Authorities, Parish Councils and Community Groups.  \nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll these groups have been encouraged to engage with Lincolnshire County Council on mutual aid and self-help arrangements\n, althou\ngh there has only been a 25% take up by Parish Councils to this process\n.\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic engagement has been encouraged especially on snow clearance of carriageways and footways following clarity on the legal situation contained within the \nQuarmby\n Review.\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMutual ai\nd arrangements are also in place with all the main hospitals in the county including accident and emergency centres.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic expectations would \nalso \nappear to \nbe becoming more realistic during severe \nwinter \nweather events.\n  This \nhas been helped by\n a more re\nalistic and pro-active response from both local and national radio and TV.\n \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLike many authorities Lincolnshire has engaged with \nthe \ntravelling public by the use of \nGritter\n \nTwitter \nas the main way of disseminating overnight operations and issues.\n4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow well prepareda)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLincolnshire through its external \npartners has\n \nplaced\n \n29 new replacement \ngritters\n into the fleet over the last two years. \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLincolnshire has increased its salt stock holdings at the start of winter season from 23,000 tonnes to 35,000 tonnes.\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis e\nquates to 87\n runs\n at 20gms dry (400 tonnes) which is the maximum treatment for snow or 175 runs at 15gms pre-wet (200 tonnes) the average for precautionary salting.\n \nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt also aims to keep a minimum stock holding of 10,000 tonnes at any one time during the w\ninter.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n25% of the county \nis \nnow \nprecautionary\n salted utilising Agricultural Bi Products (ABP's) in the pre-wetting process – a UK first.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany changes have taken place over the last few years but further changes are required but unfortunately these are \noutwith\n the powers of local authorities to implement such as :\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDerogation of certain rules and regulations so that winter gritting can take place more effectively.  This would include the relaxation of \ndrivers\n hours regulations by making winter gritting an\nd emergency activity.\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDerogation of 28 tonne vehicles for winter activities which would increase the number of haulage and construction vehicles that coul\nd be utilised in severe weather\n with slot in spreaders.\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContinue with the practice of allowing dedicat\ned winter maintenance vehicles to use rebated fuel (Red Diesel) for winter operations.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
