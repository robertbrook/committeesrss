default1.2
default              
defaultThe number of people killed or seriously injured needs to be considered relative to a measure of exposure. The 
defaultmeasure of exposure
default used in the table above is the distance cycled. There are two problems with this measure
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis evidence does not make inter-modal comparisons, and distance is a good measure for trend over time. The problem, more clearly shown in Figures 1 and 2 below
default, is that our idea of whether the rate of being killed or injured is increasing or decreasing over time is dependent on whether we place more reliance on the estimates based on the National Travel Survey or the estimates based on the National Road Traffic 
defaultEstimates.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultIt is an open question therefore, as to whether the trend in cyclists being killed and seriously injured has been increasing or decreasing over time. ICE is aware that the issue of the accuracy of the estimates for the number of cycle
default kilometres travelled is one which the Department for Transport is currently considering.
default 
defaultRecommendation 1: The Department for Transport should be urged to move quickly towards being able to make more accurate estimates of the disdefaulttance cycled so that meanidefaultngful cycle casualty exposure measures can be derived.default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultThe 
defaultTransport Select Committee 
defaultasks 
defaultwhether cycling is safe
default:
default On the one hand, the answer to the question lies in the minds of those
default who
default might choose to cycle, or who might choose 
defaultnot 
defaultto cycle. On 
defaultthe other hand, the answer might lie in deciding whether the rate at which cyclists are killed and seriously injured lies above or below some arbitrary threshold. Taking either the standpoint of the potential traveller, or the standpoint of policy makers, 
defaultit is clear that it would be highly desirable to create conditions which make our towns and cities more attractive and comfortable to cycle around, and through doing so, will make them also safer. We cannot be complacent about the current rate of injury an
defaultd death and we need to consider ways of reducing risk to cycle users, as well as all users.
default 
default 
defaultRecommendation 2: defaultCdefaultlear defaultnational objectives and targets need to be established and backed with appropriate resources, leadership and will, so that local interpretadefaulttion and implementation is effective.default&#xa0;
default2. default              defaultWhat central and local Government could do to improve cycling safety? default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultCycling 
defaulthas advantages over other modes mainly over shorter journey distances up to perhaps 5 miles
default (
defaultor 
defaultperhaps 
default10 miles for a proportion
default of the population who are fit and able
default)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe Highways Agency does 
defaultalso 
defaultneed to consider the needs of cycle users, particularly where 
defaultthe
default 
defaultmotorway and trunk road system causes severance.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultT
defaulthe action
defaults
default that local highway authorities 
default(and the Highwa
defaultys Agency) 
defaulttake 
defaultstem directly from 
defaultthe direction and leadership that they see emanating from central government. 
defaultThe 
defaultICE 
defaultthinks 
defaultthat national 
defaultdirection
default and
default leadership needs to be provided on 
defaultdesign guidance 
defaultwhich is still currently developing 
defaultfor provision
default for cycle traffic
default. The
default ICE is aware that the Department for Transport is considering its approach on 
defaultthis issue at the present time. 
defaultRecommendation 3: The Department for Transport provides leadership in design guidance which is still currently developing.default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultThere is some excellent experience now available across a wide range of local authorities on designing highway infrastructure and managing that infrastructure through appropriate traffic regulation orders in such a way as to promote cycling and also 
defaultto 
defaultmake cycling safer. There are also some very poor examples of changes which have been made to the highway network which neither support the needs of cyclists, nor make cycling safer. The
default ICE recommends that the 
defaultlimited extent, continuity and quality of 
defaultcurrent 
defaultcycl
defaulting
default infra
defaultstructure should be addressed as follows
default:
default&#xa0;
default3default.  default              defaultWhether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other rdefaultoad users, defaultidefaultncluding, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultWe answer this question by first briefly reviewing the nature of provision in Northern Europe.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultIn 
defaultthe 
defaultNetherlands, there is more of an emphasis than 
defaulthas been apparent to date in the UK on routes and lanes which are separate from motor traffic. This is particularly the case where motor traffic speeds and volumes are higher. This ‘segregation’ has become a main focus of discussion about cycling provision
default, particularly in London, and is commonly discussed in the context of roundabout design (for example, the ‘Dutch style roundabouts’ currently being trialled by the Transport Research Laboratory for Transport for London).  Arguably the more important featur
defaulte of cycling provision in The Netherlands is the nature of the comprehensive networks for cycle users.  These routes tend to be more direct, remove difficult barriers to movement, and above all are networks where it is quicker and easier to use the bike bi
defaultcycle than the car.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultDenmark,
default on the other hand, are more prepared to mix cycle traffic with motor traffic. This is characterised at traffic signal controlled junctions where cycle users typically return from a cycle lane kerb-separated from the carria
defaultgeway to join other traffic to progress through junctions.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultClearly there are
default difficulties
default in simply 
defaultapplying 
defaultDutch or Danish approaches to the UK situation.  An important area of difference is the law surrounding traffic management. The UK does not 
defaulthave ‘strict’ or presumed liability in road traffic law, which is where the default assumption is that the driver of a motor vehicle is liable to give compensation in civil law in cases where they collide with vulnerable road users.  Northern Europeans als
defaulto have different rules for the use of the road, for example, helpful time saving protocols at signal controlled junctions where pedestrians and turning traffic can move at the same time, with the traffic giving way where there is conflict.  These differenc
defaultes in law
default, and regulation,
default 
defaultare likely to have been the mechanisms by which 
defaultdifferent culture
defaults
default of responsibility, and hence consequent behaviour
defaults, have been established over a period of time
default.
default 
defaultRecommendation 7default:default defaultICE would defaultencouragedefault defaultinvestigatidefaulton ofdefault defaultpotential defaulttraffic law and regulation defaultchanges which may defaultpermitdefault beneficial change in road user behaviour.default default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultWhile some cities such as Bristol, Cambridge and London have seen significant rises in levels of cycle use in the last decade there are other places, ostensibly with the ready-made infrastructure in place, such as Milton Keynes and Stevenage, where success
default in raising cycling levels has been harder to come by. 
defaultThese significant rises in levels of cycling are to be welcomed, but seemingly the inter-relationships between motor traffic and cycle users have not reached the level of maturity shown in countries wi
defaultth currently high levels of cycle use.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultThe problem with ‘segregated’ cycle routes 
defaultthat have been provided in the UK in the past have been that 
defaulttheir purpose has been to remove cycle traffic from the carriageway, with the point being to provide less hi
defaultndered movement motor traffic on the highway. Unless cycle routes are designed for the needs of cycle users they will remain underused and, as the evidence suggest
defaults
default, no safer than the highway.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultThe problem with provision for cycling historically in th
defaulte UK is that it has always been seen as, a ‘problem’ mode.  
defaultT
defaulthis has been based on the misplaced notion that the activity itself is risky, rather than the surrounding motor vehicles which pose most of the risk. Traffic management has generally been concern
defaulted 
defaultmainly
default with maximizing capacity and minimising delay, but we are 
defaultnow 
defaultseeing recognition that, in fact, appropriate traffic management in many urban areas is well achieved through speed management, such as the introduction of 20mph limits and zones.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultThe challenge now 
defaultis to 
defaulttake the mode seriously enough to make the necessary quality of provision through comprehensive networks which are attractive and comfortable.
default To be well designed for cyclists’ needs, we know from Dutch design guidance what they ne
defaulted to be like: direct, comfortable and attractive. Off-road routes need to be well engineered in geometric terms and have sufficient width. Where routes coincide with routes also available for motor traffic, care needs to be taken in the design to continue
default to provide sufficient safe space for movement.
default Provision within the highway will include areas which are segregated from motor traffic and areas which are integrated with motor traffic. Where segregation exists, particular care needs to be taken to ensure
default that the advantages of speed and flexibility of the bicycle are not lost, and that the points where cycle traffic diverges and merges with motor traffic are safe.
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultSo far as HGVs are concerned, the ICE 
defaulthas 
defaultnot argue
defaultd
default for
default the 
defaultprohibition of HGVs from c
defaultity centres at peak hours
default. This is for reasons linked with the necessity for the goods as well as people to be moved around urban areas to maintain the economic life of urban areas. We do think that we will see changes, however, in how ‘last mile’ delivery is undertaken in the fut
defaulture, with the potential for consolidation centres at urban peripheries where the disadvantages of trans-shipment are outweighed by the advantages of less vehicle mileage wasted 
defaultin 
defaultcongested urban 
defaultconditions
default. We also think there is likely to be further grow
defaultth in cycling being part of the mix of modes providing last mile delivery.
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultContinued pressure should be brought to bear, however, on hauliers training their drivers in schemes such as FORS, which help raise awareness and skill amongst HGV drivers whe
defaultn they are driving in situations where there are many vulnerable road users present.
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default              
defaultThe ICE has been pleased to work with on a draft of Work Related Road Risk Standards for Construction Logistics with Transport for London and others. This document i
defaults currently being finalised and will address some of the issues particularly relevant to construction vehicles. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default12
default              
defaultWith this in mind, 
defaultICE would like to raise issue with the recent 
defaultGovernment announcement for HGV driver training exemption designed 
defaultto cu
defaultt costs and bureaucracy
default, where s
defaulthort distance repair and testing drivers 
defaultare 
defaultto be made exempt from additional professional driving tests and training
default.  
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default              
defaultU
defaultnder current European rules, anyone who drives heavy goods vehicles or buses must complete a C
defaultertificate of Professional Competence but around 76,000 who drive them for short distances, for the purposes of delivering or repairing them, will soon be exempt.
default  Two exemptions, made following a consultation, are to be made this 
defaultautumn
default: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.
default14
default              
defaultICE has wri
defaulttten to Government on this issue, and would again like to express our concern at this exemption.  Regardless of whether mechanics or valets are carrying passengers or goods, it remains that they are still driving heavy vehicles in potentially congested urb
defaultan areas, and should be fully trained to do so.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default15
default              
defaultICE urges the Transport Select Committee to address this issue, as we are concerned at the potential for what we consider to be 
defaultan
default unnecessary change in legislation
default, which we fear could lead to further 
defaultcollisions
default, or at worst, further fatalities
default.
