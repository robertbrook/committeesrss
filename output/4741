[normal]To watch TV from any source we have to pay an impost to a single 
[normal]channel ,
[normal] the BBC. In principle, this seems increasing to many a restriction of a human right to access TV of our choice without having to support a channel whose output we may find politically biased , socially damaging and culturally confused. It is utterly wrong that so much of the BBC recruiting is restricted to the left-wing Guardian newspaper. The BBC, living off an enormous unearned budget of other people's money, is hugely extravagant in disbursing its funds. Its salaries, pensions and pay-offs to senior employees are grossly excessive. It has become a huge bureaucracy which, together with its unaudited wealth, has led it to a belief that it is another estate of the realm. It is complacent and indeed arrogant in its dealings with the public and its many justifiable complaints. 
[normal]( I
[normal] write as one of the few people who has managed to elicit an apology on air from the BBC for inappropriate conduct). Over my life time the BBC has moved from its duty as a source of support to the Nation, a provider of reliable and unbiased news,
[normal] 
[normal]of true cultural values and acceptable entertainment, to a position where it regards itself as the arbiter of our social mores and source of radical change. The BBC is in its present form and with its present ethos is not fit for purpose. It is vast and unwieldy,
[normal] 
[normal]too powerful and too unresponsive,
[normal] 
[normal]and altogether too secretive. It should be made much smaller and provide only an unbiased news service and real culture.
