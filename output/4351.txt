[[[Written evidence submitted by Creative Skillset [FBB0084]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1 Creative Skillset is owned and led by the industry and this is reflected in its governance structure which includes CEOs and senior executives from key companies across the industry, including the BBC - see Appendix 1 for a list of our Board, Patrons and chairs of our main industry skills committees (also available on: www.creativeskillset.org ).

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2 Creative Skillset empowers the Creative Industries to develop skills and talent; we do this by influencing and shaping policy and by securing the vital investment for individuals to become the best in their field and for businesses to grow.&#xa0; As the industry skills body for the Creative Industries, we work across film, television, radio, animation, visual effects, games, fashion, textiles, advertising, marketing communications and publishing. &#xa0;1.3 Creative Skillset leads and chairs the Creative Industries Council Skills Group. The Creative Industries Council (CIC) is a forum for industries and Government to engage in a joined up way to boosting the growth and competitiveness of the creative industries. The CIC has identified talent and skills as one of the key areas where there are barriers to growth facing the sector.&#xa0;1.4 Creative Skillset has had a long and positive partnership with the BBC which involves the corporation at different levels: governance, research and consultation on training solutions, training funds, qualifications, accreditation of courses, industry clusters across the UK. A summary of the main areas of this partnership is outlined in Appendix 2, with some recent examples of our joined work. The BBC contributes financially to the core budget of Creative Skillset, and to the TV Freelance Training Fund. It also invests directly in the workforce engaged by the corporation through the BBC Academy, its training division, and co-invests by offering Apprenticeships. Both Creative Skillset and the BBC are part of the Creative Industries Council and BBC Academy is part of the CIC Skills group, as well as its sub-groups. &#xa0;1.5 Creative Skillset’s partnership with the BBC is formally described in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which was signed in June 2007, following the new terms of the BBC Charter and Framework Agreement. The BBC/Creative Skillset MoU has had a positive impact in driving forward the partnership and Creative Skillset recognises the excellent work and efforts by the current director of BBC Academy (established in 2009) to fulfil the BBC obligations and to develop the partnership.&#xa0;&#xa0;Charter and Framework Agreement2.1 In the process of the 2007 Charter Renewal, DCMS had a wide and open consultation with the industry; one clear message that emerged was the fact that the ability to produce high quality, innovative UK-originated content relies heavily on the ability of the people working in the UK creative media industries to have the talent, skills and capacity to deliver it. This meant that in order for the BBC to fulfil its commitment to quality content that delivers the best service to its audiences it needed to make a commitment to supporting the skills and talent development of its people and of the wider industry, especially as the BBC was now increasing its commissioning of content output through third parties. The DCMS 2005 Green Paper on the Review of the BBC’s Royal Charter concluded that the BBC “plays a crucial role in training the industry and developing new technology and those functions should be sustained”; and continued (paragraph 7.3, page 83):&#xa0;“The BBC should continue to provide training on a significant scale. Its training function should not be seen only as a by-product of its role as a large employer. In preparing and maintaining a highly-skilled media workforce, the BBC’s training programmes make a significant contribution to its public purpose of stimulating creativity. We also welcome the contribution the BBC makes to the development of training across the industry more widely – in particular through Skillset, the sector skills council for the audiovisual industries.” &#xa0;The Green paper also quotes from the Neil Report on how to strengthen BBC Journalism: “as the largest employer of journalists in the UK, the BBC has an obligation to take the lead in strengthening training in craft skills and promoting debate about journalistic standards and ethics in broadcasting”.&#xa0;2.2 From the BBC’s current Public Purposes listed in its Charter the following three are most relevant to this Agenda:

[[[(a) sustaining]]]

[[[ citizenship and civil society -  ]]]

[[[(incl.]]] “

[[[the need to promote media literacy”]]])

[[[(]]]

[[[b)promoting education and learning;]]]

[[[(c)stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;]]]

[[[(d)representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities;]]]&#xa0;2.3 The BBC Framework Agreement  (with new additions to reflect BBC’s wider industry role) stipulates: 

[[[ ]]]

[[[“]]]

[[[84. Training]]](1) The Executive Board must make arrangements for the training and retraining of BBC staff engaged in connection with providing any of the UK Public Services or making programmes for inclusion in any of those services.(2) The training and retraining provided under the arrangements must make an effective contribution to—(a) the promotion of the BBC’s Public Purposes, and in particular that of stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;(b) the preparation and maintenance of a highly-skilled media workforce across the audiovisual industry; and(c) competitiveness and productivity in that industry.(3) The Executive Board shall use its best endeavours to work in partnership with others in the audiovisual industry in the planning and provision of training and retraining across that industry.”

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.4 The Agreement also makes arrangements for reporting on these activities to the BBC Trust:

[[[“85. General provisions about arrangements made under clauses 83 ]]][Equal Opportunities]

[[[ and 84 ]]][Training](1) The Executive Board must—(a) take appropriate steps to make those affected by arrangements made under clauses 83 and 84 aware of them;(b) review those arrangements; and(c) (at least once each year) make a report to the Trust on the current operation and effectiveness of the arrangements.(2) After the Trust has received such a report from the Executive Board, it must publish its observations on the current operation and effectiveness of the arrangements.”&#xa0;2.5 The Executive Board reports to the Trust annually on the provisions of all the above sections. The Trust then presents a commentary that sets out the Trust's observations on the Executive's arrangements over the BBC's financial year. Our observation on the BBC report to the Trust is that it does not link to analysis of the level of skill gaps, shortages and needs that the BBC has for its own staff and freelancers – or for the needs of the broader industry, although there is good work delivered. The Trust’s reporting is on the “current operation and effectiveness of the arrangements for the training and retraining of BBC staff”. This covers the Trust’s monitoring responsibilities on the operational arrangements, but it is not monitoring how they meet the BBC’s strategic needs or the impact to the wider industry; it is remarkable that since 2007 there has been no direct consultation by the Trust with the wider industry to monitor, test and scrutinise BBC’s contribution to building the skills and talent capital for the industry. The Trust’s seems to interpret “those affected by arrangements” of clause 85, 1a, as the BBC staff only. &#xa0;2.6 The BBC Putting Quality First Strategy Review (2010) made a very clear connection between obligations to training and its public purposes: &#xa0;“Working for the BBC from now on will mean constant new opportunities but also constant change. The BBC can and must offer everyone who works for it the best training and career development in world broadcasting, and an unrivalled creative space in which to do their best work. At a time when others in the industry are being forced to curtail their investment in training, the BBC should maintain its financial commitment here at £45m per year and share the fruits of that investment with the wider industry: training staff who may go on to work elsewhere, and providing face-to-face training direct to freelancers and industry organisations. Working with the rest of the industry to provide training is a key partnership role for the BBC, and part of its mission to act as a catalyst within public space.”&#xa0;2.7 BBC continued to recognise the connection with its public obligations in their 2010 and 2011 reporting on Training to the BBC Trust. They focused BBC Academy (set up in 2009) on delivering skills in five key areas that “underpin the BBC’s strategic agenda, which in turn support the BBC’ Public Purposes”: Standards; Creativity; Digital; Multi-skilling; Leadership. More importantly, the BBC recognises that “we can no longer treat these priorities in isolation”. They recognise that meeting the BBC’s Network Production targets (for the Nations and Out-of-London too), depends on developing a sustainable creative sector to “produce highly trained talent pools around the UK”. This is not just about investment in production but also in the human capital that will develop and create content of the highest quality in these areas. It is about investing more in the workforce and skills base of the UK Nations and English regions and building sustainable companies. As the BBC puts it: “this means that achieving Network Production targets is reliant on our ability to help train the wider broadcasting sector across the whole of the UK”. &#xa0;2.8 Diversity in the industry is an area that the BBC acknowledges the need to act in partnership with the rest of the industry. Director of Television Danny Cohen’s article in Broadcast and the discussion from the industry panels during the recent Diversify event at BAFTA on 21st November 2013 point to a realisation that more should be done and training can play a key role. The BBC also has obligations in the Framework Agreement at section 83 on promoting Equal Opportunities. &#xa0;2.9 Training is also referenced in the three reports since 2007 on the economic impact of the BBC (by Deloitte in 2010 and by the BBC in 2011 and 2013); Deloitte’s report in particular calculated the additional value of the BBC’s training contribution: “the economic impact of the BBC in 2008/09 estimated that the value of BBC training offered to other media organisations benefitted the creative industries by £59m each year through improved productivity. &#xa0;2.10 The new Director General of the BBC recently described his vision and strategy for the corporation. We were very pleased to hear his commitments and assertions on training and skills development, and in particular we are delighted to hear about the BBC’s commitment to increase its intake of Apprentices. We hope that the evidence that we submit will be helpful to the BBC in framing their thinking going forward about all parts of the agenda and skills and training needed to support strategic needs. The work that they do in the area of training and skills is exemplary and one of their most significant contributions to the UK creative industries as a public service broadcaster. &#xa0;Skills issues in the wider industries2.11 The Creative Industries Council has recognised that the talent and skills of the people working in the UK Creative Industries is integral to the success and competitiveness of the sector. This Committee has also heard evidence in its recent inquiry on the Supporting  the Creative Economy the range of skills needed in order to create high quality content as well as maintaining the competitive advantage of the UK creative media businesses and concluded that, while a lot of good work is underway, there is no room for complacency. &#xa0;2.12 Creative Skillset has an over-arching research programme which involves census and workforce surveys, and employer panels whose contributions are regularly surveyed and analysed to conclude on current and future skills gaps, needs and issues. Access to training is harder for freelancers and the creative media sector has a high proportion of freelancing, which is more prevalent in those areas most closely involved in the production process. In particular in TV, for example, there are a lot of SMEs in the independent production which employs the most people followed by terrestrial TV and cable and satellite. The SMEs are the ones that need more support and mentoring in developing their business and their staff - only 33% of TV employers have a learning and development plan in place. &#xa0;2.13 Diversity remains a priority for the creative media industries since content needs to reflect the more disaggregated and global marketplace. However, with just 5.4% from a BAME background, 36% women and 1% disabled the industries are well below the national employment averages. &#xa0;2.14 Linked to diversity, fair access to the creative industries is also key with around two fifths of the workforce being forced to work unpaid in order to get into the industry and many securing recruitment through informal channels. For example, around two fifths (38%) of the TV workforce have undertaken unpaid work within the Creative Media Industries (excluding an occasional charitable contribution).&#xa0;2.15 Across the creative media, employers have identified the following areas as important for the future of the industry:&#xa0;2.15 These skills issues and shortages have an impact on the industries’ competitiveness. The recent extension of tax reliefs from Film to high-end TV, animation, games and VFX (which the BBC is benefiting from) has come with the realisation that the opening of such opportunities for inward investment needs to coincide with co-investment in skills and talent development. The HM Treasury Consultation on the tax reliefs asked the industry also to consider “how the benefits from the tax reliefs can be utilised to invest in UK skills and talent development”; this was because “the Government believes that investment in UK skills and talent development is a critical element to sustaining UK production.” In our submission to the HM Treasury consultation we provided evidence of significant concerns that, “in specific areas of these sectors, the size and strength of the existing skills and talent base is insufficient to cope with the significant amount of additional production activity which is likely to be incentivised by the tax reliefs. Alongside that, there is a risk that there would not be a sufficient supply of skilled people to service the additional activity, thereby leading to productions migrating elsewhere and undermining the core drivers of the tax reliefs”. &#xa0;2.16 The Government recognised these concerns and made provisions in the current Budget for additional support for skills for these sectors, on the basis that it is matched by the industry. This call for industry match is part of a wider call for the industries to consider seriously their skills challenges and co-invest, particularly for the larger companies who have a supply chain of SMEs (mainly small companies) and employ freelancers. &#xa0;2.17 In addition, some examples from our latest survey on specialised craft and technology-related skills that each sector needs (in areas related to the BBC):

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Film &amp; TV ]]]– 

[[[skills for series producers]]] &amp; production management; 

[[[skills for art department, script editors ]]]

[[[&amp;]]]

[[[ script writers]]], script supervisors; craft skills in: camera, make-up in HD, CGI; work-ready trainee/assistant roles.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Animation]]] - visual storyboarding; production management, trainee/assistant roles, compositing artist, CGI Animators, rigging.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Radio: ]]]production &amp; journalism/presenting skills; on-line/web design/ digital media; editing and using specific software.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[VFX ]]]

[[[technical and managerial skills]]]; production methodology: planning, workflow design; software development methodologies.&#xa0;2.18 In the light of the needs of the industry, we would like the Committee to note that BBC investment in training has been declining: after an increase following the new Agreement from £43m in 2007/08 to £44.5m in 2008/09, the trend has been downward from then on; as a result of Delivering Quality First (DQF) a 35% cut was imposed to the activities of the Academy  over three years – even though there is an intrinsic link between delivering quality programmes for the listener/viewer and investing in the training and development of the people that made it; their current core BBC funding is that of £17.3m for 2013/2014. The BBC report on Training to the BBC Trust (2012/13) in July of this year reported :&#xa0;“Following last year’s report, the key challenge set by the BBC Trust was for the Academy to continue to support the BBC as it implements its DQF proposals; at the same time as delivering our own 35% efficiency savings. We were encouraged to meet our commercial targets, despite the tough economic climate, and tasked with continuing to deliver an impressive range of training both for BBC staff and for those in the wider industry.&#xa0;2012/13 has seen us meet these challenges at the same time as delivering our budget cuts and absorbing a 45% reduction in London based training accommodation due to the closure of White City. This has required us to deliver transformational levels of productivity improvements and innovation. It has also seen the cessation or suspension of highly regarded trainee programmes such as the 

[[[Writers’ Academy]]], the 

[[[Design Trainee Scheme]]] and the 

[[[Series Producer Scheme]]]. We have also reduced the BBC’s annual grant to Creative Skillset by 25% and no longer pay an annual grant of £450k to the National Film and Television School.”&#xa0;2.19 We would like to draw the Committee’s attention that the highly valued training schemes that ended, as described in paragraph 2.18, are in areas of skill needs identified by the industry in paragraph 2.17; the training schemes were reskilling professionals who are already part of the industry’s workforce and the gaps created will not be solved with new Apprentices.&#xa0;2.20 On one level this has been the result of a decision on how to spend limited resources (License Fee settlement) and efficiency savings for the BBC; however, the BBC Academy sits within BBC’s HR department, and the 35% cut received, we understand, was one of the higher cuts made across the HR department. We note the BBC Trust’s observation to this report: “We will be looking to ensure that the reduction in the number of courses and trainee programmes will not impact on the range or quality of training on offer in the longer term, nor on the development of the next generation of talent.” It is already evident that this cut impacts on frontline training investment not just to the BBC staff, but also to the freelancers that BBC Academy trains and the third-party investment that it delivers the BBC’s obligations on training to the wider industry.&#xa0;2.21 We are of the view that this cut and continued reduced investment will jeopardise the ability of the BBC to fulfil its commitment to its audience, its staff and the wider industry. As we mentioned above, high quality content production is supported by high quality trained and skilled professionals and talent. However, the BBC continues to include its contribution to training as ‘overhead costs’, as part of the HR budget line, rather than costs directly linked with the fulfilment of its public purposes and the production of its content output. We would like the Committee to consider whether this is indeed the best way to cost and budget for the BBC’s training obligations. &#xa0;Connectivity, Content and Consumers2.22 The recent DCMS’ 

[[[Connectivity Content and Consumers]]] policy paper wants to maintain the Public Service Broadcasting model with a selection of Obligations and Privileges. The current list of Obligations and Privileges includes:&#xa0;“i) 

[[[Obligations: ]]]for example, the quality, accessibility and variety of PSB programming – from news to current affairs; and how it is made – for example what proportion is made in different regions and how much is produced by independent companies; and the requirement to “offer” its content to UK TV networks.&#xa0;ii) 

[[[Privileges: ]]]for example, funding from the licence fee, access to spectrum, a high level of prominence on electronic programme guides: the TV channel listing services that signpost people to what’s on; and the obligation on UK TV networks to “carry” PSB content.” (CCC, p.25)&#xa0;2.23 Although DCMS agrees in the CCC policy paper that “a skilled workforce is crucial to the quality of our productions” (p.27), investment developing and maintaining a skilled creative media workforce is not part of their obligations. The policy paper references under the heading ‘wider investment in content’ the Government action and public investment in training, which includes the HM Treasury matching co-investment, but there is no reference on the industries’ responsibilities and obligations to take action and invest in this too. We think that this is a vital omission.  &#xa0;2.24 As we have said previously, the ability to produce UK-originated content relies heavily on the ability of the people working in the UK creative media industries to have the talent, skills and capacity to deliver it. We have to build the human resource and infrastructure that will drive growth and innovation in the creative sectors, create original and high-quality content and engage with the technological changes and the changes in the production/distribution landscape. Therefore, we believe that expectations to support training and skills development (for employees and the wider industries) should become obligations for Public Service Broadcasters.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1. We answer this question in relation to the BBC’s current Public Purposes on promoting media literacy, education and learning, stimulating creativity and cultural excellence and representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities. &#xa0;3.2 The BBC should provide opportunities for people to create content that is representative of all the UK communities and can entertain, educate and inspire. This type of content can only be produced by people who are skilled and have their talent, professional abilities and business acumen nurtured. The BBC should continue to be involved at every level of the education and skills system so this can be achieved.  &#xa0;3.3 The development of talent and skills for the creative media industries should become one of the new Public Purposes of the BBC in its future Charter and Framework Agreement. This purpose should come with the expectation that the BBC will continue to work in partnership with industry-wide organisations. &#xa0;3.4 The BBC also sets an example (and a trend) for all Public Service Broadcasters and content developers to follow. We will expect that the BBC in its future form will continue to be the model of a creative employer that invests in and supports the people it engages (employees, freelancers, talent and craft professionals, managers and executives) as well as the people of the sector that it serves.&#xa0;3.5 There are still areas where the industry suffers from skills gaps and there are issues of fair access and mobility in these industries for people from diverse backgrounds. As the single biggest employer in the creative media and in receipt of the License Fee, the BBC has a role to play in addressing talent development and key skills issues for the creative economy and also be accountable for its contribution.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.6 As above, we answer this on specific public purposes: we think that the BBC has made a big and positive impact and contribution to these purposes. However, as seen from the evidence of the BBC’s reporting on its training obligations, the reduction of investment in training has seen its training budget almost halved in the last three years; this will need to be addressed by the corporation and the BBC Trust, as it affects frontline delivery of key industry skill needs and could impact on the ability to produce quality content. In our view, the BBC does not calibrate investment towards the analysis of need.&#xa0;3.7 We would expect that the BBC Trust will fulfill its obligation on monitoring BBC Training output to consider the industry-wide impact, as it is stated in the Framework Agreement. We would like to remind the Trust that they should consult industry-wide stakeholders beyond the BBC staff on the BBC Governance decisions on Training, as they are also ones to be affected.&#xa0;3.8 The industry will welcome consistency of how the BBC’s vision will be supported by its resource and investment in the future; how the BBC will continue its role in the efforts to build sustainable industry out-of-London and across the UK Nations, as well as be a key player in addressing issues of fair access, equality of opportunity and representation of the industry-wide workforce. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.9 We would like to add one Public Purpose for the next phase in the life of the BBC: the development of talent and skills for the creative media industries. As a distinct Public Purpose, it will have a higher prominence in the future Charter and Framework Agreement. This purpose should come with the expectation that the BBC will continue to work in partnership with industry-wide organisations. &#xa0;&#xa0;3.9 Our remit relates only to skills and talent and we can only comment on these issues and from that perspective. As we mentioned before, we would like to point the importance for the BBC to maintain investment and interest in the industry-wide training, as a responsible producer and commissioner. The BBC uses freelancers and its output includes programmes made by the independent sector, therefore it can benefit from the industry-wide skills and talent pool, as well as promote high-quality standards of output. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.10 We believe that the whole industry should invest in innovation and innovative new technologies. There is a strong business case for that, as the industries themselves are fast changing due to developing technologies. Innovation also comes with the need for new skillsets, therefore investment in technology should also consider investment in industry-wide training and new pathways. In our opinion the BBC should play their part in this.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013

[[[Overview]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;Within the Creative Skillset’s governance structure, the BBC is represented on our Board, our National Boards in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and many of our relevant sector skills councils (see also above)&#xa0;Anne Morrison (Director of BBC Academy) chairs our Digital Content and TV Strategy Group, chairs our advisory group for Hiive, a Creative Skillset new online platform for professional development, and sits in the Creative Industries Council Skills Group; the new Director General of the BBC, Lord Tony Hall, is also one of our Patrons.&#xa0;Other BBC staff are involved in other panels and task-and-finish groups which are for qualification and curriculum development (i.e. development of Apprenticeship Frameworks, development of Vocational Qualifications and Standards), geographical cluster groups (i.e. Bristol Anchor, MediaCityUK) and Training Provision related groups (i.e. the accreditation of HE courses, apprenticeship providers and short courses groups). The BBC also actively contributes to our research portfolio and participates in our intelligence gathering about the skills needs of the industry. &#xa0;Within our partnership work, the BBC contributes financially to the core budget of Creative Skillset, and to the TV Freelance Training Fund. It also co-invests directly through providing Apprenticeships, work experience, trainee positions and internships, and short training events for Freelancers, like FastTrain. The BBC also contributes directly to training institutions like the National Film and Television School. &#xa0;
