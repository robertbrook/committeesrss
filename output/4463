defaultKCC’s 
defaultsubmission of evidence can be summarised as follows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultKCC 
defaultrecommends to the committee that action is taken by the Government to: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe rationale for the Government’s proposals to de
defaultvolve to a local level decision 
defaultma
defaultking on transport expenditure 
defaultis
default to empower local communitie
defaults and partnerships (local
default authoritie
defaults and 
defaultbusinesses) to identify and deliver transport schemes to meet 
defaulttheir own 
defaultlocal prior
defaultities, in line with the Government’s ‘localism’ agenda. In principle, this 
defaultis
default a sound rationale, to dev
defaultolve decision making on transport expenditure to where there is expert knowledge of 
defaultlocal 
defaulttransport pro
defaultblems and appropriate solutions. H
defaultowever, in practice 
defaultit is unlikely that 
defaultthe new
default arrangements 
defaultwill
default deliver this intended outcome.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultIn practice, de
defaultcision making on transport sche
defaultmes is st
defaultill highly centralised.
default Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) 
default“
defaultprimary role is to decide which 
defaultinvestments should be prioritised, to review and approve individual business cases for those investments, and to ensure effective
default delivery of the programme
default”
default. However,
default the implementation of an assurance framework
default,
default approved by the
default Department for Transport
default (DfT), under the rationale of 
default“
defaultensuring that LTBs are fit for purpose and have the necessary arrangements in place to ensure value
default for money and sound decision making
default”
default, in practice
default 
defaultresults in the DfT 
defaulthaving a decisive say on what
default schemes are funded
default.
default 
defaultTherefore
default local decision making
default 
defaultis inhibited 
defaultas we still need to meet the criteria 
defaultset by the 
defaultDfT i
defaultn evaluating transport schemes.
default Thes
defaulte criteria do not fully reflect 
defaultthe G
defaultovernment’s top priority of delivering growth as they still use factors such as vehicle operating cost
defaults
default and journey time savings
default. 
defaultSuch factors are often not relevant for the schemes we need to deliver to unlock growth.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultThe DfT encourages
default scheme promoters to model and appraise transport schemes by following a 'proportionate' approach. The principle of proportionality is associated with the size of a transport scheme and the type and significance of benefits the schem
defaulte would deliver. However, the DfT has
default not yet made it clear in 
defaultWebTAG
default (Transport Analysis Guidance)
default how to apply the principle of proportionality in preparing business cases. The lack of 
defaultthis guidance coupled with the requirement to comply with
default strict WebT
defaultAG rules
default,
default do
defaultes
default not enab
defaultle
default scheme promoters to take advantage of 
defaultthe 
defaultdevolved local decision making process.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default4
default              
defaultThe requirement for schemes to have a fully developed business case and to be WebTAG 
defaultcompliant
default is of little difference from the former Regional Funding Allocation (RFA) system when the DfT directly approved individual 
defaultlocal 
defaultmajor scheme bids
default.
default A scheme may address local needs but if it does not satis
defaultfy the DfT’s appraisal process 
defaultit will not be fund
defaulted. T
defaultherefore this does not give local autonomy on transport scheme expenditure
default,
default but rather maintains central Government control over which projects proceed. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default5
default              
defaultThe complex governance arrangements for the de
defaultv
defaultolution of transport funding are
default 
defaultalso 
defaulta major
default reason
default why the 
defaultnew system 
defaultof local decision making 
defaulton transport expenditure 
defaultis not effective in practice.
default The formation of LTBs in addition to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) has added a further layer of bureaucracy 
defaultand the 
defaultrelationship between the t
defaultwo bodies is very 
defaultambiguous
default.
default 
defaultIn the South East, it is not clear whether the South East LTB (SELTB) has the right to make its own decisions on the prioritisation of transport schemes
default,
default or whether decisions also need to be ratified by the South East LEP (SELE
defaultP)
default. In
default practice,
default the SE
defaultLEP has final sign off, therefore que
defaultstioning the purpose of the LTB. Also, this is in an area where the LTB has identical geography to 
defaultthe 
defaultLEP, something which is not necessarily the case with
default all LTBs and LEPs across 
defaultEngland
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default6
default              
defaultThe relationship between the LEP and its c
defaultonstituent local authorities is also
default challenging in terms of agreeing consensus on the prioritisation of 
defaulttransport schemes given that each local authorit
defaulty answers to its own electorate. T
defaulth
defaulte LEP (and also the LTB)
default,
default 
defaultas their own entities
default,
default 
defaultare
default not 
defaultaccountable to an electorate
default. T
defaulthe involvement of the business community, although sound in principle 
defaultin terms of identifying the types of transport schemes that will 
defaultbest 
defaultsupport business needs and encourage economic growth, 
defaultalso raises questions regarding accountability of the business LEP members
default and to what extent they do reflect the views of the wider business community. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default7
default              
defaultA better model would be to devolve local decision making on transport expenditure
default direct
default to 
defaulta ‘fe
defaultderated’ LEP consisting of smaller partnership groupings of 
defaultLocal Transport Authorities (LTAs) which have the experience of delivering transport schem
defaultes and are political
default bodies
default accountable to their 
defaultown 
defaultelectorate
default.
default 
defaultIn the SE
defaultLEP, 
defaultKent County Council
default and Medway Council
default (unitary)
default is an ideal partnership within a 
default‘federated’ LEP 
defaultalong with the other SE
defaultLEP authorities forming their own 
defaultfederated areas
default, each able to make autonomous decisions on transport expenditure under the overall ‘umbrella’ of devolve
defaultd funding to the South East LEP.  
default 
default  
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultLocal Transport Authorities (LTAs) do have the capacity to deliver local transport schemes
default as demonstrated by the delivery of projects under the previous f
defaultunding arrangements, i.e. once 
defaultlocal 
defaultmajor scheme funding had been secured from central Government. The most recent example from 
defaultKent
default was the completion of the East Kent Access (EKA) road
default, an £87m scheme delivered by Kent County Council on time and to budg
defaultet. 
defaultLTAs also have the capacity to assess and prioritise local transport schemes as
default demons
defaulttrated by the work that is being
default 
defaultdone by local authorities for the prioritisation and assessment of transport schemes being funded through Local Transport Body (LTB) 
defaultdevolved funding
default;
default and the prioritisation work currently underway for the new single Local Growth Fund (LGF)
default devolved to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)
default post 2015.
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe LTB and the 
defaultLEP
default, as bodies in their own right, do not have the capacity to assess, prioritise or deliver local transport schemes. The LTB and the LEP do not have the staff resources to complete such detailed and technical tasks and ultimately the work comes back to the l
defaultocal authorities that make up the LTB and the LEP. This is at a time when local authority resources are under intense budgetary pressure. Alternatively, additional project costs are incurred through outsourcing work to external consultants. The private sec
defaulttor organisations involved with the LEP also do not have the capacity or expertise to complete transport scheme appraisal and prioritisation. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultproblem with the 
defaultLTB and LEP taking forward such a process is that it adds another layer of evaluation
default, 
defaultas once the LTA has
default prioritised its schemes these then 
defaultneed to go forward to a L
defaultTB/LEP prioritisation process. 
defaultThe experience of Kent County Council of this to 
defaultdate
default is that processes are often unclear and inconsistent and ultimately it adds time and money,
default especially to the consultancy sector who are commissioned to 
defaultact as independent evaluators. 
defaultGiven the size of the funding pot being put forward for 
defaultthe 
defaultsingle LGF, it is likely that considerable time and money will need to be allocated for the LEP wide pr
defaultocess. Neither will assist the case for delivering the sche
defaultmes we need to unlock growth quickly and could be avoided completely if 
defaultthere is the flexibility to award 
defaultfunding to
default federated LEP areas consisting of 
defaultsmaller partnerships of 
defaultLTAs.
default              
default3.
default4
default              
defaultThe optimu
defaultm delivery body 
defaultis the LTA
default working within a ‘federated’ LEP model
default. Funding should be
default 
defaultallocated to
default these 
defaultfederated LEP areas with their
default LTAs 
defaultassess
defaulting
default, prioritis
defaulting
default and deliver
defaulting
default their own schemes rather than the current 
defaulttwo-tiered 
defaultprocess of LTBs and LEPs trying to agree their 
defaultpriorities
default once the LTA has already completed this work for its own area
default. Reaching agreement on priorities
default is extremely difficult given the different poli
defaulttical and business interests that make up the LTBs and 
defaultLEPs
default. Each LTA, as an individual political organisat
defaultion, needs to be able to assess
default and prioritise its own transport schemes, the delivery of which wi
defaultll always fall to the LTA of
default the county or unitary authori
defaultty
default that the scheme is within
default. Schemes that cross
default local authority boundaries will require collaboration and partnership working between the authorities affected
default;
default and this 
defaulthappens through
default direct interaction between LTAs
default.

defaultThe level of
default fu
defaultnding for 
defaultlocal 
defaultmajor 
defaulttransport schemes allocated to the South East Local Transport Body (SELTB) for the period of four years 
defaultfrom 2015/16 to 2018/19 is £65.9 million
default or just under £16.5 million per annum
default.
default This level of funding is wholly inadequate for an LTB/Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) area consisting of two large counties in 
defaultKent
default and Essex, plus East Sussex and the urban
default unitary authorities of Medway, 
defaultThurrock
default and Southend.
default The f
defaultunding 
defaultalso 
defaultdoes not cover the full costs of the schemes being proposed, as a ‘local’ contribution is also required from local authorities, business partners or developer contributions. 
default Nor does 
defaultit begin to meet the needs identified
default if aspirations around housing provision and jobs growth are to be realised
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultAllocating
default this limited amount of funding between the authorities
default, each with their own 
defaulttransport priorities
default,
default has
default proved
default an a
defaultrduous
default task
default, 
defaultrequired
default a considerable amount of staff resource
default, as well as consultancy support
default. The result is that 
defaultKent County Council
default has provisional funding for just two 
defaultof 
defaultthe 
defaulttwel
defaultve prioritised schemes that it
default put forward. 
defaultT
defaulthe unitary authorities
default within the South Ea
defaultst LTB/LEP
default will not receive funding for any of their proposed 
defaulttransport 
defaultschemes. 
default 
defaultOverall, it could be questioned whether the considerable effort put into this process was worthwhile, particularly for the authorities that secured no funding.  
default&#xa0;
default4.
default3
default              
defaultAs 
defaultpreviously stated, the principle of devolving decision making on transport expenditure to a local level is sound and one which
default is supported by local authorities, therefore returning to the previous system of bidding to central Go
defaultvernment
default for funds through 
defaultthe Regional Funding Allocation (RFA) 
defaultis not being advocated. H
defaultowever
default, 
defaultthere needs to be a
default more effective system
default and 
defaultKent County Council
default is of the view that this can be achieved through a ‘federated’ LEP model.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5
default.1
default              
defaultIn 2015
default,
default local major transport scheme funding will be devolved to Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) with the allocations for the four years 
defaultup to 2019 already decided, e.g. the South East LTB is allocated £65.9 million. Parallel to this 
defaultin 2015
default,
default will be the introduction of the single Local Growth Fund (LGF) with devolved funding for not only transport but also skills and housing. The transport element of this fund is also not just restricted t
defaulto local major transport schemes 
defaultas with LTB funding,
default b
defaultut 
defaultalso 
defaultincludes all transport funding, e.g. Integrated Transport 
defaultBlock 
default(ITB)
default, i.e. schemes under £5million, Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) and 
defaultstructural
default maintenance funding. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultThe LGF 
defaultis allocated to L
defaultocal Enterprise Partnerships (L
defaultEPs
default)
default not 
defaultLTBs
default,
default which bring
defaults
default into the question the role of the LTB. With local major transport scheme devolved funding, the LTB is in theo
defaultry the decision making body and has
default an as
defaultsurance framework with the DfT (
defaultalthough in practice, as previously stated in regards t
defaulto the South East, the role of the LTB in relation to the LEP is unclear
default)
default. With the LGF devolved to LEPs, this makes the role of the LTB even more unclear, unless the LTB serves 
defaultsolely 
defaultas an advisory board to the LEP on transport decisions given that the LE
defaultP has to make decisions on all devolved funding 
defaultand 
defaultnot just transport. The South East is fortunate in that LEP and LTB geographies are identical, however in many parts of the country this is not the case and the role of the LTB
default,
default with 
defaultsingle pot funding th
defaultrough the LGF
default devolved to the LEP
default,
default is even more uncertain. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultPost 2015
default,
default a situation will therefore exist where there are two parallel devolved funding streams: local major transport scheme funding administered by the LTB; and funding for all transport 
defaultexpenditure, along with funding for skills and housing, from a single LGF pot administered by the LEP. The Government’s preference for the 
defaultlocal 
defaultdevolution 
defaultof funding to
default a single LGF pot, of which transport is just part of it
default, negates the need for an LTB a
defaultnd therefore these bodies should be disbanded
default with responsibility for overseeing LTB funding and project delivery passed to the LEP
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultThe level of funding allocated thro
defaultugh the LGF
default for the period 2015-21
default,
default 
defaultwill be on the strength
default of the LEP
default’
defaults
default Strategic Economic Plan (SEP)
default,
default which will specify the transport infrastructure required 
defaultto support a committed
default level of growth in homes and jobs. Therefore transport schemes need to demonstrate that 
defaulth
defaultomes and/or jobs are dependent on the scheme in order f
defaultor it to 
defaulthave a chance of securing
default funding. 
defaultE
defaultconomic growth is of utmost 
defaultimportance; however,
default there are also transport schemes that are 
defaultneeded
default for other reasons, e.g. safety, congestion relief and environmental benefits. 
defaultT
defaulthese schemes may not directly supp
defaultort the delivery of new homes and jobs, therefore stand 
defaultless
default chance of being delivered through the LGF and 
defaultthis 
defaultsubstantially reduces the mix of transport improvements that are required to address a range of problems, not 
defaultjust the need for 
defaultnew employment a
defaultnd housing.
default Schemes that address safety, congestion and environmental problems will in many cases indirectly support growth in homes and jobs even if not necessarily directly, therefore they should still be considered for funding through the LGF.

defaultA LEP wide 
defaultSEP
default is currently being developed for the South East
default.  Given the vast geography of this area and what will be required to reflect the differing needs across it, a
default more efficient and effective system would be for 
defaulta ‘
defaultfederated
default’
default 
defaultLEP 
defaultmodel with e
defaultach federated area better refle

default 
defaultKent County Council
default would prefer to operate in partnership with Medway Council (unitary) in a ‘federated’ South East LEP with its own SEP and 
defaultpowers to 
defaultadmini
defaultster
default its own LGF allocation.

default&#xa0;
default6
default.1
default              
defaultThe
default lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure in terms of the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP) and Transport Body (SELTB) are not clear. As 
defaultpreviously described, the role of the LTB in relation to the LEP is unc
defaultlear and both the LTB and the LEP are not accountable to an electorate, rather each local authority within the LTB and LEP is accountable to its own electorate
default. There is
default no 
defaultpublic 
defaultaccountability governing the business element of the LEP
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultThere needs t
defaulto be clear lines of accountability when it comes to decision making on all expenditure. Local authorities are able to do this 
defaultwith the transparent decision making processes that they implement with the Cabinet system which includes Cabinet Committees, Cabi
defaultnet Member, Leader of the Council and full Council decisions. 
defaultCouncils are ultimatel
defaulty accountable to the public
default they serve
default and through the democratic process the public can vote for new representation 
defaultwithin the electoral cycle if they are not satisfied wi
defaultth the decisions being made on their behalf.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultHowever, with the curr
defaultent proposals for devolved local decision making on transport expenditure being implemented post 2015, there is a
default clear lack of accountability in
default both the LEP and the LTB. Given the di
defaultfficulty of agreeing consensus on transport priorities within the LTB and LEP
default,
default with each local authority seek
defaulting to promote schemes that
default benefit their individual areas, the method of how overall decisions are made and the accountability of that decision ma
defaultking process 
defaultis brought into question. LEP business representatives also have a say in the decision making process yet they are not democratically accountable.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultDecisions taken on transport expenditure by the LTB and the LEP do not have clear lines of 
defaultaccountability and 
defaultas such 
defaultdevolved funding 
defaultshould
default be given direct to
default federated LEP areas
default. This will allow
default local authorities
default have more direct control over transport expenditure and can take decisions through a
default clear and transparent process
default;
default and are ultimat
defaultely accountable to the electorate. 
default 
default 
default  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultKent County Council
default recommends that in order to devolve decision making on transport expenditure to a local level, the need for schemes to follow the Department for Transport’s
default 
default(DfT’s) 
defaultWebTAG 
defaulttransport 
defaultappraisal guidance and develop full business cases needs to be relaxed. A
default high level of staff resource is required for this level of detailed scheme assessment which puts local authorities
default under extreme pressure in the current climate of budgetary cuts.
default 
defaultFurthermore, much of the 
defaultWebTAG guidance 
defaultdoes not 
defaultmake it clear how to 
defaultrefl
defaultect 
defaultthe current 
defaulttop priority policy 
defaultof
default deliver
defaulting
default growth
default in the transport scheme appraisal process. 
defaultIn order for there to be local decision making, this stipulation from central Government 
defaultof WebTAG compliant schemes 
defaultmust be re
defaultlaxed
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultKent County 
defaultCouncil recommends that the single pot Local Growth Fund (LGF) needs to allow transport schemes to be delivered that are not directly related to supporting the delivery of new homes and jobs. Although economic growth is the top priority, there are transpor
defaultt improvements that are needed for a variety of other reasons including safety
default, congestion
default and environmental benefits
default; and although they may not necessarily directly
default support 
defaultnew
default homes and jobs
default, in many cases these schemes will indirectly support growth
default. Tr
defaultue local decision making would allow local authorities to make judgements on what schemes are funded based on local needs.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultKent County Council
default recommends that the complex governance 
defaultarrangement with the devolution of local 
defaultmajor 
defaulttransport 
defaultscheme fundi
defaultng administered
default through Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) is removed
default. Post 2015
default,
default there will be two parallel systems with local major transport scheme funding devolved to LTBs but with further transport 
defaultfunding available through the single 
defaultLGF
default allocated to
default Loca
defaultl Enterprise Partnerships
default 
default(
defaultLEPs
default)
default. There needs to be one system, therefore the LTB should be 
defaultdisbanded 
defaultin favour of the single LGF. 
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default              
defaultKent County Council
default recommends that the
default 
defaultsingle 
defaultLGF should have the flexibility of allocation
default to
default federated areas within LEPs consisting of smaller partnerships of local authorities. Within the South East LEP, Kent and Medway would form a federated area and administer their own devolved funding
default. 
defaultThis will allow decisions on transport expenditure to be
default taken through a 
defaultmore local and 
defaulttransparent decision making process that is accountable to each lo
defaultcal authority’s own electorate. 
defaultThe delivery of local transport schemes will ultimately come down to t
defaulthe Local Transport Authority (LTA)
default, and the processes of
default scheme assessment, prioritisation and delivery would be more efficient and effective within a ‘federated’ LEP model.
default LTAs are also capable of working with neighbouring authorities to deliver transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries.
