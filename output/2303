defaultThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work 
defaultwith councils to support, promote and improve local government.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and
default set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the
default public sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to the Education Select Committee
default’s inquiry into the Department for Educations proposed reforms to the regulation of children’s homes.
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultResidential children’s homes are an 
defaultimportant and necessary part of our care system
default; for some children it will be the placement which best meets their needs.
default 
defaultHowever, 
defaultit 
defaultis clear that reform is needed in order to 
defaultimprove the system for the children who rely on them
default. 
defaultThis requires all parts o
defaultf the system to work more effectively, including councils and providers. It is important to note that while regulatory change can have some positive impact, it can only achieve so much; there are a wider set of issues that must a
defaultlso be considered
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultTh
defaulte market for children’s homes is complex.  It has been shaped over decades by historic factors and must also be viewed in the context of the wider system for children in care. There is mixed private, charitable and local authority provision with significan
defaultt clustering of homes in certain geographic areas. There needs to be a better balance of provision in order to meet the needs of children and yo
defaultung people across the country. 
defaultCouncils have a key role in making this happen, through more effective commission
defaulting, working with each other and providers to shape the market
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultIn recognition of this, t
defaulthe LGA commissioned 
defaultthe Office for Public Management (OPM) t
defaulto carry out an action research project with ten local authorities and providers, looking at how to 
defaultachieve more effective strategic commissioning of children’s homes.
default 
defaultThe research focused on three aspects of commissioning: needs analysis; matching needs and supply; and quality assurance and monitoring.
default The final report, available 
defaulton the L
defaultGA’s website, 
defaultmakes

default4.
default              
defaultThere are a number of changes
default proposed by the Department for Education
default which the LGA welcomes and considers would make a
default positive impact on the system.  These include
default the new duty on children’s homes to notify the authority for the area where they are located every time a child is admitted to a placement and when they are di
defaultscharged.  It is important that councils know which looked after children are living in homes in their area, in order 
default 
defaultthat they can effectively discharge their safeguarding duties and understand the impact on other local services.  
default&#xa0;
default5
default.
default              
defaultThe lack of this i
defaultnformation can be a source of frustration and concern for some ‘area’ authorities.  Although the council-to-council notification system should address this, as noted in the consultation document emergency placements sometimes leads to delay. Placing a para
defaultllel duty on children’s homes 
defaultwould
default therefore provide an additional safety net.  
default&#xa0;
default6
default.
default              
defaultAlthough we recognise that the system of 
default‘
defaultplacing
default’
default authorities notifying area authorities 
defaultneeds to be improved
default, we are concerned that the proposed change to require 
defaultthem
default to consult with ‘area’ councils before making a placement could be fraught with difficulties. For example, consultation implies joint agreement on a placement decision; there is potential for a situation to occur whereby the ‘area’ authority believes that
default the placement should
default not
default go ahead, but the placing authority disagrees and makes it anyway. It is not clear how this would be resolved. 
default&#xa0;
default7
default.
default              
defaultIn addition, 
defaultwe are concerned that 
defaultthere could be scope for ‘area’ authorities to be legally challenged by provide
defaultrs
default, based on the advice and information they provide to ‘placing’ authorities
default. How to achieve the objective of ensuring children are placed in appropriate areas and with access to other relevant local services 
defaulttherefore 
defaultneeds further consideration
default.
default&#xa0;
default8
default.
default              
defaultCou
defaultncils have safeguarding responsibilities for all children in their area, even if they are not the corporate parent
default and 
defaultt
defaulthere are concerns about 
defaulttheir 
defaultlack of control over independent providers establishing homes in their area.  This has contributed to the 
defaultgeographical clustering of homes, which means that supply of children’s homes is distorted and does not reflect demand across the country. This in turn contributes to 
defaultthe 
defaultnumbers of 
defaultchildren placed 
defaultout of
default their local
default area.  
default&#xa0;
default9
default.
default              
defaultSuch clustering also places significant burdens on other local services in those areas, for example schools or child and adolescent mental health provision.  The 
defaultsiting
default of many children’s homes in a small area can also itself have an impact on the safety o
defaultf the children.  We therefore welcome the Department’s attempt to address this.  
default&#xa0;
default10
default.
default              
defaultAlthough it is not possible to deem an area ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’, due to the complex factors at play and how those change over time, we do agree that a responsibility on h
defaultomes to carry out an annual risk assessment and to do this in conjunction with relevant local services is sensible.  In addition, the assessment of risk should be accompanied by a plan setting out how those risks will be mitigated.  No area is risk free
default fo
defaultr vulnerable children
default; setting out how those risks will 
defaultbe 
defaulthandled is as important as identifying them.  
default&#xa0;
default11
default.
default              
defaultFollowing consultation with the police and children’
defaults
default services, p
defaultroviders should be required to provide both elements to 
defaultOfsted
default and to the 
defaultLocal 
defaultSafeguarding Children Board
default (LSCB)
default for the area where the home is located. If the exercise is to have any meaning, 
defaultOfsted
default must have sufficient power to refuse registration or to de-register homes where the risks cannot be sufficiently mitigated.  LSCBs sho
defaultuld also have the power to make a submission to 
defaultOfsted
default on the appropriateness of the risk assessment and the measures proposed to mitigate any risks based on their local knowledge; 
defaultOfsted
default should have a duty to have regard to such a submission. It is possib
defaultle that local services may consider that the provider has not sufficiently addressed a risk and it is important that 
defaultOfsted
default has all the relevant information to come to an informed decision. 
default&#xa0;
default12
default.
default              
defaultAs noted in the introduction to this submission, the challenge of ensuring a better match between provision and the needs of children across the country requires more than just regulatory change.  Councils and providers must work closely together, with cou
defaultncils giving a clear picture of need to give providers confidence to invest and providers giving a clearer picture of what services they are delivering. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStatements of Purpose
default&#xa0;
default1
default3
default.
default              
defaultThe action research that the LGA commissioned OPM to carry out on the comm
defaultissioning of children’s homes 
defaultidentified
default that 
defaultbetter
default matching of needs with supply could help to reduce placement breakdown. 
defaultCouncils
default would generally welcome 
defaulta 
defaultdeeper understanding of the services available across the existing children’s residential home m
defaultarket. A common language to describe offers would help
default. C
defaultoncerns were raised throughout the research (including from providers) that inflated claims about services mean inappropriate placements are made and needs cannot be fulfilled. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default4
default.
default              
defaultNearly all parti
defaultcipants said more specialist provision is needed nationally and locally as 
defaultcouncils
default are struggling to match the most complex needs with supply. They also report that the number of children with multiple complex needs is increasing. 
defaultCouncils
default seek ‘specialis
defaultt’ and ‘therapeutic’ placements but
default,
default across the board (providers included)
default,
default said there is insufficient understanding amongst local authority commissioners and their partners about what this means in practice and insufficient evidence about what works and f
defaultor whom. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default5
default.
default              
defaultIn some authorities direct conversations between social work teams and commissioners have helped build 
defaulta 
defaultdeeper shared understanding of 
defaultthe offer from 
defaultprovider
defaults
default. Providers can also do more to articulate the services they offer and to demonstrate the staff and skills available to deliver services. The impact of a misjudged or ineffectual placement is so significant (for that individual child or young person and ot
defaulthers in the home, including staff) that there may 
defaultbe 
defaultjustification for more formal requirements around ethical advertising. The sector needs to more clearly define ‘specialist’ and ‘therapeutic’ care and promote the use of common language (amongst commissi
defaultoners and providers) to describe different type
defaults
default of provision.
default 
defaultOne of the recommendations of the report was that there is a tightening of children’s homes’ formal statement of purpose.
default&#xa0;
defaultWorkforce 
default&#xa0;

default.
default              
defaultThe people who work in children’s homes are vitally im
defaultportant to the experience of the children 
defaultand young people living there. 
defaultThe action research that the LGA commissioned OPM to carry out found that workforce development merits further attention. Children’s homes are receiving children and young people with
default increasingly high level or complex needs; strategies for skills development and to avoid burn out could help in matching needs with supply in the medium to long term. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default7
default.
default              
defaultChildren’s home staff and managers in both 
defaultcouncil
default and independent provision 
defaultsaid
default 
defaultthey are struggling to meet the needs of increasingly complex and challenging children and young people placed in their care. The skills, knowledge and experience of the children’s home workforce is clearly linked to the range and quality services availabl
defaulte and the extent to which a provider can deliver effectively against an offer to commissioners. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default8
default.
default              
defaultLocal authorities who took part in the research are concerned about burn-out and loss of experienced staff from children’s homes as pressure on the 
defaultfrontline increases. Ofsted is clear that home managers are one of the most important factors in determining the quality of care delivered, so this should be of great concern. Whilst the work at national level will help build a picture of current workforce
default qualifications, capabilities and skills gaps, local authorities want to find ways to encourage peer support, the sharing of effective practice and career progression.
default&#xa0;
default1
default9
default.
default              
defaultIn requiring all care staff 
defaultto
default achieve the minimum necessary qualification within t
defaultwo years of starting employment, t
defaulthere could be a risk that existing experienced employees without the necessary qualification might be reluctant to take the steps to acquire a new qualification and leave. The regulation should be sensitive about this so t
defaulthat levels of experience can be shown to be equivalent to the relevant qualification. This might require a more elaborate assessment process however which may increase the costs to home operators and therefore to councils as commissioners. The qualificatio
defaultn process will inevitably take people out of work for periods which may lead to staffing over-stretch; again, the system needs to be sensitive and flexible to cope with realities on the ground.
default&#xa0;
default20
default.
default              
defaultWe agree with 
defaultthe proposal that from 2018 requirement for
default candidates for registered manager posts to have achieved the necessary management qualification prior to appointment,
default but since it is widely acknowledged that the managerial position is vital for quality assurance we would query why this would be delayed 
defaultbeyond the 2017 date for more junior staff.
default&#xa0;
default21
default.
default              
defaultWe agree with
default p
defaultroposals
default&#xa0;
defaultthat
default&#xa0;
defaulthomes should only be able to operate for as shortest time as possible without a registered manager (or locum) being appointed and 
defaultOfsted
default being informed; 
defaultmoreover, new homes shoul
defaultd not be able to open without a registered manager identified as part of the registration process.  
default&#xa0;
default22
default.
default              
defaultAll regulations of this sort are bound to increase the costs of commissioning a service but it is widely agreed that the quality of these vital servic
defaultes needs to improve. It will be important to improve the accuracy of cost estimates for these requirements and to monitor actual costs carefully so that resources can be properly 
defaultchannelled
default to meet these new national requirements.
default&#xa0;
defaultChildren who go missing
default&#xa0;
default2
default3
default.
default              
defaultProtecting children is one of the most important things
default that councils do and t
defaulthe evidence has become increasingly clear that going missing can be an indicator of something affecting the safety and wellbeing of children. In particular, the link between
default going missing and the risk of child sexual exploitation is now widely accepted. Other agencies, in particular the police, but also health services and voluntary organisations
default,
default have an important role to play and it is essential that all have processes in p
defaultlace to work together in instances where children go missing.  
default&#xa0;
default2
default4
default.
default              
defaultThe LGA welcomes the streamlining of 
defaultthe
default statutory guidance, to ensure that it is clear and easy to use for all those involved and does not inc
defaultlude unnecessary prescription. 
defaultThis flexibil
defaultity is essential, in order that agencies can take the most appropriate action based on existing local services and arrangements.  
default&#xa0;
default2
default5
default.
default              
defaultWe welcome 
defaultthe proposed 
defaultrequirements on children’s homes to have policies on preventing children going missing, although
default it is important that there is flexibility as to the content, so that local service provision and arrangeme
defaultnts can be suitably reflected. 
defaultLocal authorities have safeguarding responsibilities for children who are placed in their area by other authorities an
defaultd we would therefore support the policies being agreed with the local authority in the area where the home is located
default as well as the police
default. Given the multi-agency nature of the issue, the Local Safeguarding Children Board would appear to be the sensible p
defaultlace for policies to be discussed and agreed. This would also help to ensure a consistent approach across a local area.
default&#xa0;
default2
default6
default.
default              
defaultWhen there is concern due to a child going missing, consideration needs to be given to whether the placement is the right one and w
defaulthether the placement can be provided in such a way that the child becomes more settled.
default&#xa0;
defaultA formal review of the care plan takes place if a whole new set of needs are identified; therefore, the proposed duty on the registered person of a children’s home to f
defaultormally request a review of the child’s care plan in cases where children are persistently missing from placement
default 
defaultcould be disproportionate
default in some instances. 
defaultFor example, it might be that the residential staff need advice on how best to care for a young p
defaulterson with particular needs. 
default&#xa0;
default2
default7
default.
default              
defaultThe ‘plan’ (residential care) might be the right ‘plan’ but it might be the wrong placement; a review would not necessarily be called because a placement changes.
default&#xa0;
default Alternative, more proportionate options could include the registered manager having the powe
defaultr to ask for a meeting with the social worker and others involved in delivering the care plan to consider the issue of the young person being missing from home, or the power to request a formal response from the local authority setting out what action is b
defaulteing taken and why as a result of the concern being raised.  This would enable the action to be tailored to the specific problem, whether a formal review, a meeting between professionals, or advice provided to staff. 
default&#xa0;
default2
default8
default.
default              
defaultFurthermore, we believe that the 
defaultproposal that a review meeting should be convened in circumstances where any or all of the area authority, registered manager of a children’s home or fostering service, foster 
defaultcarer
default, parent
default&#xa0;
defaultrequest that a review is needed, in response to concerns that a ch
defaultild is at risk
default, i
defaultntroduces unnecessary prescription and runs counter to the principle in the Munro review
default,
default to increase professionalism and 
defaultuse of 
defaultprofessional judgement.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRemoving references to child prostitution from legislation
default&#xa0;
default2
default9
default.
default              
defaultWe strongly support
default 
defaultthe removal of 
defaultreferences to prostitution and replacing these with the term sexual exploitation. Using the term prostitution indicates that children have a choice or that they are consenting to their own abuse.  It belies the fact that exploitation is a s
defaulterious form of abuse and a crime.
