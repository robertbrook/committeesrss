"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Professor Laura McAllister (DWB 14)Introduction1.\n              \nT\nhis evidence \nis submitted \nin relation to \nthe pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Wales Bill. \nI am \nhappy to elaborate on this evidence in person should the \nWelsh A\nffairs Committee \nconsider that to be of value.\nFocus of submission 2\n.\n              \nThe evidence focuses on Part O\nne of the Bill (‘The Assembly an\nd Welsh Government’).  \nIt draws upon my \non-going\n research on devolution, relating \nspecifically \nto the capacity of the National Assembly for Wales (Assembly). It also uses\n evidence \nsubmitted to the Commission on Devolution in Wales\n (the Silk Commission) from \nthe Study of Parliament Wales Group\n. The \nsubmission focuses on \nthe enduring issue of the Assembly’s \ncapacity\n,\n \nas I \nregard \nthis \nas critical to \nthe \nscrutiny of the Bill\n and its intended outcomes\n.\n \n3.\n              \n The fundamental principles wh\nich \nunderpin \nall \ndemocratically elected legislature\ns \ninclude\n:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCa\npacity (to discharge its roles)\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClarity\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimplicity\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntelligibility (\nto \ninternal and external\n stakeholders\n)\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProfile\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMutual respect and effective co-operation (between all UK legislatures) \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nL\negitimacy\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAutonomy \n(\nto\n act on matters affecting Wales, w\nithout \nexcessive\n prescription or unnecessary \nobstacles\n)\n4.\n              \nMy \nsubmission \ncontextualises \nP\na\nrt O\nne of the Bill against \nthe \nlong-standing \ncapacity\n challenges that the Assembly faces\n. This is a fundamental constraint that \nframes the context for \nthe Assembly’s \ncurrent \noperation\n, as well \nand \nmany of \nthe issues that \nare \nraise\nd\n \nin connection with the operation\n, public profile and acceptance \nof devolution in Wales\n.\n Various pieces of r\necent\n published research by\n \nour team at the University of Liverpool (\nMcAllister\n, Cole, Stirbu) \nrehearse\n these issues in some depth\n. \n \nM\natters relating to Assembly size \nare highlighted here \nas these are especially relevant \nto Part O\nne\n, S\nection 2 of the Bill\n:\n “Rem\noval of restriction on standing for election for both constituency and electoral region”. \n&#xa0;\nMoreover, the fundamental issue of capacity \nalso relates to Part T\nwo of the Bill, as these additional financial and fiscal re\ns\npo\nn\ns\ni\nbilities are framed by a desire f\nor greater accountability. Without\n the resources\n to\n properly\n scrutinise and mana\nge these powers, that objective is unlikely to be fulfilled.\n&#xa0;\nAssembly size&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nBy \nall the evidence and \nby \nany international comparison, the Assembly is a very small \ninstitution\n indeed\n. \n W\nith just 60 elected members, i\nt has fewer elected politicians than small US states such as Utah (73 members), North Dakota (94 members), Vermont (148 members) and Maine (151 members). \nThe \nAssembly \nhas fewer politicians \nthan ‘small’ Ge\nrman Lander\n,\n such as Bremen (with 83 members) and Saxony Anhalt (97 members). \nThe average size of national parliaments \nwithin the EU with \npopulations of between 1-6\n \nmillion \ncitizens \nis \napproximately \n141 \nelected \nmembers.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nWithin the UK context, the Asse\nmbly is less than half the size of the Scottish Parliament (129 MSPs) and substantially smaller than the Northern Ireland Assembly (with 108 MLAs), which has a population half the size of Wales. The \nAssembly has fewer \npoliticians than many Welsh local \nauthorities\n: \nCardiff \nCouncil \nhas 75 councillors\n,\n and Swansea has 72. \nIn 2004\n,\n when the Assembly’s powers were much more constrained, the Richard Commission advocated an increase to 80 AMs\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nIt \nis frequently \nsaid that the \nmatter\n of Assembly size should\n not be addressed whilst public disengagement with elected politicians remains high\n \nand \nagainst a \ncontext of economic recession\n. \nT\no the contrary, without consideration of \nthe \nappropriate number of AMs, the capacity challenges which the Assembly currently faces are likely to be exacerbated by new powers \nover taxation and borrowing\n.\n \nIn turn, \nmatters of capacity \naffect\n negatively public confidence and support for the institution, \nas well as challenging many of the fundamental principles \nthat \nwe \nhave set out\n above.\n \nFurthermore, the \nAssembly Commission\n has a s\ntrategic goal to engage with the people of Wales by encouraging \ngreater \ninterest in the \nAssembly’s \nwork and facilitating involvement with \nthe \nlegislative \nprocess\n. \nFor this to happen, there needs to be \nfirst, \ngreater\n \nclarity and intelligibility\n,\n and \nalso, \nsufficient\n politicians to discharge \nthe Assembly’s\n duties effectively.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nWe have argued elsewhere \n(Cole, McAllister and Stirbu\n,\n \n2013) \nthat\n the\n size of the A\nssembly\n \nis at\n the heart of many of \nits \ncapacity \nchallenges\n. \nThe \nnegative \nimpact on \nscrutiny and on developing \neffective committee work is considerable. \n \nIn particular, \nmatters of capacity were \nassoc\niated with the intensive workload of the Third Assembly and driving and constraining changes to the system of committee scrutiny in the Fourth. \nThe small s\nize\n also places a substantive burden on the political parties to select candidates of the highest cal\nibre because the presence of more than\n a handful of\n less effective membe\nrs can quickly become a serious\n weakness. In contrast, larger-scale institutions such as the House of Commons or the Scottish Parliament can easily absorb the diverse skills range and \nexperience of elected members into the overall mix of roles that any legislature furnishes.\n \nIn Wales since 2006, t\nhis \nhas been exacerbated by the\n ban on standing for election on both constituency and electoral region ballots.\n9.\n              \nOur research has \nmade various \nsuggestions for addressing capacity weaknesses in the Assembly\n, \nacknowledging that \nsome clearly address the symptoms rather than the causes\n of the problem\n:\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges to the dual candidacy ban\n&#xa0;\nThe Government of Wales Act, 2006 introduced a prohibition on “dual candidacy”, that is candidates standing for election in the constituencies and on the regional list simultaneously. This is an anomaly and out of line with virtually all other Additional M\nember Systems (AMS). Furthermore, it has a serious impact on capacity with regard to quality of candidates that parties might put up (and, therefore, of elected AMs). The Wales Office Green Paper (2012) \non future electoral arrangements for the National Ass\nembly for Wales\n (\nhttp://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/have-your-say-2/\n) suggested removing the ban\n saying that the\n UK Government believes: \n&#xa0;\n“that, in principle, candidates should not be barred from standing for election simultaneously in an Assembly constituency and an Assembly region. It impacts disproportionally on smaller parties, who would understandably not wish to risk their smaller pool\n of candidates in a constituency election when there may be a chance they could be elected from the regional list. Likewise, if a party does better than expected in constituency elections, candidates on that party’s regional list are unlikely to be elected\n. The prohibition on dual candidacy may, in time, have a negative effect on representation in the Assembly as high quality candidates who stand as constituency candidates, but who fail to secure that seat, are lost to the Assembly because of the “all or no\nthing” choice they are required to make.” \n&#xa0;\nI agree\n entirely\n with the removal of the restriction in the draft Bill\n.\n The ban introduced in 2006 was ill-advised and has affected \nboth \ncapacity and calibre\n,\n especially given the \nsplit \nbetween list and constitue\nncy seats in the Welsh system. \nIn other nations that use similar Additional Mixed \nMember \nSystems (AMS), there is no such restriction. Indeed, a \nrecent Electoral Commission \nreport \nin New Zealand rejected a ban\n,\n as did the Arbuthnot\nt\n Commission in Scotland. \nIssues about mandate and procedures \nbetween constituency and regional members \nhave been successfully resolved elsewhere\n,\n and there is \nno reason to think W\nales is different in this regard.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreasing the number of AMs \n&#xa0;It is hard to disprove that substan\ntial capacity constraints arise from having such a relatively small number of AMs. Any longitudinal\n review of devolution in\n Wales \nand strategic planning for the future of the Assembly \nmeans that at some stage the\n core\n capacity issues will \nhave to be addressed, otherwise there \nwill be an inevitable\n continued impact on the profile, effectiveness and legitimacy of the Assembly\n. \nIt is, however, critical to consider the number of politicians representing Wales and its localities in the round, th\nat is at European, UK, national and local level.\n Equally, it lends weight to Section 3 of Part One of the Bill which rightly prohibits the holding of a seat in both the UK Parliament and the Assembly.\n \n&#xa0;\nResearch undertaken by McAllister (\nin \n2008-9\n, whilst \nworking with the Independent Panel on AMs Pay and Support\n) and Cole et al (2013) \nhas \nexamined alternatives to \nincreasing the finite number of AMs. It should be noted that each of these is far from perfect as they are essentially temporary solutions to symp\ntoms of a core problem.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShorter-term alternatives: \nAssembly\n A\nssociates\n \n&#xa0;\nThere is \nsome \nmerit in considering the appointment of a small number of individuals to serve on Assembly committees with the paramount objective of enhancing opportunities for \nscrutiny.  Such a proposal would build on practice\n already underway\n in local authorities, where scrutiny committees often appoint independent members \nas a means of \nenhanc\ning\n capacity (Wilson and Game\n, 2011). The suggestion for Assembly Associates was raise\nd by McAllister in research papers provided for the Independent Panel on AMs Pay and Support (2008-9) and in recent work on Assembly capacity with Cole et al (2013). \n&#xa0;\nSuch Associates \nmight each serve for no more than four years and would have an unpaid an\nd non-voting status. \nAs well as \naugment\ning\n in\nternal\n expertise\n for effective scrutiny\n, this\n would have the added bonus of presenting greater \ndiversity and experience to the \nwork of the \nAssembly.  \nOf course, there are \ndifficulties with this suggestion\n especially \nwith regard to \ndemocratic legitimacy: Cole et al (2013)\n suggest that it would not be appropriate to appoint more\n than\n six \nat any one time to ensure that \nelected AMs \nwould \nretain at least a 10-1 ratio.\n Although this is an interesting\n \ninnovation,\n clearly it is an experimental one and one moreover, that is wholly unfamiliar to a UK parliamentary context. In addition, \nthe \nlikely financial \ndifferential between\n \npursuing\n one of these routes \nor\n having more directly AMs is minimal\n.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘Overhang’ seats\n&#xa0;\nA m\nechanism for providing additional AMs without formally increasing the size of the Assembly \ncould\n lie in the concept of ‘\no\nverhang seats’ (used in the New Zealand Parliament, the German Bundestag and the National Assembly of Venezuela). The need for ‘overhan\ng seats’ arises when a party in a Mixed Member Electoral System wins \nmore constituency seats than its share of seats determined by the party vote (that is, its overall proportional entitlement). In such cases, the extra seats are not normally removed, rath\ner the number of representatives in parliament increases just for the life of that parliament, so adding to its capacity (Soberg Shugart and Wattenberg, 2003; National Assembly Independent Review Panel, 2009). \n&#xa0;Other sections of the BillI agree \nwith \nand support sections 3, \n4 and 5 of Part O\nne of the Bill. Any future changes to \nthe Assembly’s electoral arrangements should only be made with the Assembly’s consent\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nReferencesCole, M., McAllister, L. and Stirbu, D.
