&#xa0;Written evidence from Spectrum (TIC 0002)&#xa0;Spectrum, based in Cornwall, are a care provider dealing with people whose condition impacts on their ability to travel on public transport and even these people are having problems securing assistance with transport costs other than through the DLA / PIP route. In the wider community we have people being supported in outreach services who have no ability to migrate in and out of their village other than before 10.00am, firs bus, and 3.30pm last bus which makes for them planning their days activity and skills development a very difficult task to manage. &#xa0;We have the situation in the County where some of the major town have bus and train routes available but the costs of traveling in this manner is prohibitive and where a driver fails to report for work they bus simply does not run, again detrimental to the health and wellbeing of people who need to plan meticulously for journeys.&#xa0;July 2013&#xa0;
