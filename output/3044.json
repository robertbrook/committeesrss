"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the British Transport Police (BTP) (WRT 032)&#xa0;\nSUMMARY&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.              INTRODUCTION&#xa0;1.1\n              \nThe \nBritish Transport Police (BTP) is the national police force for the main line railways throughout \nEngland\n, \nWales\n and \nScotland\n.  In addition to the main national railway network, it is also responsible for policing the London Underground System, the Docklan\nds Light Railway, the Midland Metro Tram System and Croydon Tramlink\n, Sunderland Metro, \nGlasgow\n subway and the Emirates AirLine\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBTP\n, since 2009,\n respond to \nspecific railway incidents\n \nrelating to severe weather e.\ng.\n stranded trains; in line with \nreviewed \nand revised\n standing operating procedures. i.e. BTP resource response will be proportionate to the \nnature/severity of the incident\n \nin support of the affected Train Operating Company or Network Rail.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.              RESILIENT UK TRANSPORT NETWORKS&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nBTP’s response to \nsevere weather incidents\n is guided by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and within \nLondon\n, by London Emergency Services Liaison Panel (LESLP) protocols. BTP utilises the principles of integrated emergency management and has an established \nplanning process for ensuring that critical functions can continue dur\ning episodes of severe weather.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nSince 2009/10, \nlessons have been learn\nt\n and plans introduced, \nwhich \nhave proven to be effective during subsequent \nsevere weather \nperiods.\n \n \nBTP, together with other partners within the Rail Industry have developed a co-ordinated and planned response to severe weather \nwhich \nmay affect the \nUK\n rail network.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nBTP \nproactively monitors\n \nt\nhe Meteorological Office \nInternet Site which provides a sho\nrt to medium term weather forecast. \n \nThis information is also \nmade \navailable to the Transport Providers; who use this information to proactively plan for adverse weather.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nNetwork Rail has a \nNational Coordinator for \nweather related issues; \nwho reviews \nthe \npotential impact \nof severe weather warnings\n to a\nny \npart of the \nUK\n rail network\n. \n \nUpon notification of a \nsevere \nweather warning, Network Rail will hold \nboth regional or national teleconferences with BTP and\n other \nkey partners to ensure there is a\n co-ordinated response.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.              LESSONS LEARNED&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nTimeliness, accuracy and a single authoritative voice is essential in times of severe weather events\n,\n in order to minimise disruption to transport system users.  Through appropriate community resilience for\nums, industry partners and wider organisational partners, BTP seeks to ensure that communications direct from transport system users, in times of severe weather are fully contextualised and responded to, in order to minimise the impact on the travelling co\nmmunity in times of disruption.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nBTP has opened communication channels in the widely used social media networks, of Twitter \nand F\nacebook, enabling fast-time response to emerging issues.  This is particularly important during tim\nes of severe weather, \nwhen time-\ncritical information relating to over-crowding \nat stations, \nor trains stuck on the route\n,\n \nis key to an effective operational response and minimising further disruption or risk to the travelling public on the rail transport network.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nSince 2009, \nBTP \nhas\n \ndeveloped comprehensive, staged implementation, \ninternal \nsevere weather plans that \nensure \nprimarily its own \nbusiness continuity.\n \nThe severe weather plans include detailed contingencies for ensuring continuation of key policing functions\n such as the response to incidents and ensuring that \nsufficient \nstaff\ning levels are maintained.\n  At the same time, the arrangements dove-tail into the wider industry response to such severe weather situations.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nBTP has developed a proactive strategy to\n ensure that there are \nadequate \nspecialist \nvehicles \navailable \nwhich are able to \noperate effectively during severe weather \ni.e. \n4x4\n \nv\nehicles\n. The number of such vehicles has been increased over the last two years; this includes an initiative with Network Ra\nil on the \nWessex\n route, where a fully liveried 4x4 vehicle is staffed by BTP and a N\network Rail Mobile\n \nOperations Manager.  This enables a fast-time response to incidents \nand is invaluable \nd\nuring periods of severe weather.\n&#xa0;\n4.              A CO-ORDINATED RESPONSE&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nBTP plays an important role in response to severe weather on the rail transport network.  In o\nrder to maximise the value of w\nhat BTP do, it is essential that BTP work in partnership with others.  In this respect, BTP has worked hard to ensure that we, \nas a national police service, are better connected with Lo\ncal Resilience F\norums around the country, in order to fully understand the impacts of severe weather and demonstrate how we can effectively contribute to the minimisation of disruption to the Rail n\network during such severe weather episodes.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nAt present there is still an independence of operation in response to severe weather across the transport groups\n:\n Rail, Road, Aviation and Maritime.  \nDuring the Summer 2012 Olympics, the DfT set up a cross-m\nodal transport group, led by BTP, to plan and deliver a safe Games for those travelling.  \nThe group delivered a mechanism of understanding how each of the modal forms of transport would contribute to the movement of those travelling to the games and enable\nd a co-ordinated approach to be undertaken.  For transport-related disruption, such a cross-modal group could have benefits in ensuring the minimisation of disruption in times of severe weather.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
