defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultCountry Land and Business Association default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 1: defaultDo you think the Government should introduce a biodiversity offsetting system in England? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes, very much so. We have been 
defaultmaking the case for market based solutions, to environmental problems, including offsetting, since 2009 and the publication of our report “Private Solutions to Public Problems”.
defaultIn an age of austerity, 
defaultwe need to be looking at new ways to pay 
defaultfor biodivers
defaultity. 
defaultEven if the budget for the new CAP is only marginally less than the current one, it is unlikely that there will be sufficient public funds to do meet all of society’s aspirations in the long term.  One of the most straightforward ways of levering in m
defaultore funding is through ecosystems markets by which those who benefit from the provision of environmental  services contribute to the costs; particularly developers being required to provide offsets to replace 
defaultthe loss of 
defaultbiodiversity as a condition of obta
defaultining planning permission. 
defaultSimilarly, there is of course the requirement for the 
defaultprovision of compensatory habitat under the Habitats Directive. 
defaultHowever, we would emphasise that 
defaultall 
defaultthese arrangements will only find favour with landowners if they enter
default in
defaultto them 
defaultvoluntarily. 
defaultAny system based on or involving the comp
defaultulsory acquisition of land will
default be unacceptable to the vast majority of landowners. 
defaultAs such we see 
defaultoffsetting 
defaultas being primarily a commercial matter with the landowner deciding that he wishes to dedicate his land for conservation purposes so long as the price is right. 
defaultQuestion 2: defaultD
defaulto you think the Government’s objectives for the system and the characteristics the
default Government thinks a system would display are right? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough we do not claim to speak for the sort of developers likely to be obliged to provide offsets, we think that anything that brings certainty to the planning system by enabling developers to predi
defaultct from the outset what is expected of them will result in a faster 
defaultand almost certainly cheaper 
defaultsystem. Nevertheless, the system must not have the effect of making much needed small scale developments in the countryside unviable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe strongly believe tha
defaultt offsetting will bring net benefits for biodiversity. 
defaultWe agree with the proposed characteristics. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 3: defaultDo you think it is appropriate to base an offsetting system on the pilot metric? If not is there an alternative metric that should be used? 
default&#xa0;
defaultW
defaulte support the aspiration that the metric needs to be both simple and able to cope with a range of habitat types.  We are not aware of any other metric which better achieves this.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 4: defaultIf you think the pilot metric is the right basis for an offsetti
defaultng system: 
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre there 
defaultany other factors which should be considered when quantifying biodiversity loss and gain?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe think the factors themselves are correct, but some subdivision may be appropriate.  For example, it would be useful to include a specific reference to “age” under distinctiveness. 
default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre the weights given to the different factors appropriate?
default&#xa0;
defaultYes 
default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre there any other changes you think should be taken into account? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are not aware of any. 
default&#xa0;
default(Please also refer to questions under section 6) 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 5: defaultDo you think offsetting assessment should be used when preparing a planning application for a pr
defaultoject? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes, subject to considerations such as thresholds.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuesdefaulttion 6default:default defaultD
defaulto you agree that it should be the responsibility of planning authorities to ensure the mitigation hierarchy is observed and decide what offset is required to compensate for any 
defaultresidual loss
default?  
defaultIf not, why, and how do you think offsetting should be approached in the planning system? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do think it should be the responsibility of the planning authority.  But we are very conscious of the need to avoid placing additional burdens on
default developers. 
defaultThe amount of information a developer is obliged to supply in support of an application is already excessive. 
defaultAs such we suggest a short statement
default, for consideration by the planning authority, 
defaultsetting out how he has complied with the hierarchy
default should be sufficient. 
defaultIf a developer is required to spend time and money in obtaining consultants reports it will defeat one of the main objectives of offsetting. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 7: defaultDo you think biodiversity offsetting should have a role in all development con
defaultsent regimes?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes. We see no reason to differentiate between the various terrestrial development consent 
defaultregimes. We would support the introduction of an offsetting obligation for HS2
default and 
defaultother
default large infrastructure projects.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 8: defaultDo you think developers should be able to choose whether to use offsetting? If so what steps could Government take to encourage developers to use offsetting? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough instinctively we would prefer a voluntary approach we suspect, to be viable, the system will need to 
defaultbe mandatory
default, subject to thresholds, 
defaultboth in terms of the 
defaultassessment and 
defaultthe requirement 
defaultto offset
default.  Unless the system is mandatory we 
defaultdoubt we 
defaultwi
defaultll be able to ensure the level of investor confidence required to produce the number of offset sites required. Landowners will not think it worth their while looking into offsetting if there are only a few random developers looking for offsets. 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestion default9default: defaultIf
default you think developers should be required to use offsetting do you think this requirement should only apply above a threshold based on the size of the development? What level should the threshold be? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes.  We support the use of thresholds rather than
default requirements to assess the significance of the developments impact. 
defaultFrom our experiences with the concept
default’
defaults use under the Habitats Regulations and the EIA Directive, s
defaultignificance
default is 
defaultdifficult to measure and invariably requires the use of consultants.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe suggest that the threshold should be based on the viability of the development.  It should certainly not be so low as to discourage the small scale developments in rural villages or settlements tha
defaultt are required to deal
default with the lack
default of housing in the c
defaultountryside.
default On this basis we believe it should be at least 10 units. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no discussion in the consultation paper about what the thresholds would be for other developments, such as road building. We suggest there should be no thresholds in such cases
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 10default:default defaultDo you think there should be constraints on where offsets can be located? If so what constraints do you think should be put in place? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe location of offsets is a difficult issue. We can see merits in consolidating the offsets resulting 
defaultfrom a number of small developments in one location to create something bigger and better, or to fill in the gaps between protected sites as per the Lawton report.  
default&#xa0;
defaultMoreover, if 
defaultthere is a
default requirement that the offset must be local to the development, the
defaultre may be a difficulty with the number of potential offset providers available. In some localities with only a small number of landowners, those landowners could charge “ransom values” to provide the requisite offsets. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless, we understand the con
defaultcerns that 
defaultsuch an approach may result in the offset being some distance from the related development and local people suffering the possible detrimental impact of the development without obtaining the benefit of the offset.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs such whilst the offset do
defaultes not have to be next to the development it should not be too far away
default.  
defaultAs a compromise between these various factors we suggest that
default,
default at 
defaultthe very least
default,
default the
default development and the offset 
defaultshould be in the same county, although we 
defaultappreciate that this is not
default an ideal situation. If you develop on the northern border of a county then your perfect offsetting site may be a mile away across the boundary and you may be searching for a suitable site 30 miles away further south to stay with the same county
default.
default 
defaultIt may be
default that localities based on other than 
defaultadministrative 
defaultboundaries could also be used, such as water catchments.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 11:default defaultD
defaulto you have any comments on the analysis set out in the impact assessment? 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 12: defaultDo you have evidence that would help refine the Government’s analysis of the costs and benefits of the options considered in this paper? In particular, evidence relating to: 
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe amount of compensation already occurring where there is residual biodiversity
default loss which cannot be avoided or adequately mitigated 
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe method for estimating costs and their magnitude 
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe method for estimating benefits and savings and their magnitude 
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow to capture the wider social and environmental benefits of maintaining England’s stock of biodiversity and delivering a coherent ecological network 
default(e)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLikely take up of offsetting under a permissive approach 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 13: defaultDo you think offsetting should b
defaulte a single consistent national system without scope for local variation? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes, 
defaulta single consistent national system
default is essential.
default  
defaultTo 
defaultwork offsetting will require a nationwide market and that in turn requires one nationwide system.  
defaultThere are already a 
defaultmass of local schemes out there
default, each
default with 
defaulttheir own exponents. It will make developers and landowners lives difficult if everyone has to get their minds around different schem
defaultes in every part of the country.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 14: defaultDo you agree with the proposed e
defaultxceptions to the routine use of biodiversity offsetting? If not, why not? If you suggest additional restriction, why are they needed? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes. We agree with the analysis in the Consultation paper. 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestion 15default:default defaultW
defaulthich
default defaulthabitats do you think should be considered irreplaceable? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNo.  The importance of an irreplaceable habitat should be taken into account through the planning system and the mitigation hierarchy.  The question is the multiplier for destroying such habitats.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe suggest particular attention needs to be given to connectivity and the possibility that a habitat may have an added value because of its location. For example the value of a particular site may not be high in itself, but it may have considerable sign
defaultificance as part of a corridor. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 16: defaultDo you think offsetting should in principle be applied to protected species? 
default&#xa0;defaultYes.  We do, although we accept the complexity of the issue.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe extent to which the suspected or possible presence of, in 
defaultparticular bats, newts and dormice can frustrate or delay farm diversification projects such as barn conversions is a significant concern, particularly since under resourced planning departmen
defaultts are increasingly inclined to
default err on the side of caution. 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestion 17default:default defaultH
defaultas the Government identified the right constraints and features that need to be addressed when applying offsetting to protected species? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe so.  They certainly reflect the complexity of the legal regime. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 18default:default defaultD
defaulto you agree 
defaultthat great crested newts should be the first area of focus? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would prefer it to be bats, but would not object to great crested newts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 19default:default defaultD
defaulto you have any comments on the Government’s thinking on how to apply offsetting to great crested newts
default? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe support it, and suggest it provides a suitable model for other species. 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestion 20default:default defaultS
defaulthould offsetting be considered for any other species in the near future taking account of the constraints on species offsetting? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes. Bats and dormice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 21: defaultDo you think conservation covenants should be put in place as part of an offsetting system? If they are required, who do you think should be responsible for agreeing conservation covenants? If not, how else do you think offsets could be secure
defaultd for the long-term? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe accept the limitations of both freehold and leasehold covenants in th
defaultis context.  However we have been closely engaged with the Law Commission’s work in this area and 
defaultsuspect that what the
defaulty 
defaultdescribes as “workarounds” may have grea
defaultter potential than 
defaultthey believe
default. 
defaultNevertheless we accept the desirability of creating new legal mechanisms
default and a simple way of avoiding the problems with conventional covenants. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 22default:default defaultD
defaulto you think management agreements should be put in place as part of an offsetting system? If they are required, who do you think should be responsible for agreeing management agreements? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our view a management plan setting out the parties aspirations f
defaultor the land, rather like the Views about Management statement required for SSSIs, would be more useful than an agreement.  We suspect any agreement would simply be a parallel document to the conservation covenant. 
defaultIf management plans were to be introduced
default, we
default maintain they should be a 
defaultmatter for negotiation between the parties.
default 
default There are plenty of priva
defaultte organisations, such as FWAG 
defaultwhich think would be capable of acting as facilitators. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 23default:default defaultD
defaulto you think an offset register should be put in plac
defaulte as part of an offsetting system? If so, who do you think should be responsible for maintaining an offset register? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaultdo not see any need for any 
defaultcentral recording of 
defaultoffsets
default; but 
defaultwe would not object to 
defaultthat responsible bodies 
defaultbeing encouraged 
defaultto 
defaultpublish information voluntarily, with the agreement of the relevant landowner.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 2default4:default defaultHow long should offsets be secured for? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are pleased the question has been asked. The presumption that offsets should be secured in perpetuity has been a parti
defaultcular cause for concern.  We think it fundamentally wrong to dictate the use of a particular piece of land for ever. We suggest that few people would think that a land use determined in 1813 still had any great relevance, and similarly that in 2213, few wi
defaultll think a use set now was still appropriate. Moreover, we suspect that many landowners will see little that is attractive about 
defaultdedicating land in perpetuity. 
defaultThey might as well sell it. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs such, we suggest that the default position should be something 
defaultless than perpetu
defaultity –
default66
default years may be a more reasonable timescale. 
default In any event a 
defaultcertain amount of flex
defaultibility in the management plan will be required so that 
defaultso that it can adapt in the l
defaultight of changing circumstances.
defaultQuestion 25default:default defaultA
defaultre there any long-term factors, besides climate change, that should be taken into account when securing offsets? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStatutory designations allow for revocations or modifications in the light of changing circumstances.  We see no reason why conservation cove
defaultnants should be any different.  Climate change, in particular  will result in many changes to the uses to which particular land can be put and will also impact on the location o
defaultf suitable habitats for certain 
defaultspecies, as such we should be encouraging the d
defaultevelopment of flexible structures. 
defaultAttention should also be given to other sources of biodiversity funding. 
default In particular, with the increasing probability that the CAP budget
default will be significantly reduced 
defaultover the coming years, the need to secure other s
defaultources of funding becomes all the greater. 
defaultQuestion 26: defaultDo you think biodiversity offsetting should be” backdated” so it can apply in relation to any planning applications under consideration at the point it is introduced?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe see no reason why it should 
defaultnot be introduced on the basis that the developer can volunteer to provide an offset rather than go through the s.106 procedure.  If it were mandatory we can envisage developers who had already begun commissioning reports in anticipation of having to negot
defaultiate a s.106 agreement being prejudiced. 
defaultQuestion 27: defaultDo you think an offsetting system should take a national approach to the question of significant harm and if so how? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs noted
default above, an obligation to asses
defaults significance creates uncertainty and expenditure. We would very much prefer the test to be based on thresholds. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 28: defaultDo you think any additional mechanisms need to be put in place to secure offsets beyond conservation covenants? If so why and w
defaulthat are they? If this includes measures not listed above, please explain what they are. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe developer is bound by a requirement to acquire an offset by the terms of the planning permission.  If the developer does not provide it personally it will do so o
defaultn the basis of a contract with an offset provider. 
defaultIn either instance there are sufficient enforcem
defaultent mechanisms available. The pl
defaultanning authority can enforce ag
defaultainst the de
defaultveloper and the developer can take action und
defaulte
defaultr the contract with the provider. 
defaultWe 
defaultsuggest that for 
defaultconservation covenant
defaults
default 
defaultto be an effective mechanism certain additional mechanisms should be put in place.  Firstly they 
defaultshould be 
defaultable to be 
defaultregist
defaulte
defaultred
default as a
default 
defaultlocal land charge, and that from the date wh
defaulten a conservation covenant is 
defaultregis
defaulttered it will be enforceable against successors in title to the original 
defaultcovenantor.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly, injunctions and contractual damages should be available to the beneficiary of the covenant in the event of the covenant being breached.  However
default,
default t
defaulthe only circu
defaultmstances in which we can see 
defaultexemplary damages 
defaultbeing legitimate is where the perpetrator has committed the act with a view to making a financial gain.  Exempl
defaultary damages could be ordered which would effectively
default confiscate it. 
defaultWe do not believe these contractual remedies should be available to any third party, including the state.  It is a matter of a private agreement between the parties. 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestion 29: defaultDo you think there should be constraints on what habitat can be provided as
default an offset? If so what constraints do you think should be put in place, and how should they work in practice? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe see no reason why this should not be a matter for the local planning authority to determine when determining the planning application. If it 
defaultconsiders that an offset should require be similar to the destroyed habitat, it could so require, subject to conventional public law constraints. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 30: defaultDo you agree an offsetting system should apply a strategic approach to generate net ecological 
defaultgain in line with 
defaultMaking Space for Nature
default? If so, at what level should the strategy be set and who by? How should the system ensure compliance with the strategy? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs discussed above in the context of the location of offsets, we see a place for this but it
default cannot be the sole approach.  We suggest it should be set at county level, although this need not mean that the offsets could only be provided within the 
defaultcount
defaulty boundary. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the early stages
default 
defaultof the roll out of offsetting, a strategic approach could 
defaultcreate more obstacles than benefits.  The aspiration should be to ensure the system is functioning effectively and has the necessary “buy in” be
defaultfore deciding to regulate it 
defaultby means of a strategic overview.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 31: defaultDo you think habitat banking should be allowed? Do you think a provider must show intent to create a habitat bank to be allowed to sell it as an 
defaultoffset? Do you think habitat banks should be “retired” if they are not used to provide an offset? If so, after 
defaulthow long? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes it should and for the reasons given.  We suggest that an obligation to show intent is a prima facie an unnecessary imposition and this section of the consultation reads a little like it is trying to create obstacles. 
defaultThe imperative should 
defaultbe for the landowner 
defaultto improve the biodiversity and 
defaultenvironmental  management on his land. If he can subsequently sell as part of an offset providing business then that is all to the good. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 32: defaultDo you think maintaining an environmental gain that
default might otherwise be lost should count as an offset? If so, how should a value be attached to the offset? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes.  We suspect that with the decline in agri environment budgets, a number of sites that have hitherto benefited from public funding will be at ris
defaultk of deteriorating.  Offsetting is one of the few ways of preventing that happening. 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestiondefault 33: defaultDo you think it is acceptable or not to use biodiversity gain created for other purposes as an offset? If you do, how should it be decided what is allowed t
defaulto be used as an offset? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes. We suggest that anything which creates additionality should be included. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 34: defaultHow do you think the quality of assessments should be assured and who by? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should be a matter for the local planning authority.  The creation of some overarching body will simply result in additional bureaucracy for marginal, if any, gains. A system based on assessors will be even worse. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 35: defaultH
defaultow should differences o
defaultf opinion over assessments be addressed? 
default&#xa0;
defaultDifferences of opinion can be addressed via the planning system.  We do not see any issues that woul
defaultd fall outside its competence. 
defaultThere is no need to create a parallel structure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 36: defaultDo you think the m
defaultetric should take account of hedgerows? If so do you think the current approach is the right one or should it be adjusted? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaulthave no strong views on this and 
defaultwould not want the introduction 
defaultof an offsetting system to be delayed by concerns regarding the inclusion of hedgerows. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 37: defaultD
defaulto you think it should be possible to offset the loss of hedgerows by creating or restoring another form of habitat? 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 38: defaultIf conservation covenants are put in place, do you think providing for offsetting through planning guidance will be sufficient to achieve national consistency? If not, what legislative provision may be necessary? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe planning guidance should be su
defaultfficient. If it transpires that is not the case, further consideration can be given to the issue.
