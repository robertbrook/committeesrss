default would like to thank you for providing us with the opportunity to outline our stance on the draft eligibility bill. However we cannot specifically recommend any particular option as outlined in the original letter.
default&#xa0;defaultThe Draft Voting Eligibility Bill has attracted much controversy since its first appearance in the Houses of Parliament in 2010, proposing only those sentenced to four or more years imprisonment should be ineligible to vote. In February 2011, the blanket ban remained. It appears the UK has little choice but to reform in order to comply with EU directives from the Hirst 2005 case, and the EU Convention on Human Rights.

defaultVictim Support recognises the positive role social responsibility and citizenship can play on a prisoners’ rehabilitation process and that in some cases this may contribute to reductions in reoffending. However, there is currently little 
defaultavailable 
defaultby the way of a robust evidence base to show the positive impact of citizenship on reductions in reoffending.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt Victim Support we strongly believe in the rehabilitation of offenders as a means to reduce further offending. But we 
defaultdon’t have the evidence to comment 
defaulton the issue of prisoners voting without evidence to clearly demonstrate the link between the enfranchisement of offenders and lower recidivism.

defaultDifferent victims will feel differently on this issue – there is no one single viewpoint. But what is clear is that this issue has been drawn out for far too long and has taken up too much of government and the public’s time. What is needed is a clear and swift decision so that the government can concentrate instead on what should be the most important issue – the needs of victims of crime, whose confidence in the justice system is already far too low and who too often feel marginalised by the criminal justice process.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn conclusion, at Victim Support we believe that the government’s focus should shift from offender
defaults’
default rights to the rights and needs of victims of crime.
