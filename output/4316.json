How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low\n-\ncarbon innovation, and how should it measure su\nccess?\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow should \nthe Department for Energy and Climate Change (\nDECC\n)\n ensure t\nhat its remai\nning capital allocation for low-\ncarbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of \nunderspend\n?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n \nUK p\nublic funding for \nlow-carbon \ninnovation \nhas reduced annually since the G\novernment spending review in 2010\n (National Audit Office, 2013)\n. \nResearch by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment suggests that the \ncurrent \nlevel of \npublic funding for low-carbon innovation, and \nthe way in which it is targeted\n, \nis insufficient\n to achieve the UK’s legally\n-\nbinding \n2050 emissions reduction targets\n at the lowest possible cost.\n&#xa0;\nThe level of support for low-carbon innovation in the UK2.2 \nThe\n key \nfinding\n \nof \na\n recent \nresearch \nproject\n by the Grantham Research Institute\n \n(\nAghion\n \net al\n.\n, 2012) \nis that there is \na \nstrong path dependency\n \nwhich determines\n the direction of innovation\n. B\nusinesses\n which have innovated in \nlow-carbon\n \ntechnologies\n in the past, \nand \nwhich \nare exposed to \nmore \nlow-carbon\n \ninnovation in the economy, \nare more likely to direct their research activit\nies\n to\nwards\n \nlow-carbon\n \ninnovation in the future\n.\n Similarly, \nbusinesses\n \nwith a history of \n‘\ndirty\n’\n innovation, and \nwhich are \nlocated in economies \nthat are \nmore speciali\ns\ned \nin\n \n‘\ndirty\n’\n innovation, are more likely to focus on \nit\n in the future.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nSince today\n’s \nstock of \n‘\ndirty\n’\n innovation is much greater than that of clean\n innovation\n, the path dependency e\nff\nect tend\ns\n to \nlock economies into \nhigh-carbon research and \nhigh\n-\ncarbon emissions technologies, even after the introduction of a mild carbon \npricing mechanism\n or \nresearch and development\n subsidies for clean\n innovation\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nThis highlights the desirability of acting \nearly\n \nto shift incentives \naway from \n‘\ndirty\n’\n innovation and towards low-carbon innovation.\n Indeed,\n the longer the delay\n, the more \ndifficult and \nexpensive it becomes to redirect the economy \ntowards clean technologies\n, as shown by \nAcemoglu\n \net al\n.\n (2012)\n.\n \nCurr\nent UK policies \nare not sufficient\n to move innovation on to a low-carbon pathway and\n this\n \nwill make\n the UK dependent on foreign technology\n \nto meet its \n2050 \nemissions reduction \ntarget\n at least cost\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5 O\nnce the economy has \nshifted to a low-carbon \ninnovation pathway\n, \nthe \npath dependency effect \nimplies\n that the economy then naturally lock\ns\n itself into \nlow-carbon\n \ntechnologies\n, removing the need for further\n \nGovernment support\n.\n \nThis further strengthens the case for early \nGovernment \naction to support \nlow-carbon innovation\n,\n which can be relaxed in the future as the economy’s stock of \nlow-carbon \nknowledge\n grows\n.\n \nHowever, c\nlear \ncriteria governing\n \nfuture \nreduc\ntion\ns\n in\n \nGovernment support for \ninnovation \nmust be\n set\n in advance\n to prevent unexpected policy\n cha\nnges\n \nthat\n could inhibit investment. \n&#xa0;\nThe type of support provided for low-carbon innovation in the UK2.6 \nT\nhe UK’s current strategy \nappears\n \nto prioriti\ns\ne policies\n,\n \nsuch as\n \nfeed-in tariffs\n \nand a carbon price floor\n,\n \nwhich promote deployment rather than\n \ndirect support \nfor\n \nresearch and development\n.\n \nHowever, \nas \nshown\n by \nAcemoglu\n \net al\n. (2012), \nenvironmental polic\nies\n \nthat are economically optimal \nto fight climate change not only\n \naddress demand\n \nbut also\n \ndirectly incentivi\ns\ne the development of \nlow-carbon \ntechnologies.\n&#xa0;\n2.7 Providing more direct support for research and development\n \nfor\n low-carbon technologies\n, for example \nthrough\n tax credits\n and subsidies, would provide better value for money and could be economically advantageous for the UK as it is more likely to benefit \nUK \nbusinesses.\n Indeed, \nas shown by \nDechezleprêtre\n \n&amp;\n \nGlachant\n (2013),\n \ndeployment policies \nincentivi\ns\ne innovation activities not \njust\n \nin the UK\n but also in \nother\n countries\n. While these deployment policies certainly have a positive impact on\n global \nefforts to tackle \nclimate change\n, they \nmay provide less economic benefit to the UK and \nhence may\n be less poli\ntically acceptable.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1 The best strategy for the UK G\novernment \nis to \ntarget its \nsupport for \nlow-carbon innovation \nat technologies that have the highest \npotential\n \nfor \nemissions reduction\ns\n, are \nfurthest away from the market\n,\n \nand \nhave the highest knowledge \nspillovers\n (i\n.\ne\n.\n knowledge\n benefits for other inventors).\n&#xa0;\n3.2 Research by the Grantham Research Institute\n \n(\nDechezle\nprêtre\n \net al\n.\n, 2013) has shown that \nknowledge \nspillover\n \nbenefits \n(\ni.e.\n the societal benefits that justify policy intervention) \nare much higher in radically new low\n-\ncarbon technologies, such as renewable energy technologies, than in technologies \naimed at improving the efficiency of existing \nhigh-\ncarbon tec\nhnologies. This justifies prioriti\ns\ning renewable energy technologies, in particular the most radically new \ntechnologies \n(\nfor example\n \noff\nshore \nwind\n and\n marine energy), over energy efficiency techn\nologies\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n1 Th\ne\n measurement of success\n is \nimportant to\n sustain \nG\novernment support \nfor\n the LCICG\n. \nR\nesearchers at\n \nthe Grantham Research Institute have \ndeveloped three\n \nindicators that can be used\n at the national level\n to assess the success of \nlow-carbon innovation\n in the\n UK:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPatent applications filed by UK businesses \nfor\n low-carbon technologies, both in the UK and elsewhere. \nOne benefit\n of \nusing \npatent applications \nas a metric is that they allow the identification of\n low-carbon technologies \nat a highly disaggregated leve\nl\n (\ne.g.\n wave energy patents)\n and \nof their link to\n UK-based applicants\n.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExports of low-ca\nrbon capital goods from the UK (\ne,g\n,\n wind turbines\n)\n. \nSo far w\ne have identified about 20 different low-carbon capital goods that we are able to trace in international t\nrade databases\n.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForeign investments in UK-based low-carbon \nbusinesses and, conversely, \ninvestments \nmade by\n \nUK-based low-carbon \nbusinesses \nin\n foreign countries, are \nanother\n \ngood indicator \nof\n \nthe success \nof\n any low-carbon innovation strategy\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nTwo of these indicators seem already \nto be \npart of the metrics\n used by the LCICG\n. We \nrecommend that \nthe \ninternational \ninvestment indicator should be added.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nIdeally\n,\n \nthe\n LCICG \nsh\nould try to measure not only the impact of low-carbon innovation policies \non the growth of the low-carbon sector\n, but also the impact of these policies on the growth of the economy as a whole. A key result from \nrecent research by the Grantham Research Institute \nis that a redirection of innovation from \n‘\ndirty\n’\n to \nlow-carbon \ntechn\nologies can lead to higher economic growth in the medium\n term\n because \nlow-carbon \ntechnologies generate much larger knowledge spillovers in the economy than the \n‘\ndirty\n’\n technologie\ns they replace (\nDechezleprêtre\n \net al\n.\n, 2013). A necessary condition for \nlow-c\narbon \npolicies \nto \nimpact\n \ngrowth of\n the economy \nmore broadly \nis that\n \nthe \ntechnologies\n they support\n \nmust \ngenerate\n \nbenefits\n outside their \nown fields\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nFor \nexample\n, \nDechezleprêtre\n \net al\n.\n (2013) found that clean patents in the car industry relating to the \n‘\ngeneration,\n conversion or distribution of electric power\n’\n have been \nused to develop new computer sciences patents in\n \n‘\nelectrical digital data processing\n’\n technologies. Another example is \n‘\ncombustion apparatus using fluent fuel\n’\n technologies\n, which\n hav\ne\n spi\nll\ned \nover\n to\n \n‘\ndiagnosis, surgery and\n identification\n’\n \npatents\n in medical science.\n \nThe Grantham Research Institute is\n currently \nworking on a project that analyses\n the impact of knowledge spillovers from green technologies on business performance.\n This methodology could be applied to UK businesses\n,\n in particular to measure the impact of low-carbon innovation on economic growth.\n \nThis project seems \nvery relevant for the work of the LCICG\n, and its\n results will be available in Spring/Summer 2014.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1 \nDECC should \nprioritises innovation\n \nfunding for\n \ncarbon capture and storage (\nCCS\n)\n technologies.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nGiven the current energy mix in the UK, \nsupport for \nCCS\n (including gas, industrial and biomass CCS)\n will be a key component of \nthe Government’s\n \nstrategy for achieving the \ntarget\n \nof\n reduc\ning\n \ngreenhouse gas\n \nemissions by 80% \nby\n 2050\n compared with\n 1990 levels\n.\n In addition, CCS technologies are still at an early stage of development\n; when\n \nG\nov\nernment support is most needed.\n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nIn a recent paper, \nDechezleprêtre\n \net al\n.\n \n(\n2013) \nf\nou\nnd that innovations in CCS technologies generate even larger knowledge \nspillovers\n \nthan renewable energy technologies, implying that the incentives to conduct private research and development activities\n, compared to what is socially desirable, are lower\n \nfor CCS\n than \nfor\n \nother technologies (including \nrenewables\n)\n.\n \nS\ntrong public support is\n \ntherefore\n warranted.\n&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;\nAcemoglu\n, D., \nAghion\n, P., \nBursztyn\n, L., and \nHemous\n, D.\n,\n \n2012\n. \nThe \nEnvironment\n and \nDirected\n \nTechnical\n Change\n.\n \nThe American \nEconomic\n \nReview\n, 102(1), pp.\n131–166. \n[online] \nAvailable\n \nat\n:\nhttp://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.102.1.131\n&#xa0;\nAghion\n,\n P.,\n \nDechezleprêtre\n,\n A.,\n \nHemous\n,\n D.,\n Martin\n, R.,\n and Van \nReenen\n,\n J.,\n 2012. \nCarbon\n Taxes, \nPath\n \nDependency\n and \nD\nirected\n \nTechnical\n Change: Evidence \nfrom\n the Auto \nIndustry\n. \nGrantham \nResearch\n Institute on Climate Change and the \nEnvironment\n \nWorking\n \nPaper\n No. 102.\n [\npdf\n] \nAvailable\n \nat\n:\nhttp://personal.lse.ac.uk/dechezle/adhmv_nov29.pdf\n&#xa0;\nDechezleprêtre\n,\n A.,\n Martin\n, R.,\n and \nMohnen\n,\n M.,\n 2013. \nKnowledge\n \nspillovers\n \nfrom\n clean and \ndirty\n technologies: A patent citation \nanalysis\n.\n \nGrantham \nResearch\n Institute on Climate Change and the \nEnvironme\nnt\n \nWo\nrking\n \nPaper\n.
