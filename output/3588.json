"Supplementary written evidence from \nSanjeev\n \nAppicharla\n (SLC 042)\n&#xa0;\nThe Additional Written Evidence is a submission by the author in his personal capacity. \n&#xa0;\nThe aim of the paper is t\nhree\n-\nfold. First to present\n \nNetwork Rail data on level crossings \nas \nreported by Laura Roberts and published by the Daily Telegraph on 18 August 2010\n. Then, \nexamine the \npublished \ndata using\n the Bayesian method of statistics\n to establish the reliability of level crossing user\n actions\n \nand reliability of\n GB Railways’ inferences\n. \nUtility of this approach is to examine whether the latest evidence of RSSB/Network Rail claim that railway accidents are a result of user’s action accords with historical observations or not?  \n&#xa0;\nFollowing the \nWri\ntten and \nOral Evidences \npresented \nbefore the Transport Select Committee, a\nuthor is anxious that c\nhange of leadership at Network Rail and additional\n funding by ORR \nmay be used \nby GB Railway Industry \nto close out \ndis\n-used level crossings to satisfy anxiety o\nf members of public and \nmedia to \nmeet\n the regulatory targets without changing the underlying process of risk based decision making\n or \nmake\n a \nlong –term \nplan to eliminate \nthe dangerous assets\n of level crossings\n.  \n&#xa0;\nPsychology of good decision making require\ns that decision maker reflect upon the data when new or same evidence is presented again to work out whether a change of one’s own knowledge base is required or not?\n In this light, author examines the risk data publicly available. \n&#xa0;\nSecond \nis \nto draw the a\nttention of the Members of Transport Selection Committee\n to\n \nthe distractions \nintroduce\nd\n into GB railway industrial decision making on hazards posed by level \ncrossings by the prevalent ideas of different schools of \nIndustrial finan\nce and economy\n. Utility of\n this ap\nproach is to illuminate \napproach\nes\n applied to measuring and forecasting risk and examine whether industrial decision making in the GB railways aligns with the best practice of risk management. \n&#xa0;\nThird \nis \nto draw \nattention of the Members of Transpor\nt Selection Committee \nto \nthe fact \nof \nthe risk analysis as it is performed\n. Failure of risk analysis \nis itself is \na\n formal cause contributing\n to the level crossing accidents. \nThis\n reasoning from Aristotelian causation perspective is \na\n valid idea accepted by\n \npsychological (human factor)\n experts\n (Rasmussen, et al., 1994)\n.  \nRisk management can be itself a common mode of failure is learnt from Douglas W. Hubbard’s publication: Failure of Risk Management\n (Hubbard, 2009)\n.  \nFailure of railway organisations to \nunderstand safety risk of level crossings was studied by Barry A. Turner in 1976\n (Turner, 1976)\n.\n&#xa0;\nPrevious submissions \nin a chronological order \nby autho\nr drew \nattention to \nthemes of human error \ninvolving groups\n of people working together using extended Swi\nss Cheese Model\n in a general manner\n, \ninformed how \nqualitative post-mortem risk analysis \nin 2011 was performed of the \nMoreton\n on \nLugg\n(2010) accident\n, and\n how\n pre-mortem risk analysis of \na\n level-crossing accident\n \nof train-bus  collision \ncan be carried out\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nThis submission is to be read together with the \nfollowing documents submitted earlier by the author.\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWritten Evidence SLC 015\n dated 11 September 2013\n. \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWritten Evidence\n dated 04 November 2013\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWritten Evidence dated 11\n November 2013\n&#xa0;\nAuthor requests that\n earlier Written Evidence dated 16\nth\n November 2013 may be discarded as author wishes to withdraw the submission\n.\n Author apologies for inconvenience cause\nd\n by the submission of the Evidence dated 16\nth\n November 2013. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor is British Naturalised citizen since 2006. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor‘s experience in system safety engineering research and experience is evidenced by the publications of peer reviewed publications at the Institute of Engineers and Technology ( IET) International Sy\nstem Safety Conf\nerences in 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor was employed at RSSB from 2004 till 2010 as a System Engineer and deployed the System for Railway Investigations Methodology at RSSB\n for identifying hazards and analysing risks of few sig\nnalling systems\n. This methodology showed that RSSB Safety Risk Assessment \nand Decision Making Process \nsuffer from \nwhat is known as Group-think bias\n. \nThis finding was shared with the community of \nrailway \nengineers at the IET System Safety Conference October\n 2010. \nRSSB is \na\n GB Railway Industry body. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAuthor was awarded a Letter of Gratitude by the IET in 2009 for his contribution to the UK HSE Consultation Document,’’ Be Part of Solution, the UK HSE’s Strategy for the 21st Century’’. \n&#xa0;\nSa\nnjeev\n Kumar \nAppicharla\n, dated 1\n7\n November \n2013, London.

Author thanks the reader(s) for their patience in \nreading the material that may be full of \ngrammatical and \ntypos \nthat may lie hidden away from author’s eye\n.\n &#xa0;\nThis paper presents\n the results of examination of Network Rail published \nrisk \ndata on level crossings using Bayesian method of statistics as per the System for Railway Investigations Methodology (SIRI). \nThis section discusses the role of human factor issu\nes on performance when \na\n human user interacts with level crossings. \nThe discussions over societal risk by John Adams may be consulted here\n.\n&#xa0;\nAuthor presented the application of the Bayesian method of statistics (i.e. rules of conditional probabilities) to\n determine the quantitative reliability of train driver (human performance) in \ndangerous situations in \nthe form of a poster session at the IET System Safety Conference in 2010. Author had used \nsimplified\n \nBayesian method of statistics\n in his submission to t\nhe UK Law Commission Inquiry on Level Crossings(Appicharla, 2010). Author noted that Bayesian\n method can be\n applied where errors in statistical risk analysis are to be identified as suggested by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman\n. This is\n to overcome the biase\ns inherent in\n risk perceptions by public and experts as well. \nAuthor \nexplained \nthis in a general way \nin the Technical Review of the Common Safety Method presented at the IET System Safety Conference in October 2013\n \nand in the Submission to the UK Law Commi\nssion in 2010 (Appicharla, 2010),\n(Appicharla, 2013)\n. \n Complicated forms of Bayesian analysis were performed by expert statisticians to argue the case \nfor \nthe temperature effect of ring failures and the probability risk assessment of Space Shuttle Challenge\nr launch decision\n (Dalal, et al., 1989)\n. \n&#xa0;\nScott Adams, creator of Dilbert, writes that engineers hate risk\n (Adams, 1996)\n. Scott Adams reasons that engineers try to eliminate risk it whenever they can because media will amplify a single engineering mistake\n. Some of the examples of engineering mistakes given by Scott Adams are \nHidenberg\n, Space Shuttle\n Challenger\n, Hubble space telescope, Apollo 13, Titanic, Ford Pinto, and \nCorvair\n. \nThe fear of killing thousands motivates engineers to eliminate risk, writes Scott Adams. \n&#xa0;\nAn objection may be raised by railway executives and staff that this is a very complicated way of looking at risk\n for the fear of media \nwhen deaths at level crossing\ns are never more than double figures\n. In general, \nthey argue that \norganisations and their leaders are always short of time, money and resources and do not have \nenough \nresources to indulge in such wishful thinking. \nA j\nudicial test of \nevaluating \ncost-benefit\n analysis \nof eliminating risk \nprovides \nus with \na satisfactory and legal ground for arriving at a decision on how much investment is to be made into safety improvements. \nOpposition from employees is also a factor in decision making \nprocess \nand therefore, \na \ncognitive appr\noach to errors is a distraction. The\n attention of the executives \nis a expensive resource and shall be depl\noyed where\n \nfar more serious decisions are to be made. \nThis objection is a valid one and reader can find this type of argument in the bri\nef survey of literature on managerial decision making\n by Janis&amp; Mann\n. T\nhis strategy \ncan be labelled as a quasi-\nsatisficing\n approach or \nsatisficing\n approach to decision \nmaking (\nL.Janis\n &amp; Mann, 1977). \nHoweve\nr, this argument does not stand up\n to the legal scr\nutiny as it was examined and concluded \nby the UK Law Commission \nin September 2013\n that law on level crossings needs to be reformed to facilitate faster closure\n.\n&#xa0;\nHere is the response of the Office of Rail Regulation to \nthe UK Law Commissions proposal\n. \nIan\n Prosser, Director of Railway Safety at the Office of Rail Regulation, said: “The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) welcomes the Law Commissions’ proposals to modernise level crossing legislation, which will cut red-tape and make it easier for high-risk cros\nsings to be closed.\n&#xa0;\n Great Britain’s level crossings, although among the safest in Europe, pose a significant rail safety risk to the public.\n&#xa0;\n That is why we have announced millions of pounds’ worth of extra funds to close or upgrade level crossings over t\nhe next five years, and will work to support implementation of improved level crossing laws.”\n&#xa0;\nIn the previous Written Evidence dated 11\nth\n November 2013, author has shown how the signalling engineering experts believed that \nGreat Britain’s\n level crossings \nare\n the safest in Europe\n and therefore, no action is needed. \n&#xa0;\nBy reflecting upon the statement of the ORR’s Director of Railway Safety, author wonders whether level crossings can be categorised by risk into t\nwo different categories of high\n and \nlow risk\n le\nvel crossings.  The question arises as to how to detect errors in risk \ncategorisation \nby industrial organisations \nby comparing it to the data \npublicly available in a cost efficient manner? This paper gives an answer in relation to the UK railway level cros\nsings. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFurther, a\nuthor wishes to counter this logic by drawing the objector’s attention to the fact that psychology of thinking and reasoning is an active research subject since the time of Aristotle\n in a recorded form\n. Aristotle argued that human beings are rational animals. This paper published by Philip N. Johnson-Laird argues that errors depend upon the mental \nmodel that is\n used in reasoning in 2010\n. Philip N. Johnson-Laird argues against computational approaches t\no problem solving. Therefore, reasoning is helpful guide to draw out errors in reasoning. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor wishes to add that unlike errors in economic \nor statistical \nreasoning, the loss of life is \nirreversible\n event\n \nlike an incurable disease that\n \nhas \nno drug\n that\n can cure\n it\n. \nFrom a profit perspective, one can postpone development of drugs if the development is un-profitable. Author does not think that this is a sound policy. \nFurther, \nsettling the debate from a stochastic analytical view point lies in ascertaining\n the type of distribution involved, \ndetermine \nthe spread of parameters etc and involves performing social analysis or analysis of computer stimul\nations\n (Dalal, et al., 1989)\n. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor had showed how \nAristotle model of three causal factors (causational \nmodel\n) model\n can explain\n the adverse system event coming\n into be\ning. The Clapham Accident case study wa\ns published to show the logic involved in the\n explanation\n \nof the accident\n(Appicharla, 2010)\n. Author\n accepts the fact three causal factors model cannot ex\nplain the making of the Universe\n and this has been clarified in the NASA Challenger Case Study published by the author (\nAppicharla\n, 2012). \nExecutive decision making i\nn risk assessment process used by firms is in\n itself a third factor apart from the materia\nl and efficient factors involved in the\n physical\n causation of accidents. \nNobel Laureate Daniel \nKahneman\n cautions\n the readers\n against \nusage of causal intuitions when statistical thinking may be appropriate (pp77)\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. These difficulties \nintrodu\nced by universal religious beliefs \nas pointed by \nPaul Bloom and described by \nNobel Laureate, Daniel \nKahneman\n over physical causes, intentional and other causes do not manifest in the case of author’s \nexplanation of\n the Herefordshire Level Crossing accident\n.  \nIt is important to note Nobel Laureate Herbert \nA.Simon’s\n idea that co-relation is not causation\n (Simon, 1972)\n. The philosophy of action and inaction is extremely subtle is noted by Swami \nNikhilananda\n on his commentary on the verses of 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, \nand 4.19 of the ancient sacred text of Hindus, the \nBhagavad\n \nGita\n (Nikhilananda, 1944)\n.\n&#xa0;\nAnother fact \nauthor wishes to draw \nattention \nto \nis that the objector’s do not take into account the fact\n that\n some of the technologica\nlly\n innovative \n(Apple\n products) \nproducts are a result of influence of Zen Buddhism\n way of meditation\n. This is \nreported in the Schumpeter column of the \nEconomist (\nSchumpeter, 2013). \nScott Adams noted in 1996 that executives had Buddha laid in their top drawers. \n Author is aware that resea\nrchers in the safety risk domain do undertake mediation activities to focus their attention on hazards and measures and try avoiding mind being distracted by other specious arguments. Makers of atom bomb also relied upon meditation much to the dislike of t\nhe author’s \nsentiments (\nYouTube, 2009). \nIn other words, utilitarian approach to managing people under the maxim of happiness of \nmany numbers\n of people \nby organisation’s bosses\n \nmay ignore \nor deny \nthe pain inflicted \non other members of the society\n by the mem\nbers of their organisations\n in the pursuit of happiness\n. \n&#xa0;\nNow, a\nuthor \nwishes to \nshows the difference between human and machine learning.\n \nNobel Laureate Daniel \nKahneman\n \nnotes that expertise in chess playing is a skill h\noned over many thousands of hours pra\nctice (\npp\n 239)\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n \nIn terms of the logic of chess game at the expert level, author asserts that a human chess player playing white and allowed one or two human errors can always win against an algorithm playing chess. Author reckons that com\nputer companies like \nIBM etc will not object to \nan unfair chess game\n being played\n. \n&#xa0;\nApart from the failures of memory, \nperception, and cognition of danger, \nresearch on human errors\n and decision making \nneeds to \ntake account of Consciousness. \nThe scientific\n \napproach to investigate\n human\n consciousness has\n not made much progress\n over last two hundred years\n. \nNobel laureates like Francis Crick have failed to establish that consciousness is local and \nparticular\n to any region of the brain\n. \nAuthor has noted that \nFr\nancis Crick and \nChristof\n Koch explained an amazing case of a lady patient \nwhose brain is damaged by carbon oxide poisoning but is able to \ncatch ball and \nis unable to see form. \n&#xa0;\nAn attempt to explain the workings of human brain (emergent properties like pain, pleasure, visual awareness, and seeing qualities in \nobject)\n in terms of its component parts together is labelled by author as \na\n reductionist hypothesis\n (\nKock\n, 1998)\n.  Experim\nents in the neurological field have failed to yield any satisfactory results\n for scientific demonstration that consciousness is local and particulate. The experiment in 2009 has demonstrated the hypothesis that \nsystem approach to consciousness is not tenab\nle. \nNeuronal synchronization in the gamma\n \nband is considered important for the transient functional\n \nintegration of neural assemblies across brain areas to achieve\n \nvarious cognitive functions\n. T\nhe\n degree to which increases in\n \nevent-related synchronization (\nERS) in the gamma band were\n \nassociated with awareness of a stimulus (its \ndetectability\n) and/or\n \nthe emotional content of the stimulus\n were studied. \nExperimenters\n observed increases in\n \ngamma band ERS within prefrontal--anterior \ncingulate\n, visual,\n \nparietal, \nposterior \ncingulate\n, and superior temporal cortices to\n \nstimuli available to conscious awareness. However, we also\n \nobserved increases in gamma band ERS within the \namygdala\n,\n \nvisual, prefrontal, parietal, and posterior \ncingulate\n cortices to\n \nemotional relative\n to neutral stimuli, irrespective of their availability\n \nto conscious access. This suggests that increased gamma band ERS is related to, but not sufficient for, consciousness\n (Qian Luo1, 2009)\n. \n \nThe ERS argument by neuroscience experts is analogous to elect\nrical engineers argument that several generators can run parallel connected to the grid and share the burden as long as the load conditions, frequency and other factors like speed etc are stable.  However, a load surge or any other disturbing condition imp\nosed on the set of generators can de-stabilise the performance of the set of generating machines. \n&#xa0;\nSearch for \nreligious\n and spiritual \nexp\nlanations of\n consciousness and/or human awareness  is approximately \n5,000 year old enterprise \ncan be learnt from these\n modern translations of ancient \nSacred \ntexts\n(\nNikhilananda\n, 1944)\n, (Valerie, 2003)\n.\n Thus, author accepts that \nC\nonsciousness\n is \nuniversal and singular in nature. \nThis is in accordance with the teaching of the Upanishads All is Brahman\n (Nikhilananda, 1944)\n,\n (Valerie, 2003), (Vyasa, 2005)\n. \nTherefore, author does not subscribe to the view that \nmembers of public participating in experiments are any more irrational \nthen\n their counter parts in the psychological laboratory.  \nInterest in human factors issues and si\ntuational awareness has a long history can be seen from reading of these Sacred texts.  \n&#xa0;\nNobel Laureate Bertrand Russell noted t\nhere is a peculiarly painful chamber inhabited solely by philosophers\nwho have refuted Hume. These philosophers, though in Hell\n, have not\n \nlearned wisdom. They continue to be governed by their animal propensity\n \ntowards induction. But every time that they have made an induction, the next\n \ninstance falsifies it. This, however, happens only during the first hundred\n \nyears of their damna\ntion. After that, they learn to expect that an induction\nwill be falsified, and therefore it is not falsified until another century of\n \nlogical torment has altered their expectation. Throughout all eternity surprise\n \ncontinues, but each time at a higher logi\ncal level\n (Russell, 1945)\n.\n A Penguin editor noted on the back cover that David Hume viewed human beings not as religious creation, nor as a machine, but as a creature dominated by sentiment, passion and appetite\n (Hume, 1739/1984)\n.  \nDavid Hume argued that i\nf we exclude the sensible qualities of colour, sound, taste and smell, there is nothing \nin the Universe, which has such an existence(pp280)\n (Hume, 1739/1984)\n. \nDavid Hume examining the debate between theologians and moral philosophers on the theme of \nimmate\nriality of soul noted that the fundamental principle of the atheism of Spinoza is the doctrine of the simplicity of the universe, and the unity of substance, in which Spinoza supposes both thought and matter to inhere. Spinoza, as understood by David Hume,\n noted that substance is perfectly simple and indivisible, exists everywhere, without any local presence. \n \nAuthor notes\n that d\nespite being called atheist,\n \nSpinoza \ndid believe \nthat universe has a resting place in God.  \n&#xa0;\nAlfred \nNorth\n Whitehead\n \n(pp155-156\n)\n, \nwho tutored Bertrand \nRussell,\n noted that the second half of the modern philosophical thought\n from Descartes to Kant \nhas been hampered by \none, or other \nof the following \nthree misconceptions:\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe substance\n-\nquality doctrine of actuality \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe sensationalist \ndoctrine of perception\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Kantian doctrine of the objective world as a construct from subjective experience \n&#xa0;\nAlfred North Whitehead, adopting the perspective of mathematical theory of sets, argued that no occasion can be both in the past and future of \na \nduration\n. A duration is a complete set of actual occasions, such that all members of the set are mutually contemporary one with another\n (Whitehead, 1927/1978)\n.  This insight applies to the hazardous events in which the states of the world are altered due t\no loss lives at level crossings. \nThe duration of suc\nh an occasion may last for centuries as evidenced from reading of the history of level crossings\n (Hall.S &amp; Mark, 2008)\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe UK Parliament Note 156 dated June 2001 looked at human factors which are liab\nle to cause such errors, examines\nhow their effects can be minimised and analysed the implications for health and safety policy\n.  Readers of this note may falsely assume that investment into human factors in the GB railway \nduring the last thirteen years \nm\nay have led to safety risk reduction in the GB railway industry. The continuous stream of level crossing and track worker accidents draw our attention to the fact the operating and maintenance \nrules\n, and signalling\n \nprocedures still\n suffer from latent human\n factors issues. Moreover, the UK Parliament Note 156 did not look at the human errors that may occur in the method of risk and accident analysis deployed by the GB railway industry. \n&#xa0;\nResearch conducted in 1974 by William Johnson and his team found that v\narious acts of omission and commission in industrial organisations \ncan \nlead to accidents. They developed a logical tree representation called Management Oversight and Risk Tree to perform what is known as post-mortem analysis of accident to learn what went\n wrong and inform \ndecision making based upon the MORT representation\n (Kingston, et al., 2004)\n. \n&#xa0;\nResearch conducted in 1989 by Deborah J. Mitchell, of the Wharton School; Jay Russo, of Cornell; and Nancy Pennington, of the University of Colorado, found tha\nt prospective hindsight—imagining that an event has already occurred—increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%. We have used prospective hindsight to devise a method called a\n&#xa0;\npremortem\n, which helps project teams identif\ny risks at the outset\n.\n&#xa0;\nAn unpublished paper by author \nwhilst working at RSSB \nexplored the risks of a bus-train collision and e\nstablished the fact an user operating under\n knowledge based behaviour \n(using\n the \nterm as it is used in the Human Factors’ Framew\nork \nSkill-Rules-Knowledge Framework\n) will certainly lead\n to a \nfata\n bus and train collision due to the lack of effective measures to prevent such an occurrence\n (Appicharla, 2009)\n. \nInformation processing at knowledge based level is slow and takes effort and \nis prone to error. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAfter discussions on briefly on the cognitive illusions that may occur, it is pertinent to divert attention to the measurement of risk. \nMeasurement of risk is\n an ongoing concern of academics and members of public as well\n. \nFrom the representations used in the standard decision theory perspective,\n author represents the hazardous event as\n the decision node and the outcomes\n as the \nresult of chance nodes\n. Because \na decision maker(s) made a decision to install level crossings on the railway infrastructure it is appropriate to treat the hazardous events as a decisional event in the following discussion on measurement of risk and error in human performance. \n&#xa0;\nThe Tele\ngraph article published in 2010 contained the following figures for the year 2009\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe above data from the perspective of \nquantitative risk analysis\n (i.e. event tree analysis as noted by James Reason) represents\n \nthe distribution of \nvarious \noutcomes of an initiating event\n (Reason, 1990)\n. \nThis is not \na\n standard form of representation used in the decision theory\n as argued in 197\n9 \npaper (see\n Foot-note 6).  \n&#xa0;\nNow, author wishes to calculate the probabilities of total number of hazardous events in 2009 at the level crossings and estimate how many were caused by the level crossing user and how many were caused by the action or inacti\non of the GB railway industry. \n&#xa0;\nDrawing from the data used in the above publication and the formulas shown in the Figure 1, the following information items become available.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAuthor \nuses the decision rule\n \nthe success and failure \nof hazardous\n events adds up to 1\n. \nFurther, the total space of probabilities is partitioned \ninto two \nzones:\n hazardous and non-hazardous occasions.\n The count of hazardous events managed by the road user u\nnsuccessfully is\n 14\n. These outcomes resulted\n in 13 deaths. \n&#xa0;\nHazardous events managed by the road user successfully are counted as 145. The total number of hazardous events is equal to 14+145= 159.  This includes false negatives, and true negatives outcome\ns.  T\nhe ratio of 911\n95\n: .08\n805\n is an indicator of user \naction’s reliability\n \nto unreliability ratio \nin dealing with the hazardous event(s). Applying the same ratio to the \nnon –hazardous events, the count of non-hazardous outcomes calculated are 36,842 event\ns.  In other words, the total count of non- hazardous events successfully managed is 36,842 -3,244 = 33,598(true positive outcomes). \n&#xa0;\n \nThe total of events occurred in 2009 are = 36842+159= 37,000 events. \nThus, from Bayesian perspective, the road user unr\neliability is calculated as = True negatives/ True negatives + false positives = 14/14+3244 = 4.29%. \nFigure \n1\n: Diagram showing conditional probabilities between two random variables X and Y\n&#xa0;\nThe ratio \nof safe to unsafe partitioning of total (interaction\ns\n) at the rail and road \ninterfaces in 2009 from a statistical perspective \nis\n approximately 96% safe and 4% unsafe. \n&#xa0;\nThe level crossing user reliability in managing unsafe situations is approximately 91% for the year 2009. This risk analysis figure indicates that the GB Rail Industry’s statement in 2009 \nor 2013 \nthat level crossing user is responsible \nor cause \nfor 92% of \nlevel crossings \naccident is an erroneous statement. \n&#xa0;\nThe above results indicate that the GB Railway \nfocal point of \nattention on risk analysis and human factors using fault and event tree analysis ( Bow Tie Model) as a quantitative risk estimation tool and using specialists for the analysis of human error occurring in the front line activity is not fetching any improvem\nents in the level of \nrisk. \nThe above calculation shows that the assertion of GB Railway executive and staff that level crossing users are causing 90% of the accidents is an illusion entertained by GB Railway executives and staff from a cultural and social \nperspective.  \nThe method of using event tree analysis suffers from human error problem can be seen from the \nexamination of \nFigures I and II of the 1979 paper on Prospect Theory\n. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor is of\n the firm opinion that the sequential formulation of hazard eve\nnt scenarios leads to errors in subjective assessment as the Bow Tie model does not represent the standard form of decision analysis. \n&#xa0;\nAll of the \nsafety \nengineering work \ncurrently popular with engineering work force evolved from \nsince the start of Boeing \nmissile safety programs uses this form of Bow Tie Modelling and analysis \n(Clifton, 2005)\n. Several authors like James Reason, Nancy \nLeveson\n and Sir Charles Haddon Cave  apart from author have critiqued this method\n (Reason, 1990)\n,\n (Haddon-Cave, 2009)\n,\n (Leves\non, 2011).  Sequential procesing of information may  lead to errors is not a new idea. Arthur Schopenhaur was the first \nperson \nto moot this idea\n when he remarked that both\n David Hume and Imma\nn\nuel Kant made same type of errors in thei\nr reasoning of cause-ef\nfect rela\ntions. Dav\nid Hume reasoned that consequnce is a mere sequence\n \nwhereas Kant affirms that all sequence must necessarily be  consequnce\n(Schopenhauer, 1818)\n. \nOppostion advanced by John Stuart Mill in 1861 against \nthe contemperaory practice of then British Civl Service in the form adminstering the rules and regulations is seen by some as the early poineering activity of management (David Clutterbuck, 1990). \nThe \n19\nth\n century prescriptive approach  to rules and regulations \npersist\ns\n in the ORR’s regulating practice\n of managing design of level crossings can be inferrred from reading their Guidance on Level Crossings (The Office of Rail Regulator , 2011), (The Office \nof Rail Regulator, 2008)\n. \n&#xa0;\nAs far as the rational agent model of economic theory\n is concerned\n, it is important to note that contracts between the clients like railway undertakings and infrastructure managers \nand their suppliers \nrely upon the risk managers\n and Bow Tie models to inform their decisions on \nhazards\n. These decisions on whether to \nclose out the hazards on their hazard log or do nothing about them as the cost of eliminating the hazards is beyond the specific firm or the railway operator\n and theref\nore, the real issue of danger at level crossings remain unaddressed\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe nature of remedial measures to eliminate the existing\n man-made\n hazards \nfaced world-wide\n \nis that the implementation is carried out by the duty –holders but the cost has to be borne \nby respective nations.  \nDeaths at level crossings may be less in absolute terms when compared to deaths due to other diseases as pointed out by Daniel \nKahneman\n in chapter 13 of his book\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\nGovernment intervention is needed \nas Nobel Laureat\ne Ronald H. \nCoase\n realised that life is more complex than theory. The approach to solving deaths at level crossing problem cannot be based upon market based mechanisms \nas the\n transactions costs are not borne by market participants but by outsiders\n of the m\narket mechanism(Exchange, 2013)\n. Settling by means of praivate out –of –court settlement with level crossings victims does not solve the problem of transactions costs borne by the external parties. This can be seen from the out-of-court settlement made by \nNetwork Rail\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRisk assessment is an implicit requirement of the UK Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HSW, 1974) and is also explicitly required by other general and \nindustry-specific regulations\n. The UK HSE has published research looking at the pitfalls of risk assessment in the period prior to \nmandating of \nthe Common Safety Method\n.\n \nGood practice in managing risk at public rail-road interfaces level crossings is to b\nuild bridges. At the private level crossings, where\nver\n feasible\n,\n bridges can be built and where they cannot be \nclosed,\n modern radio communications can be utilised to inform the level crossing user of the train arrival. \n&#xa0;\nThe implementation of standard appr\noach to signalling like ERTMS/ECTS technology does not solve the problem of deaths at \npublic rail –road interface managed by \nlevel crossings. By wrongly associating the problem of death at level crossings with the theory of market capitalism, Economists ar\ne distracting attention from the remedial measures that need to be taken. However, availability of barriers may be recorded in the hazard log at the time of safety justification of the start or close out of the railway projects\n, granted by RSSB and\n inspect\ned by the regulator\n. This phenomenon of risk assessment in the ERTMS project did\n figure in the RAIB\n Report on Cambrian ERTMS ABCL Incident\n (\n RAIB, 2012)\n. \n&#xa0;\nNow, let us consider the data from the UK Law Commission Paper\n \navailable for computing \ne\nconomics of deaths at level crossings (a rail-road interface). \n&#xa0;\nCost to the \nGB \neconomy due to loss of \n11 FWIs (\npara\n 28) statistical lives on an annual basis at the value of £1.5 million per statistical life, A= £16.5 million. \n&#xa0;\nCost to the GB economy (\npara\n 18, 19, 20) due to investment on safety measures on eliminating level crossing, \nD\n is calculated as under\n in the Table 1 on the next page.\n The assumption\ns are that the \nissues of typography and heritage do not arise.\n Author has n\not computed any benefits to the wider economy. \n&#xa0;\nThe facts of railways accidents from 1851till date studied by author suggest that these accident scenarios are not available to signalling engineers and managers memory when demanded.  The social DNA of a ra\nilway engineer(s) and manager(s) cannot associate hazards and barriers as outlined in the author’s publications suggest that the idea that much vaunted learning skills are absent from the railway sector. \nA PhD in computer science and a signalling system en\ngineering domain expert with over 20 years’ experience in 2001 was surprised when author had suggested random number  generating algorithms were not random  at all. Probably, he did not read publication by \nI.Mitrani\n where \nMitrani\n accepted the argument\n (I.M\nitrani, 1982)\n.\n&#xa0;\nAuthor wishes to place on record that Mr Anson Jack and Mr David \nBulgin\n of RSSB did comprehend the system advanced by the author when he deployed the system at RSSB. Apart from them author did not find any other person competent to grasp th\ne subtleties of risk assessment using cognitive systems engineering during his employment period with RSSB.\n \n&#xa0;\nTable \n1\n: Costs of Safety \nImprovements:\n Rough estimate of the Budget needed \nNumber of Level Crossings \nA\nType \nB \nCost of \nreplacement or closure in thousands C\n estimates\nTotal cost in thousands D= A*C\n1747 \nPublic Vehicular crossings\n£1,500\n£ \n2,620,500\n&#xa0;\n2074\n&#xa0;\nPublic foot-paths \n£ 750\n£ \n1,555,500\n&#xa0;\n130 \nPublic bridle ways\n£750\n£ \n97,500\n&#xa0;\n2,383\nPrivate Vehicular roads \n£1,500\n£ \n3,574,500\n&#xa0;\n248 \nPrivate foot paths \n£750\n£ \n186,000\n&#xa0;\n11 \nPrivate Bridleways \n£750\n£ \n8,250\n&#xa0;\n1,500 \nHeritage railways \n£50  ( closures)\n£ \n75,000\n&#xa0;\nTotal \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n£ \n8,117,250\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAssuming the disproportion factor in the calculations for loss of statistical life to be 10, then annual loss of statistical life per year = 11*1.5*10= £ 165, 000, 000. \nAuthor assumes that\n a \n higher \ndis\n-proportionate\n figure was \nused for recommending the in\nstallation of the TPWS System in 2003.  \n&#xa0;\nThe ratio of cost of safety measures to the cost of loss lives works out to approximately 50. In other words, \nit takes 50 years to recover the cost of investment into safety improvements at the rail road interface.\n \nAuthor has not considered routes for financing such as debt financing as this theme is beyond author’s skill base. \n&#xa0;\nWork done by James Reason in 1990 has shown that Group-think bias is a major problem that poses threat to the safety of members of public \nand staff and confirmed by author again in 2010\n (Appicharla, 2010)\n. \n \nGiven the fact that \npsychology of railway signalling engineers and managers is\n biased towards measurements \nof lengths in terms of braking distance (service and emergency) \nand \npsychology o\nf human factors and risk managers using \nmeans and variance frameworks applied to risk data \nand human factors data biases them to accept the Cartesian idea that there is no empty space without objects filling it. Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein how our psych\nological concepts of space and time arise in practice (pp.136-137). Author note\ns\n Albert Einstein’s idea that our auditory experience of hearing \na \ncar passing\n by on adjacent \nroad may\n precede our experien\nce of it \nappearing visually\n from where we are seated\n.\n In other words, time \nsequence of events cannot be ordered in accordance with \ntime sequence of experiences (pp140)\n (Einstein, 1920)\n. This has implications for modelling hazardous event sequences in the activity of eliciting or describing potential or actua\nl accident scenarios. \n&#xa0;\nApart from the accident and other case studies p\nublished since 2006, author \nexperienced managerial incompetence in risk assessment in \nIndian organisational \nsettings as well. Author recalls his experience \nduring his previous employm\nent with CEGELEC India between 1994 till 1998, a \nbusiness unit of French Alcatel\n. A\nuthor \nfound that the executive and managerial staff employed with CEGELEC India did not possess\n sufficient competence on \nhow to perform risk assessment as required by the \nAl\ncatel C\norporate Guidelines. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn the processes deployed within the business acquisition procedure required \nthe bid manager to prepare the estimate of chances to win the bid in a risk assessment\n form\n prior to the bid submission. However, author, as a bid m\nanager, found that the Chief Executive of CEGELEC India made errors in filing the risk assessment form for a  bid  £ 5.8 million at 1997 prices. \nThe bid was won but the project did not materialise. \nSimilarly, another \nrisk assessment form with for a \nbid wit\nh a value of £58 million was also similarly filled with errors to boost the chances of CEO’s tenure\n in the event of winning the bid\n.  The rupee to pound exchange ratio was 70 \nat the time bidding \nin 1998. \nAuthor had brought these facts to the attention of M\nr Allan Davies, the Technical Director at \nAlstom\n in 1999 vide a private communication\n (Appicharla, April 1999)\n.  \nAuthor learnt subsequently that the bid was lost to a competitor with whom the author had formulated a bid strategy. \nThe \nCEGELEC India \nbusiness\n unit and \nits parent company were subsequently absorbed into \nAlstom\n India Transmission and Distribution. Author has learnt a lesson from this episode that organis\national structures and procedures\n do not provide safe guard against \nsystematic \nhuman errors. \n&#xa0;\nN\nobel Laureate, Daniel \nKahneman\n expressed confidence \nthat organisations \nare better when it comes to avoiding errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to impose orderly procedures. Daniel \nKahneman\n hoped organisations can introduc\ne \nsolutions like \nchecklists, reference class forecasting and the \npremortem\n.  Moreover, people can watch another as they approach mine fields (\npp\n417-418)\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. \nAuthor argues that the hypothesis\n of free market ca\npitalism can be argued for counter\n-acting \nagainst human errors\n. This is a fallacy commonly entertained is shown by the \nerrors in safety research in author’s Written Evidence o\nn 11the November 2013\n. Author’s technical review of the Common Safety Method of Regulation found that it is full of\n latent human errors\n (Appicharla, 2013)\n. \n \nThus, author cannot assent to the confidence expressed by\n \nDaniel \nKahneman\n \nthat organisations are less prone to commit errors. B\neca\nuse \nauthors has shown that \njudgements on risk decisions can be distorted by\n payoffs and penalties\n, or facing saving gestures within\n \nindustry or an organisation.\n \n&#xa0;\nAuthor cannot foresee how manslaughter \nlegislation as suggested by the UK Law Commission \ncan be applied to the cases where classes of regulatory, managerial, engineerin\ng and operational hum\nan errors abound\n distorting\n the true picture of \ndecisions\n on safety risk\n.\n S\nilo thinking abounds in 21\nst\n century is admitted by Nobel Laureate \nG.Baker\n (Baker, 1964)\n. \n \nThus, Behavioural ap\nproach, \nFree Market Approach \nor Transactional App\nroach to Economics\n \nof Risk \nare unable to guide our thinking in resolving the problem \nof death at level crossings as all of them require \ncompetence on the part of duty-holders to assess risk of the assets they hold\n in their portfolio \nfor delivering the publ\nic service. . \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAuthor observes that d\nuty-holders and other railway bodies do not have any long term policy for \nlevel crossing emerges\n from the Written and Oral evidence \npresented \nto \nmembers of \nthe Transport Select Committee. \nA long term poli\ncy is necessary for eliminating risk posed to members of public  by the level crossings. \n&#xa0;\nAs the ongo\ning huge investment of nearly \nthree billion \npounds \ninto new signalling technologies\n may not yield benefits \ndesired \nif the foregoing discussions\n are taken \ninto account. Therefore, author suggests the idea to the Members of Transport Select Committee that a learning unit dedicated to the identification and assessment of railway hazards and their elimination is vitally necessary as the review of existing level\n crossing acc\nidents shows \nrisk judgements are prone to error\n. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor believes that \ndangerous assets like level crossings may be categorised erroneously as being safe\n when \nthey‘re\n not safe\n and \ntherefore, \na cultural\n attitudinal change \ntowards safety \nstandards, risk assessment and accident investigation of level crossing accidents is needed\n. \nThis shift in attitudes cannot be brought about individuals but a body that \nfocusses\n attention on hazards and preventive measures in\n the GB Railway Domain. RSSB, \nO\nRR \nand duty-holders together with their support structures and functioning \ndo not satisfy this role is evident from the foregoing conclusions. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRAIB, 2012. \nInvestigation into an incident at Llanbadarn level crossing, 11/2012 June 2012. \n[Onli\nne] \nAvailable at: \nhttp://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/RAIB_Llanbadarn2011.pdf\n[Accessed 18 Aug 2012].\n&#xa0;\nAdams, S., 1996. \nThe Dilbert Principle. \nSecond ed.
