defaultWritten submission from the Cabinet Office (LPG 15)default&#xa0;defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultThis note sets out how centralised 
defaultcollaborative 
defaultprocurement operations delivered by the Government Procurement Service
default (GPS) as part of the Cabinet Office
default 
defaultsupports the delivery of value for money and savings to Local Government organisations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt also sets and how the current implementation of Commercial Reforms in Central Government through the creation of the Crown Commercial Service, presents a significant opportunity for Local Government Procurement to access best in class procurement services, aggregated and benchmarked deals for commodities and training programmes such as the Commissioning Academy.
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal Government organisations’ take up of GPS services continues to grow as more compelling examples of success, such as those set below, become more widely known. However, there is a significant opportunity for more Local Government organisations to use and benefit from centralised procurement services without compromising the Localism Agenda and the critical need to support economic growth of businesses, in particular SMEs, in local areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, the use of centralised deals for commodities such as energy which are established through central government buying power and where contracts and key suppliers are actively managed, directly frees up budgets and capacity of Local Government procurement staff to focus on specialist and key strategic procurement projects that support local front line service delivery and make a difference to the organisation and the local people they serve.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe evidence provided below primarily supports a response to questions 2, 3 &amp; 4 (Annex 1).
default&#xa0;
defaultStrategic development of central government commercial operationsdefault which will benefit Local Government Procurementdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe forthcoming creation of an integrated commercial service for Government in the form of the Crown Commercial Service (CCS)
default, building upon the existing GPS,
default will bring together Government’s central commercial capability into a single organisation to ensure maximum value is extracted from every commercial relationship and drive up the quality of service. It will fundamentally change the way we procure to improve efficiency, savings and service delivery.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs part of this new model, CCS will be managing the procurement of common goods and services on behalf of departments, working on the principle of buying once and buying better to maximise efficiency and savings delivery. However, as part of this new approach particular focus will be given to opening up markets and opportunities for SMEs as part of the frequent renewal of appropriate procurement frameworks – with G-Cloud for ICT services being a good example. There will also be a significant focus on effective contract management and increasing commercial skills.
default This is a key part of the 
defaultcommercial
default and civil service reform programmes and the 
defaultbenefits
default and experience of this will be shared across the public sector.
defaultGPS delivery of savings to Local Government organisationsdefault and provision of procurement servicesdefault&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012/13
default GPS managed £11.44 billion 
defaultof public spending
default, delivering £1.1 billion in savings. More than £6 billion of this spend came from wider public sector organisations including £1.25 billion from local authorities, saving them 
defaultclose to £100 
defaultmillion
default.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultStrategic alliances with Local Government Buying Organisationsdefault&#xa0;
defaultGPS is actively working with a number of local government buying organisations as part of strategic alliances to drive additional savings on common goods and services through increased aggregation and improved efficiency.  This has resulted in a number of collaborative procurements, including a joint framework for Multi-functional devices with ESPO and YPO which is delivering average savings of 46% on hardware and 49% on service costs by standardising specifications.
default&#xa0;
defaultSimilarly, GPS launched the first ever national pan-government framework for insurance in 2012/13, developed in part
defaultnership with Local Government buying organisations 
defaultYPO, ESPO and NEPO, demonstrating joint
default commitment to 
defaultdriving savings.
default  
defaultThese strategic alliances and joint activities will help to change buying behaviours for common goods and se
defaultrvices across the entire Local Authority landscape.
default&#xa0;defaultSpend analysis and opportunity assessmentsdefault&#xa0;
defaultGPS has undertaken individual 
default(and cost free) 
defaultspend analysis exercises across eight local authorities, including four London Boroughs, covering a total of £2.8 billion
default of total Authority expenditure
default.  The resultant savings opportunity assessments concluded savings of between 2% and 4% of total Authority spending by greater utilisation of existing centralised arrangements.
default&#xa0;
defaultInterrogation of this data also showed that for five of the authorities the top ten suppliers (by authority) represented over £790 million of spend and for the remaining three authorities the top twenty suppliers represented a further £487 million.  This limited supply base lends itself well to national aggregation to drive savings as well as more effective supplier management.
default&#xa0;defaultAs an 
defaultexample, a spend analysis exercise undertaken by GPS on behalf of 
defaulta number of 
defaultLondon
default Boroughs
default in 2012/13 revealed 
defaultvarying prices 
defaultfor similar software services from the same supplier 
defaultincluding a fivefold variation 
defaultbetween two London 
defaultauthorities
default.  
defaultIn direct response the London ICT Programme has worked with four key software suppliers to provide Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) to provide fair and consistent pricing on day-rates and access to APIs (enabling links between software systems).  The MOU with Northgate, one of the four suppliers, is delivering savings of up to 25% on day rates for London authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultPan-London ICT Procurement Programmedefault&#xa0;
defaultA key initiative in local government which is already delivering encouraging results is the London ICT programme, a collaboration facilitated by GPS and led by the London Borough of Camden on behalf of all 33 London councils, working closely with Chief Information Officers.  London authorities spend £9 billion annually on ICT and GPS assigned 
defaultdedicated resource to drive and facilitate greater collaboration on ICT, providing senior expertise to look at how savings could be achieved by working together to drive better value for money, improved supplier relationship management and technology transformation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default London ICT Programme
default,
default working with GPS and local authority buying organisations across the country are 
defaultnow 
defaultdeveloping a new strategic procurement for Local Authority Software Applications which aims to bring greater transparency, value and innovation in this market. 
defaultIn addition, the success of GPS’s relationship with London authorities has led to two further significant initiatives:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaulteAuctionsdefault&#xa0;defaultIncreasing use of aggregated eAuctions to drive better value is 
defaultdelivering significant savings.
default A
defaultn innovative 
defaultforward eAuction managed by GPS on behalf of a group of local authorities in 
default20
default12/13 
defaultfor the 
defaultrecycling of newspapers and magazines into newsprint, generated £1.8m revenue, improving the pre-auction value by 17%.
default 
defaultOther successful aggregated eAuctions for local authorities include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultCommissioning Academydefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Commissioning Academy brings together senior commissioners from across the public sector to learn from the example of the most successful commissioning organisations – developing a growing cadre of professionals skilled in best practice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing two pilot programmes, the Commissionin
defaultg Academy was formally launched 
defaultin January 2013 and 
defaultdemand for places has been high. O
defaultf the 114 participants across 
defaultthe 
defaultpilots and first wave, 
defaultover 58% (
default67
default)
default were from Local Authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 8 day programme includes a ‘provider perspective’, where conversations with different types of providers, including SMEs, help the participants gain a greater understanding of opportunities that are being missed to ensure we get the best outcomes possible for tax payers, communities and society as a whole.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;defaultIssues facing Local Government Procurement teams which can be addressed through greater joint working with GPSdefault&#xa0;defaultThe importance of procurement in local government has increased significantly in recent years 
defaultand a consequent expansion of the role of procurement from what was previously a ‘buying’ role.    This has led to some capability gaps in authorities particularly with regard
defaults
default to more strategic commercial skills whe
defaultre there is competition across i
defaultndustry for similar skill sets. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the sector level, the absence of skills, systems and resources to implement a national procurement strategy and in particular a coherent pan-sector approach to category management is particularly evident
default.  
defaultGPS and the Local Government Association (LGA) are actively working to address these shortcomings and a strategic partnership is under active discussion.   
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the biggest challenges is changing behaviours and coordinating activity across a large group of autonomous bodies.  There is significant duplication of effort and initiatives such as the local government procurement strategy face
default 
defaultchallenges in establishing any means of implementing practical 
defaultand effective work streams.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe absence of coherent approaches to spend visibility, contract management and supplier management across local government makes effective category management
default very difficult
default.   The LGA led national procurement strategy which GPS fed in to, demonstrates commitment to improving efficiency and achieving better value and acknowledgement that problems have been identified, however there remains a significant gap between identification and action.
default&#xa0;
defaultSpend analytical capability
default is an ongoing issue in local government. This is reflected in a systemic inability to see where similar goods and services are bought at widely differing costs. There is little benchmarking and a reluctance to expose internal procurement practice to external scrutiny.  DCLG is currently discussing with GPS how to facilitate the rollout of spend analysis across local government, to provide the basis for more challenging innovations such as effective benchmarking and the identification of 
defaultforward procurement pipelines.
