[normal]Submission from the Confederation of British Industry[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal]re is a
[normal] mixed picture of procurement performance across 
[normal]local authorities
[normal] 
[normal]Local authorities need to shift from primary pro
[normal]vider to commissioner of service
[normal]s and develop the necessary toolkit of skills and processes to act as an effective market steward
[normal]An improved skills
[normal] s
[normal]et for local authority commercial teams will allow 
[normal]councils
[normal] to be better market managers
[normal]Better 
[normal]strategic 
[normal]leadership of major change programmes improves the likelihood of achieving the desire outcomes from a procurement process
[normal]A stronger u
[normal]nderstanding 
[normal]of how the provider market operates, which
[normal] ensures councils develop the most effective partnerships and manage risk effectively
[normal]Improved transparency is
[normal] 
[normal]an 
[normal]essential to
[normal]ol in
[normal] building trust in markets and making them sustainable
[normal]Developing the capacity of SMEs to participate in public sector procurements is essential, but will take time â€“ councils can support it without undermining the existing market
