[normal]Written evidence from the Foundation Trust Network[bold] (AMO 0007)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]SUMMARY [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Foundation Trust Network (FTN) is the membership organisation and trade association for the NHS acute hospitals and community, mental health and ambulance services that treat patients and service users in the NHS. The FTN helps those NHS trusts deliver high quality, patient focussed care by enabling them to learn from each other, acting as their public voice and helping shape the system in which they operate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The FTN has over 225 members – more than 90% of all NHS foundation trusts and aspirant trusts – who collectively account for £65 billion of annual expenditure and employ more than 630,000 staff.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]FTN is pleased to contribute to the Committee’s annual review of Monitor. Our submission primarily focuses on Monitor’s operation over the last six months as sector regulator for health. It highlights challenges facing Monitor as it adapts to its new, broader role; the Francis Inquiry recommendations and findings; and significant financial pressures on the NHS. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The past year has seen significant change and challenge for both Monitor and the NHS. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 created an expanded role for Monitor, including new responsibilities for setting prices for NHS-funded care, policing rules on cooperation and competition, and enabling better integrated care. Monitor has also established a licensing regime, applying to all FTs from April 2013 and due to be extended to other providers of NHS-funded care in 2014. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitor has made changes to adapt to elements of its extended role, including introducing regional structures that mirror CQC and NHS England structures. It has adopted a collaborative approach to developing the new regime, engaging closely with FTN and our members from an early stage and acting on our comments and feedback. This has been particularly valuable in developing the new licensing system. However, more needs to be done, particularly in relation to pricing, competition and enabling integrated care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitor has developed a reputation as a respected, robust, risk-based and focused regulator. However, the Francis Inquiry raised questions about the efficacy of its 
[normal]regulatory oversight and, more generally, about the quality of NHS care, leading to increased expectations of regulation and all regulators. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This low-trust environment post-Francis has created external pressures on Monitor to become more interventionist in its regulation of foundation trusts and more risk-averse. The desire to “prevent another Mid-Staffs” risks creating an over-bearing and expensive system of regulation in response to one or two worst-case examples. It also threatens to replace risk-based regulation with performance management, a shift clearly evident in Monitor’s growing scrutiny of A&amp;E performance against targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is vital that Monitor retains its focus on proportionate, risk-based regulation. Monitor has neither the capacity nor capability to performance manage struggling foundation trusts, and such an approach would be of questionable value. Over-reliance on active regulation would fundamentally undermine the autonomy of FTs and their unique local accountability to communities through their board, governors and members – the cornerstone of their status. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As noted in our evidence to the Committee’s review of NHS finances, the continued squeeze on NHS funding means that many FTs face significant challenges to their financial health and sustainability. These are exacerbated by the inexorable rise in demand for services, particularly emergency care, which current tariff arrangements notoriously under-fund at 30%. Often these difficulties are rooted in the wider local health economy rather than the quality of the organisation’s leadership or governance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increasing numbers of trusts will face these issues in the coming years, and the pressure will be to reconfigure services or to merge. However, our members increasingly find their proposals for change under the purview of both the reconfiguration and competition regimes. These have conflicting and competing aims – one focusing on public consultation and engagement, and the other on ensuring a competitive market. A further complication is the variability with which local commissioners approach and interpret the Section 75 regulations on procurement, patient choice and competition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Operating within this framework, NHS providers are increasingly in a position where they are unable to achieve what they need to at the required speed. We urge Monitor to clarify its role and approach under these different regimes, including to publish its Section 75 guidance for commissioners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome Monitor’s joint statement with the competition authorities
[normal] that it will play a greater role in advising trusts on competition considerations of proposed mergers at an earlier stage, and that the competition authorities will set greater store by its 
[normal]advice.  However, Monitor must better define the ‘wider patient interest’ in such transactions and ensure a lessening of competition does not override sensible proposals to safeguard future services for patients by ensuring their financial and clinical sustainability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The scale of these financial challenges and the seemingly intractable problems facing NHS providers raise important questions for Monitor as sector regulator. It must balance its ‘sector wide’ duties with requirements to secure change and improvements in FTs’ financial viability and service quality. Monitor is ill-equipped to solve system-wide problems, and must avoid trying to manage aspects of the healthcare system that are more realistically the responsibility of other bodies, such as weaknesses in commissioning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Clarifying Monitor’s relationships with other regulatory and oversight bodies for the NHS, particularly their respective roles and responsibilities, is vital. We welcome steps Monitor, Care Quality Commission (CQC) and NHS Trust Development Authority (TDA) are taking to clarify operation of the failure regime, particularly special measures, but our members continue to report confusion about these new approaches and the regulators’ respective roles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is significant potential overlap between Monitor and CQC on the governance and leadership of organisations, particularly with development of CQC’s ‘well-led?’ domain, and with NHS England. Similarly, Monitor must work closely with the TDA to avoid overly burdensome and duplicative processes and requirements on aspirant trusts as they make their case for FT status.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The absence of a consistent and coherent approach to common concerns by the different bodies risks duplication and confusion, and inconsistent assessments of compliance or trusts being penalised twice for the same issue. Both CQC and Monitor use definitions of “fit and proper person” as part of their registration/ licensing requirements but it is unclear whether the two approaches align. Similarly differences of approach between Monitor and NHS England on the procurement, patient choice and competition regulations appear to have delayed much-needed guidance and establishment of the joint website.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the progress made, Monitor still needs to develop its capacity and capability to establish itself as a credible specialist sector regulator for healthcare, particularly to bring an understanding of healthcare issues to deliberations on competition and pricing. We remain committed to working with Monitor to meet this challenge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitor needs to clarify how it will discharge all its responsibilities, including managing potential conflicts between its functions. For example, we question whether 
[normal]Monitor’s development and thought leadership functions fit appropriately with its core role as an effective and efficient sector regulator. Additionally, our members continue to seek clarity from Monitor on reconciling obligations on enabling integrated care with promoting choice and preventing anti-competitive behaviour. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is essential that Monitor’s approach is appropriate for all types of trusts, not just acute providers. Feedback from our members indicates that Monitor needs to strengthen its understanding and approach to community and mental health service providers as well as tailoring its approach to the particular issues and needs of integrated service providers, which provide social care as well as NHS services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Most importantly, Monitor must develop its responsibilities in relation to competition and the competition authorities. Although several mergers have been approved, our members are concerned that decisions take insufficient account of the benefits for patients of proposed changes, and are too focused on the potential loss of competition. This potentially leaves them little scope for the radical service change needed to achieve the longer-term clinical and financial sustainability for the NHS. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We suggest that an effective sector regulator will act as a bridge between the NHS and the competition authorities, particularly in determining proposals for reconfiguration. Monitor should provide sector-specific input on competition cases and to the competition authorities, and strengthen the NHS’s understanding of competition law. This could include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome recent clarification of Monitor’s role in this area, including its joint statement with the competition authorities. We hope this will herald a more tailored approach to assessing proposals for service change with guidance and early input from Monitor, and specialist health-sector input to the process. We wait with keen interest to see how this will operate in practice.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitor shares responsibility for setting prices for NHS-funded care with NHS England. However, the original division between NHS England’s responsibility for 
[normal]developing currencies (or units of activity), and Monitor’s responsibility for price-setting has now been conflated by the two organisations inputting into both functions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a result, the setting of prices may now be informed by different, and sometimes conflicting, agendas. Prices for NHS services should incorporate a best estimate of the costs of providing the desired care, a realistic amount for provider efficiencies and a reasonable margin to incentivise service improvement. However, through the deflation of tariff prices year-on-year and operation of national business rules (such as the marginal rate for emergency admissions), prices are clearly being set to meet overall efficiency requirements for the wider NHS, rather than reflect providers’ service delivery and improvement costs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Continued deflation of national tariffs is likely to contribute to provider difficulties, ultimately destabilising providers and undermining the sustainability of individual clinical services. This creates a tension for Monitor’s role to ensure essential services continue if providers get into difficulty. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The new licensing regime is a key element of Monitor’s regulatory regime for providers of NHS care. However, not all providers of NHS-funded care are required to hold a Monitor licence and some aspects of the licence only apply to FTs. We believe this raises fair playing field issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Monitor licence sets out conditions that providers of NHS-funded services must meet, including conditions to ensure continued provision of key NHS services in the event provider difficulties. These aim to ensure that providers are financially viable, and well-led and run.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our members reflect a generally smooth transition to the new licence regime. However, aspects of the regime need further work including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Initially all existing mandatory services provided by FTs under the terms of their authorisation are “grandfathered” into CRS designation. Monitor has set time limits on the automatic classification of CRS, with this expiring on 1 April 2016 for all trusts achieving FT status by 1 April 2015. For trusts authorised after this date, the automatic classification of CRS will apply for one year after the date that the trust obtains its 
[normal]provider licence. This effectively gives commissioners three years to review the designation of CRS services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CRS designation focuses on the continued provision of services, not the continued operation of the provider. However, designation can significantly constrain what providers can do to alter provision without the explicit permission of its commissioners. This is potentially especially problematic for providers in the current financial environment, particularly given the broad scope of many FTs’ mandatory services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A recent FTN member survey reflects little progress so far on the review of services grandfathered into CRS designation. Members highlight the main challenges associated with reviewing these services as:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For many providers, their services automatically designated as CRS will involve multiple commissioners, including local authorities and sometimes commissioners outside of England. Any review process is likely to involve complex negotiations, and take significant resources at a time when patterns of NHS provision need to change radically. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We would urge Monitor to monitor closely the operation of the CRS regime and its impact on providers, and to act promptly if this acts a barrier to much-needed service change. This may require close cooperation with NHS England, as a commissioner of services and its oversight of clinical commissioning groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitor’s new Risk Assessment Framework (RAF) replaces its previous Compliance Framework, and encompasses new approaches to identifying risk. It aims to help Monitor assess the risk of a licence breach at an early stage, assessing the financial viability of providers of CRS and the quality of governance at an FT. Monitor assigns separate risk ratings for financial viability and for governance, and uses these to decide what action, if any, is needed, including potentially launching a formal investigation or taking regulatory action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]FTN members are concerned that the new RAF will result in more trusts being rated in breach on financial measures (2 or 2*) than would have happened previously under the Compliance Framework. Some trusts suggest that under the RAF they could receive a risk rating of 2 (possible regulatory action), whereas their data would have previously led to a risk rating of 4 (no problems) under the old system. There are further concerns 
[normal]that the requirement to maintain a capital servicing ratio of 1.75 or more is over-cautious.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These changes give Monitor greater scope to intervene or take regulatory action. Monitor is unlikely to have sufficient capacity to deal successfully with the many trusts likely to be assessed as at risk of possible regulatory intervention under the RAF. With FTs working on increasingly tight margins, this could result in poorly targeted regulatory intervention.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are further concerns that many of the measures in the RAF to assess governance are based on proxies, often relating to attainment of nationally set targets. The apparent assumption is good boards will ensure their organisation consistently meets the target. However, most national targets are not indicators of good governance, and failure to achieve a target is often unrelated to the quality of an organisation’s leadership or governance. Unless this changes, Monitor may find itself taking regulatory action against otherwise well-run organisations rather than focusing regulatory intervention on trusts that would benefit.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further work is needed to develop better proxies for good governance and improve governance assessments. FTN and our members are keen to work with Monitor to achieve this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our members have concerns about proposed changes to the annual planning arrangements, including imminent changes to the timetable for submissions for 2014. Changes to the risk rating of forward plans also reflect a more interventionist approach by Monitor to monitoring providers’ financial risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given anticipated real-term budget reductions of 5% pa, FTs are increasingly likely to struggle to provide projections showing a healthy capital servicing and/ or liquidity ratios over a three year period. However, if Monitor’s review of the three-year forward plan produces a projected continuity of service rating of rating of 1 or 2 at any stage, Monitor may consider regulatory action. Forward plans considered unrealistic will raise governance concerns. If transactions, service reconfigurations and/ or redesign do not become easier, many trusts will struggle to reach the required standards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Fundamental to good governance is the principle that boards take responsibility for their actions and are accountable for them. FTN supports the regular review of governance and board effectiveness as good practice, and many members already undertake such reviews.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our members strongly oppose Monitor’s proposals specifying that boards should undertake three-yearly, independent governance reviews using a Monitor approved 
[normal]contractor. We believe it is inappropriate for Monitor to specify the details of such reviews or to designate “approved” contractors to undertake them. More appropriately, Monitor could require that such exercises are undertaken, and then assure that they have been done.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If the concern is that FTs need closer supervision in the first few years post-authorisation to avoid governance problems, Monitor could require all FTs to undertake a one-off review in the first two years after they have been authorised. However, once an FT is deemed fully independent, they should be left to manage their own affairs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While finding the process stretching, members are generally positive about Monitor’s assessments for FT status. Many feel the process helped to strengthen their governance and enhance their reporting and monitoring processes. However, some non-acute providers question the relevance of some information requested and aspects of the process to their type of organisation. There is also a need to avoid duplication with the TDA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Delays to the authorisation of further FTs are particularly concerning. We welcome Monitor’s work with CQC to prioritise its inspections of trusts currently applying for FT status and to introduce pilot inspections for aspirant community, mental health and ambulance providers in advance of the developed inspection programme. We remain concerned that changes to the CQC regulatory regime may delay further approvals.
