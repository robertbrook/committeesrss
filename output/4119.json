"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence \nfrom\n Michael Flint\n (CYS0076)\nI do not officially represent anyone other than myself but I would like to think I represent everyone who wants to live in a wholly better country.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. I do not live in England. I currently live in Amsterdam, Netherlands. I was, however, born in the UK and I am considering retu\nrning to the UK. Aside from \not\nher \nreasons not to return to the UK, after\n living in Amsterdam, cycling has emerged as one of the more prominent\n. \n2. It would be naïve of me to claim that cycling is perfect in Amsterdam. On average 6 people die cycling every year. \nConsider that fact \ni\nn tandem (unintentional joke) to\n the fact that 57% of Amsterdammers use a bike daily\n and it doesn’t seem so big\n. \n38% of traffic movement in the city is by bike compared to 37% by car and 25% by public transport. In the city centre, 57% of traffic movement \nis by bike.\n Nobody wears bike helmets because they justifiably don’t feel in any danger. Pregnant women cycle\n, OAPs cycle \nand parents cycle with their children. This is not just a city/country where cycling is made safer by the government through clearly s\neparated/raised cycle paths. It’s not just the fact that cyclists have right of way over cars at many junctions. It’s not just the fact that cyclists have their own traffic lights. Amsterdam and the Netherlands as a whole \nrepresent a culture of cycling\n. Tr\nansport=bike. \n3. A cycle culture is better for everyone. It’s better for the environment. It’s better for the nation’s physical health. It’s better for natio\nnal wellbeing. In my mind it’s i\nndisputably a better way of living. Cycling makes people happy and\n is a key ingredient in positive society.  \n \n&#xa0;\n4. So one of the reasons I don’t want to return to the UK is not just because I’m afraid of cycling in my capital city but because I believe that the UK’s failure to embrace cycling is symptomatic of many of it\ns other unpleasant features. An investigation into cycling should be more than an investigation into how to make cycling safer, it should be an investigation into how British culture can accept and raise cycling as one of its many positive attributes. \n5.\n In the short term, don’t be proud. Go and talk to Denmark, go and talk to the Netherlands, Go and talk to Sweden. These countries know what they’re doing\n to a far far greater extent than we do\n. It will NOT be difficult to get an education in how to improv\ne. Saving lives is the primary concern and these \ncountries will help. The long term is harder to advise on. It will take time to create a culture of cycling such as is the current state in the Netherlands but making cycling safer can’t be a bad place to st\nart. \n&#xa0;\n6. My presumption is this. The people who really control city hall will not allow a real revolution in cycling. While an increase in cycling decreases profit for companies blindly holding onto the power and money that doesn’t nourish them in any wor\nthy way we will not have a revolution. If someone can convince BP to give up on the gas and invest in some second hand bikes there might be a more positive future for us.\n&#xa0;\nDe\ncember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
