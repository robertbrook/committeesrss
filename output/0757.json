"Final\n 2\n: \nJanuary 2013\n \nDelivering better services for people with long term conditions (LTC) – getting on with it!&#xa0;The aim of the current initiative is to bring together all the expertise across the ‘LTC Landscape’ (a coalition of the willing) around a Delivery System as a starting point for comprehensive change; led by the people involved (service users, policy makers, academics, practitioners, Colleges, trainers, service providers etc) and offering those ‘on high’ a chance to help to make it happen more easily. &#xa0;\nBack groundChronic diseases are now the commonest cause of death and disability in England and people who live with \nlong term conditions (LTCs)\n are the biggest uses of services and g\nreatest generator of costs. It is now recognised\n that the care and support needed to live with a LTC is fundamentally different to that for acute episodic conditions, and \nthat this will \nrequire services\n for people with long-\nterm\n \nconditions\n \nto \nbe \nradically\n redesigned\n. However, despite \nexhortation from people who live with LTCs, \nconsistent health policy, a robust evidence base and a compelling economic case, progress \non the ground has been painfully slow with little improvement over the last 10 years.  \n&#xa0;\nM\nany of the \nelements\n \nneeded\n to \nsupport change\n in England have been developed, drawing on international best \npractice\n, but they \nremain\n fragmented. Top down \nexhortation\n and targets have failed to influence change and clinical behaviour at the grassroots. The missing \ncomponent\n,\n which is \na\n \npractical,\n robust\n,\n \nreproducible\n \nand\n \ntransferable\n \ndelivery system\n developed by practitioners\n and service \nusers in\n England \nis now available\n. \n&#xa0;\nKey issues The Delivery S\nystem is described below. \nSome of the k\ney issues \nit addresses \ninclude:\nThe coordinated delivery system for Long terms conditionsThe delivery system provides a \nrobust\n, \nsystematic and reproducible approach, transferable to any setting and for people with any single or multiple LTCs, \nincluding multi morbidity \nwhich ensures that each person receives a uniquely personalised service bringing together support for self management with high quality clinical and social care, delivered in a systematic, coordinated and high quality manner. \nThe \ntwo part delivery \nsystem includes a \nguide to the components and a \nquality assured approach to implementationThe \ncomponents \nCare planning ImplementationThe delivery system invites local services to work through the ‘house’ for the particular health / social care setting relevant\n to their particular population, ensuring that attitudes, skills and infrastructure are all addressed together\n \nby using a \nquality assured approach leading to culture and system change. \nImportantly, the care planning consultation is in the centre of the house; local services need to\n ensure that all of the element\ns of the house are reliably in place for every care planning consultation.\nThis will involve: \nAlf Collins, Simon Eaton, Jim Phillips, Sue Roberts: with t\nhanks to \nall\n those who have contributed\n \n2\n&#xa0;\n Social prescribing is an ‘unfortunate’ \nterm in\n common use for referral to non traditional community services to support self management such as exercise ‘on prescription’. \n"
