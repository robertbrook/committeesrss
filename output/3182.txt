[[[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]]]&#xa0;1  Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) welcomes the Scottish Affairs Committee (SAC) consultation and inquiry on land reform in Scotland as announced in July 2013.  HIE views this as complementary to the ongoing work of the Land Reform Review Group (LRRG) to which HIE submitted a comprehensive response in January 2013.  As requested by the SAC during an informal meeting in Stornoway on 15th August 2013, HIE will focus its response to the ‘432:30 report’ on matters reserved to Westminster.&#xa0;

[[[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[About Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise (HIE)]]] &#xa0;2  HIE is the Scottish Government's economic and community development agency for an area which covers more than half of Scotland. We work with high growth businesses, social enterprises and public and third sector organisations to build sustainable economic growth across a diverse region which stretches from Shetland to Argyll and from the Outer Hebrides to Moray. We are committed to continuing the development of the Highlands and Islands as a competitive region which is home to strong communities, successful, high growth businesses and offers an excellent quality of life. &#xa0;3  In line with the Government Economic Strategy (GES), HIE’s purpose is to generate sustainable economic growth in every part of the Highlands and Islands.  Across the region, we pursue four priorities:&#xa0;4  Our work to support community ownership is an integral part of our approach to deliver on all the above organisational priorities, recognising the contribution community asset ownership makes directly to the economy AND society of our region.  Our knowledge, based on the evidenced outcomes from community asset ownership in the region enables us to authoritatively advocate the powerful benefits of community land and asset ownership.  Since 1997 we have actively supported and contributed towards over 150 community buyouts, including a significant number of whole estate purchases.  &#xa0;5  Since 2001 HIE has been actively involved in supporting community asset ownership across Scotland.  Recognising the extensive knowledge and skills within our agency in this area, we have been contracted to deliver two community asset programmes for the Lottery: i) Scottish Land Fund (2001-06), and ii) Growing Community Assets (2006-2010).  We are currently delivering the second Scottish Land Fund programme, in partnership with the BIG Lottery Fund, across rural Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Government.  Our broad and unique expertise in the community ownership sector is founded from this national operating context.&#xa0;

[[[RESPONSE TO THE 432:50 REPORT ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[More diversified land ownership and sustainable economic growth]]]&#xa0;6  The Scottish Government asked the LRRG to identify how more people in rural and urban Scotland can have a stake in the ownership, governance, management and use of land, leading to a greater diversity of land ownership, and ownership types, in Scotland.  HIE shares the premise of the LRRG that more diversified land ownership, specifically community land ownership, can create greater opportunities for sustainable economic growth.  Moreover, when considering the Highlands and Islands region and the dual remit of our agency - enabling economic and community development - it can be shown that where communities own and manage their own land the powerful outcomes secured extend beyond solely economic advantage.  Where communities direct their own development, primarily enabled by income sources and opportunities derived from their land holding outcomes include increased community capacity, confidence and high levels of autonomy.&#xa0;7  Land is a fundamental yet finite resource.  We believe a diversified land ownership pattern, enabling communities as land owners, is highly compatible with a sustainable and more equitable modern Scottish economy.  &#xa0;8  Whilst HIE is committed to enabling increased community and wider social/economic benefit from Scotland’s land resource through community ownership, we believe that land reform extends beyond the Land Reform (Scotland) Act (LRA) and community ownership.  As detailed in our evidence to the LRRG, although the Community Right to Buy and Crofting Community Right to Buy legislation is welcome the total amount of land passed into community ownership through the LRA provisions is nominal.  &#xa0;9  Furthermore, the LRA applies only to rural areas and can only be utilised by community bodies and crofting community bodies (geographically-based, open membership community companies).  At present, therefore, the LRA does not support individuals, public bodies, NGOs or community bodies outwith rural Scotland to acquire land.  &#xa0;10  We concluded the LRA is having a limited impact on both the diversity of land ownership and even less impact on diversity of land ownership types.  We would therefore welcome the consideration of other measures, which together with the LRA, would help more people to benefit directly from the opportunities afforded by land ownership in Scotland.&#xa0;11  We would note that, critical to the enabling role which we have delivered supporting communities across Scotland to acquire their own assets are both our broad expertise in the complex community ownership sector and the responsive flexibility in our support over time. Recognising that the journey to acquire assets by communities is invariably a lengthy one, longevity of relationships between communities and HIE staff is also an intrinsic enabling-success factor.&#xa0;

[[[Land ownership concentration underpinned by public, especially fiscal, policy]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]12  HIE supports communities, social enterprises and businesses to realise their development and growth aspirations.  This is enabled through the framework of a long term relationship with individual organisations, and allows us to provide access to a range of business and community development products and services, specialist advice and capital investment in the form of grants and loans.  Support to acquire land and assets is centred on our work to strengthen communities - community-led regeneration with the direct outcome of increasing the resilience of whole communities.&#xa0;13  Access to land for development and regeneration purposes can be a barrier to sustainable development.  This can take the form of lack of available land to acquire or lease (market failure) or the cost to acquire/lease land that is available; these two factors being closely related.&#xa0;14  With respect to the purchase of large tracts of rural land (forestry, estates, islands) it is our experience that the contemporary value of such land is disproportionate to the return on investment that such assets typically generate.  This could be shown as a direct legacy of the economic context and fiscal environment of land ownership over time in Scotland and a legacy which presents a barrier to diversified land ownership patterns in Scotland today.  &#xa0;15  The effect of the historic context is it necessitates that purchasers of larger land assets must have access to significant financial resources. Community bodies are often not in this position, and as they cannot usually borrow against the asset (due to low return on investment levels noted above) they have been typically dependent on significant support from the public purse to achieve community ownership of assets.&#xa0;16  The 432:50 reports cites examples of certain tax reliefs and offsetting that land ownership can provide.  If a change in fiscal arrangements regarding landownership is to be considered, we would welcome measures that are transparent and encourage investment which deliver a range of economic, social and environmental benefits.  Tax incentives or relief that support wider rural development objectives, and increase the resilience of rural communities would be beneficial to our region and to Scotland, in our view. &#xa0;17  Overall, it is important that any new fiscal proposals encourage, and do not inhibit, investment in land.  Land-related tax arrangements that drive wider public benefit outcomes will increasingly enable greater parity of economic and social benefit for all, from Scotland’s valuable land resource.&#xa0;18  Regarding land management grants, it is perhaps not surprising that larger landholdings tend to accrue, in total, greater public subsidy in the form of forestry grants, land management options and nature conservation grants as these tend to be disbursed on a ‘per hectare’ basis.  Greater diversity in ownership could enable production/conservation support to be more equitably distributed amongst a greater number of owners.  We do however recognise that smaller landholdings and those on less productive land have found it more challenging to access such support schemes.  We would be encouraged if the forthcoming SRDP (Scottish Rural Development Programme) included measures to support smaller landholding enterprises and also those on poorer quality land.  &#xa0;19  We would welcome consideration of fiscal and public policy measures that will create an environment for increasing the economic and community benefits from Scotland’s land resource – specifically diversified ownership, and an environment where community ownership is enabled.  We would also welcome land management/conservation support (subsidy) that favours smaller landholdings and encourages purposeful use of less productive land.&#xa0;

[[[Achieving 1 million acres of land in community ownership by 2020]]]&#xa0;21  In June 2013, the First Minister set a target for the amount of land currently in community ownership to double, to one million acres, by 2020.  Speaking at the Community Land Scotland conference, Mr Salmond said: &#xa0;“We cannot underestimate the crucial part land reform will play in contributing to the future success of Scotland for the next generation.  Land ownership is currently overly concentrated.  If the people who live and work in Scotland are best-placed to make decisions about the country’s future, then it follows that local people are best-placed to make decisions about their futures.”&#xa0;22  The First Minister acknowledged this is an ambitious target and in addition to “radical reshaping of the right-to-buy landscape” he committed a further year and an additional £3 million to the Scottish Land Fund.&#xa0;23  In our response to the LRRG, we provided a detailed account as to how opportunities for community ownership of assets could be increased.  These included: &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Simplifying the LRA-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Provisions for underused or neglected/misused assets-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Compulsory purchase (in exceptional circumstances only)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Encouraging voluntary sales through willing seller incentives and facilitation-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Reform of The Crown Estate-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Public asset transfer-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Reform of common good land-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Supporting communities through the process (advice and capacity building)&#xa0;Rather than repeating these points we will instead focus on two areas which fall within ‘reserved’ matters: a) State aid, and b) The Crown Estate&#xa0;

[[[State aid:]]]24  The 432:50 report suggests that EU State aid rules requires urgent attention in a public asset transfer context.  State aid rules apply to all forms of public funding invested in an undertaking (an economic activity) and so its affects are far reaching.  Across the public sector there are different interpretations of State aid legislation which is challenging and confusing for communities.  &#xa0;25  Supporting communities to own and manage land often requires significant capital investment, and this is particularly so in urban areas where land and asset values are higher than in a rural context.  As discussed previously, commercial borrowing is rarely available to communities, or not to an extent that will enable the purchase to proceed on the basis of loan finance only.  Coupled to this is that most communities, at the time of purchase, have little if any trading history and very limited cash reserves.  &#xa0;26  Adding important context to the note above, communities do not enter into asset acquisition naively - as might be implied by the absence of trading history or financial capability.  HIE support for communities, established sometimes around the contemporary availability of an asset but also as part of the long term relationship, enables the building of capacity within community "anchor" organisations; these being the organisations which go on to acquire assets and contribute to whole community resilience. Longevity of support from HIE is assured beyond the acquisition phase, with community organisation growth and development being supported - as we value highly the critical role community organisations play in ensuring a strong, diverse economy and confident society in the Highlands and Islands region.&#xa0;27  It is our experience that grant assistance, at a high intervention level, is important to enable community asset acquisition.  Providing significant grant funding was the rationale adopted for the original Scottish Land Fund in 2001-06.  This principle has been replicated in the current Scottish Land Fund (2012-16) which can potentially provide up to 95% of the acquisition costs based on an independent valuation of the asset.  &#xa0;28  As HIE and the Scottish Land Fund look for communities to deliver social and economic outcomes from their assets, there is potential for grant assistance towards the purchase of land and land assets to involve State aid.  Within this context HIE is playing a leadership role in encouraging a refreshed approach to State aid assessment.  The principle aims of our approach, which has been shared with Scottish Government, include: &#xa0;&#xa0;29  It is our view that a more aligned approach to State aid across the public sector would be constructive.  The prevailing option to assess public assistance as de minimis aid, often by default, is in our view missing opportunities to provide approved aid and thereby limits the amount of grant assistance that can potentially be invested in enterprises that will deliver public benefit.  Furthermore, it would be advantageous if public bodies such as HIE were supported at a national level to be proactive in taking a risk-aware approach to allow assistance to be recorded as ‘non-State aid’ where this is appropriate.  For example, it would be extremely beneficial if public bodies could confidently apply a no-aid argument in instances where the project’s focus is on delivering local services and amenities in remote, harder to reach communities where market failure is prevalent.&#xa0;30  Working collaboratively with partners and agreeing national guidance, which can more easily be applied to real projects, would be a significant step forward.&#xa0;

[[[Crown Estates: ]]]31  The Community Right to Buy provisions of the LRA apply to the foreshore and we believe there are merits in extending this to the seabed, at least up to the 12 nautical mile limit which is retained as a public asset and is managed by the Crown Estates Commission.  &#xa0;32  As detailed in our LRRG submission, we consider this is relevant to the community empowerment and resilience agenda.  Putting the seabed, or parts of it, under LRA legislation could increase the future ability of communities to develop income generating assets, particularly in relation to the growth in tidal, wave and wind electricity generating.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[CONCLUSION]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]33  HIE is an ambitious organisation with a unique remit which combines economic and community development.  Ensuring that the Highlands and Islands derives maximum benefit from existing and emerging opportunities is central to our role.  We are firmly of the view that a decade on from the passing of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, more can be done in the pursuit of greater economic and social outcomes from Scotland’s land resource.  &#xa0;34  Fiscal and public policy measures to encourage more diverse land ownership, particularly through increased community land ownership, together with greater investment in land to deliver wider rural objectives would, in our view, contribute to a more sustainable and equitable modern Scottish economy.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;
