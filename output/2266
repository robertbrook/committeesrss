EIS 10
default&#xa0;
defaultWritten evidence submitted by Matthew Parsons on behalf of Sirius Minerals Plc.default&#xa0;
defaultSirius Minerals welcomes the opportunity to submit written evidence to the inquiry.
default&#xa0;
defaultSirius Minerals is a UK-listed, global potash development company. The York Potash Project, a proposal to build a new state-of-the-art potash mine near Whitby in North Yorkshire, is the company’s flagship project. It has the potential to help Sirius to bec
defaultome a leading global potash producer, significantly boost the UK economy, and put the UK at the forefront of the global mining industry in the approach to innovative mine design in sensitive landscapes.
default&#xa0;
defaultSirius has defined the 
defaultworld’s
default largest highest and g
defaultrade polyhalite resource in North Yorkshire. Polyhalite is a rare form of potash which uniquely contains four of the six macro-nutrients necessary for plant growth. As the world’s population expands and the land available for farming diminishes, balanced a
defaultnd sustainable fertilization using poyhalite is rapidly becoming regarded as an effective solution to global food security.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur evidence to the inquiry will focus on:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is the contributidefaulton to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?default&#xa0;
defaultThe extractives sector is central to the way we live our lives. Everything we see around us is made of materials that were either grown or mined. The places we live and work, how we travel, the tech
defaultnology we all rely upon, and the food we eat are all dependent on the extractives sector. As a result it is one of the oldest and largest industries in the world.
default&#xa0;
defaultExtractive industries make a significant contribution to the UK economy, both directly and t
defaulthrough supporting other key sectors such as construction, manufacturing, energy and agriculture. The value of the sector to the UK economy is estimated to be as much as £10 billion.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe York Potash Project can make a significant contribution to the UK 
defaulteconomy. In addition to creating thousands of jobs, an independent socio-economic study has calculated that the project can, at full production:
default&#xa0;
defaultHow does the UK based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citidefaultzens overseas?default&#xa0;
defaultAround 70,000 people are employed by the extractive industries in the UK, and many thousands more in the sectors it supports. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe York Potash Project will create up to 1000 new, skilled and sustainable jobs, and approximately 2000 further
default opportunities in the supply chain in a local economy with historic low employment growth.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK has some of the most highly regarded mining consultancies, which are in high demand worldwide. The UK still produces good quality engineers and geologists th
defaultat are highly sought after 
defaultin the global labour market. There is however, an increasing national and global shortage of the skills the extractives sector requires. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDoes UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive indefaultdustries i.e. In sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?default&#xa0;
defaultYes, mining equipment is manufactured
default in the UK which supplies the national
default and wider global market, and supports the UK manufacturing base. Joy Global, a world le
defaultader in mining machinery and services, has three UK-based manufacturing facilities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDoes the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such defaultas shale gas?default&#xa0;
defaultIt is well known within the extractives sector that there is a national and global shortage of people with the skills required. This is also the case with other sectors requiring similar skill sets, such as advanced manufacturing. The UK is 
defaultnot producing enough people with technical skills and qualifications.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK extractives sector is a dynamic, technology-driven industry requiring Level 3 and higher level Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) qualifications, particularly engine
defaulters and skilled technicians.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Commission for Employment and Skills forecast a demand for around 1.9 million workers with engineering skills up to 2020, of which almost 90% are replacement jobs as the existing workforce retires. This equates to over 
default87,000 new workers each year qualified to Level 4+ and 69,000 qualified to Level 3.
default&#xa0;
default42% of employers requiring STEM skills have difficulties recruiting. The UK produces less than half number of required engineers at Level 4 and less than 40% at Level 3. A low participation rate in STEM subjects at Key Stage 4 is a key part of the problem.
default In 2009/10 just 16% of entrants achieved GCSEs at A*-C in 3 Sciences and Maths (vital for progression to A levels) and only 56% of schools entered pupils for ‘triple Science’ GCSEs.
default&#xa0;
defaultSirius Minerals recognises this issue and the challenge we face in reali
defaultsing our commitment to maximising local employment in the York Potash Project. The Company is continuing to invest in an education and skills programme that ensures the right skills are available in the local area. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is the impact of the industry of tdefaulthe UK signing up to the EITI?default&#xa0;
defaultSirius Minerals is committed to the principle of good corporate citizenship and supports the EITI.
default&#xa0;
defaultWould increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used todefault make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?default&#xa0;
defaultThe Company has committed to the ICMM sustainable development principles. In general increased regulation should be discouraged.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is the competitive landscape for the extdefaultractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?default&#xa0;defaultHaving a secure supply of critical minerals is in the national interest. We recommend that the Government develops a UK minerals strategy as part of 
defaultthe overall Industrial Strategy. This should have the dual aim of ensuring that we have access to minerals of national importance, and that economic growth is generated by exploiting our own indigenous supply. This will enable the UK to reduce a re
defaultliance o
defaultn imports, and drive
default UK economic growth through exports to the global market.
