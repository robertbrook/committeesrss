EIS 10
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence submitted by Matthew Parsons on behalf of Sirius Minerals Plc.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Sirius Minerals welcomes the opportunity to submit written evidence to the inquiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sirius Minerals is a UK-listed, global potash development company. The York Potash Project, a proposal to build a new state-of-the-art potash mine near Whitby in North Yorkshire, is the company’s flagship project. It has the potential to help Sirius to bec
[normal]ome a leading global potash producer, significantly boost the UK economy, and put the UK at the forefront of the global mining industry in the approach to innovative mine design in sensitive landscapes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sirius has defined the 
[normal]world’s
[normal] largest highest and g
[normal]rade polyhalite resource in North Yorkshire. Polyhalite is a rare form of potash which uniquely contains four of the six macro-nutrients necessary for plant growth. As the world’s population expands and the land available for farming diminishes, balanced a
[normal]nd sustainable fertilization using poyhalite is rapidly becoming regarded as an effective solution to global food security.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our evidence to the inquiry will focus on:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the contributi[bold]on to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The extractives sector is central to the way we live our lives. Everything we see around us is made of materials that were either grown or mined. The places we live and work, how we travel, the tech
[normal]nology we all rely upon, and the food we eat are all dependent on the extractives sector. As a result it is one of the oldest and largest industries in the world.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Extractive industries make a significant contribution to the UK economy, both directly and t
[normal]hrough supporting other key sectors such as construction, manufacturing, energy and agriculture. The value of the sector to the UK economy is estimated to be as much as £10 billion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The York Potash Project can make a significant contribution to the UK 
[normal]economy. In addition to creating thousands of jobs, an independent socio-economic study has calculated that the project can, at full production:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How does the UK based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citi[bold]zens overseas?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Around 70,000 people are employed by the extractive industries in the UK, and many thousands more in the sectors it supports. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The York Potash Project will create up to 1000 new, skilled and sustainable jobs, and approximately 2000 further
[normal] opportunities in the supply chain in a local economy with historic low employment growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK has some of the most highly regarded mining consultancies, which are in high demand worldwide. The UK still produces good quality engineers and geologists th
[normal]at are highly sought after 
[normal]in the global labour market. There is however, an increasing national and global shortage of the skills the extractives sector requires. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Does UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive in[bold]dustries i.e. In sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Yes, mining equipment is manufactured
[normal] in the UK which supplies the national
[normal] and wider global market, and supports the UK manufacturing base. Joy Global, a world le
[normal]ader in mining machinery and services, has three UK-based manufacturing facilities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Does the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such [bold]as shale gas?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It is well known within the extractives sector that there is a national and global shortage of people with the skills required. This is also the case with other sectors requiring similar skill sets, such as advanced manufacturing. The UK is 
[normal]not producing enough people with technical skills and qualifications.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK extractives sector is a dynamic, technology-driven industry requiring Level 3 and higher level Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) qualifications, particularly engine
[normal]ers and skilled technicians.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK Commission for Employment and Skills forecast a demand for around 1.9 million workers with engineering skills up to 2020, of which almost 90% are replacement jobs as the existing workforce retires. This equates to over 
[normal]87,000 new workers each year qualified to Level 4+ and 69,000 qualified to Level 3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42% of employers requiring STEM skills have difficulties recruiting. The UK produces less than half number of required engineers at Level 4 and less than 40% at Level 3. A low participation rate in STEM subjects at Key Stage 4 is a key part of the problem.
[normal] In 2009/10 just 16% of entrants achieved GCSEs at A*-C in 3 Sciences and Maths (vital for progression to A levels) and only 56% of schools entered pupils for ‘triple Science’ GCSEs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sirius Minerals recognises this issue and the challenge we face in reali
[normal]sing our commitment to maximising local employment in the York Potash Project. The Company is continuing to invest in an education and skills programme that ensures the right skills are available in the local area. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the impact of the industry of t[bold]he UK signing up to the EITI?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Sirius Minerals is committed to the principle of good corporate citizenship and supports the EITI.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to[bold] make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Company has committed to the ICMM sustainable development principles. In general increased regulation should be discouraged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the competitive landscape for the ext[bold]ractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Having a secure supply of critical minerals is in the national interest. We recommend that the Government develops a UK minerals strategy as part of 
[normal]the overall Industrial Strategy. This should have the dual aim of ensuring that we have access to minerals of national importance, and that economic growth is generated by exploiting our own indigenous supply. This will enable the UK to reduce a re
[normal]liance o
[normal]n imports, and drive
[normal] UK economic growth through exports to the global market.
