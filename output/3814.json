But fundamentally, \nthe scale of challenge is also enormous: \nthe level\n of financial and social \ncapital inequality between families cannot\n simply be compensated \nfor \nby school\ns\n alone\n. \nWe n\need to address wealth inequality, and \nto \nempower and engage working class parents. \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnd the practice of VA, foundation and academy schools being their own admissions authority, and convening their own appeals panels. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDirect schoo\nls to publish the data on who applied to their school, and who was granted admission, in relation to socio-economic background\n – and \nthe \nO\nffice of the \nS\nchools \nA\ndjudicator to scrutinise this data\n.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEmpower and resource the Office of the Schools Adjudicator \nto carry out random checks and enforcement of schools’ admissions procedures.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;References&#xa0;Academies Commission (2013) \nUnleashing Greatness: Getting the best from an academised system\n, London: RSA/Pearson Think Tank.\nCandy, S.

Disadvantaged pupils are likely to be placed in low sets and streams because they arrive with lower achievement. However, research has shown that teacher perception may play a part in such allocation, and also that low sets ten\nd to suffer \nfrom poor quality teaching (Ireson\n &amp; Hallam\n, 2001\n).\n \nOECD (20\n10\n), a point\n regularly observed by Michael Gove (e.g. Gove 2011).\n Wherein social segregation is shown to be especially strong.\n See also Moss’ work on boys and literacy.\n As the \nUK has traditionally maintained a strong, hierarchised distinction between vocational and academic routes. \n \nThe Pupil Premium is set to \nincrease\n to 2.5bn in 2014-15,\n but even so the sums involved are smaller than originally recommended by the Sutton Trus\nt (2010a) and Liberal \nDemocrat manifesto, and in comparison with similar international initiatives such as the Harlem Children’s Zone project.\n Sibieta (2009) estimated that the cost for getting the attainment of poor children up to the national average wou\nld require the pupil premium to be set at over £25,000 per pupil.\n In the US, charter agreements are between 3-5 years duration.\n This and the above three recommendations were all made by the Academies Commission (2013).\n This recommendation has been ma\nde by West et al (2009), the Academies Commission (2013), and Francis (for ASCL, 2013).\n"
