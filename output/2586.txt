[[[ (Durham University)]]]&#xa0;Overcoming the poverty gradient for schools in England: a summary of some recent evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Closing the social class achievement gap or ‘poverty gradient’ in education is a prominent policy reform issue in the UK, as it is in many other developed countries. And billions of pounds of public money has been, and is being, spent on generic or tailored interventions to address it. However, these interventions are largely untested, or where they have been rigorously and independently evaluated they have been shown not to work or even to be harmful. &#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recent work has shown, for example, that almost all interventions to improve the attainment of disadvantaged pupils by altering attitudes, aspirations or behaviour have no evidence base or have been shown not to work (Gorard 2012). This is also so for attempts to improve post-compulsory participation, and applies to the attitudes and behaviour of parents as well as young people and children. The same problem arises when assessing the evidence for interventions simply based on increasing or altering the timing and delivery mechanisms for education. Provision of summer schools, Saturday clubs, IT equipment and even teaching assistants in themselves make no difference (Gorard and See 2013). Aspiration without increased competence makes no difference whereas increased competence can lead to changes in aspiration, for example. In the same way, more school, faster delivery or smaller groups make no difference unless the activities undertaken are effective. But if the activities are effective then it is not clear that the others changes matter. A new example of this will be the first report of a randomised controlled trial funded by the Educational Endowment Foundation (Gorard et al. 2013). Switch-on Reading was found to be a promisingly effective intervention for children moving to secondary school with low reading scores (around 3 months gain in reading age), capable of being conducted by teaching assistants. The intervention was most effective for the very lowest attainers, and those with special educational needs.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the reasons why money is being directed towards unproven, ineffective or harmful interventions is that the quality of the evidence available is generally so poor. And this is despite further billions of pounds of public money spent on generating such evidence. It is crucial that there is, in future, greater discrimination between attempts to provide good research evidence for wider use, and the rest. This is illustrated in the remainder of this submission by a summary of a new review of evidence linking interventions to improve parental engagement in their children’s education with improved attainment, conducted for the Nuffield Foundation (See and Gorard 2013). The review illustrates that there is not yet enough evidence that any intervention will work, and also that a far higher standard of basic evaluation is required, and should be demanded by all funders. The implications for policy-makers are in the final paragraphs 5.9 to 5.11. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Previous reviews have shown that there is a strong association between parental involvement in their child’s education and that child’s subsequent attainment. This means that, on average, a child with parent(s) fully engaged in their learning will do better on standardised tests of attainment than a child without such parents. [The term ‘parent’ should be taken here to include foster parents, carers and responsible adults in any form of family structure]. If disadvantaged pupils are less likely to have engaged parents then this could be part of the solution to the poverty gradient. &#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Previous work has suggested a range of plausible ways in which this association could arise. These include getting the parents to act as a kind of substitute teacher providing home tutorials, or as a role model, creating appropriate learning spaces in the home, and making the culture of school and home more similar so that school becomes less threatening to a young child. Any of these explanations for the association might be true. However, robust evaluations of interventions to increase parental involvement and assess the impact of this on children’s attainment are far fewer than the studies of association, and also far fewer than studies that have simply shown that parental involvement can be increased (but without testing whether this makes a difference to attainment). &#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite this, considerable public funding and policy and practice effort has been devoted to increasing parental involvement in England precisely in order to improve school outcomes. At present, these actions are not evidence-informed (or rather they are ‘informed’ by over-claiming on the basis of studies of association). These actions could be wasteful, an inefficient use of public funds or even harmful to the intended beneficiaries. Therefore, this new review was commissioned to clarify the situation.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Most of the studies in the review came from searching the main on-line databases for education, psychology and sociology – ERIC, PsycInfo, ASSIA, Australian Education Index, British Educational Index, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The results were extended by medical databases, key contacts, existing knowledge, hand searching of journals, bibliographies, and websites including Google Scholar, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. The search was as inclusive as possible in identifying a wide range of both published and unpublished literature, to prevent publication bias, but was limited to studies published in English between 1990 and 2012. This search yielded 756 distinct reports, which were checked to see that they were indeed relevant (i.e. a randomised controlled trial or similar reasonably robust design for evaluation of a parental intervention to improve children’s attainment). Any studies thought not to meet the inclusion criteria were reviewed by the other members of the research team for consensus. On this simple basis, a further 688 studies were excluded, leaving 68. These 68 were judged to be relevant, empirical and described in sufficient clarity to make judgements about the quality of the evidence. Each study was then summarised in terms of its purpose, methods, outcomes, and limitations.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Studies will have been missed due to imperfections in the search, and the necessary time limits on applying exclusion criteria. However, it is very unlikely that the studies not found in the search were disproportionately the missing high quality ones, or would alter the picture below. The findings of the review are secure. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have shown elsewhere, in a more widespread review, that there is plenty of reasonable descriptive evidence associating levels of parental involvement with levels of child attainment (Gorard et al. 2012). The question this new review considered was whether the act of enhancing parental involvement through intervention leads to improved educational outcomes. This required a different kind of research design, of a substantial size, with a clear and fair counterfactual. We found no such study, and this has to be the headline finding for the review. Despite all of the practitioner, policy and state-funded investment in enhancing parental engagement in education across the world, we could not find one high quality study that evaluated its impact. &#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This new review includes the highest quality evaluations in terms of answering the key causal question about whether higher parental involvement creates higher attainment for their children. However, no relevant study was deemed to be high quality or even anywhere near high quality. Each study located had two or more serious flaws, such as being too small (most had fewer than 30 cases), no baseline equivalence between comparator groups, high or unequal dropout after allocation to groups, and misuse of statistical techniques. Seven studies were deemed to be large enough with some attempt at creating a suitable comparator, and so were rated as medium in quality. The remaining studies were all of low quality with three or more serious flaws. There are so few studies of consequence that a traditional meta-analysis is not possible.&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overall, and even taken at face value, these 68 studies present a mixed and far from encouraging picture for the success of parental interventions. Of the best, some have suggested positive outcomes, some no effect, and some that parental involvement interventions may actually harm children’s attainment. Many of the studies with positive outcomes involve complex interventions including more than parental involvement (such as additional classes at school as well). Where these different elements have been separated, it is those other aspects that are shown to be effective rather than the parental involvement. &#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This means that the promise of improving attainment by enhancing parental involvement is less than appeared to be the case when this new review was commissioned. However, our previous work has shown that the situation for many other possible interventions is even worse. In terms of individual behaviours and attitudes, parental involvement remains the most promising approach. &#xa0;4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The studies that were found are presented in terms of the ages of the children involved.&#xa0;Pre-school age children&#xa0;4.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There were ten studies relevant to pre-school age that claimed or reported unclear/negative impact from increased parental interventions, and all were deemed of low quality. Many of these were tiny, with group sizes for analysis as low as eight, as well as high drop out of cases after allocation to groups. One had a control group but ignored it. One researcher used their own test without calibration, one used changes in behaviour rather than tests to make claims about attainment, and one claimed positive results for teacher-reported outcomes but found no gains using a standardised test. The latter group are instructive because they suggest we should not rely on bespoke tests, indirect indications or simple self- or teacher- reports. &#xa0;4.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There were thirteen studies relevant to pre-school age reporting largely positive results, and ten of these were deemed low quality. Again many were small, with treatment groups as small as 14 pupils, without randomisation or clear prior matching between treatment and comparison groups. One study had clearly unbalanced comparator groups from the outset. Another had 45% dropout after allocation to groups. One even quoted effect sizes for gains in a parental volunteer group compared to those parents who refused to participate, and claimed that these were the ‘effects’ of the programme.&#xa0;4.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The three medium quality studies with positive outcomes were all of the same intervention, reporting after different times had elapsed. The successful intervention was the Chicago Child-Parent Centre Programme (CPC), which was a federally funded pre-school programme for families in high poverty areas in Chicago. It included parental training with a child-centred focus on developing reading and language skills. However, it also included teacher-directed whole class instruction, small group activities, field trips and play, low child to staff ratios in kindergartens, outreach activities including home visits, staff development activities, and an enriched classroom environment for developing reading and math skills, plus health and nutrition services. This complex intervention took place 3 hours per day 5 days per week over 9 months with a 6-week summer programme, plus the provision of ‘continuing services’. The programme was originally meant for pre-school children up to 3rd grade and was run within pre-school centres. These centres are now part of the Chicago Public School system. In every CPC there is a staffed parent resource room, and the programme requires active parental participation. Parents must commit to volunteer at the CPC on a weekly basis. Around 1,400 mostly African American children were tracked through to age 28, with about 15 to 20% dropout. The researchers claimed that CPC had positive effects on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS), attendance and high school completion. However because of the multiple components of the programme it was not clear what the impact of parental involvement was specifically, or even if it had any impact at all. The intervention has also altered since its inception, moving from pre-school to school-age (up to 9) and becoming more institutionalised. What is needed now is a much clearer evaluation of only the parental involvement component of this intervention for a specific age group, and in a pre-specified format.  &#xa0;4.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overall, it is difficult to conclude that there is much solid evidence of effective parental interventions for pre-school children despite the widely held belief that early interventions will be the most effective.&#xa0;Primary age children&#xa0;4.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The review found nine studies of parental involvement with primary age children that showed unclear/negative outcomes. Six of these were deemed of low quality. Two were so small as to be negligible (5 cases per arm), and another was so poorly described in terms of the sample reported that it is not possible to say how large or small it was. One, like so many summarised, completely misused the technique of significance testing. One dredged by trying to find a positive result through the removal of ‘outliers’ (possibly inconvenient results). In perhaps the best of these weak studies, the comparison group performed substantially better than the treatment group. &#xa0;4.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The other three studies that showed unclear/negative outcomes were deemed of medium quality. The Family-School Partnership programme improved parent-teacher communication. It involved using teachers and health professionals to train parents in teaching literacy and numeracy, and child behaviour management skills. It started with a three day seminar for teachers and relevant school personnel, training them in parent-teacher communication and partnership building. Teachers received a training manual, videotape, and training aids, plus additional support after the training. Programme experts visited schools during the intervention to supervise and offer feedback. There were nine parent workshops run by the 1st grade teachers, social workers and school psychologists, with weekly home-school learning and communication activities. The evaluation was a longitudinal study involving a total of 678 students from nine schools. Classes were randomly allocated to one of three groups who were tracked from first grade to age 19. One group received the parental intervention, one a classroom intervention, and one acted as a control. Around 16% dropped out after allocation. Regression analysis suggested that the classroom intervention had positive effects on reading and maths performance using the the Kaufman tests of Educational Achievement, but no impact on high school graduation. There was no overall difference on any outcome due to the family intervention. &#xa0;4.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The LiFuS programme involved training parents to support their children at home with their reading homework, and training teachers in cooperative learning activities at school to enhance children’s reading motivation and comprehension. The home reading programme was for 20 minutes three times per week, using 4th grade students in Switzerland. It emphasised supporting child’s autonomy in reading, by avoiding controlling and interfering behavior, and using autonomy supportive strategies. Parents should provide reading materials such as dictionaries and remain nearby to answer questions, but allow the child to read silently at their own pace. Instead of giving them the complete solutions to queries, parents were instructed to provide strategies for the child to use. Parents needed to familiarise themselves with three strategies (background knowledge, predicting and summarising) to facilitate pre- and post-reading discussions. Before implementation, parents attended two training sessions each lasting three hours, held in the evening in the child’s school. In the first training session, parents were shown a video demonstrating the theoretical aspects of the homework intervention. In the second training session, parents practised strategies with their child on how to support their reading homework in a semi-authentic homework situation. Parents were supported throughout the intervention with personal coaching. In addition, they received instructional booklets with the content of the training session (to refer to whenever they needed). Children were given a checklist to help them remember the steps of the strategy used. A total of 713 children took part in the evaluation, divided into three groups: school intervention, school/home intervention and a control group. The control group was merely matched with the intervention groups, and known differences between the groups controlled for. Although the authors reported that the programme had significant effects on students’ enjoyment in reading and reading motivation, it did not have any positive effect on reading comprehension tests. Both interventions (school only and home/school) actually had small negative effects on text comprehension compared to the control group, suggesting that students might have been better off without the intervention. Perhaps increased enjoyment of reading itself did not translate into performance in reading comprehension because comprehension requires certain skills which needed to be taught. This means that students can be motivated to do well, but to actually do well they need the competence to do so.&#xa0;4.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An earlier study evaluated a school-collaborated programme involving parents helping their children to read at home using prescribed activities. The aim of the intervention was to help enhance children’s vocabulary and comprehension, as well as their self-esteem. Parents in the experimental group attended one training session, where they had to commit to a 14-week parental involvement programme. At the sessions they were given materials, and discussed the topics in these handouts. The topics were about issues like building self-esteem, how to support their child in their reading, how to help their child to cope with stress and to create a stress-free environment for the child. Parents also received vocabulary and comprehension exercises and were shown, using role play, how to reinforce reading skills at home. This is an important study because it is a straight comparison between parental involvement or not (and is the only such study of medium quality found in the review). In five schools, teachers and their 230 students were allocated in an unspecified manner to the ‘treatment’ or ‘comparator’ group, but around 15% dropped out after allocation. The comparison group made slightly greater improvements in reading attainment than the treatment children (ES = -0.20), as assessed by the standardised Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test (GMRT). This suggests that increasing parental involvement was harmful. &#xa0;4.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There were a further 14 studies with positive, or elements of positive, results. All of these were of low quality. Again many of these studies were negligible in scale, with as few as seven pupils per arm of the study. One study used a total of 3 cases. Other studies had high levels of attrition such as 31% in one of the groups after allocation. Three had no matching comparator (or maybe just a nearby school), one used a bespoke test that did not translate into real-life achievement and another relied on self-reported achievements only. &#xa0;4.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overall, there is no evidence here that primary age interventions to enhance parental involvement are generally effective in increasing children’s attainment. In fact, the better studies suggest the interventions can be harmful. It may be important that all of the medium quality negative studies so far are largely about training parents to act a little like teachers at home, whereas the medium quality positive study involves parents and other adults meeting and working together in an institution of some sort. It is also noteworthy that when parental involvement has been compared to a classroom intervention with the same purpose, if there is a difference it is the classroom programme that is more successful.   &#xa0;Secondary age children&#xa0;4.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The review found fewer interventions aimed solely at young people of secondary school age. This is presumably because of the widespread belief that earlier interventions will be more effective. There were six studies reporting unclear/negative results overall, and all of these were low quality. Problems with these studies included very small samples, and confusion about what the results really are. One study suggested that prior attainment was the key to outcomes. The latter is important because, if true, it means we cannot trust any studies that either do not take prior attainment into account, or that do not make it irrelevant by having large randomly allocated groups. &#xa0;4.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There were five studies reporting positive results. Four of these were of low quality, including some very small samples – with as few as 14 pupils per group. The latter study also contains some negative results not clearly presented. One study is substantially larger but has no comparator. &#xa0;4.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One study with positive results was of near-medium quality. Bridges to High School/Puentes was a family-focused programme to reduce problems associated with transition to secondary school. It lasted for nine weeks in the 8th grade, and combined parent and child education with family support. It involved a parenting intervention, adolescent sessions and family sessions, plus two home visits (one pre and one during intervention). Parenting sessions were aimed at helping parents understand school expectations, improving parent-teacher communication enhancing parenting skills using positive reinforcement, monitoring and appropriate discipline, and reducing harsh parenting. In adolescent sessions, students were taught coping strategies, managing interpersonal and school problems, exploring goals and motivations and balancing family relationships with other obligations/interests. Family sessions provided structured opportunities for mutual understanding, enjoyment and communication, and to practice skills learnt in parent and adolescent sessions. The leaders of sessions were trained in the intervention, for 45 hours beforehand, and five additional hours per week during the intervention. A school liaison officer was available to support families. Around 500 students were randomly allocated to treatment or not, and around 27% dropped out later especially in the non-treatment group. The authors reported positive effects on students’ GPA. It is difficult to isolate the active ingredient as there are so many aspects to the intervention including parental training, home visits and adolescent behaviour training. The outcome measures are heavily dependent on self-reporting scales with less emphasis on independent observation/records, and in the analysis no account was taken of the differential dropout. &#xa0;4.19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overall, on this evidence, it is currently not possible to conclude that the kinds of parental involvement interventions covered here will be effective in secondary phases. &#xa0;Across age groups&#xa0;4.20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There were a small number of studies about interventions for children across age groups (e.g. from primary to first year of secondary school). Three of these included a combination of strategies, two were about training parents and two involved getting parents to work with their children at home. One was a home-school collaboration intervention. Five of the reports had negative/unclear outcomes, and all were deemed low quality. Two studies of the same intervention had very high dropout, another had clearly tried to dredge for positive results and did not report the negative ones properly. The others also had problems both with high dropout and apparently selective reporting of results.&#xa0;4.21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The four reports claiming positive outcomes were generally just as poor. Two had small cell sizes (as low as 15). One had no match between classes in the two groups, and another had a conflict of interest and reported only the successful results. &#xa0;4.22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is a very unpromising set of studies of parental involvement for children in transition between school phases. On balance, they provide no sound basis for claiming the success of all-age interventions to increase parental involvement. The largest study in this group by some way (445+ cases) reported no difference in outcomes between the parental intervention treatment group and the others.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Messages for funders&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the absence of high quality evaluations encountered in this review, the first task of funders must be to remedy the situation. This can be done by calling for new primary research with specific characteristics, and ceasing to fund mere associational or supposedly explanatory work in this area. The new research should be a fair test of whether the most promising approaches to enhancing parental involvement actually work in the sense of cost-effectively improving children’s subsequent attainment. The research should involve several studies, both direct replications and of differing age groups, based in real-world settings. The design for each should be either a simple randomised comparison of a treatment and control group, or of an allocation using regression discontinuity. There should be around 1,000 pupils or more in each study, with very low attrition, perhaps through using a waiting-list design or other incentive to reduce post-allocation demoralisation, followed by an intention to treat analysis. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The procedures of the intervention and its evaluation should ideally be ‘blinded’ as far as possible, and for many steps this is simple (for example, by conducting the pre-test for all cases before randomisation). The evaluation must be conducted by individuals with no concern for whether the intervention works or not, but concern only for finding out. The outcome measure used, such as a test of student learning, must be standardised, independent of the innovators of the intervention, and have real-world meaning (such as a link to Key Stage results). The intervention itself should be as simple as possible, not mixing parental involvement with any other elements of change or intervention (and applied only to the treatment group). After the intervention has been completed for one large group but not the other, both groups should be assessed or measured for the single pre-specified outcome that the intervention was intended to improve. The result should be based on a simple comparison of the outcomes or gain scores for each group.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This advice is quite generic, and will apply to other topic areas as well, but it is necessary because of the very low level of quality found, even among the best evaluations. The level of work encountered is so far from that needed to answer relevant questions for public policy that even adopting these rather basic recommendations would lead to a considerable improvement. &#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; More generally, funders need to ensure that programmes and fields of research make suitable progress, or cease funding them. Research must work towards answers. This means that exploratory work is perfectly proper, but that when the results show promise the researchers must continue to developmental work, leading eventually to a fully-fledged trial. Good ideas must be pursued to a gainful end in this way and poor ideas discarded. Currently too much work is mired in a repetitive phase of exploration without progress. This is an unethical use of taxpayer and charitable funding.&#xa0;Messages for researchers&#xa0;5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To a large extent the implications for researchers follow those for funders. In this area, as in so many others, researchers must wake up to their ethical responsibilities to the public and to research funding bodies. They must see their work as part of an ongoing and larger research cycle working towards an evaluation (of what works, a theory, or an artefact such as curriculum materials). They must ensure that promising work moves to a trial or other suitably rigorous evaluation phase, and that unpromising work ceases. If they do not progress from exploration to development to trial then they must report that their early work is unpromising, so as to discourage wasteful investment of time and money by others. Finding out what does not work is therefore, almost, as valuable as finding what works.&#xa0;5.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Researchers must be independent of the interventions they are evaluating, and they must commission genuinely independent evaluations of any interventions they are developing.  They must care far more about getting the correct answer to their research questions than about what that answer actually is. Almost as importantly, they must be more careful in describing and badging the kind of work they are currently conducting. They must eschew causal terms like ‘impact’ or ‘influence’ except where their research designs permit or where the use is clearly speculative. &#xa0;5.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some of the generic problems with evaluation studies are quite alarming, and are nothing to do with those compromises sometimes necessary because of limited time, resources or data. Researchers are frequently quoting statistical significance and p-values with non-random samples not randomly allocated to groups, and this is as prevalent in supposedly peer-reviewed articles as in unpublished reports. And they are using the ‘significance’ levels to try and decide whether an intervention has been effective or not. This is a widespread error, based on ignorance of sampling theory, and it simply must cease. Researchers are also frequently presenting such analyses based on individual cases when they have allocated cases to treatment groups by classes, or even when there has been no allocation at all (such as when a matched comparator is created post hoc). A slightly less widespread but still important and dangerous problem is dredging for success. Many reports, even the better ones, are poorly written in the sense that they are vague or incomplete about basic facts such as numbers of cases, how they were selected and allocated and how much dropout or refusal there was. This may be carelessness. But some reports describe wider studies and several possible outcomes but only present the findings for outcomes that are deemed positive or desirable. This goes far beyond the possible file-drawer problem of unpublished negative findings. Authors themselves seem to want to bias the evidence base by cherry-picking their own results before publication. Nothing will improve until such frankly shoddy practices are prevented. This is a challenge for capacity-building, and one that is unaddressed by high profile programmes such as the UK ‘Quantitative Methods Initiative’ (which are mostly trying to widen the existing invalid practices in this area).

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In some instances, the lack of efficacy of these interventions may have had more to do with the recruitment and retention of participants than the intervention itself. An intervention to involve parents more, by definition, can only work if the parents wish to be involved. In fact, this difference in motivation could be the reason for the widely noted association between parental engagement and child attainment in the first place. Perhaps interventions will never be successful with the unwilling. Potential barriers to enhanced parental involvement include issues with parent work schedule and lifestyle, lack of confidence in communicating with school, language, health problems, embarrassment about their own education, negative learner identities, inconsistent enthusiasm of teachers for the process, and a general lack of interest among some parents. &#xa0;Messages for users&#xa0;5.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For users such as policy-makers and practitioners, the key message from this review is that although increasing parental involvement sounds plausible, there is no solid evidence base for intervention yet, in most age groups and for most approaches. Where they are compared with parental involvement interventions, classroom interventions to achieve the same end currently have more evidence of effectiveness in raising attainment. &#xa0;5.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The most promising phase is pre-school and preparation for primary school. The most effective programme in this review, with long term results, and based on some of the best evaluations, mixes parental involvement with an array of other intervention elements. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the parental involvement element has been effective. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this programme is based on providing institutional support for parents and bringing them into the care centres and early classrooms. It is not a home-based intervention. In fact, overall, the impression from the review is that interventions are most likely to succeed when they are aimed at young children, and involve parents and staff meeting regularly in an institution, with parental training, on-going support, and co-operative working with teachers. &#xa0;5.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is very little evidence of promise from evaluations of parental interventions for children of later primary age, secondary age or across phases of schooling. Practical interventions here can be safely abandoned for the present, where the concern is chiefly with academic outcomes. Some specific kinds of intervention also have so little evidence of promise that they can be abandoned safely (if the concern is chiefly with academic outcomes). These include parents working on computers with their children. The remaining approaches can be classified into a number of broad groups. Simple parental participation in school events, like parents-teachers’ evening, or parents-teachers associations, cake sales and other fund-raising events, is untested. There is no reason to believe such behaviour will influence attainment for disadvantaged children. Programmes that merely encourage parents to work with their children at home (i.e. without direct support or skills training), or seek to improve parent:child relationships appear to be ineffective. If neither the parent nor the child knows how to improve a skill like reading comprehension then mere aspiration or motivation is not going to help. Effective parental engagement is not just about getting parents to be interested in their children’s education or to help them with their school work. Many parents from all socio-economic backgrounds are already routinely helping with their children’s school work, with low income families just as likely to be involved as those from higher income homes. And such involvement does not significantly affect children’s performance. So, merely increasing parental involvement is not the answer in itself.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
