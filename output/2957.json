"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the RSPB The RSPB welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the \nEnvironmental Audit \nCommittee inquiry into \nbiodiversity offsetting. \nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK National Ecosystem Assessment provides a comprehensive \naccount of how the natural environment and its biodiversity provide us with services that are critical to our wellbeing and economic prosperity\n. \nDespite this, biodiversity \nis being continually eroded and fragmented by inappropriate development\n. T\nhe \nplanning system does not adequately guard against biodiversity loss; the mitigation hierarchy is inconsistently applied\n,\n and where compensation does take place it is often inadequate and short-lived. \n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the same time, there is an acute s\nocial need for mor\ne housing, alongside\n better infrastructure for business\n. Despite this,\n the planning system is\n often\n slow and cumbersome. It is, therefore, only right that Government explores ways in which to make the planning system more fit for purpose, so that it can de\nliver truly sustainable development. \nThe\nre is undoubtedly potential\n for \na new\n system \nthat could take\n a\n systematic account of the value \nof\n nature, \nsave money for business, and\n increase speed in\n a simpler\n planning system\n. \n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, the Government’s preferred\n options raise a series of \nsignificant concerns that\n will need to be addressed before a\nny new\n system is established.  \nIn particular, o\nffsetting must only be established as part of a coherent strengthening of the mitigation hierarchy; it must be supported b\ny real, independent ecological expertise at a local level; it must be applied uniformly across developments; and it must be underpinned by a long-term financial and legal framework for monitoring, reporting and implementation. If this can be achieved, biod\niv\nersity offsetting can deliver\n potential benefits for econo\nmy, society and environment. Conversely,\n if \nt\nhese issues cannot be addressed, biodiversity offsetting \nrisks serious damage to our natural environment.\nThe mitigation hierarchy 4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecreating complex \nnatural processes is inherently difficult and full of risk. Essentially, you are guaranteeing ecological loss in return for uncertain gains.\n Even if the offset is successful, in many cases there will be a temporal loss of biodiversity that can never be ret\nrieved.\n As such, in-situ conservation is always preferable. \n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat offsetting biodiversity loss is incredibly difficult is evidenced \nby the fact that there are no systems in the world that have been able to demonstrate no net loss of biodiversity, and t\nhe w\nealth of studies showing (often considerable) net-\n losses\n. \nIndeed, we would seriously \nquestion the repeated statements in the Impact Assessment\n,\n that offsetting wil\nl ‘improve biodiversity’, given the \nabsence of any evidence to support this statement.  \n \n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is because of the uncertainty and risk associated with offsetting that the mitigation hierarchy must be adhered to\n, as required by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)\n. O\nffse\ntting should\n only ever\n be\n undertaken when a development is absolutely \nnecessary, and all attempts to avoid harm or mitigate it have been exhausted. \nWe welcome the statements in the Green Paper that the mitigation hierarchy is adhered to, but this assertion is undermined and contradicted by the explicit desire for offsetting \nto free up more land on site for development (because mitigation will no longer be necessary). This is a blatant\n disregard of\n the mitigation hierarchy\n,\n to which we strongly object.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would consider \nthe failure of LPAs to avoid and mitigate harm from devel\nopment to be a far more serious problem for biodiversity than the poor implementation of any necessary compensation. This is largely due to a culture of not va\nluing biodiversity and not giving\n due weight to policies concerned with biodiversity – a point su\npported by Defra commissioned research into the implementation of PPS9\n. \nGovernment must\n ensure that LPAs and the Planning Inspectorate give appropriate weight to biodiversity policies, just as they do to, for example, housing policies. \n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLPAs need better g\nuidance on how to avoid and mitigate harm, and it is crucial that a single guidance document is published on every aspect of the mitigation hierarchy. This must contain very clear guidance on how to assess harm, avoid harm, mitigate harm, and finally – off\nse\nt \nharm\n. \nEcological expertise within planning authorities  9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe metric applied to offsetting is merely a simple articulation of what will often be a complex decision. \nIt takes significant ecological expertise to be able to assess the ‘value’ of a site an\nd to understand how, or if, its loss can be compensated.\n Such an exercise will necessarily requi\nre a degree of judgement, and while it is the responsibility of the developer to provide the initial assessment, \nthe LPA cannot fulfil its role as a competent d\necision-maker if it is unable to verify the information. \n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe world of land use planning is highly contested by a myriad of different interests, and the integrity of the planning system depends on independent arbitration. Moreover, the public’s faith in th\ne \nsystem\n depends on independent arbitration. The decision to approve an \napplication may hinge on matters relating to biodiversity and it would be unacceptable for a LPA to have to sim\nply accept the developer’s recommendation on offsetting – even if the rep\nort is written by an ‘accredited’ expert. \nAccredited or otherwise, a consultant is ultimately being paid\n by a developer\n -\n \nwho will have\n a clear vested interest in obtaining planning permission.\n \nWe would strongly recommend a system of accreditation but this cannot be a substitute for LPA ecological expertise. Many planning consultants are ‘accredited’ by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), but no-one would seriously suggest \nthat this negates\n the need for local authority planning officers. It is equally unacceptable for LPAs not to have any ecological expertise, simply because consultants are accredited. \n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the potential benefits of an\n offsetting system would be\n the strategic choice of of\nfs\net type and location, involving\n the replacement of lower value habitat with higher value habitats\n (higher value habitats should generally be replaced like for like)\n. While certain habitats are of national importance (and this needs to be reflected in any\n metric\ns), ‘value’ will vary according to local\n ecological\n context. \nEcological expertise\n is therefore needed \nto ensure that local metric\ns reflect local value, and strategic plans maximise opportunities for enhancing the local ecological network with offset\ns. \n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the critical importance of local authority ecological expertise in both reducing risk and maximising potential benefits associated with offsets, it is highly alarming that less t\nh\nan 30% \nof local authorities have any ecological expertise. \nAll loca\nl authorities must have ready access to independent ecological expertise before a biodiversity offsetting system can be reliably implemented.\n \n  \nThe importance of a mandatory system13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLargely because it is \nrequired as part of an environmental impact assessme\nnt (EIA), there will generally be an explicit process of assessing the potential impacts of a major planning application on bi\nodiversity. However, for applications\n that\n are \neither \noutside of protected areas\n or\n \nthat \nfail to meet the required threshold for a\nn EIA, \nbiodiversity is infrequently considered and assessments of potential harm are often poor\n. \nThis is a major factor in\n the alarming losses of wildlife \noutside of protected areas. Losses of biodiversity and the fragmentation of habitats outside of \nprotected areas\n,\n also have a significant negative impact on our protected area network\n. \n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe share the Government’s desire for a faster and simpler planning system that brings forward the sustainable development that society needs. A faster system depends \non increased simplicity, and the system will only become simpler for all users\n,\n if all users are using the same system. It is very difficult to reconcile the Government’s contradictory desire for a \nsimple system, and \nfor developers to be able to opt out an\nd use a different system. A new method will only make the planning system simpler if everyone in the planning\n system uses it.\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNor will a scheme deliver effective protection for biodiversity if a threshold is applied below which developers will not be requi\nred to participate. \nA\n standard and explicit system for assessing potential harm to biodiversity would\n \n only bring margin\nal conservation benefits if solely\n applied to major developments; whereas there would be significant benefits if\n it was\n applied to all n\new housing development, new commercial buildings and to large commercial extensions. \nWe recognise that direct participation in an offsetting scheme may be prohibitively expensive for some of the smallest developers—in such cases, it may be possible to impl\nement a form of the Community Infrastructure Levy, where businesses \nwould pay a levy to the local planning authority which would then strategically offset any unavoidable damage associated with the development.\nMetrics16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere must be a consistent framework \nfor local authorities to produce their own metrics within an offsetting supplementary planning document. This is because the value of a habitat may vary depending on context. For example, woodland may be\n extremely\n rare in an urban authority and this would \nneed to be reflected in \nthe ‘score’\n used\n to express its value.\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere must also be national guidelines that set minimum scores for\n nationally important\n priority habitats and species\n, so that, for example, a local authority in Dorset could not set a low sco\nre for \nnationally rare \nhe\nathland\n,\n on the basis that it is\n not considered rare in that district. \n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\npecies should \nalso \nbe included in\n any future\n metric\ns, and this needs to be accompanied by much better data on general populations, so that the value of a loca\nl population can be determined. Storing all data collected as part of a new standardised system, both for existing/ lost sites and for offsetting sites, could be hugely beneficial in this regard. This data should be stored nationally by Natural England, vi\na LPAs. \nProtection and management of offset sites 19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor offsetting to stand any chance of\n avoiding net losses,\n \nsites must be protected and managed \nover ecologically relevant timeframes. \n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNatural processes require\n very l\narge areas of natural land that are \nseldom found in England\n. Unfortunately, this renders most habitats in need of continual management and this would be the case for most offset sites, thus making ongoing management an additional cost\n \non top of the upfront costs \nassociated with creating the \nhabitat\n. \n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nManagement costs must be secured \ni\nf the offset site is to stand any chance of avoiding a net-loss of biodiversity.\n A recent example from Scotland\n, involving a European protected site and Scottish Coal, highlights the dangers: Scottish Coal were g\nranted permission to mine,\n on the condition that \nthey restore the site after use, only for Scottish coal to then declare\n bankrupt\ncy.\n \n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to overcome the danger of either the developer or the offset provider ceasing to operate (there is a danger this \ncould be premeditated) it is critically important that monies are collected prior to the commencement of development and this money is paid into a trust fund. \nWe recommend\n that this trust fund is operated by one of \nDefra’s\n agencies – preferably Natural \nEng\nland. This would enable additional oversight and the ability to withhold funds if the offset provider was not meeting the conditions of their agreement. \nClear responsibility and the ability to enforce23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithout clear legal and financial arrangements in place at the outset, there is no guarantee that an offsetting provision would be reliable. \nThere must be a robust legal agreement that sets out clear responsibility for the implementation and management of \nan offset. \nCritically, this has to enable enforcement to be taken against a specified party at any time\n,\n for the duration of the agreement. \nIn particular, i\nt must also be possible to take punitive action against a third-party that \nfails to fulfil its obligations. \nAs such, it is\n inconceivable that a third-party would not be bound by a legal agreement at the planning stage, as the delivery of the offset is integral to the decision to grant planning permission. It is, therefore, alarmi\nng that the Green Paper suggests\n that provision of an offset by a third-party could avoid the need for detailed requirements\n regarding compensatory measures in s106 or similar agreements. You cannot grant planning permission, subject to a legal agreement,\n if the legal agreement does not secure all\n of\n the measures necessary to make the development acceptable. \n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf the granting of planning permission is dependent on satisfactory offsetting,\n there must\n also\n be a clear legal responsibility on the competent auth\nority to enforce the offset for the duration of the agreement, with this being the LPA in most cases. \nHowever, \nit may be advantageous from a conservation perspective for the offsetting to\n take\n place outside of the local authority where the development take\ns place\n and permission is\n granted\n.\n \nClarification would be\n needed \nas to how enforcement action could\n be taken \nin such circumstances, if, for example, a management agreement was not being adhered to. \n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, if \ncommuted sums are \ntaken\n by LPAs\n for small\ner developments (to enable cumulative funding for strategic offsetting)\n in lieu of any offset \nprov\nision, the monies must be \nring-fenced\n and used for conservation\n, and there must be a robust legal agreement in place with the subsequent offset provider\n -\n tha\nt \ncan\n be enforced through a civil mechanism. \nEnsuring additionality 26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAny offsetting provision must be additional to any existing statutory or policy obligations. For example, this means that it would not be acceptable for aftercare from a minerals site (t\nhat was a conditi\non of the permission) to be used to offset harm fr\nom another development, as the aftercare\n was necessary to offset the harm from the mineral extraction. However, the aftercare agreement would typically be time limited, and \nin some circumst\nances \nwe would be comfortable for the site to be sold as an offset once the planning obligation had expired, \nif\n this would secure additional funding \nnecessary \nto manage the site. \nLikewise, it would be unacceptable for Government to \ngenerate funds needed to \nfulfil its existing obligations for managing protected sites\n through offsetting\n. Neither would it be acceptable to use \nagri\n-environment funded work to offset harm elsewhere, during the timeframe of the agreement. The integrity of t\nhe system depends on \nadditionality\n and without \nadditionality\n we will end up with severe net-losses of biodiversity. \n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also important to avoid offset provision being ‘double-sold’. This will require a central register, preferabl\ny\n maintained by Natural \nEngland,\n \nthat holds details of all offset provision. \nMonitoring28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the main benefits of introducing a standard system is that it enables effective monitoring\n and analysis\n of net changes. This means that Natural England should be requi\nred to collect th\ne data\n of the\n initial assessment of the s\nite, in order to understand what has been lost\n. There must also be a legal agreement as part of the planning consent that requires the submission of monitoring reports of the offset to the LPA\n. These should also be \nstandardised so that the assessments of the site follows the same criteria as those used when deciding whether or not to offset. This data should in turn be submitted to Natural England. Understanding changes in the extent of different habitats will also b\ne necessary to inform the revisi\non of criteria for valuing habitats, as value may change according to changes in extent\n.\nOffset type and location 29.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHigh value habitats must be protected accordingly. T\nhis means that permission \nshould only be granted on sites\n that have a high ‘score’ in exceptional circumstances. The bar for what constitutes necessary development should rise commensurate with the score - and the likelihood of granting permission should decrease. \nFurthermore, i\nf a high value habitat is lost, we\n would expect that habitat to be replaced like-for-like, wherever possible. \n30.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\nor sites with lower scores \n(\nespecially smaller sites\n), offsetting with a higher value habitat in a strategic location could lead to significant ecological gains. \nIn order to maxi\nmise this potential, neighbouring LPAs should work with each other and with their Local Nature Partnerships\n, to identify strategic locations where cumulative offsetting could do most to improve ecological connectivity and deliver landscape-scale conservat\nion. This strategy should then be embedded in the LPAs SPD for offsetting.\n31.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nHowever, while strategically locating offsets has the potential to deliver ecological gains, distancing communities \nfrom biodiversity can also incur\n a social cost.\n \n \nFor instance, t\naking a small wildlife reserve from an ecologically deprived location could have a significantly negative impact on that community’s quality of life.  LPAs will need to carefully balance the needs of people and wildlife, and these trade-offs should be expl\nicitly addressed when \nplanning for the strategic implementation of offsets. \n&#xa0;\n16 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n Watson and \nAlbon\n, 2011, The UK National Ecosystem Assessment: Synthesis of Key Findings\n \nO\nver 40% of \nEngland’s priority species, 30% of priority habitats\n and 30% of ecosystem services are still declining\n, while eight priority species were lost entirely between 2002 and 2008\n.\n \nMerono-Mateus\n et al (2012) Structural and functional loss in restored wetlan\nd ecosystems, \nPLOS Biology\n; \nBenDor\n (2009) A dynamic analysis of wetland mitigation process and its effects on no net loss policy,\n Landscape Urban Planning\n ; \nHossler\n et al(2011) No net loss for nutrient function in salt marshes\n, \nEcosphere\n;\n \nBull et al (2013) Biodiversity offsets in theory and practice, \nOryx\n; \nSuding\n (2011) Towards restoration in ecology: success, failure, and opportunities ahead, \nAnnual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systems;\n \nGibbons (2010) The case for biodiversity offsets,\n \nDecision Point\n.
