&#xa0;Written evidence from Bikebiz Magazine (CYS 065)&#xa0;CYCLE SAFETY: HoC Library Briefing Document on Vehicle Excise Duty&#xa0;Could members of the transport select committee please read ˜Roads: vehicle excise duty (VED) - Commons Library Standard Note”. This gives the history of vehicle excise duty and confirms that “road tax” does not exist and has not existed since 1937.&#xa0;Some motorists use the belief in this long-dead tax to bully and intimidate cyclists, both verbally and physically and use of the phrase by MPs shows ignorance of Britain’s tax system and how roads are funded.&#xa0;If MPs wish to call VED by an easily understood term, use car tax, as VED is a tax on cars and other vehicles, not a tax on roads or a fee to use them.&#xa0;Motorists do not pay directly for the roads. Roads are paid for via general and local taxation. In 1926, Winston Churchill started the process to abolish road tax. It was finally culled in 1937.&#xa0;Car tax is based on amount of CO2 emitted so, if a fee had to be paid, cyclists - who are sometimes branded as 'tax dodgers' by some motorists - would pay the same as 'tax-dodgers' such as disabled drivers, police cars, the Royal family, and band A motorists, ie Â£0.&#xa0;Most cyclists are also car-owners, too, so pay VED.&#xa0;HoC Library Document: http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN01482&#xa0;Ironically named campaign website: http://ipayroadtax.com&#xa0;BBC article on use of “road tax” as a bullying tactic against cyclists: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23694438&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
