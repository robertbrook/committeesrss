inspire the nation to choose cricket. \n&#xa0;\nOur responsibility is to promote and develop the game at all levels and in recent years we h\nave invested a great deal of expertise and resource into modernising our structures to ensure that we can effectively support and develop cricket at all levels of the game, including women’s and girls’ cricket.\n&#xa0;\nSixteen years ago the ECB took over responsi\nbility from the Women’s Cricket Association as the National Governing Body for women and girls cricket \nIn this time we have made tremendous progress in growing and promoting the women’s and girls’ game at all levels. \n \nWomen’s and girls’ cricket is more or\nganised, better funded and has wider exposure than ever before with more people participating not only as players but in many different roles – including coaching, umpiring and volunteering.\nOne of the most significant achievements is that women’s cricket \nis now fully integrated within the ECB, from international level to development programmes\n.  T\nhe women’s game sits inside the same structures with the same reporting lines.  It is completely embedded in the or\nganisational\n structure and has become an integr\nal part of the cricket family within the ECB’s Cricket Partnerships and \nEngland Cricket Departments\n. \nAt present there are two women on ECB’s main Board\n: \nformer Chief Constable Jane Stichbury who is an Independent Director providing strategic support to ou\nr anti-corruption unit and Baroness Rachel Heyhoe-Flint\n OBE DL\n, a former high profile England International and Women’s Cricket representative who has championed the women’s game for many years.\nAs with the \nmen’s \ngame, the vast majority of our investment i\ns focused into developing grassroots opportunities, developing player pathways and top-class support structures for elite players. \n \nThis approach ensures we have a “product” from the elite end to the very grassroots which is compelling, competitive and sus\ntainable.\nOn the international stage, ECB investment and on-going commitment has seen the England Women’s team secure continued success including lifting the ICC World Cup in Sydney in 2009, retaining their number \none\n \nworld ranking from 2009 to 2013 and this summer beating Australia to regain the Ashes – and win the inaugural multi-format Women’s Ashes Series (which comprised one Test match, \nthree\n \nNatWest \nODIs and \nthree\n \nNatWest \nT20s). \nAt the grassroots level\n, \nthe last \nten years has seen a 507% increase in the number of cricket clubs with a Women’s and/or a \ng\nirl’s section (from 93 to 565). \n \nWe have had huge success in attracting young girls to the sport and we have exciting plans to retain a greater percentage of them th\nrough their teenage years and into adulthood and ultimately, for those with the ability, into a clearly defined and maturing talent pathway.\nNot only has ECB made women’s cricket part of its core business so too have the 39 County Cricket Boards (CCBs). \n \nT\nhe CCBs are the game’s local delivery network and with support and investment from both ECB and Sport England in recent years the women’s game is now central to their strategic plans\nThere remains a significant challenge to secure wider media coverage and commercial value for \nw\nomen’s \nc\nricket. \n \nThe ECB will continue to pioneer new formats and invest directly to achieve these aims, building on the success we have had already in promotion\nal activity including “double headers” where \ninternational w\nomen’s Twenty20 fixtures are played immediately before the men’s match, \ninvesting \nin broadcasts of non-televised matches on YouTube and creating a new \npoints based multi-\nformat \ns\neries \nto widen and\n sustain interest \nthroughout the summer\n.\nIn this submission we highlight some of the successes to date, some of the challenges we face and set out how we are committed to ensuring that women’s cricket continues to thrive and provide women and girls with \noutstanding opportunities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChildren should be introduced to physical activity opportunities (physical literacy) at an early age as part of their personal and emotional developme\nnt and then in time to competitive sport. It is vital that this development process is driven within the school system. \n \nWe believe that young girls should be given the same opportunities to play and try sport without any stigma that the sport is only ‘for\n boys’.\n&#xa0;\nOur priority is to ensure delivery of as many opportunities as possible for girls to develop a lasting interest in cricket and continue to play the sport for years to come.  \nTo deliver this the ECB has invested millions of pounds over the last fe\nw years into partnerships with other cricket bodies and the private sector to build programmes that help \ngrow \ncricket in schools, especially state schools\n,\n and make full use of the facilities they offer. \nEach partnership programme offers a fantastic oppor\ntunity for girls to participate in cricket from a young age either through offering\n both mixed sessions and/or specific courses for girls. \n2.1\n              \nAsda Kwik Cricket\nThe ECB’s flagship grassroots schools initiative is Kwik \nCricket\n,\n in its 8\nth\n year of sponsorship\n with Asda\n.\n \n It provides children at primary school a fun, inclusive, fast-paced introduction to the game of cricket\n \nand offers both mixed sessions along with a programme designed specifically for girls\n. \nThe current competition boasts \nparticipation figures of 140,000 with over 50% of all primary schools entering the competition.\n \n \nThe girls\n’\n only programme had over 30,000 girls \nplay \nin 2013, a 38% increase from 2012.\nThe main aim of the competition is to inspire children to play cricket \nthrough the means of a national competition framework delivered by our 39\n CCBs\n. \n \nThe \nprogramme provides\n teachers \nwith a range of resources\n \nincluding skills \ndemonstrations, \nideas to play the game, an interactive web site, equipment and resources\n \nand\n \ncertificates and badges.\n2.2\n              \nChance to Shine\nThe Chance to \nShine\n programme is run by the Cricket Foundation \ncharity and is currently in its 8\nth\n year of delivery and is part funded by the ECB.\n \n It has delivered cricket lessons to over \ntwo\n \nmillion children in \n7,000\n schools across the UK.\n \n The aim of the programme is to reintroduce cricket into state schools and use cricket as a tool for the wider developmental issues like behaviour, attainment, team work and life skills \nand\n \nvalues.\nChance to\n Shine supports the wider development of girls and cricket by working in partnership with the ECB to place girl’s cricket development at the forefront of every project. \n \nThere are approximately 160,000 girls playing cricket in school annually through the C\nhance to \nShine\n programme\n \nand it will reach the one millionth girl to have gone through the programme during this school term\n. The programme will continue to expand its reach into both Primary and Secondary Schools (with a new focus on 14-16 year olds based\n on Sport England funding) offering more girls the chance to receive high quality coaching and the ECB will be looking to increase the numbers entering the club network on the back of this. \nThe project has partnerships with 1,004 local cricket clubs, and \nqualified cricket coaches provide coaching and competition to local primary and secondary schools.\n&#xa0;\n \nOf those children going on to join a local club, 31% of these were girls. \nSeven members of the current England’s Women Cricket Team, including the captain \nCharlotte Edwards\n MBE\n, are employed by the Cricket Foundation as Chance to Shine Coaching Ambassadors and have made an enormous impact as positive role models in schools and clubs.\n&#xa0;\n The Ambassador programme has been running since 2008 and so far 11 England\n Women have worked inside both schools and community programmes. 15,000 school girls were coached by the seven England Women ambassadors last year.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.3\n              \nLady \nTaverners\nECB have benefitted from a \nten\n \nyear relationship with the Lady Taverners, a funding arm to the Lord\n’\ns Taverners,\n to promote the participation of teenage girls playing cricket in education and at cricket clubs\n. Since its inception the outcomes of the girls\n’\n only programme has: \nIn 2013, the indoor competition had entries of 1500 teams (a 32% increase on 2012) from the U13 and U15 age groups; whilst the club competition had circa 400 entries from a variety of soft and hard ball formats ranging from U11 to U15. \n \nThe co\nmpetition has engaged with over 110\n,\n000 girls since its introduction in 2003.The competition is administered centrally by ECB but supported locally by 39 CC\nBs\n and provides girls with the opportunity to play regular cricket at a local level and progress thr\nough to County, Regional and National Finals. \n \nThe National \nschools \ncompetition culminates in a Final held in the indoor school at Lord\n’\ns every May.\n2.4\n              \nFuture School \nSport \nFunding\nECB welcomes the additional funding from DfE and support from DCMS into school sport and the commitment that this will be ring-fenced and reviewed by Ofsted. It is vital that the school sports programme, including the national curriculum, underpin school s\nport provision. \n \nThe scale of the school system is far too big for any NGB to cover the entire infrastructure and training that is required. \n&#xa0;\nIf we are to tackle the decline in some areas of sport and physical activity and deliver the wider social benefit\ns sports brings there has to be more focus on this activity at school, particularly for young girls who play less sport than boys. \n \nWe are aware that 24% of girls aged 2-15 don’t do enough physical exercise yet 74% would do more if the offers to them were \nmore suitable. \n&#xa0;\nWhatever the positives or the negatives of the previous system, it did provide NGB’s with support and strategic assistance to help us to effectively assist school sport so that our engagement offers greater economies of scale and return on\n investment.\n&#xa0;\nOrganisations that can provide specialist coaching and training such as NGBs require support and advice on how to access schools which do not currently run any cricket programmes or training. \n \nThe Youth Sport Trust has a tremendous network bu\nt there are thousands of schools still not being given the chance to draw upon our resources. \n \nThere needs to be a one stop shop at a county level, such as County Sport Partnerships, to have the necessary resources and expertise to help identify demand and\n where needed help co-ordinate delivery.\n&#xa0;ECB’s strategic plan for the development of grassroots cricket is mapped out in our Whole Sport Plan, a partnership arrangement with Sp\nort England. The development of \nwomen’s \ncricket is integral to this plan and a key priority for the ECB. Whole Sport Plans have transformed the way Cricket approaches its delivery both nationally and at local level. Stability in the sector is crucial to al\nlow sports to deliver the agreed \np\nlans with Sport England to \nachieve \nthe current long-term targets.\n &#xa0;\nOur key focus is on:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWomen’s Club Cricket has seen considerable growth over the last ten years. P\nreviously 90 ECB\n \naffiliated clubs had \na \nw\nomen’s\n and/\n \nor \ng\nirl’s sections\n and by \n2012 \nthis had increased to \n565:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur ambition is to ensure the game maintains this level of growth and as such we are in the process of putting together a new strategy which will see the women’s cricket \nembedded\n across our C\nCB \nnetwork to sustain and grow our network of clubs and increase the level of participation. \n&#xa0;\nEach of our 39 County Cricket Boards now \nhas a\n \nperformance pathway in place that provide\ns\n opportunities for girls and women to compete in county cricket.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2012 t\nhe ECB also introduced a new women’s club competition structure in which the pinnacle of club cricket was expanded to increase the number of top level clubs, and other leagues link to the linear structure. Counties are now investing in running and developi\nng their own junior and senior leagues to meet demand. Leagues are run throughout the week or at weekends\n.  \n3.1\n              \nCoaches\n \nThe number of female coaches has grown from 556 in 2003 to 2,756 in 2013.\nEight CCBs are involved in project 500,\n a County Sport Partnership / UK Sport project which is working with 5 NGB’s to develop programmes and opportunities for female coaches in their sports. The ECB will develop this programme nationally and roll it across our CCB network.\nECB are in the proce\nss of developing new courses\n and resources\n to \nfurther \nimprove \ncoaches’ \nsoft skills to \nhelp them \nengage \nmore \neffectively with women and girls.\n3.2\n              \nOfficials\n \nAs part of our integrated approach the ECB is committed to offering opportunities\n to women\n across a\nll sections of the game including offering and providing training to \nthose \nwho want to become umpires and scorers\n within a membership arm called the ECB ACO (Association of Cricket Officials). \nSeveral counties have begun to provide female only courses in support of the growth of female umpires. \n \nFurther steps have been taken to source female official role models from the success of the England Women’s teams. \n \n \nActive promotion of female official\ns is one of the main priorities for the ECB ACO and recent work has been undertaken to identify and remove the key barriers to females following the officials’ pathway through to all levels of the game. \nFemale umpires are becoming more prominent\n – within \nthe last few years female umpires have been appointed to umpire both Minor Counties and County Second Eleven cricket and further examples exist in Premier \nLeagues\n. \nLate in 2012 ECB ACO launched a national initiative to develop and engage more females in u\nmpiring.  Having established a robust pathway for all umpires to follow, it is now open to all umpires of the appropriate ability, irrespective of gender and race, to attain appointments at all levels of the game. \n \nThis includes developing Umpires at the v\nery highest level of the game and ECB is about to launch an inclusive scheme to provide top level female umpires with opportunities to demonstrate their umpiring ability and to progress towards involvement in the professional game.\nThere are currently fema\nle scorers involved at all levels of the game (including international level)\n, and the intention is to mirror this in the umpiring arena\n.\n&#xa0;\nCase Study – female umpires in the Northumberland Cricket League In 2011 \nOfficials Gillian Woodley and Sarah Lee have\n become the first two women to take charge of a match in one of the North’s top leagues\n.\n Gillian is a fully qualified umpire having attained her Level Two \nqualification \nlast year. Sarah previously scored for Blyth Second XI and this is her second season um\npiring, after passing her Level One from the English Cricket Board’s Association of Cricket Officials.\nGillian, from Gosforth, Newcastle, said: “I admit I once hated the sport but I was becoming a cricket widow because my husband loves it. I had to grow to\n like it just to see him at weekends. \n \n \nI started as a scorer and got hooked so I decided to get my qualifications at the same time as Peter. It’s a fascinating sport and I love it now. I think I’ve gained respect from the men players.\n \n It was difficult at first when I did my first matches four years ago because I think some men found it hard to accept decisions from a woman. \n \nBut I think now I’ve shown I can do it and it’s something I very much enjoy.\n \n It would be lovely to see more wom\nen doing it. There’s a great team spirit among the umpires, but it’s always nice to see a few women walking out there.”\nSarah, from Blyth, Northumberland, is studying A-levels at Newcastle College but spends her weekends \nat cricket matches\n across the county.\n  \nShe first attended a cricket match aged just three months with her dad, a keen player.\n(Case study used from the local paper – the Chronicle live) \n3.3\n              \nCapital Investment into Facilities\nThrough the last Sport England funding period the ECB have targeted women’s and girls’ participation through capital investment – identifying where access to facilities are barriers and require investment to increase participation. Over the 4 year period t\nhe ECB invested £5.4m to specifically support women and girls cricket. This totalled 57 awards across approximately 26 projects with the majority of these going to our recreational clubs. Supporting this capital investment, first class counties and clubs e\nnsured revenue funding was aligned to support growth in women’s cricket. \nInitial statistics have seen increases in participation across the awards with a 72% increase amongst 5 – 15 year olds and 40% increase in participation of 16 – 24 year olds. \nIn add\nition to this targeted funding, other revenue and capital investment is made available to support club programmes and the wider network to support women and girls cricket and clubs within England and Wales.\n3.4\n              \nProtection of Local Authority and School pitc\nhes\nIn order for Women and Girls’ participation to continue to grow they must have access to decent local facilities and pitches. \n \nOver 40% of cricket is played on local authority pitches and Central Government must make sure that local leisure provision i\ns a key \ncriterion \nby which local authorities are held to account for their spending by the Department for Communities and Local Government. \n \nAs sport is not a statutory service it too often a soft option for cuts. \n&#xa0;\nECB welcomed the enhanced protections ou\ntlined in the Government’s National Planning Policy framework but remains very concerned at the on-going threat to the infrastructure of pitches and facilities available to sports within the local authority framework which is under extreme budgetary pressu\nres. \n \nPlaying fields are also under threat from developers on certain sites such as Civil Service grounds.\n&#xa0;\nGreater effort needs to go into provision of pitches and facilities. \n \nWhether these are maintained by local authorities, volunteer groups or cricket\n clubs on-going support needs to be given to addressing the poor state of pitches and increasing quality standards.\n&#xa0;\nRecently all of the major pitch sports have jointly with Sport England, revised the planning model for local authority playing pitch strate\ngies.\n \n Through this model all pitch sports have committed to collaborating and working with Local Authorities on the strategic provision of sport. \n \nSupply, demand, disposal and quality are all measured through this process.\n4.              International and Elite programme development and facilities  For many years there were envious glances from all UK NGBs to the facilities and research centres and programmes in other countries. Cricket was no\n&#xa0;\ndifferent. \n \nCricket Australia's centre of exc\nellence was always seen as the benchmark in this regard. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, in 2003 the National Cricket Performance\n&#xa0;\nCentre at\n \nLoughborough\n&#xa0;\nUniversity was\n&#xa0;\nopened\n&#xa0;\nby Her Majesty \nThe\n Queen,\n&#xa0;\nand has\n&#xa0;\nnow established itself as the leading cricket centre in the world. \n&#xa0;\nThe centre employs\n&#xa0;\n25 full time staff\n&#xa0;\nand delivers world class programmes in terms of cricket and areas such as science and medicine and provides the game in England and Wales with leading edge research.\n \n The coaching courses created and the science and m\nedicine innovations\n&#xa0;\npermeate throughout the game and the centre itself is used by a wide range of teams from grassroots school levels to the England elite squads.\n&#xa0;\n \n \nIndeed the Elite Coach development Programme is recognised as the foremost cricket coach ed\nucation programme in the world.  It has also provided an elite coaching benchmark which other UK sports have sought to follow by seeking advice directly from the ECB.\n&#xa0;\nAll England Women’s Cricket Pathway programmes (players and staff) benefit from this wor\nld-leading resource: from the England Women’s Development Programme U15 through to the full England Women’s Programme.  All winter training camps ate staged at the National Cricket Performance Centre with matches also staged at Loughborough during the seas\non.\n&#xa0;\nEach County Cricket Board delivers an \nEmerging Players Programme (EPP) to support players who \nC\nounties believe have talent and potential at ages 13 – 16 in preparation for potential future academy programmes and elite England programmes. There are \ncurrently over 150 girls in EPP programmes across the country, and\n \nsome counties now run specific EPP programmes for their talented females. \n&#xa0;\nFirst Class County Academies are completely supportive with more \nA\ncademies now offering places to females who are\n identified as talented through ECB’s England Women’s Development Programme (EWDP) –many of the current England team and \nEngland Women’s A\ncademy players have benefitted from \ntime spent on County Academies\n, \nUniversities and MCCYA – girls into these programm\nes. \n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nS\nustained success on the International Stage\nThe England Women\n Squad\n has secured unprecedented success on the international stage in recent years culminating in being ranked the world number one \nODI \nteam from 2009 to 2013 and regaining the Ashes \nwith a resounding victory against Australia, the new world champions, in August 2013.\nThis success comes as a result of the full integration of elite women’s cricket into the England Cricket Department at ECB. This integration has yielded more of the suppo\nrt services needed to \nperform at a world class level – specialist coaching, medical screening, bespoke strength and conditioning programmes and access to the very best facilities.\nThe England \nWomen’s \nsquad players are now semi-professional and benefit from\n membership of the PCA – the Professional Cricketers’ Association. \nThe England Women’s team play their internationals at some of the finest grounds in the country.\n&#xa0;\n The 2013 Ashes matches were played in all corners of the country including Lord’s Cricket \nGround, Ageas Bowl (Southampton), ICG Emirates Durham, Chelmsford, and Hove.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nWhilst the majority of women’s internationals are staged at First Class County grounds, ECB also takes international women’s cricket to out-grounds and to festivals such as Tru\nro CC (Cornish Festival of Cricket 2012) and Louth CC, Lincolnshire (SO Festival 2013).\n&#xa0;\n The vision here is that international women’s cricket can have a huge impact in the more remote parts of the country and in acting as a catalyst for growth in the fema\nle game.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n1 game at Lord’s, Ageas Bowl, ICG Emirates Durham, Chelmsford, Wormsley, and Louth CC;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2 games at Hove;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n3 at Loughborough University.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn total, 38,621 watched a Women’s Ashes match this summer \n(20,500 of which were at ‘double headers’ before the England men played Australia).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAttendance: \n6,300 across the 4 days (peak of 2,500 on Day 1).\nPrices £1-15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAttendance: \n4,772\nPrices £5-14\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAttendances: \n3,049 (1,443 + 1,606)\nPrices £1-5, but free \nfor\n Sussex CCC membership\n&#xa0;\nAttendance: \n4,000\nPrices £1-5, but free for Essex CCC members\n&#xa0;\nAttendance: \n3,200 (at start) – 8,500 peak (5pm)\nPrice: £40\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAttendance: \n2,500 (at start) – 12,000 peak\nPrice: £40\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.\n2\n              \nICC framework for promoting Women’s Cricket\n              \nThe ICC \nFemales in Cricket Strategy (which sits within ICC’s Strategic Plan) has set a target of a minimum of 1 million women participants across the world by the end of 2015.  The current estimate suggests there are some 650,000 players around the world.\n&#xa0;\nThe ECB were lead proponents of the decision taken by the ICC that the World Twenty20 tournaments in 2009, 2010 &amp; 2012 were to be joint men’s and women’s events - generating increased profile and exposure for the women’s game around the world. \n&#xa0;4.\n3\n              \nTarge\nting\n Sustained\n \nS\nuccess\n \n&#xa0;\nECB has set itself the target of developing the world’s best players to win the ICC World Twenty20 in 2014, 2016 and 2018 and the ICC Women’s World Cup in England in 2017.  One of our key ambitions is to for the England Women’s \nAcademy to develop an effective supply of players capable of performing for England from 2014 and at world’s best level from 2018.\n&#xa0;\nThe England Women’s Development Programme U19 is designed to develop an effective supply of players to the England Women’s \nAcademy from 2014 capable of performing for England from 2017 and at world’s best level from 2021. Both the England Women’s Development Programmes at U19 and U15 level and the inaugural England Women’s U19 overseas tour (South Africa) is to become an annua\nl event.\n&#xa0;\nUnderpinning this development the ECB in partnership with Sport England invest into the further development of a robust Talent ID system to detect the country’s highest potential players from within Counties.  There is a mentoring Programme imple\nmented for England Women’s Academy to be rolled out with all England Women’s Development Programme U19 players from 2014 alongside the implementation of regional skills based coaching sessions delivered by Lead Specialist Coaches for all England Women’s Cr\nicket Pathway \nfast bowlers, spin bowlers, wicket-keepers and batters\n.\n&#xa0;\nOne of the most challenging areas in trying to develop and grow wo\nmen’s cricket is securing an increased media profile to help drive \npublic interest and \ncommercial success.\nThere is still a long way to go and the reality is that women’s cricket is still subsidised from revenues generated by the men’s international game a\nnd requires cross promotional support and subsidy in the commercial field and targeted public sector investment. ECB’s commercial strategy is to centralise all England team sponsorships – meaning all England teams (Men, Women, Lions, development sides, \nD\nis\nabilit\nies\n) share the same Team Sponsor. \n \nFrom 2014\n,\n \nWaitrose \nwill be the \nmain \nTeam Sponsor \nwith kit provided by adidas.  From a perception point of view it is important for the women’s team to have an association with \nthese\n \npremium\n, well-known brands as it\n helps reiterate and promote the professionalism of the game.\nHowever, whilst our current view is that the teams should share the Team Sponsor, the ECB will longer-term continue to explore additional standalone commercial deals for the women’s team – and h\nas employed a new business manager devoted specifically to targeting these opportunities. \nThis summer, the ECB secured its first “stand\n-\nalone” sponsorship for the Women’s team - Kia Motors came on board for the Women’s Ashes Series providing the team with\n cars for the duration of the Series.\n \n Whilst the deal did not have any significant financial benefit for the team nor organisation, it shows that there is an appetite from brands to be associated with successful women’s sports teams –albeit on a much smal\nler scale.\n \n For comparison, Jaguar – the men’s team car supplier – provides cars in addition to £300k in sponsorship monies.\nEngland Women tend to play a mixture of One Day Internationals (ODIs; 50 overs) and Twenty20 matches (it is only in the Women’s Ash\nes Series where they \nalso \ncompete in one four-day Test match). In previous years, these formats have been sponsored by NatWest – as they also sponsored the men’s ODIs and T20s. \n \nFrom 2014, NatWest will become the title sponsor of all T20 cricket (men’s, wo\nmen’s and grassroots). The ECB is currently sourcing a new sponsor for the ODI format, who we envisage will become the game-wide sponsor of the one-day format, including Women’s ODIs.\nWe are also optimistic that the ICC Women’s Committee will create a bi-l\nateral programme amongst the top 8 teams over the next 3 years to \nenable us to market international women's cricket with a longer lead time and therefore give the ECB Commercial team more to work with and much stronger assets to sell. \n&#xa0;\n \nFor comparison in \nthe cricket world, Cricket Australia \nadopt\n a similar strategy by ‘bolting-on’ women’s sponsorships onto the men’s team packages. CA \nhave\n not been able to secure any stand-alone sponsorships for the women’s team. \n&#xa0;\nThe one major difference between ECB and C\nA is their choice of branding and communications strategy for the Women’s team - the Australia Women’s team is branded as the ‘Southern Stars’ and have their own social media channels. \n \nFor reference, Southern Stars twitter feed has 8,700 followers compare\nd to the CA’s overall following of 223,200. \n&#xa0;\n \nWhilst the ECB is exploring separating its digital media channels for each team or competition, our current view is that sending women’s messages to our entire database (circa 1.5m across all channels) does mor\ne to boost the profile of women’s cricket/ the England team, than sending to a smaller, targeted audience as CA choose to do.  Both approaches have their merits and we keep this area under close review in order maximise our reach.\nThe profile of women’s cr\nicket will only grow through sustained, mass media interest leading to increased spectator following and commercial income.\n \nSecuring mass\n media coverage \nremains a challenge\n, but t\nhe ECB notes and welcome\ns\n the further progress made by broadcasters and the media since the London Olympics. Sky’s viewing figures of the recent Women’s Ashes were the \nbest ever for international women’s cricket in this country and Sky described 2013 as “a breakthrough summer for \nwomen’s cricket”.\nThe ECB itself \ncontinues to heavily invest in marketing activity to help profile the Women’s team and fixtures\n as highlighted in case study 5.\nThe ECB provides rights-free imagery to media for every match (through Getty), and after every \nday’s play and training session - a player is put up for media interviews. If media cannot attend these sessions, ECB records interviews and sends to them via our Audioboo site.\n \n In addition, video highlights of every women’s international – regardless of \nwhether it’s televised or not – are posted on the ECB’s digital platforms.\nIn addition to this ‘business as usual’ activity, ECB arranged 4 ‘life-style’ photo-shoots to present the team in a different light – one as part of a promotional shoot for suit mak\ner TM Lewin, one taken at Wormsley Cricket Ground (before the Women’s Ashes Test), one at Brighton sea-front (before the NatWest ODI at Hove), and another beneath the Angel of the North – with the Women’s Ashes Series trophy in shot.\nDuring ECB promotional\n activity for the grassroots game – a women’s player is always offered up to media alongside a men’s player. For example, in April 2013 Charlotte Edwards joined Alastair Cook at Harrow Town CC to promote NatWest CricketForce – a nationwide initiative where\n 2,000 clubs hold an event to prepare their ground for the season ahead.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1\n              \nMedia partnerships\nThe ECB’s two major broadcast partners – Sky Sports and BBC Radio – are committed supporters of the women’s game, and their increased coverage reflects the increasing interest in women’s cricket. \nSky Sports began broadcasting women’s cricket seventeen yea\nrs ago (June 1996 v New Zealand), and aired \nfour\n of the \nseven\n Women’s Ashes Series matches live this summer.  Sky have aired\n the majority\n \nof England women’s home T20 matches live during the past 5 years, including the team winning the ICC Women’s World Cup\n and World Twenty20 in 2009. Sky routinely undertake player interviews and broadcast promotional events on Sky Sports News and Cricket AM, as well as background pieces featuring key players during the intervals of men’s internationals. \nBBC Radio covered t\nhe first ever England Women’s T20 match at Hove in 2004, and have reported on every \nWomen’s\n World Cup.\n \n \nEarlier this year, for the first time they broadcast all of England’s games in a World Cup – as well as sending a network TV crew and a reporter for BBC\n \nOnline\n to India the \nhost country\n.\n  BBC Radio also covered the Women’s Ashes in 2005 and 2009, and this summer carried ball-by-ball commentary on all \nseven\n Women’s Ashes Series matches.\nOn a smaller scale, The Times is the ECB’s Official Newspaper partner, and the ECB promoted the Women’s Ashes Series with a ticket promotion in-paper and online a few months prior to the matches – giving away 100 tickets for \nthree\n games, helping to raise a\nwareness of the Ashes Series. \nNational newspapers continue to support the women’s game, but like other sports no doubt share our frustration, space given is minimal. Coverage for Women’s cricket peaks during Ashes matches and World Cups. \nThe Women’s Ashe\ns Series format was announced on 13 May, and since then 11 matches have been played (\nfour\n against \nPakistan,\n and \nseven\n against Australia). These matches generated 86 items of national print coverage – reaching a total audience of 44.1 million.\nThe \nECB looks\n toward Government to place greater focus on public service broadcasters to cover women and girls sport within their schedules, including magazine and coaching programmes, as part of their broadcast licence arrangements\n. Additional pressure on Sports Edito\nrs would also be welcomed.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The ECB approach, as documented in \nthis submission, is to create a fully accessible sport at every level of the game to ensure that we continue to grow the sport and make the right interventions to remove as many of the barriers to playing as possible.\nThere are many well documented reasons\n for a drop out in sport - physical, environmental and social factors all can play their part to greater or lesser extent and the ECB is keen to understand \nmore and to make sure our programmes adapt and meet the needs and requirements of those women and gi\nrls wanting to participate in the sport. In reality it is the same barriers that prevent women playing as men. \nOne of the key interventions a National Governing Body (NGB), such as the ECB, can make is to promote physical literacy at an early age, as part\n of a young person’s personal and emotional development and then in time provide the right opportunities to play competitively. It can provide teachers with the necessary training and coaching support to help young people begin to develop a habit for life.\n In our view it is vital that this development process is driven within the school system, to allow sports such as cricket to create a development journey from childhood to adulthood with different opportunities to play to meet the demand.\nAs outlined, the\n ECB through its partnerships has well established programmes at primary school level such \nAsda \nKwik Cricket which has a huge reach offering both mixed and programmes focused specifically on girls. \nSince receiving a major National Lottery investment from S\nport England in April 2013\n, t\nhe Cricket Foundation is also embarking on a change in the way they work and a shift in priority to secondary schools.\n \n \nThrough Chance to \nShine\n, they have \nbegun creating strong links between community sports clubs and schools w\nith the help of County Cricket Board. Local cricket clubs are enabled to work closely with coaches, young people and teachers to set up a satellite cricket club on school sites; making it easier for young people to make the transition to clubs in the commu\nnity. \nIt\n has already recently reached the milestone of its 500th school-based or ‘satellite’ cricket club.  \nPupils are at the heart of the decision-making and influence how their school club is run. \n \nActivity at the clubs range from extra-curricular coaching and forums to discussions on club activity, organising social events and ambassador visits.\n \n \nThe aim of the scheme is two-fold: first, to help reduce the number of children leaving the game when th\ney move from primary to secondary school and, second, to contribute to a lower drop-off rate in sport among teenagers, especially in the 14 to 16 year age group. \n \nOver the next three years Chance to \nShine\n will look to work with 1250 secondary schools to es\ntablish Satellite Clubs to improve the transition from school to community cricket.\nTo gain a greater understanding \nof participation \nacross all ages, the ECB \nhas recently commissioned a significant research project called Eureka! \nthat\n seeks to give specifi\nc insight from current, lapsed and non-players. \n \nThis will be used nationally and locally to better inform planning and programme design for women and girls. Early indications suggest that young people will continue to play more \ncricket \nwith better signpos\nting of opportunities at local clubs and teams with proactive contact in schools to establish these links. \n \nThis places more focus on expanding our school club links going forward.\nThere is significant potential to grow even further the game for women over\n the age of 14 and will be looking to provide a different range of options based on this insight and in both cricket clubs and a range of different environments. \n&#xa0;\nECB has also recently established a dedicated programme to work with further and higher educ\nation institutions to ensure that the drop off rate after leaving school is reduced and is working in partnership to deliver new programmes such as Last Man Stands.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Since taking over the Women’s game, the ECB\n,\n along with its key partners\n,\n has transform\ned\n women’s and girls\n’\n cricket at every level of the game. \n \nWomen’s cricket is now fully integrated within \nour\n structures from international level to our development programmes, and has become an integral part of the cricket family within the \nECB’s Cricket Partnerships and\n England Cricket Department\n.\nThe international team has access to the best facilities and we promote their outstanding success through every means possible.\n \n \nThere has been a huge level of investment into the development of th\ne women’s game that has helped rebuild cricket in schools, grow a thriving community club network and to ensure we continue to develop the pathway to elite success. \nWe cannot be complacent as there are many challenges facing us as we continue to grow and \ndevelop the game and we are continually exploring new ways \ngetting\n more people \nto \nplay \ncricket and mak\ne\n sure that once they do\n,\n they continue to play the game for life. \n \nOn a wider level the Government has its part to pla\ny\n working in partnership to ensure school sport is co-ordinated, protect our local facilities\n, encourage \nmedia promotion\n \nand continue its vital investment into sport. \nOur ambition is clear, we want women’s cricket to build on its outstanding \nsuccess, deliv\ner best practice in all areas of the game and inspire the nation to choose cricket.\n \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
