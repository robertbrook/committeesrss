defaultDisability associated with 
defaultmental ill health
default has for too long been a low priority in development. Psychosocial disabilities
default 
default are increasingly recognized as resulting not only in individual social exclusion, but being an important factor frustrating the aspirations of families, comm
defaultunities and emerging economies. According to the World Report on Disability, 1 billion people worldwide experience a disab
defaultling
default condition. Of these, 60% of the causation is strongly liked to mental, neurological and 
defaultsubstance abuse conditions. 
defaultThe economic 
defaultcost of these conditions was estimated to the $2.5 trillion in 2010.

default The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1 in 4 people will experience an episode of mental 
defaultillness in their lifetime, and that approximately 600 million people worldwide are disabled as a consequence. Most (85%) of these people are in

defaultime but risks being left behind in disability, human rights and development discourse. Poverty and hunger, conflict and trauma, poor access to health and social care, and social inequity are significant risk factors, increasing vulnerability to persons wit
defaulth psychosocial disabilities in low and middle income country contexts. Despite such challenges, communities under stress often show a remarkable resilience. The most effective work in global mental health aims to reinforce this resilience and find solution

defaultAs a consequence, the aim of improving acce
defaultss to human rights and dignity is as much about changing the environment in which people live as addressing any impairment they may have.  Allowing people to access the things they value most (such as livelihood, a family life and participation in communit
defaulty decision-making), requires a change in attitudes, and a challenge to the stigma that people with psychosocial disabilities face. This focus on human rights and stigma reduction is the ma
defaultin message of organizations of people with psychosocial disabilities
default from the global south, as well as being central to the growing Movement for Global Mental Health

defaultRecent systematic analyses comparing disability attributable to different impairments show that mental and behaviora

default. Neurological conditions including dementia and epilepsy account for 3% of DALYs. Mental and behavioral problems command an even greater shar

default increasingly recognized. In high income countries men with mental health problems die 20 years and women 15 years earlier than people without mental health problems. In low income countries this gap is likely to be much wider

default2.2.3
default              
default 
defaultThis life expectancy gap is due partly to high rates of suicide
default (
defaultnearly one
default million people globally 
defaulttake their own lives every
default year)
default, but also because people 
defaultwith 
defaultpsychosocial disabilities
default lead poorer, more disadvantaged lives, experience more physical health problems, and are often excluded from services accessible to others resulting in severe disabilities. This mortality gap must be recognized as a human rig
defaulthts issue.
default2.3default              defaultCHRONIC UNDER INVESTMENT IN SERVICES AND RESULTING TREATMENT GAPdefault2.3.1 
default              
defaultGlobally, there is chronic under-investment in psychosocial disabilities, and a huge mismatch between investment by governments and the relative burden of psychosocial 
defaultdisabilities (Figure 2). Low income countries spend about 0.5% of their health budgets (which are in themselves very low) on psychosocial disabilities, despite them causing 25.5% of the YLDs. Investment in relevant work in the social and education sectors 
defaultis equally low.
defaultFigure 2default |Percentage of total health spending on mental health compared to the burden of disease (DALYs and YLDs) for all mental health and neurological conditions, by country income level. 
default2.3.2
default 
default              
defaultThis under-investment in mental health s
defaultervices has resulted in a huge treatment gap. In low income countries, less than 20% of people who would benefit from services are able to access them. In some countries, and for more severe disorders such as schizophrenia, the treatment gap is as 
defaultwide
default as 
default98%. Treatment choices are therefore frequently limited to traditional or religious treatments which are often ineffective. Such settings have often been used to simply contain people who families cannot cope with, and can be abusive, with chaining and for
defaultced treatment common.
default Where services do exist, they are often based in large cities, far from people who may need them. This lack of access to treatment breaches a fundamental right to accessing health care.
default3.1
default              
defaultThe large treatment gap is
default 
defaultparticularly critical as the evidence overwhelmingly shows that prompt treatment improves health outcomes, social integration and economic outcomes for individuals. Improving access to treatment, combined with improving hum
defaultan rights, is the key call to action to improve the quality of life of person with psychosocial disabilities.

default              
defaultA growing body of research, much of which deliberately prioritizes operational and implementation issues, has also resulted in strong evidenc

defaultA
default major milestone was achieved in May 2013 when the World Health Assembly of the WHO unanimously adopted a Global Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2018) for the first time.  I
defaultn addition, the WHO has started to address the related issues of human rights. Their QualityRights program aims to provide resources for monitoring mental health care facilities and supporting processes for improving the care they provide.
default5.1
default              
default Despite the 
defaultgrowing recognition of the essent
defaultial need to address psychosocial disabilities in development, global development budgets remain woefully inadequate. The UK Government, through DfID
default, is one of the few governments who have invested in understanding more about scaling up services for mental health in low resources settings. Since 2005
default,
default DfID have funded two Research Partnership Consortiums. The Mental Health and Poverty Project explored
default the relationship between poverty and mental health in four African countries. Since 2011, DfID have committed to funding £6 million over 6 years for the PRogramme for Improving Mental health care (PRIME).
default PRIME is groundbreaking as it is the first projec
defaultt to design, implement, scale up and evaluate mental health services in collaboration with Ministries of Health in five countries in Asia and Africa.
default5.2
default              
defaultAs DfID has taken a lead in commissioning appropriate research in this field, it is well placed to tra
defaultnslate this into scaled programmes. While there are few examples at present, the strength of evidence, and systematic way that DfID has approached this, is a good foundation on which to build. 
default6.1
default              
default Mental health is unique in its relevance to many other aspects of health and development. As well as being critical to success in addressing poverty and economic development, there are strong links to almost all the other Millennium Development Goa
defaultls.  Psychosocial disabilities are the most common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) by disease burden, as well as playing an important role in successful interventions for the other NCDs. In a similar way, there are key mental health aspects of programmes a
defaultddressing HIV/Aids (depression, medication compliance), maternal and child health (post-natal depression, early child stimulation) and Neglected Tropical Diseases (stigma, depression). 
default6.2
default              
default Mental health status is associated in multiple ways with each of 
defaultthe nine thematic areas for emerging post-MDG priorities, and can therefore be considered as a fully cross-cutting issue.  For instance, in relation to education, educational stressors are risk factors for college students, while an important route for acc
defaultess to mental health care for young people is via educational organizations.

default.2
default              
defaultThe stigma associated with psychosocial disabilities has been such that their voice has been poorly repre
defaultsented even among the disability movement, let alone in the health and development sector.  This is changing fast, with increasing numbers of countries having organizations of persons with psychosocial disabilities, and in some cases continental umbrella b
defaultodies, such as the Pan African Network of Persons with Psychosocial Disabilities. This will allow greater participation in not only CRPD processes (e.g. parallel reports), but at all levels of service development and planning that affect their interests. G

default              
default    
defaultIt is impossible to seriously address psychosocial disability without considering both 
defaulthuman rights and health
default in tandem. As we approach a new phase of global consensus on development priorities, health is increasingly seen as an essen
defaulttial component of overall sustainable development, and as a positive outcome of successful achievement of human rights, social, and environmental targets. Similarly, mental health (and

defaultPsychosocial disability is the preferred term used in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
default (
defaultCRPD
default)
default and defines people who are affected by a variety of mental health issues. Psychosocial disability does not represent any particular condition or category of mental disorder or illness, but is defined by the impact on a person’s life of the interaction of 
defaulta mental condition and the way that society treats that person as a consequence.
