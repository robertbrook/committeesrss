[normal]Disability associated with 
[normal]mental ill health
[normal] has for too long been a low priority in development. Psychosocial disabilities
[normal] 
[normal] are increasingly recognized as resulting not only in individual social exclusion, but being an important factor frustrating the aspirations of families, comm
[normal]unities and emerging economies. According to the World Report on Disability, 1 billion people worldwide experience a disab
[normal]ling
[normal] condition. Of these, 60% of the causation is strongly liked to mental, neurological and 
[normal]substance abuse conditions. 
[normal]The economic 
[normal]cost of these conditions was estimated to the $2.5 trillion in 2010.

[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal] The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1 in 4 people will experience an episode of mental 
[normal]illness in their lifetime, and that approximately 600 million people worldwide are disabled as a consequence. Most (85%) of these people are in 
[normal]l
[normal]ow and

[normal]c
[normal]ountries
[normal]. Psychosocial disability is one of the most pressing development issues of our t
[normal]ime but risks being left behind in disability, human rights and development discourse. Poverty and hunger, conflict and trauma, poor access to health and social care, and social inequity are significant risk factors, increasing vulnerability to persons wit
[normal]h psychosocial disabilities in low and middle income country contexts. Despite such challenges, communities under stress often show a remarkable resilience. The most effective work in global mental health aims to reinforce this resilience and find solution
[normal]s that reinforce local coping strategies and resources with scientifically proven interventions.

[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]Psychosocial disability
[normal] 
[normal]emphasizes the central importance of social attitudes and discrimination in the experience of people 
[normal]labeled
[normal] with mental illness. Socially unacceptable behavior is frequently punished with exclusion and, all too commonly, frank human rights abuse. There is
[normal] documented evidence from all regions of the world that people with psychosocial disabilities experience some of the most severe human rights violations
[normal] of any group of people
[normal]. 
[normal]2.1.2 
[normal]              
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] includes being tied to beds or kept in isolation in psychiatric in
[normal]stitutions, being incarcerated in prisons, being chained and caged in small cells in the community
[normal],
[normal] and being 
[normal]physically
[normal] 
[normal]abused by ‘traditional’ healing practices. 
[normal]E
[normal]stimates form the Ministries of Health in Indonesia for example, indicate that 
[normal]over 18,000
[normal] 
[normal]people
[normal] are currently being physically restrained because of their mental health condition. This has been called a failure of humanity and is a global emergency that requires immediate and sustained action.

[normal]              
[normal]As a consequence, the aim of improving acce
[normal]ss to human rights and dignity is as much about changing the environment in which people live as addressing any impairment they may have.  Allowing people to access the things they value most (such as livelihood, a family life and participation in communit
[normal]y decision-making), requires a change in attitudes, and a challenge to the stigma that people with psychosocial disabilities face. This focus on human rights and stigma reduction is the ma
[normal]in message of organizations of people with psychosocial disabilities
[normal] from the global south, as well as being central to the growing Movement for Global Mental Health
[normal].

[normal]2.2[bold]              [bold]A GROWING BURDEN[bold] OF DISEASE[bold]2.2.1
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Recent systematic analyses comparing disability attributable to different impairments show that mental and behaviora
[normal]l problems account for 7.4% of the global burden of disease measured using Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY
[normal]s
[normal])
[normal]. Neurological conditions including dementia and epilepsy account for 3% of DALYs. Mental and behavioral problems command an even greater shar
[normal]e of Ye
[normal]ars Lived with Disability
[normal] (YLD)
[normal]: nearly one-quarter of the global total. This is the biggest single cause, more than cardiovascular diseases and cancer combined (
[normal]F
[normal]igure 1).

[normal]Mental illnesses cause such a large burden
[normal] of disease
[normal] 
[normal]both in the person experienc
[normal]ing
[normal] the impairment and the social exclusion and human rights violations that result
[normal]. 50%
[normal] of menta
[normal]l health problems start in childhood
[normal], and many conditions have a relapsing and remitting course which can last for many years
[normal],
[normal] particularly if untreated. As well as long-lasting impairment from these conditions (morbidity), a high excess mortality is being
[normal] increasingly recognized. In high income countries men with mental health problems die 20 years and women 15 years earlier than people without mental health problems. In low income countries this gap is likely to be much wider
[normal].

[normal]en with mental health prob
[normal]lems die 20 years, and women 15 years, earlier than people without mental health problems”
[normal]2.2.3
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]This life expectancy gap is due partly to high rates of suicide
[normal] (
[normal]nearly one
[normal] million people globally 
[normal]take their own lives every
[normal] year)
[normal], but also because people 
[normal]with 
[normal]psychosocial disabilities
[normal] lead poorer, more disadvantaged lives, experience more physical health problems, and are often excluded from services accessible to others resulting in severe disabilities. This mortality gap must be recognized as a human rig
[normal]hts issue.
[normal]2.3[bold]              [bold]CHRONIC UNDER INVESTMENT IN SERVICES AND RESULTING TREATMENT GAP[bold]2.3.1 
[normal]              
[normal]Globally, there is chronic under-investment in psychosocial disabilities, and a huge mismatch between investment by governments and the relative burden of psychosocial 
[normal]disabilities (Figure 2). Low income countries spend about 0.5% of their health budgets (which are in themselves very low) on psychosocial disabilities, despite them causing 25.5% of the YLDs. Investment in relevant work in the social and education sectors 
[normal]is equally low.
[normal]Figure 2[bold] |Percentage of total health spending on mental health compared to the burden of disease (DALYs and YLDs) for all mental health and neurological conditions, by country income level. 
[normal]2.3.2
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]This under-investment in mental health s
[normal]ervices has resulted in a huge treatment gap. In low income countries, less than 20% of people who would benefit from services are able to access them. In some countries, and for more severe disorders such as schizophrenia, the treatment gap is as 
[normal]wide
[normal] as 
[normal]98%. Treatment choices are therefore frequently limited to traditional or religious treatments which are often ineffective. Such settings have often been used to simply contain people who families cannot cope with, and can be abusive, with chaining and for
[normal]ced treatment common.
[normal] Where services do exist, they are often based in large cities, far from people who may need them. This lack of access to treatment breaches a fundamental right to accessing health care.
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The large treatment gap is
[normal] 
[normal]particularly critical as the evidence overwhelmingly shows that prompt treatment improves health outcomes, social integration and economic outcomes for individuals. Improving access to treatment, combined with improving hum
[normal]an rights, is the key call to action to improve the quality of life of person with psychosocial disabilities.
[normal]3.2 
[normal]              
[normal]A growing body of research, much of which deliberately prioritizes operational and implementation issues, has also resulted in strong evidenc
[normal]e of (cost) effective interventions suited even to the poorest settings with weak
[normal] infrastructure
[normal].
[normal] This 
[normal]evidence has recently been complied into 6 actions for global policy makers in the World Innovations Summit for Health (WISH) Mental Health 
[normal]Report.

[normal]              
[normal]We know what works
[normal] – the challenge now is to implement these evidence-based services to at scale while 
[normal]meet
[normal]ing
[normal] the essential standard of local contextual appropriateness.  It is not morally defensible to remain idle in the face of enormous abuse of the right to access treatment and gross human rights abuses when we now 
[normal]have the evidence of what works
[normal].

[normal] aims

[normal]p services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders
[normal], 
[normal]especially 
[normal]in
[normal] low and middle
[normal] 
[normal]income
[normal] countries. Unfortunately, more commitment is needed by governments and other international donors to budget adequately for prevention, treatment and care f
[normal]or psychosocial disabilities, though awareness is increasing about the issue.

[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal] major milestone was achieved in May 2013 when the World Health Assembly of the WHO unanimously adopted a Global Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2018) for the first time.  I
[normal]n addition, the WHO has started to address the related issues of human rights. Their QualityRights program aims to provide resources for monitoring mental health care facilities and supporting processes for improving the care they provide.
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal] Despite the 
[normal]growing recognition of the essent
[normal]ial need to address psychosocial disabilities in development, global development budgets remain woefully inadequate. The UK Government, through DfID
[normal], is one of the few governments who have invested in understanding more about scaling up services for mental health in low resources settings. Since 2005
[normal],
[normal] DfID have funded two Research Partnership Consortiums. The Mental Health and Poverty Project explored
[normal] the relationship between poverty and mental health in four African countries. Since 2011, DfID have committed to funding £6 million over 6 years for the PRogramme for Improving Mental health care (PRIME).
[normal] PRIME is groundbreaking as it is the first projec
[normal]t to design, implement, scale up and evaluate mental health services in collaboration with Ministries of Health in five countries in Asia and Africa.
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]As DfID has taken a lead in commissioning appropriate research in this field, it is well placed to tra
[normal]nslate this into scaled programmes. While there are few examples at present, the strength of evidence, and systematic way that DfID has approached this, is a good foundation on which to build. 
[normal]6.1
[normal]              
[normal] Mental health is unique in its relevance to many other aspects of health and development. As well as being critical to success in addressing poverty and economic development, there are strong links to almost all the other Millennium Development Goa
[normal]ls.  Psychosocial disabilities are the most common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) by disease burden, as well as playing an important role in successful interventions for the other NCDs. In a similar way, there are key mental health aspects of programmes a
[normal]ddressing HIV/Aids (depression, medication compliance), maternal and child health (post-natal depression, early child stimulation) and Neglected Tropical Diseases (stigma, depression). 
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal] Mental health status is associated in multiple ways with each of 
[normal]the nine thematic areas for emerging post-MDG priorities, and can therefore be considered as a fully cross-cutting issue.  For instance, in relation to education, educational stressors are risk factors for college students, while an important route for acc
[normal]ess to mental health care for young people is via educational organizations.
[normal]7
[normal].1 
[normal]              
[normal]Th
[normal]e growing
[normal] momentum 
[normal]of evidence, advocacy networks and investment 
[normal]is reflected in the increasingly strong policy and legislative framework for psychosocial disability. The CRPD has psychosocial disabilities as a core mandate, proving a strong mechanism for holding signatory countries to account. This monitoring function 
[normal]is explicitly stated in the CRPD (Article 33(2)) as a key way that persons with psychosocial disabilities and the organizations can participate.  
[normal]7
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]The stigma associated with psychosocial disabilities has been such that their voice has been poorly repre
[normal]sented even among the disability movement, let alone in the health and development sector.  This is changing fast, with increasing numbers of countries having organizations of persons with psychosocial disabilities, and in some cases continental umbrella b
[normal]odies, such as the Pan African Network of Persons with Psychosocial Disabilities. This will allow greater participation in not only CRPD processes (e.g. parallel reports), but at all levels of service development and planning that affect their interests. G
[normal]lobal development organizations and governments need to commit to this principle.
[normal]8
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]Given the cross-cutting nature of mental health and psychosocial disability, the most powerfu
[normal]l way that the UK 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment and D
[normal]f
[normal]ID can have an impact is to consider mental health within the full range of policies and programmes. 
[normal]D
[normal]emonstrat
[normal]ing
[normal] appropriate consideration of mental health 
[normal]issues 
[normal]in external communication would send a powerful message 
[normal]to partners.
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]    
[normal]It is impossible to seriously address psychosocial disability without considering both 
[normal]human rights and health
[normal] in tandem. As we approach a new phase of global consensus on development priorities, health is increasingly seen as an essen
[normal]tial component of overall sustainable development, and as a positive outcome of successful achievement of human rights, social, and environmental targets. Similarly, mental health (and 
[normal]better social inclusion
[normal] for persons with psychosocial disabilities) has
[normal] an 
[normal]extremely strong case as being essential for sustainable human development, 
[normal]with
[normal] mental wellbeing increasing a
[normal]s a result of such development.
[normal]8
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]   
[normal]The
[normal] UK G
[normal]overnment needs to build on its recognition of the importance of happiness and wellbeing by rec
[normal]ognizing that enabling access to mental health care has the best evidence of impact in this area. 
[normal] 
[normal]Addressing psychosocial disability is an essential step in addressing key development issues such as social inclusion and equity, universal health coverage, 
[normal]a holistic and life-course approach to health, access to justice and human rights, and su
[normal]stainable economic development. 
[normal]Members of t
[normal]he Mo
[normal]vement for Global Mental Health
[normal] contributed to a common position statement related to the post-2015 development agenda
[normal]. They have three calls
[normal] for action
[normal] which we would echo
[normal] (Figure 3).
[normal]Figure 3[bold] | Main calls of the Movement for Global Mental Health post-2015 position statement
[normal]9.1
[normal]              
[normal]This submission 
[normal]reiterates these prior
[normal]ities and calls upon the UK
[normal] Government to ensure int
[normal]erventions addressing psychosocial disabilities are recognized as being
[normal] essential, and
[normal] an opportunity to maximize posit
[normal]ive global development outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Psychosocial disability is the preferred term used in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
[normal] (
[normal]CRPD
[normal])
[normal] and defines people who are affected by a variety of mental health issues. Psychosocial disability does not represent any particular condition or category of mental disorder or illness, but is defined by the impact on a person’s life of the interaction of 
[normal]a mental condition and the way that society treats that person as a consequence. 
[normal] The Movement for Global Mental Health is 
[normal]a network made up of service users, practitioners, academics, the development
[normal] 
[normal]community and other stakeholders
[normal], which 
[normal]has
[normal] a common 
[normal]aim of advocating for protection of human rights and campaigning for improved access to appropriate mental health care
[normal].

[normal] 
[normal]One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The sum of these DALYs across the 
[normal]population, or the burden of disease, can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.
