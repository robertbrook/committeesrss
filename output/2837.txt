[[[&#xa0;]]]The RAC is the UK’s most progressive motoring organisation and welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Transport Select Committee as part of its review of the resilience of the UK’s transport networks during severely adverse winter weather.&#xa0;The RAC represents more than seven million members, providing services for both private and business motorists, and is committed to making driving easier, safer, more affordable and more enjoyable for all road users. &#xa0;We employ more than 1700 patrols providing roadside assistance in the most extreme weather conditions across the UK and, therefore, have a good understanding of the impact of adverse weather on the road network. Throughout recent winters, RAC patrols have worked alongside the Highways Agency, the Police Service and other key stakeholders to maximise the safety of road users at risk in treacherous conditions. &#xa0;During periods of sudden snowfall, when roads can became impassable, and immediately afterwards, when roads remain treacherous because of compacted ice, the demand for roadside assistance increases dramatically. During the worst periods in recent winters, national demand has risen to levels typically 50% greater than is normal for the time of year, with demand as much as 100% greater than normal in the worst affected areas.In response to the conditions, the RAC has increased the proportion of 4x4 patrol vehicle on its fleet progressively over the last three years. This investment has primarily been in 4x4 panel vans rather than specialist 4x4 vehicles. We have also issued snow socks or snow chains for all of our patrol vehicles, whereas historically we have only done so in areas where severe winter weather was most common.  We believe that many other large fleets have made similar investments to improve their response to adverse weather.Our comments are confined to the road network and RAC’s ability to respond to adverse weather.&#xa0;

[[[RAC FOUNDATION REPORT]]]

[[[ ON WINTER RESILIENCE]]]

[[[: Ploughing On]]]

[[[ (published May 2013)]]]&#xa0;We understand that the Committee has already been made aware of the report “Ploughing on – Winter Resilience Review” (http://www.racfoundation.org/research/mobility/ploughing-on-report), which was authored by Brian Smith and published by the RAC Foundation in May 2013. We also understand that the Committee has received evidence submitted by the Foundation that summarises the main findings of the report. RAC regards the report as fair and accurate and commends it to the Committee. &#xa0;As part of the research conducted for this report, RAC patrols provided feedback on their own experience delivering service during the period January to March 2013 when the worst of the 2012/13 winter conditions were experienced. Specifically:&#xa0;&#xa0;The report also states: “Within free text comments that also made up the response, there were several observations that drivers appeared not to have heeded weather warnings and had been caught out, or unprepared, and that many of the stranded vehicles were not suitable for driving in the extreme weather conditions. There were also concerns about poor driving and lack of experience/skills for the road conditions. There were a large number of comments about the number of potholes in all types of road, and the observation that they are particularly dangerous when it has snowed, because they cannot be seen.”&#xa0;

[[[GENERAL RESILIENCE OF THE ROAD NETWORK]]]RAC believes that the ability of the Highways Agency and local authorities to respond to adverse weather and keep the roads operational in the most extreme weather has improved since 2009/10. The recommendations of the Quarmby report have generally been implemented and have delivered the predicted benefits. Salt stocks have not run out. Major roads are generally treated in a timely way, but patrols report that the effectiveness with which local roads are kept passable still varies hugely from area to area depending on the priority given to this by local authorities. RAC patrols often have to attend customers on minor rural or residential roads so this does inhibit service delivery.The Highways Agency has been successful in keeping the strategic road network functioning. The only exceptions have been geographically localised and in highly unusual circumstances.&#xa0;

[[[FORECASTING OF ADVERSE WEATHER]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]RAC is best able to respond to adverse weather when the organisation has sufficient warning to adjust resourcing levels. Five-day weather forecasts proved to be reasonably accurate and predicted the adverse weather in the 2012/13 winter. In contrast, 16-day forecasts were insufficiently accurate to justify commitment of extra resource. Five days provided only limited opportunity to adjust working shifts and relocate patrols into areas where demand was likely to be greatest. The ability, therefore, to predict adverse weather a minimum of two weeks ahead would significantly improve RAC’s ability to respond. We anticipate that other organisations facing similar challenges would benefit from improved longer term weather forecasting. &#xa0;

[[[POTHOLES AND ]]]

[[[ROAD MAINTENANCE ]]]&#xa0;The formation of potholes has been accelerated by three successive harsh winters and has had a large and sustained impact on the state of our roads across the country. This has resulted in added risk to the safety of motorists and their vehicles, particularly for cyclists. These risks are increased when potholes become invisible when roads are flooded or covered by snow. &#xa0;Motorists regard local road maintenance as the top priority in transport spending and this year there have been numerous calls for local authorities to improve the speed and effectiveness of pothole repairs. The Department for Transport has provided valuable guidance on addressing the practical problems of potholes in the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme Report “Prevention is better than cure – Pothole Review” published in April 2012.&#xa0;In 2013 the RAC’s Report on Motoring found that:&#xa0;&#xa0;This dissatisfaction is greatest in rural areas where the quality of local roads appears to be getting much worse, according to 87% of respondents.  &#xa0;The RAC has called on the Government to ensure more of the £ motoring taxation collected centrally by the Treasury, which totals in excess of £40 billion p.a.,  is made available to local authorities to fund the maintenance of local roads. RAC acknowledges that the Government made additional funding available to address the problems of potholes, but this has not had the desired outcomes and it seems likely that in some cases this funding has been used to replace, rather than supplement, funding from local budgets to address local roads maintenance. Earlier this year, RAC called on the Government to carry out an audit of the work required to bring the UK’s roads to a state that is fit for purpose and prioritise the funding required to achieve this objective over a realistic timescale.&#xa0;
