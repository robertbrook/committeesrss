[normal]Written evidence from[bold] the Regulatory Policy Institute’s [bold]Better Government Programme[bold] (SCE0012)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Select committee effectiveness, resources and powers: Follow-up[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Better Government Programme, a free-standing entity within the Regulatory Policy Institute, focuses on the machinery of government and regulation and on improvements to policy and regulatory processes. 
[normal]A
[normal] commission established by the Programme produced a series of recommendations on improving trust in institutions and processes. As part of its work, it considered the role and functions of Select Committees and this submission draws on that analysis
[normal], which was published as evidence to the Liaison Committee’s 2012 report
[normal]. 
[normal]This submission does not necessarily represent the corporate view of the RPI.

[normal]The Committee has requested responses to three questions:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To what extent have the Committee’s best practice recommendations been met?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We do not accept that the 
[normal]Osmotherly
[normal] rules should have any bearing on whom a select committee should choose to summon as a witness. The 
[normal]Osmotherly
[normal] rules are merely internal for Government. They have never been accepted by Parliament. Where the inquiry relates to departmental delivery rather than ministerial decision-making, it is vital that committees should be able to question the responsible official directly.

[normal](

[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government’s response referred to a review of the 
[normal]Osmotherly
[normal] Rules and to proposals in the Reform Plan on accountability of officials. It expressed keenness to work with the Liaison Committee on this issue. However, although the Committee’s Progress Report (item 43) refers to a planned meeting with the Minister for the Cabinet Office, examination of subsequent Select Committee
[normal] inquiries
[normal] indicates that while committees have become more confident in their approach to summoning witnesses, 
[normal]there has been no noticeable change in Whitehall’s interpretation of the [bold]Osmotherly[bold] Rules as they affect the propriety of requested witnesses responding to requests to appear or to the acceptance by such witnesses of committees’ claimed right to seek clarity on responsibility for decisions and actions. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Findings and recommendations in committee reports are invariably ignored, with Government responses usually drafted as models of evasion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Committee’s report expressed a willingness to work with the Cabinet Office on guidelines to improve responses (
[normal]para
[normal] 109), but while this appeared to be accepted by Government
[normal] 
[normal]there is no evidence[bold], even taking account of the examples provided by committees in their evidence to the initial inquiry,[bold] that the traditional practice of Whitehall in general only accepting recommendations that endorse decisions already made[bold] or planned[bold] has changed[bold]. To a great extent, this can be attributed to a (not entirely unjustified) culture that views most Select Committee inquiries as short-term exercises run by amateurs with limited professional support (NAO/PAC reports are an exception) that cannot match the rigour of Departments’ own policy or delivery analysis. Revised guidelines cannot improve the system’s respect for the work of Select Committees. The Committee’s 
[normal]recommendations echo our initial submission’s suggestion
[normal] that 
[normal]Select Committees should be allowed to appoint a larger panel of specialist assistants
[normal]. We further recommended
[normal] that 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]there are occasions when it might benefit the inquiry process if specialists were empowered to question organisations on behalf of their committee - akin to Committee Counsel in Congress
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A development that might not only increase perceptions of professionalism but also reduce criticisms of, as our initial submission put it
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]political point scoring, bullying of witnesses, or apparently deciding on recommendations in advance and guiding witnesses towards them. 
[normal] 
[normal]     
[normal]Are Committees succeeding in achieving greater impact?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What more needs to be done?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prime Minister’s Questions have little to do with informing and calling to account and more with point scoring and conveying an image of the legislature as children’s 
[normal]playground. They may be part of the drama of politics, but analysis of comments on PMQs suggests the likelihood that such displays, and the way they are reported to the public, alienate more than they entertain outside the Beltway.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We therefore recommended that 
[normal]PMQs and departmental question times should be supplemented by increasing (perhaps to monthly) the frequency with which the Prime Minister and his departmental counterparts appears respectively before the Liaison and departmental Select Committees[bold] and allowing any backbencher or Peer to participate in such sessions by submitting questions (which would be vetted to eliminate planted or empty questions) to the committee in advance.
