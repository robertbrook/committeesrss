defaultWritten Evidence from defaultthe defaultDeputy Mayor for Policing and Crime [CST0019]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultI have 
defaultbeen made aware of an allegat
defaulti
defaulton ma
defaultd
defaulte today by James Patrick about the challenge set by the Mayor's Office for Po
defaultli
defaultcing And Crime (MOPAC) to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to reduce 7 key neighbourhood crimes (the MOPAC 7) by 20 per cent over the pe
defaultriod 2012/13-2016/17. I understand tha
defaultt 
defaultyour comm
defaulti
defaultttee heard an 'anecdote' that th
defaulti
defaults target emerged following an error by a speechwr
defaulti
defaultter. This is categor
defaultic
defaultally untrue.
default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing consultat
defaulti
defaulton with the MPS a high-level target for a reduction in victim-based
default offences was defined in 2012 and was consulted on as part of our draft Police and Crime Plan in early 2013
default. 
defaultOur final plan was published in March. The plan, which includes further details about this challenge, can be found on the GLA webs
defaulti
defaultte (
defaultwww.london.gov.uk
default)
default. 
defaultI would be happy to write to your committee 
defaulti
defaultn more detail about the process for developing the MOPAC 7 
defaultif 
defaultthis would be helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultI also understand that allegations were made that the creation of the MOPAC 
default7 will lead to manipulation of crime figures, or victims being ignored, with crimes that fall with
defaulti
defaultn the 7 be
defaulti
defaultng categorised as different crime types- so called 'cuffing'
default. 
defaultThere 
defaultis 
defaultno evidence to support th
defaulti
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultYour w
defaulti
defaulttnesses specifically referred to offic
defaulters re-categorising robbery offences as theft from the person and burglary offences as criminal damage
default. 
defaultAs 
defaultboth theft from the per
defaults
defaulton and criminal damage are included in the MOPAC 7, along with 
defaultrobbery 
defaultan
defaultd 
defaultburglary, this would be entirely 
defaultcounterproductive. Cons
defaulti
defaultderation was given to this when the MOPAC 7 were developed.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith regard to sexual offences, we have set no targets on these and so it is 
defaulti
defaultncorrect to suggest that MOPAC targets are driving inappropriate behaviour. In fact, we have 
defaultcelebrated 
defaultincreased 
defaultreporting of these offences 
defaultin 
defaultthe light of significant levels of underreporting.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, I entirely reject the suggestion that the only way the MPS can meet the challenge we 
defaulthave set them 
defaultis 
defaultby 'fudging' the figures. The ambition is
default a challenging one, but it 
defaulti
defaults manageable, and good progress is be
defaulti
defaultng made as we seek to ensure that Lon
defaultd
defaulton 
defaultis 
defaultthe safest big city in the world.
