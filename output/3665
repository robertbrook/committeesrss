[normal]Written Evidence from [bold]the [bold]Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime [CST0019][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I have 
[normal]been made aware of an allegat
[normal]i
[normal]on ma
[normal]d
[normal]e today by James Patrick about the challenge set by the Mayor's Office for Po
[normal]li
[normal]cing And Crime (MOPAC) to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to reduce 7 key neighbourhood crimes (the MOPAC 7) by 20 per cent over the pe
[normal]riod 2012/13-2016/17. I understand tha
[normal]t 
[normal]your comm
[normal]i
[normal]ttee heard an 'anecdote' that th
[normal]i
[normal]s target emerged following an error by a speechwr
[normal]i
[normal]ter. This is categor
[normal]ic
[normal]ally untrue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following consultat
[normal]i
[normal]on with the MPS a high-level target for a reduction in victim-based
[normal] offences was defined in 2012 and was consulted on as part of our draft Police and Crime Plan in early 2013
[normal]. 
[normal]Our final plan was published in March. The plan, which includes further details about this challenge, can be found on the GLA webs
[normal]i
[normal]te (
[normal]www.london.gov.uk
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]I would be happy to write to your committee 
[normal]i
[normal]n more detail about the process for developing the MOPAC 7 
[normal]if 
[normal]this would be helpful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I also understand that allegations were made that the creation of the MOPAC 
[normal]7 will lead to manipulation of crime figures, or victims being ignored, with crimes that fall with
[normal]i
[normal]n the 7 be
[normal]i
[normal]ng categorised as different crime types- so called 'cuffing'
[normal]. 
[normal]There 
[normal]is 
[normal]no evidence to support th
[normal]i
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Your w
[normal]i
[normal]tnesses specifically referred to offic
[normal]ers re-categorising robbery offences as theft from the person and burglary offences as criminal damage
[normal]. 
[normal]As 
[normal]both theft from the per
[normal]s
[normal]on and criminal damage are included in the MOPAC 7, along with 
[normal]robbery 
[normal]an
[normal]d 
[normal]burglary, this would be entirely 
[normal]counterproductive. Cons
[normal]i
[normal]deration was given to this when the MOPAC 7 were developed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With regard to sexual offences, we have set no targets on these and so it is 
[normal]i
[normal]ncorrect to suggest that MOPAC targets are driving inappropriate behaviour. In fact, we have 
[normal]celebrated 
[normal]increased 
[normal]reporting of these offences 
[normal]in 
[normal]the light of significant levels of underreporting.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, I entirely reject the suggestion that the only way the MPS can meet the challenge we 
[normal]have set them 
[normal]is 
[normal]by 'fudging' the figures. The ambition is
[normal] a challenging one, but it 
[normal]i
[normal]s manageable, and good progress is be
[normal]i
[normal]ng made as we seek to ensure that Lon
[normal]d
[normal]on 
[normal]is 
[normal]the safest big city in the world.
