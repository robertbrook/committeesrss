"AFS0011&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT)&#xa0;Education Select Committee – Inquiry into Academies and Free Schools.&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA pre-requisite in any school for improved standards is:\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ngood/outstanding leadership and governance,\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ngood/outstanding teaching.\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have 40 academies in our chain. To bring about the accelerated improvement need\ned we changed either immediately or within weeks of conversion 26 out of our 40 h\neadteachers and ma\nny other senior staff\n. In most of our academies governance has also changed.  \n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing on from these changes there needs to be comprehensive professional development programmes for \nsenior staff\n, governors and teachers.\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf our academy chain provides a “snapshot” of education, it shows  starkly the task that needs to be carried out nationally. It begs the question about what Local Authorities (LAs) have been doing in the area of school improvement over the last couple of decades, as we are having to change totally the ethos and culture in most of our \nnew \nacademies.\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTKAT has four data collections a year: September, December, March/April,\n and July. All our academies report  on “looked after children” children on the SEN register,  English as an additional language and free school meals.  The data is collected by the academies and is available online to Regional Directors and the Educational Executive.  The data is interrogated rigorously and quality assured by TKAT.\n1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe governors have the responsibility of holding the academy to account for narrowing the gap. The governors have training to enable them to interpret the data and challenge where necessary.  If the governors do not have the expertise then we \nimmediately \neither put in a Regional Board to support governance or the TKAT Board approves additional skilled governors be appointed to governing bodies have training \n1.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe data from academies is also available to the Regional Directors and other \neducationalists at TKAT central, who use this information to challenge both senior leaders and governors.\n1.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is only when the right model of governance is in place that academies can truly be held to account.\n1.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf an academy is not narrowing the gap \nfor disadvantaged children (ie closing the attainment gap for free school meal and non-free school meal students) \nat an accelerated rate\n, then\n intervention/support is provided by TKAT. Immediately, six weekly targets are set for progress, which are then closely monitored and measured.\n If an academy does not meet these targets then senior leaders and/or governance are changed.\n1.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following tables show the accelerated progress our academies are making in terms of results at the end of both KS2 (primary schools) and KS4 (secondary schools).  \nPlease note that after two years with TKAT all schools show accelerated improvement.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DfE has an “Academies Group” which oversees all aspects of conversion of schools to academies.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTKAT does not market \nitself \nand has grown in two ways.  Firstly, by schools approaching TKAT directly and secondly, by the “B\nr\nokerage Division” of the DfE working with schools/LAs to recommend TKAT as a sponsor.  Most of TKAT’s academies have come through brokerage ie the governing body of the school has been “guided” by the DfE/LA to choose  TKAT.  This is a great improvement on the previous practice of “beauty parades” whereby\n a number of sponsors present\n to a governing body \nwith the governing body clearly tempted to choose\n the one least likely to cause much change. \n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll schools that are to become an academy have a “lead contact” at the DfE and this works well.  If a school that wants to become an academy is PFI the whole process of conversion is slowed dramatically.  I believe we are the only non-secular chain to have a Church School.  This was a long process and my understanding is that this is going to be a rare occurrence, if it happens at all.  The Diocese has to give approval and this is now being withheld.\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome Local A\nuthorities\n (LAs) have dragged their feet in supporting schools to become academies and some have been quite hostile, this is slowly changing.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \napparent \nself interest of some LAs in either preventing or slowing down the process of their “failing” schools moving to academy status, seems to indicate they do not have the pupils’ interests at heart.\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTKAT has taken over “failing schools” in more than one authority that have been failing for generations with absolutely no support or intervention.  \n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DfE works well with sponsors but there\n has been a sea\n change by Ministers away from sponsors with large chains to creating more sponsors with smaller chains.  The cost effectiveness of smaller chains and their models of school improvement need to be scrutinized closely.\n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs an organization we regularly share all our data/information \nopenly \nwith both the DfE and Ofsted (I believe we are the only chain to do this).  However, I do believe that neither the DfE nor Ofsted understand how a large chain like TKAT operates.   A \nshort term \nsecondment to TKAT by someone from the DfE or Ofsted m\nay give a greater understanding of how we operate.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently, the Secretary of State monitors the progress of academies \nthrough national data; DfE official and adviser visits and Ofsted reports.  When an academy has not made accelerated progress over a period of time (often a year) then a pre-warning notice is served.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom our experience it appears that the DfE and Ofsted do not work together or coordinate their work.  For example, an academy can go into special measures and not be given a pre-war\nning notice yet \n schools\n, not in category, \n can be visited by a DfE official and adviser and given a pre\n-\n warning notice.\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf an academy chain has “taken over” a failing school in a September then due diligence will normally have shown that the senior leadership and governance are failing.  The first task is to remove and replace the headteacher and  governing body.  Many of the staff will not know what “good/outstanding” looks like so a comprehensive and intensive model of professional development needs to be put in place.  Some staff will rise to the challenge of being held accountable for their classroom practice whilst others will decide to leave.  This exercise has to be followed up with a recruitment process.  It is quite possible for a school to join an academy chain, with poor results but a “satisfactory” or even “good” Ofsted report from 2 or 3 years ago.  The school could well dip further before it improves so sponsors should be given a minimum of two years to show accelerated progress.\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the programme expands the DfE/Ofsted will have to understand more about how academy chains work and the quality assurance and school improvement programmes they have in place.  TKAT is currently working with Ofsted on joint inspections of a number of our academies to see what we can learn from each other.   At the moment neither the DfE nor Ofsted understand the effectiveness of our QA and school improvement model.\n  \n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith the range of data now available to the DfE, Ofsted, Local Authorities and Schools it is very easy to track any under-performing sc\nhool. However, a regionally elected board, comprising of successful academy headteachers, with a DfE appointed chairman could be the body with powers of intervention and support as the system gradually moves to a self-regulatory system.\n The logic sho\nuld be as academies improve and standards rise  less intervention should be required. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll academies are accountable to their local community and the local community elect the local councillors.  Therefore all academies should be held to account by the local authority for the progress of the academy.  Essex has produced a “Memorandum of Understanding” which encompasses this accountability.  TKAT openly shares its data with local authorities and where we have a good relationship with the LA then the \nLA supplies us with information they hold centrally on the schools\n.  Other LAs \nare not so forthcoming.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcademy chains are essential to the new landscape as they:\n&#xa0;\n5.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nhave models of school improvement that work; \n5.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nare changing the culture in failing schools that have been failing for generations within the LA; \n5.1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncan lead the way by showing new sponsors the examples of good practice \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere is more accountablitiy now\n than there ever was under the LA.  Each \nTKAT academy is accountable to its\n governing body.  Each governing body has the right skill set and has had appropriate training. The governing body is accountable to the TKAT Board, which analyses data regularly on all its academies.  This ensures that there are no surprises and that any intervention is brought in at an early stage.\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, TKAT is accountable to the LA, DfE and Ofsted.\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernance has been an issue at all levels.  In October 2012 TKAT commissioned Deloittes’ to carry out a review of the company and suggest the models of governance needed.  We have implemented their recommendations which could be a template for other academy chains. Our model of a small (7) but highly qualified Board, with an Executive Chairman\n,\n is central to our model of governance.  We have separated out the strategic lead of the company, through the Board and the operational side, led by the CEO.\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have two sub-committees: Audit &amp; Risk chaired by a non-executive director, who has 20 years experience with J P Morgan, and a Remuneration &amp; Nomination Committee which reviews the salaries and performance of senior executives as well as well as agreeing a shadow structure as part of succession planning.  Audit &amp; Risk monitor the finance but also monitor risk.  The Corporate Risk Register is owned by the A&amp;R committee, with only the top 6 risks being taken to the Board.  There is a process of escalation of risk from the initial due diligence carried out on any school wishing to become a TKAT academy through the school risk register to the corporate risk register.  There is a clearly defined escalation process for risk .\n  We believe that this is a more business-like approach than might be seen anywhere else in the academy chain world.\n&#xa0;\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt academy level we have taken an approach to governance depending on need. For example in, Thanet and Chichester where governance needed to be strengthened we have set up regional boards with clearly defined terms of reference, focusing on holding the academies to account.  These Regional Boards have a strong Chairman, who may not be from the area.\n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are rolling this model of governance out to our schools in Hampshire and Crawley.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcademy status is appropriate for clusters of primary schools, a single small primary school joining a secondary academy trust or a large primary school on its own.\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany, possibly most\n,\n primary schools have a dependency culture on the LA. In some cases this may have been actively encouraged by the LA.  In the majority of cases the finance/business manager in a primary school would not have the skills required to manage the audit and finance function in an academy.  They are often part-time and not qualified for the role. This means that either a comprehensive and intense training programme needs to be put in place or a “Finance Director” with the required skills is appointed across a number of primary schools.\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are major savings to be made through having a comprehensive procurement policy for all the academies.  TKAT’s is currently in draft form. Many of our academies do not have the experience or expertise in negotiating “value for money” contracts. This expertise lies at the centre of TKAT through the Chief Finance Officer.  However, there are already examples where we have made savings for our academies, which releases funding to be reinvested \nby the academies \nin the core business of teaching and learning.\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWebsites The cost of an average website with the latest functionality is around 5-10k each.\n&#xa0;\n TKAT has negotiated a cost of 2.5k for each of our academies websites which is funded centrally and offered to all our academies as a zero cost.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLicensing TKAT hold a central Microsoft Licence Agreement.\n&#xa0;\n Each of our academies are encouraged to join our licencing programme as they will achieve better pricing than through many of their usual resellers.\n&#xa0;\n We estimate that across 25 academies, we have saved around 10-15k on licensing costs. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, all full time staff at each of the academies signed up to our licensing programmes are entitled to a free copy of Microsoft Office, (worth around £100 per person).\n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProcurement \nWhen procuring hardware we encourage academies to use our preferred procurement channel, ESPO (Eastern Shires Procurement Organisation).\n&#xa0;\n This organisation has more than thirty years of experience in offering a centralised procurement service and can provide TKAT with assurance of compliance with the EU Procurement Directive. It is also worth noting that ESPO is run on a not for profit basis.\n&#xa0;\n As ESPO have pre-negotiated contracts with the large computer manufacturers such as Dell, HP and Lenovo they are able to provide our academies with pricing that simply wouldn’t be available through an everyday reseller.\n&#xa0;\n During the summer of this year, an academy obtained 3 quotes for an identical spec computer through the normal suppliers they use.\n&#xa0;\n We (TKAT) requested a quote from ESPO/Dell who came in just under £80 cheaper per unit.\n&#xa0;\n Based on a collective total of 500 pcs, this saving equated to around 40k.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf we are going to raise standards then a failing primary joining a strong and successful trust, with a track record of school improvement\n,\n is the way forward.\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFailing primary schools could remain with the LA.  However our evidence and experience shows \nclearly \nthis does not work.\n&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
