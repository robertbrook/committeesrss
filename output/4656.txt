[[[&#xa0;]]]One of the problems in commenting on whether academies narrow the gap for disadvantaged children is that information is increasingly difficult to obtain. &#xa0;The information on GCSE results has changed and only recently has the performance of children on free school meals been included. &#xa0;The information on the DfE website is more difficult to find, which means that individuals have greater difficulty in challenging the misinformation given out by Ministers.&#xa0;However, comparing the percentages of the SEN figures for academies between 2008 and 2010 is interesting. &#xa0;It shows that, on average, Academies are reducing the percentages of children who have special needs.&#xa0;Yr of openingAverage change in SEN 2008-2010Average Change in St or SA+ 2008 - 20102002-5.2%-11.5%2003-3.5%-1.8%2004-1.7%-0.5%2005-4.4%-2.6%2006-9.4%-9.3%2007-7.5%-5.0%&#xa0;Some academies stand out in terms of the drop in the %age of those who were statemented or on school action plus: Harris Academy, East Dulwich - 12.4%;John Medejski Academy, -18.3%; Paddington Academy, -19.3%; Havelock Academy, -10.6%. &#xa0;&#xa0;Those which stick out for an overall drop in special needs are: St Aidan's Academy, -21%; Harris Academy, South Norwood, -15%; Havelock Academy, - 15%; New Line Learning, - 12%.
