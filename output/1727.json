"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence\n from Flybe (TIC 073)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1 \nFlybe is Europe’s largest regional airline and the UK’s number one domestic airline. Employing more than 2\n,5\n00 staff,\n the Flybe brand c\nurrently operate\ns\n \n190\n routes from\n a total of\n 112 departure points, 34 UK and 78\n European airports\n in \n23\n countries and carried more th\nan 7 million passengers in 2012.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nI\nncluded within the Flybe brand is o\nur franchise partner, Loganair, who serve the\n geographically isolated communities of the \nHighlands and Islands\n. Loganair operate their aircraft in Flybe livery and fly 27 routes from 11 airports\n,\n with four\n \nof its \nintra-UK\n routes covered by \nPublic Service Obligation (PSO) agreements.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nWhile the \nc\nall for evidence focusses solely on bus, rail and car, \nFlybe believes there is an important role for \naviat\nion in providing reliable \nand frequent transport services for \nisolated\n communities\n.\n This response aims to briefly outline the importance of air services for those communities and is something \non which \nwe \nwould be h\nappy to provide oral evidence\n should the committee think it would be helpful.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1 Aviation, in contrast to most other forms of public transport,\n \npays its own way\n and i\nn terms of infrastructure investment – both by airports and airlines – the industry receiv\nes little or no public subsidy.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nWe we\nlcome the government’s announcement establishing the \nRegional Air Connectivity fund\n,\n but the £10million being set aside to support \nto ensure that regions outside the Hig\nh Speed Rail 2 network will\n benefit from stronger transport links\n is small beer compare\nd to the public\n subsidy given to rail and bus.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 We support the government’s \ncommitment to re-balancing the economy away from the south-east and believe that greater support for regional aviation \ncan be an important tool in that rebalancing.\n \nFlybe has commissioned a study from Oxford Economics to explore the impact of regional aviation and connectivity on GDP, the relationship between regional aviation and growth, inward investment, business supply-chains, tourism and employment. The report wi\nll be \nready in the autumn and we trust \nwill help \ninform the debate.\n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nA measure of how the regions – not only ‘isolated’ communities – have lost connectivity over the years is best exemplified by the statistics relating to access to London Heathrow airport. \nOnly six UK cities (Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Mancheste\nr and Newcastle) \ncurrently \nhave access to Heathrow, compared to some 20 airports\n (in\ncluding the likes of Inverness, Newquay, Plymouth and Humberside)\n \nthat \nhad such access in 1990\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.5 \nWe fear that \nwithin two years London Gatwick will have gone the same w\nay\n, given \nthe CAA’s failure to uphold Flybe’s complaint against London Gatwick’s owners following price rises of 102% over a five year period. Despite the plainly unreasonable and discriminatory nature of such rises, the CAA concluded that Gatwick’s object\nive in restructuring its charges to ‘increase the efficient use of its s\ningle runway’ was justifiable. \n&#xa0;\n2.6 The challenges that isolated communities face as a result are even greater, given the need for two and sometimes three flights to reach an internat\nional destination. Airlines like ourselves try to assist our passengers wherever possible by operating direct routes to \ninternational hubs, such as Exeter to Paris CDG or Inverness to Amsterdam. This enables them to access global airports and negates the n\need for hours spent on the road driving to say London Heathrow or Birmingham. \nMore direct routes could be introduced were the funding available.\n&#xa0;\n2.7 Another alternative Flybe has developed is the Manchester hub.\n Intro\nduced in March 2012, we\n created a regi\nonal network hub by optimising scheduling options through Manchester airport, meaning that Flybe passengers instantly benefitted from an additional 86 regional point-to-point connections.\n \nBy working with Manchester Airport to streamline connectivity and re\nduce minimum connecting times to as little as 35 minutes, Flybe significantly added to the choice of our domestic flights, giving passengers an affordable choice of multiple day returns throughout the UK. While the hub can never be, and does not seek to be\n, a rival to Heathrow, it has created a long-haul alternative to for the UK’s regional communities, allowing them to access flight connections to the rest of the world offered from Manchester Airport.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1 \nAir Passenger Duty is a barrier to economic growth. It is well documented that the UK has the highest aviation tax in the world – a seriously short-sighted policy for an island nation. Indeed, the government themselves have explicitly acknowledged that APD\n constrains demand, evidenced by their decision \nin 2011 \nto approve a reduction in Continental’s APD from Belfast International to Newark in order to retain the service.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nAs can be seen from the table below, the numbers of UK domestic air \npassengers has\n fallen by more than a fifth\n since 2007-08. While this drop has been in part the product of the recession and continuing economic challenges, the fact that APD for a domestic flight was £5 per passenger per flight in 2007-08 and is now £13 per passenger pe\nr flight has undoubtedly had an impact.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYear&#xa0;\n2007-08\n&#xa0;\n2008-09\n&#xa0;\n2009-10\n&#xa0;\n2010-11\n&#xa0;\n2011-12\n&#xa0;\n2012-13\n&#xa0;07/08 – 11/12 Total domestic passengers&#xa0;\n25,326,857\n&#xa0;\n23,579,169\n&#xa0;\n22,060,930\n&#xa0;\n20,275,085\n&#xa0;\n20,172,440\n&#xa0;\n19,970,996\n&#xa0;- 21.1%&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nFlybe commissioned an \neconomic analysis by Oxera examining the regional impact of APD in 2011. The study showed, amongst many other conclusions, that a reduction in APD for the regions, but not London, would have relatively little impact on London itself - mainly because the pr\noportionate impact on regional airports of a small percentage of passengers switching from London is quite substantial\n for those regional airports\n. We would be happy to share the full report with the \nCommittee\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nWe argued strongly in our response to th\ne Treasury’s 2011 consultation that any reform of the banding structure of APD must remove the inherent unfairness that means UK domestic passengers pay the tax on both legs of their journey, while those flying abroad pay just once.  The fact that, for exa\nmple, a return passenger travelling between Glasgow and Belfast City (208 miles) pays double the tax that someone flying between Glasgow and Dalaman in Eastern Turkey does (4,086 miles) is inequitable. \n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nAlthough the government decided against such an \namendment, Flybe still believes that this ‘double hit’ must be addressed in order to safeguard UK domestic aviation and UK \nregional economic competitiveness. The practical effect of APD on a predominantly domestic operator \nlike Flybe was that, during 2012-\n13\n, the airline paid some £\n70\n million in APD to the Treasu\nry, some 18% of our UK ticket revenue.\n&#xa0;\n3.6 \nAPD is, of course, not the only barrier to growth for the industry – excessively high airport landing charges, the recession and the stubbornly high cost \nof fuel all make for a challenging environment – but it is something that impacts more heavily on UK airlines than their European counterparts. As the biggest airline at Inverness airport, Flybe and its passengers clearly benefit from the current exemption\n on APD. However, it seems only reasonable that the impact\n on other transport isolated\n areas of the UK, for example\n Northern Ireland and Cornwall are a\nfforded similar exemptions\n and we would encourage the Committee to bear this, and the other points outlin\ned above, in mind during its deliberations. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
