[normal]&#xa0;[bold]HS2 [bold]FOLLOW-UP[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Tr
[normal]ansport
[normal] Committee is to examine the Economic Assessment of the HS2 project
[normal] and, in particular, the KPMG Economic Assessment..
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have been a consultant, banker and practitioner in infrastructure and energy project finance, - PFI, PPP and the like, - for the last 
[normal]30 years or more, with both UK and wide overseas experience.  I have also given Seminars and Courses on this topic in more than 40 countries 
[normal]over
[normal] the last 5 years.

[normal]Comment[bold]ary[bold]:[bold]              [bold]              [bold]The Green Book:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. the discount rate used to express future costs and revenues in 
[normal]  
[normal]    
[normal]today’s values; and
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the use of the concept of “Optimism Bias”.
[normal]Hence, in choosing a discoun
[normal]t rate to bring future values back to today, we choose our "cost of money", or thereabouts. Mathematically, 
[normal]arriving at  Present Values 
[normal]it is compound interest, 
[normal]- 
[normal]which we all learn 
[normal]in GCSE 
[normal]at school, 
[normal]- 
[normal]working backwards!
[normal][Looking at it a different way, a “real” discount rate of 3.5% is equivalent today to around 
[normal]6.2
[normal]% “nominal” after adding inflation (2.7%), compared with the Government’s actual, i.e. “nominal”, cost of money = 
[normal]3.7
[normal]%!].
[normal]Is it not surprising that they[bold], [bold]- [bold]the[bold] DfT[bold] et al.,[bold] [bold]- [bold]get their sums and comparisons of alternatives wrong???[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold] [bold][* = before 2003, a “real
[normal]”
[normal] discount rate of 6% p.a. was imposed
[normal] by Treasury
[normal], which was equivalent to a rate of 8.5 - 9% “nominal”
[normal] rate, when at th
[normal]at
[normal] time the long-term cost of borrowing for Government was around 5.5-6%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Is it not surprising, therefore, that for many PFI projects, - which push out into the future the payments Government has to make to finance the assets, like a cre
[normal]dit card,
[normal] 
[normal]- the projected Present Value costs for the PFI option were always going to look cheaper than conventional funding? Many PFI hospital projects suffered through such flawed decision-making.
[normal]The same prognosis can be applied to recent rail franchis
[normal]es, e.g. West Coast Main
[normal]-
[normal]Line.
[normal]]
[normal]Based on a consultant’s report of a range of projects 
[normal]undertaken in 1980- 1990’s, Government/HM Treasury derived multiples, which they would apply to cost estimates. Sometimes this multiple was applied to the estimates before making adjustments for risk, sometimes afterwards**
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal][**. there is a mathematical d
[normal]ifference. Network Rail and HM Treasury for a time applied OB both ways respectively, and both claimed they were right whichever way they used it!!!]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion:[bold]Given the above, is it not time to question the use of the Green Book? I hope so, otherwise many more major UK infrastructure projects will be surrounded by controversy.

[normal]n 
[normal]June 2013 
[normal]HM Treasury published an update of the 2003 
[normal]edition of the Green Book
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]O
[normal]n Jan 27, 2003 
[normal]I alerted 
[normal]HM Treasury 
[normal](&amp; HM
[normal] 
[normal]Treasury ac
[normal]knowledged
[normal] the 
[normal]alert
[normal]) 
[normal]that 
[normal]there was an error
[normal], 
[normal]- 
[normal]or, possibly, just a misprint!, - 
[normal]in one of the discount rates quoted in the Green Book. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]That error is still there today, 10 years on! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I leave 
[normal]HM 
[normal]Treasury
[normal] until 2023 to find it!!
