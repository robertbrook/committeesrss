[[[Written evidence from West Dorset District Council]]]

[[[ (TIC004)]]]&#xa0;Referring directly to your suggested bullet points:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?At the moment, very poorly! Local Authorities and local councillors have much information on the locality and need of people requiring extra care packages, but this information is not used (or is not made available) to transport providers. Health and Social Care providers, the Voluntary sector, School transport providers, Church and other local community organisations should be asked to pool their information.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?Again, liaison between different agencies would be enormously helpful. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?Affordability. More publicity as to when buses are available is vital as is co-ordinated thinking as to when people with additional needs are in need. It is recognised that it is uneconomic to provide empty buses but ‘use it or lose it’ initiatives can be helpful if they are continually repeated – though I recognise diminishing returns here!&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?Direct contact with those identified by the various care-providing agencies and voluntary groups should help identify need and enable individuals to get together so that they can all be transported together.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?Depends how isolated – and how needy! Taxi provided by the LTA, as happens with schoolchildren, could be a way forward.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?Ask local groups to get together to ‘save their local service’&#xa0;July 2013&#xa0;
