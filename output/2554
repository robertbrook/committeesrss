Written evidence submitted by Sarah [bold]Teather[bold] MP (LAI 0071)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]I am the Member of Parliament for Brent Central, representing one of the most ethnically diverse 
[normal]constituencies in the UK. I am Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees and in June this year was fortunate enough to secure a Backbench Business debate in the House of Commons on the subject of legal aid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]The proposed introduction of a r[bold]esidence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1 
[normal]              
[normal]The proposed residence test will leave many vulnerable individuals without the means to access the legal system. Individuals who hav
[normal]e a legal right to challenge decisions made about them will be unable to do so. In effect, these individuals will be unequal before the law.
[normal] 
[normal]While I recognise and welcome the number of exceptions to the residence test that the Government announced in their
[normal] response to the Ministry of Justice’s consultation 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid: delivering a more credible and efficient system
[normal], 
[normal]even in its amended form it will result in many vulnerable 
[normal]individuals 
[normal]being unable to access the justice system. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Schedule 1
[normal] of the The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) sets out the civil cases for which legal aid is currently available. During the course of LASPO, the Government argued that the types of cases included in Schedule 1 are those t
[normal]hat most need legal aid. During a House of Commons debate on 6 September 2011, the then Minister for HM Courts Service and Legal Aid stated that “schedule 1 [of the bill] makes legal aid available for the most serious damages claims against public authorit
[normal]ies” and that 
[normal]“the Bill ensures that funding may be made available for claims regarding a breach of statutory duty or a breach of convention ri
[normal]ghts against public authorities”
[normal]. The introduction of the residence test would mean that many individuals would not be eligible for legal aid even in those cases which the Government has previously accepted 
[normal]are the most serious. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Among those groups that would be negatively affected 
[normal]by the residence test are migrant children. Those children who do not meet the resident test criteria would be unable to receive civil legal aid for cases relating to special educational needs, community care for children in need and in care, children at r
[normal]isk from gang-related violence, child victims of sexual offences, and judicial review. The Ministry of Justice should produce a full Child Impact Assessment of the residence test.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Women are also likely to be disproportionately affected by the residenc
[normal]e test. As a group, they are high 
[normal]users of civil legal aid: over 55% of clients for civil representation are female
[normal]. Additionally, women whose
[normal] status is dependent on a spouse or partner would, in most cas
[normal]es, not qualify as they would not have
[normal] been legally
[normal] resident in the country for 12 months.
[normal] 
[normal]Those women who fail to meet the proposed residence test would not be eligible for support in cases that involve sexual offences, protection from harassment, equality and discrimination claims, judicial review, welfa
[normal]re benefit appeals and cases involving the special education needs of any dependent children.
[normal] Implementing the residence test would discriminate against women who have not been legally resident for 12 months and would also cause problems for women who do n
[normal]ot have access to the documentation they need to prove their status. I believe that women who have been legally resident for less than 12 months have the same right to civil legal recourses when they are fighting discrimination, seeking protection from har
[normal]assment or 
[normal]seeking recompense following a sexual assault as any other woman.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Also impacted by the residence test will be those individuals seeking asylum in the UK.
[normal] The test as originally proposed would have meant that i
[normal]ndividuals whose claim for asyl
[normal]um is refuse
[normal]d but who cannot be removed would have
[normal] be
[normal]en
[normal] unable to access legal aid to make a new claim. 
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]next steps
[normal] document, at paragraph 118, welcomely 
[normal]states that under the updated proposals legal aid will continue to be available for individuals su
[normal]bmitting a fresh claim or making a judicial review in respect to a previous decision. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]Also welcome is the concession that for those individuals granted refugee status, the starting date for the 12 months continuous residence will be the time at which
[normal] the application for asylum was made, rather than the time it was granted, which was the case under the original proposals
[normal].
[normal] However, this approach still seems counterintuitive as it means that the individuals who have the strongest cases for refugee status
[normal] will not be eligible for 
[normal]civil legal aid for almost a year, whereas those individuals who are granted refugee status after successive appeals might never cease to be eligible for support
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The denial of legal aid following a successful asylum claim is part
[normal]icularly worrying as it is frequently at this stage that individuals experience a gap in the support they are entitled to from the state and resorting to legal proceedings is often necessary. A further area for concern is that the 
[normal]next steps
[normal] document is un
[normal]clear about whether the 12 month period starts from the time the initial claim is made or when the successful claim is made. 
[normal]If it is the latter, this would disadvantage those individuals who are granted asylum but w
[normal]hose initial claim was refused.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]There are also practical difficulties with the proposed residence test. The proposal put forward would require legal aid providers to check the immigration status of prospective 
[normal]clien
[normal]ts, a system that closely resembles that currently used by employers. Whi
[normal]le the Ministry of Justice documentation makes this appears to be a fairly straightforward and efficient system, my experience as a constituency MP suggests otherwise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]The British immigration system is extremely complex and there are many different ty
[normal]pes of immigration status and, as a result, a vast array of status documents. Whereas n
[normal]ow people are issued with Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs), previously they were issued with 
[normal]paper Immigration Status Documents (ISDs) and some have either stamps or v
[normal]ignettes in their passports. As an MP who has dealt with thousands of immigration cases since being elected, I still come across unfamiliar documents. I do not believe that legal aid providers can or should be expected to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of
[normal] immigration documents.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]              
[normal]Other possible issues relating to the ability of legal aid providers to check documents include cases where
[normal] a person is granted indefinite leave to enter, 
[normal]in which cases 
[normal]the 
[normal]passport 
[normal]stamp will have an expiry date.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The expiry date is the date by which the person must enter the UK, however a lay person may interpret it as expiration of their leave.
[normal] Furthermore, when an individual 
[normal]submits an application to the Home Office, they are requ
[normal]ired to submit their original status documents and will only have an acknowledgment sent to them.
[normal] This would prevent that individual from being able to prove their eligibility.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Under the proposals, f
[normal]irms carrying out prison law work will have to have criminal legal aid contracts. This will almost certainly spell the end of specialist niche prison law practices. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prisoners already have to exhaust internal complaints remedies b
[normal]efore they can apply for a court to review the legality of a Prison Service decision, and the courts regularly find such decisions to have been unlawful despite them having been maintained by the complaints procedures. The courts have ruled, for example, t
[normal]hat it is unlawful for the Prison Service not to provide indeterminate prisoners with rehabilitative courses so that they can reduce their risk and progress to release, and that decisions on recategorisation and transfer have a direct impact on liberty bec
[normal]ause they can impede the prisoner's progress to release, as well as confining them to more severe conditions and difficulties maintaining family relations than may be justifiable. Such rulings are in the wider interests of society as well as to the individ
[normal]ual prisoners, and ironically are likely to have saved considerable financial and other costs in the longer term.
[normal] Also, most of prison law will be removed from scope, including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Resettlement Work:
[normal] [bold]This includes w
[normal]ork done 
[normal]to secure timely access to off
[normal]ending behaviour courses and to education and employment opportunities; ensuring that local authorities have services in place for young, elderly and disabled prisoners who are approaching release; ensuring the probation service has conducted its assessmen
[normal]t, and checked release addresses.
[normal] This could result in extra costs as prisoners fail to be released on time.
[normal] For example,
[normal] A, 15 years old, contacted the Howard League through a children’s advocate. He had behaved well in custody and was told he could be re
[normal]leased early from his secure children’s home in two days time provided he has somewhere suitable to live. He could not go home to his dad as the local authority had obtained an ASBO restricting his movements on the estate where his dad lived. In fact, he w
[normal]as in prison in part for breaching the ASBO after his foster care placement had broken down and the local authority had advised him to return to his dad’s. The Howard League for Penal Reform were able to write 
[normal]an urgent letter to the local authority remind
[normal]ing them of their duties. As a result he was released to a children’s home.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Disciplinary hearings:
[normal] [bold]These can impose hefty penalties on prisoners, or alter conditions of detention including solitary confinement or added days. Legal aid would remain whe
[normal]n the Tarrant criteria are met – i.e. adjudications dealt with by a Prison Governor, but these are very rare. Proceedings are highly formal and legalistic. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally, the removal of most prison law from the scope of legal aid will place extra burd
[normal]ens on the Prison Ombudsman. However, the judgements of the Ombudsman are not binding, nor does it have the same powers as the court to award damages or to require remedial action. The Government should continue to provide legal aid for prison law cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The process of judicial review is a 
[normal]key check and balance on the actions 
[normal]and decisions 
[normal]of 
[normal]public bodies
[normal]. The ability to instruct legal representation is necessary for 
[normal]the vast majority of
[normal] individuals to 
[normal]affectively 
[normal]access the judicial review process.
[normal] 
[normal]The approach outlined in the 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid 
[normal]consultation
[normal] will make it more difficult for people to find representation because of the increased risks to providers. As judicial review processes are “front-loaded” (i.e. most of the work for the case is done prior to the applicat
[normal]ion for permission), the proposals mean that providers will be risking not getting paid for substantial amounts of work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]This includes instances where claims would have previously been settled before reaching court as the local authority o
[normal]r
[normal] governmen
[normal]t department in question agrees to settle. The effect will be to make providers more litigious to ensure that they are paid, rather than relying on seeking cost orders. This will mean that cases that would not have reached court previously will now have to
[normal] be heard by the court, putting extra strain on court time.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Providers will also not be able to take on as many judicial review cases as they do currently as the increased risks will not make it financially viable. The outcomes of permission applicat
[normal]ions are hard to predict and events can overtake proceedings. This means that even cases which appear clear cut carry a degree of risk. Providers will have to reduce their judicial review caseload in order to reduce their exposure to risk. 
[normal]Following the co
[normal]nsultation, t
[normal]he
[normal] 
[normal]Government i
[normal]ntends to modify this proposal by introducing
[normal] discretion to permit the Legal Aid Agency to pay providers in certain cases
[normal] 
[normal]concluding prior to a permission decision without a costs order or agreement.
[normal] However, this is unlikely to
[normal] provide the certainty that providers require in order to take on cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]The financial savings of this proposal are, according to the impact assessment, just £1 million from a legal aid budget of nearly £2 billion. The human cost, however, is far grea
[normal]ter 
[normal]and t
[normal]he overall impact of this proposal will be to prevent individuals being able to challenge the decisions taken by local authorities and government departments. The i
[normal]mportance of this change should not
[normal] be overlooked. 
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold]The proposal that legal [bold]aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]In the 
[normal]next steps
[normal] documents, the Government argue that public funding should not be expended on cases that do not have at least a 50% chance of success. 
[normal]Borderli
[normal]ne cases (those cases of which it is not possible to tell the likely success of the case) are
[normal], under the Government’s proposals,
[normal] removed from scope. Borderline cases are those which are not unclear but, by reason of disputed law, fact or expert evidence, i
[normal]t is not possible to decide that the chances of success are greater than 50% or that the prospects for success are poor. Due to this uncertainty, these cases are sometimes very important as they are test cases
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]create precedents and in doing so clarify the
[normal] law. 
[normal]Preventing these cases from being brought will prevent legal assessment of the most important issues of the day, and will unfairly let the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment clarify the law when individuals cannot.
[normal] The Government should continue to fund borderline cases in 
[normal]the same way that it currently does.
