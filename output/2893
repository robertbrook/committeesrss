[normal]Conclusion
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1 THE BRITISH COUNCIL [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1[bold] 
[normal]The British Council creates international opportunities for the people of the UK and other countries and builds trust between them worldwide. 
[normal]We are on the ground in six continents and over 100 countries bringing international opportunity to life, every day. Each year we work with millions of people, connecting them with the UK, sharing our cultures and the UK’s most attractive assets: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]English, the Arts, Education and our ways of living and organising society. We have nearly 80 years’ experience of doing this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2[bold] 
[normal]We provide international opportunities to people living in isolated countries such as Burma, Iran and Zimbabwe, building trust in the UK and giving the people of these countries a voice that can be heard beyond their borders
[normal]. Our development work in fragile and conflict affected states helps build prosperity and security in vulnerable communities and generates trust in the people of the UK that is vital to our own prosperity and security.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2 OUR WORK IN BURMA[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1[bold] 
[normal]The British Council was established in Burma in 194
[normal]8
[normal] and has been active throughout Burma’s international isolation. We operate out of the Cultural Section of the British Embassy in Rangoon and a centre in Mandalay. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold] We deliver teaching, exams and library services in both Rangoon and Mandalay. In addition to lending services our libraries provide study space, a forum for civil society and support volunteer groups who provide services to under-privileged and vulnerable communities. Our libraries support a network of 19 community “Millennium Centres” with resources and programme and project delivery.   We also support local schools with 
[normal]our mobile lending library
[normal], and training and capacity-building for national and community libraries in English and librarianship. During Burma’s long isolation, our libraries provided a space for the free expression of ideas and uncensored access to the outside world through our classrooms and library. A quarter of a million users use our libraries every year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold] Wide-ranging changes in the political scene over the past 18 months present significant opportunities for increasing the level of engagement between Burma and the UK. Through our longstanding presence in Burma we have built a strong position of trust and have access to extensive networks across civil society
[normal], the Government and the business community to deliver programmes for pro-poor development. We have particularly strong ties with
[normal] the education sector giving us the capacity to make a very significant contribution to improving access and quality to education in Burma during this period of transition. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 [bold]As 
[normal]one of the very few organisations committed to and able to deliver in Burma, the
[normal] British Council is a key partner for the delivery of the UK’s strategic objectives for a peaceful transition from a military dominated administration to democratic, accountable government with respect for an independent judiciary and rule of law; 
[normal]improvements in respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and raising the economic and social prospects of ordinary people.. Our ability to deliver in-country makes us a favoured partner for DfID, the FCO, UKTI and international organisations seeking to achieve impact in Burma.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 [bold]There are significant challenges to progress in Burma, including poor infrastructure, land disputes and a lack of basic amenities such as electricity and running water. Ethnic and religious tensions are also prevalent in Burma with violent clashes occurring between the majority Buddhist and minority Muslim groups. 
[normal]The gulf between the rich and poor is a further source of social tensions. The democratic deficit created by years of repression and isolation impacts all levels of society – student politics, public hustings, activism in all its forms has been curtailed. 
[normal]Strengthening governance systems and building capacity in civil society are critical to providing stability during the political transition to democracy.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6 [bold]Our vision in Burma is:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3 PYOE PIN PROGRAMME[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 [bold]Pyoe Pin is a civil society strengthening programme funded by DFID and SIDA and managed by the British Council. It aims to strengthen the capacity of civil society in Burma to participate in decision making by supporting issues around which positive coalitions of civil society, private sector
[normal] and government can build. The p
[normal]rogramme works predominantly with local partners and stakeholders to support the facilitation of coalitions in the areas of 
[normal]rule of law, environment, 
[normal]health, education
[normal], and
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]economy, with the aim of contributing to the furthering of democratic and accountable governance in Burma.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] Given the longstanding presence of the British Council in Burma, and well established in the wider cultural and political context, we are the best placed UK agency to deliver this programme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold] The Pyoe Pin programme has had 
[normal]a 
[normal]significant impact 
[normal]in increasing access to decision making of civil society in areas of access to justice and legal services; land and forestry; HIV and non-state education policy and training; and rice production and fisheries.
[normal] We have worked with hundreds of Burmese and International Non-Governmental Organisations and Community Based Organisations over the last 
[normal]six
[normal] years, building the capacity of Burmese civil society to achieve accountable relationships with 
[normal]key actors – from 
[normal]change agents and organisations in 
[normal]local
[normal] communities
[normal], to private sector and government leaders
[normal]. 
[normal]The programme is making a difference in the relationship between the government and civil society. It has worked to improve the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable people through support for HIV/Aids groups, work with subsistence farmers and the promotion of land reform.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.[bold]4[bold] [bold]At the heart of Pyoe Pin is the 
[normal]building and 
[normal]strengthen
[normal]ing of
[normal] coalitions, advocacy, research and monitoring capabilities
[normal]. This is possible through an understanding of power and incentives that can link grass-roots organisations with actors with influence enabling real change
[normal]. 
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]innovative 
[normal]programme 
[normal]is a model that
[normal] 
[normal]could 
[normal]be applied to other countries
[normal] like Bangladesh.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]5[bold] Pyoe Pin
[normal] has received outstanding feedback from DfID over a number of years. 
[normal]Its impact should not just be seen in terms of things delivered, it is not a bricks and mortar programme. Instead it is the trust built in communities, the increased capacity of local organisations and institutions and the strengthened networks that together underpin the systematic change needed to build a strong, cohesive and democratic future for Burma. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6 [bold]Based on our experience with Pyoe Pin we would recommend
[normal] a continued 
[normal]focus
[normal] on civil society strengthening
[normal] by UK agencies. A
[normal]s government reform
[normal] continues
[normal], 
[normal]there are also significant
[normal] opportunit
[normal]ies
[normal] to do more work on the supply side of governance reform.
[normal] We also believe our experiences in the reform of land rights and forestry have valuable lessons to offer for Burma’s ambitions for the extractive industries and other priority areas for investment to ensure the profits of economic development benefit all of Burma’s people including the poorest and most vulnerable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4 OTHER BRITISH COUNCIL PROGRAMMES IN BURMA[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Education and society[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1 [bold]Since the official dissolution of the ruling military junta in 2011, the government of Burma has launched an extensive programme of liberalisation and democratisation. An important part of this programme has been increasing internationalisation, to reconnect Burma with its neighbours and the wider world to support economic renewal and growth. Many development agencies, national governments and universities are keen to support Burma and are bringing forward proposals to aid in the improvement of education in Burma in a variety of ways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 [bold]Education is one of Burma’s main development priorities. 
[normal] [bold]The Comprehensive Education Sector Review has completed its initial assessment of national education (at all levels) and is now embarking on the detailed review. The British Council is one of a number of international Development Partners actively involved in the CESR and is supporting it through the provision of UK consultancies in some of the key areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3[bold] 
[normal]The British Council 
[normal]is also actively supporting the two parliamentary committees which have been tasked to redraft the legislation for higher education and planning the revitalisation of Yangon University. Both these committees are chaired by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
[normal] 
[normal]In June 2013, the 
[normal]British Council
[normal] hosted its first policy dialogue in Naypyitaw, ‘Empowering Higher Education’. This saw policy-makers, government and civil society come together in a spirit of open debate on the future of Burma’s university sector. The two-day event was chaired by Aung San Suu Kyi, who commented 
[normal]“
[normal]‘Empowering Higher Education’ is the first time that all the different stakeholders have got together to discuss openly the issues in Burma’s higher education reform.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]Investment and support for the reform of the education sector by UK development partners has a major role to play in fostering Burma’s economic development. Up skilling the workforce through technical assistance and support for English language learning has a crucial role to play in building a self-sustaining economy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 [bold]The Myanmar-UK Alumni Network was established in 2012 
[normal]and is a social and professional network designed and developed by the British Council for Burmese nationals who have completed courses and programmes by studying either in the UK for at least three months or outside the UK as long as their qualifications are awarded by UK colleges or universities.
[normal] 
[normal]. 
[normal]The goal is to build a support network
[normal] 
[normal]for both past and future students and develop academic links between UK and Burmese institutions. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.5[bold] We deliver skills training for young people active in Burmese civil society to take an active role in shaping the future of Burma. Many of our trainees have taken up leading positions within their communities. We have been working with former political prisoners, including ‘the ’88 Generation’, to rebuild Burma’s Opposition to invigorate and build capacity in the political process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6 [bold]Through our Active Citizens and Skills for Social Entrepreneurs programmes, we are recognised as the main enabling partner for social enterprise in Burma and for the delivery of co-funded projects to promote the rule of law, human rights and responsible investment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7 [bold]Amatae is a two year DFID / SIDA-funded project that distributes operational or ‘core’ grants to domestic civil society organizations (CSOs). Amatae launched in January 2013, and aims:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8 [bold]Amatae works with organisations throughout Burma, engaging on social and political issues, and provides them with medium-sized grants (with an average size of around GBP £180K) to cover 1-2 year activity. Resource is directed towards a combination of organisational development and operational costs, to build a secure platform from which to conduct advocacy and the capacity to design internal development programmes.
[normal] 
[normal]Amatae’s support for sharing of good practice between mature and less experienced CSOs, and its resourcing of core activity, is crucial if Burma’s civil society is to meet the challenges and make the most of the opportunities ahead.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Arts [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.9[bold] We are making a valuable contribution to the lives of Burmese people through Arts. 
[normal]The British Council is delivering a literature programme called ‘Hidden Words, Hidden Worlds’ to raise the capacity of and knowledge and appreciation of ethnic writers in Burma.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are running workshops with photographers and film-makers in photojournalism and screenwriting with emerging Burmese film-makers through the Myanmar Motion Picture Organisation to give Burmese people a voice both at home but also in the wider world.  
[normal]Providing documentary makers and journalists with the advocacy skills to champion Human Rights and challenge politicians is one of the most important components in the process of democratic change. Using the power of film and the persuasive strength of audio-visual communication, we are creating a space for encouraging human rights discussions amongst the general public in Burma.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.10[bold] This year the British Council was the main sponsor of 
[normal]Yangon’s first ‘Human Rights, Human Dignity International Film Festival. W
[normal]e are working at all levels to promote human rights awareness and the principles of democracy in Burma. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]English [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.11 [bold]This year will see significant growth in our teacher training with the Ministry of Education. We aim to train 10,000 English teachers per year 
[normal]by placing 44 native speaker teacher trainers in
[normal] the 2
[normal]2
[normal] state teacher training colleges. By teaching the teachers we will reach 41,000 schools and improv
[normal]e
[normal] the life chances of two million children each year
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This initiative came about as a direct request from President Thein Sein during his state visit to the UK in July 2013. We plan to deliver against this request by allocating £2m of ODA over the coming two years with match-funding from DFID. In turn, DFID is seeking an expansion of Burma’s Accelerated Reform Facility, demonstrating our close ties and joint commitment to respond to demand in a period of rapid change. 
[normal]4.12 [bold]English has the potential to transform the career prospects of young Burmese. Around the world demand for English proficiency is rising, it is increasingly a key skill for businesses looking to grow and expand as it is the prevalent language of international commerce. Governments across the developing world are recognising the importance of English and are investing in schools and training to skill up the workforce.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5. CONCLUSION [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The British Council is working closely with DfID, the FCO and local and international partners on a range of projects in Burma. Through our work in civil society, education reform and the promotion of human rights we are helping build a better future for Burma. The joined up approach of the FCO, DfID and British Council in Burma is a model for the three organisations work around the world. It is critical that the UK and other international partners continue to work together as one in Burma to ensure as smooth a transition as possible to a free and prosperous future for her people. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The British Council’s work in civil society is helping build the capacity of the country as it moves towards a democratic future. We are working with all levels of civil society from community activists, students and social entrepreneurs, journalists and documentary makers, to the Government and Opposition, to lawyers to help build the infrastructure of a functioning democracy. By encouraging student debates and political discourse we are helping young people develop the skills they need to help shape their country’s future. By working with activists, film makers and journalists we are giving the people a voice that can hold the executive to account. By supporting Aung San Suu Kyi and the 88 Generation we are helping create a pluralistic democratic political system that can build a consensus on the future direction of the country. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We recognise the fragility of what has been achieved and that there remain very significant challenges ahead for Burma. We are particularly concerned over ethnic and religious tensions and believe this is an area where the UK can provide much needed assistance.
[normal] The Pyoe Pin programme includes a focus on social cohesion and inclusion but there is a need to scale up work in this area. Programmes like Active Citizens with their focus on community cohesion may also have a role to play.
[normal] 
[normal]Using the UK’s voice at the highest levels, we can push for education reforms to put an emphasis on building respect for difference and tolerance in classrooms. 
[normal]Building up state and local institutions to foster tolerance and respect for human rights is a key challenge for development agencies. We are cautiously optimistic that the Government and Opposition are committed to the long term investment and cultural and institutional reforms needed to rebuild the country’s economy and society. 
[normal]For example, o
[normal]ur work with the Government and Parliamentarians on reforming the school curriculum and raising standards in higher education has the potential to transform the life chances of an entire generation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The British Council has been working for a better future for Burma
[normal] since 1948 and we
[normal] committ
[normal]ed are
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] support
[normal]ing
[normal] her people
[normal] realise their aspirations for a free and prosperous future
