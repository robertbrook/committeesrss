[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from [bold]the [bold]London Assembly Transport Committee[bold] [bold](CYS0050)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I am writing, on behalf of the London Assembly Transport Committee, to 
[normal]provide
[normal] written
[normal] information on cycling safety
[normal] 
[normal]to inform the Transport Select Committ
[normal]ee’s oral evidence session on 2 December 2013. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This 
[normal]written 
[normal]submission 
[normal]details our relevant past work
[normal] on cycling safety
[normal] in relation to the 
[normal]three 
[normal]specific areas 
[normal]where the
[normal] Transport Select Committee would like views
[normal]: 1) whether cycling is safe
[normal], particular
[normal]ly in towns and cities
[normal]; 2) what government can do to improve cycling safety; and 3) whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users. 
[normal]The submission 
[normal]is
[normal] mainly
[normal] based on our
[normal] report 
[normal]Gearing
[normal] Up? An
[normal] 
[normal]investigation into safer
[normal] cycling in London 
[normal](November 2012
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]and a
[normal] 
[normal]full copy of 
[normal]this 
[normal]report is available 
[normal]online

[normal]1. [bold]Is cycling safe[bold], particularly in towns and cities[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In our report 
[normal]Gearing Up
[normal]?
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]we argued that,
[normal] although cycling is increasing in London, safety 
[normal]remain
[normal]s
[normal] a
[normal] cause for conc
[normal]ern.  D
[normal]espite 
[normal]improvements in the cyclist casu
[normal]al
[normal]ty rate between 2001 and 2006, we identified that the 
[normal]rate across all types of casualty (slight, serious and fatal) 
[normal]worsened between 2007 and 2010.  
[normal]After 2006 there was an 
[normal]increase in the number of 
[normal]cyclist 
[normal]casualties per million cycle journeys in London
[normal] and the
[normal] risk of injury to cyclists increased between 2007 and 2010. Moreover, T
[normal]ransport for London (
[normal]TfL
[normal])
[normal] failed to achieve its
[normal] original
[normal] target to improve cycle safety
[normal] and 
[normal]subsequently 
[normal]lowered its target. 
[normal] Ori
[normal]ginally 
[normal]TfL
[normal] aimed to reduce the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured (KSI) by 50 per cent by 2010 compared to the 1994-98 average, but the actual reduction achieved was 18 per cent. 
[normal]TfL
[normal] now has
[normal] 
[normal]a target to reduce all KSI casualties by 40 per cent
[normal] 
[normal]by 2020 
[normal]compared to the 2005-09 average. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We found cyclist
[normal] casualty 
[normal]rates in London compare
[normal]d
[normal] poorly to
[normal] those in 
[normal]other cities where cycling ha
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]also
[normal] 
[normal]increased
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]between
[normal] 2001 and 
[normal]2010
[normal],
[normal] New York recorded a drop of 72 per cent in the rate of cycl
[normal]ist KSIs
[normal] in central Manhattan
[normal] whereas in the same p
[normal]eriod in London the drop was 55 per cent on 
[normal]TfL’s
[normal] road network. This is based on an increase in cycling of 255 per cent in New York and 160 per cent in London. 
[normal]Elsewhere
[normal] higher cycling rates have led to fe
[normal]wer casualties. For example, in Copenhagen, as cycling grew by 50 per cent between 1995 and 2010 the risk of cycle casualties reduced four-fold. Although the Mayor believes the ‘safety in numbers’ effect will improve cycling safety in 
[normal]the capital
[normal], we found
[normal] this is not 
[normal]yet
[normal] evident. 
[normal]We, 
[normal]therefore
[normal],
[normal] concluded that it was
[normal] imperative for the Mayor and 
[normal]TfL
[normal] to make improving the safety of cyclists the top priority in all their cycling programmes.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. What [bold]can [bold]government do to improve cycling safety?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In our report 
[normal]Gearing Up?
[normal], 
[normal]we made 
[normal]clear the role central, regional and local government 
[normal]bodies 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] to play in improving
[normal] cycling safety
[normal] and encourage more cycling
[normal]. 
[normal] We expressed our support for the Mayor’s aspiration to increase cycling but suggested that
[normal] his 
[normal]target of 5 per cent cycling modal share by 2026 was too low and 
[normal]that the
[normal] upward cycling casualty trends could prevent more Londoners cycling. 
[normal] Indeed the 
[normal]Mayor and 
[normal]TfL’s
[normal] Cycle Safety Action Plan
[normal] (2010) recognises
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]concern about 
[normal]safety 
[normal]is
[normal] both the
[normal] most significant barrier for non-cyclists taking up cycling and stop
[normal]s
[normal] 10 per cent of existing cyclists cycling more.  We
[normal] 
[normal]recommended that the Mayor should establish a new target of 10 per cent cycling modal share by 2026 
[normal]and 
[normal]appoint a Cycling Commissioner
[normal] to champion cycling. 
[normal] We wanted the Cycling Commissioner to 
[normal]publish a biennial London Bicycle Account to inform Londoners 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 
[normal]work 
[normal]taking place 
[normal]to improve cycle safety. 
[normal]We also called for more
[normal] invest
[normal]ment in 
[normal]cycling to shift it away from a transport opt
[normal]ion for the few
[normal],
[normal] to a safe and attractive choice for all Londoners. 
[normal]We 
[normal]recommended that 
[normal]the Mayor a
[normal]nd
[normal] 
[normal]TfL
[normal] should
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]allocate at least £145 million to cycling in 2013/14 (the equivalent of 2 per cent of 
[normal]TfL’
[normal]s
[normal] 2012/13 budget); 
[normal]com
[normal]mit a minimum of £100 million 
[normal]to
[normal] funding the
[normal] Better
[normal] Junction
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]Review (
[normal]over the period of the review);
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]provide at least £60 million (or 20 per cent of 
[normal]TfL
[normal] cycling budget
[normal])
[normal] to fund the
[normal] Biking Borough Programme so it becomes an Outer London Cycling Fund
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]Would it be [bold]desirable and [bold]feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In our report 
[normal]Gearing Up
[normal]?
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]we concluded 
[normal]eriod of the review), recommendations in four broad areas: 1) ndon 
[normal]al authorities have encouraged the provision of cy
[normal]there could, and should, be more segregated
[normal] cycle space in London. Currently, decisions to give cyclists protected space are often turned down because there is a lack of political will to take space from motorised traffic. 
[normal]We heard from 
[normal]cyclist 
[normal]organisations that cyclists should mix with other traf
[normal]fic where possible, and be separated where necessary. Experts told us that any effort promoted as cycling improvement should give cyclists protected space.  We found the lack of protected space for cyclists on cycle superhighways continued to present risks
[normal]. This echoed the findings from our earlier report 
[normal]Pedal Power
[normal] 
[normal](November 2010) which found that users of the first two cycle superhighways were concerned about their safety. Around 60 per cent of over 1,000 cyclists who responded to our survey said they di
[normal]d 
[normal]not 
[normal]feel safer 
[normal]when 
[normal]using the 
[normal]first two 
[normal]cycle superhighways and two-thirds did not feel the
[normal]se
[normal] superhighways were respected by other road users. We 
[normal]recommended the Mayor and 
[normal]TfL
[normal] provide
[normal] greater consistency in the measures along the 
[normal]cycle 
[normal]superhighways suc
[normal]h as a uniform width, improvements to junctions and 20 mph speed limits on busy sections.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our re
[normal]port 
[normal]Gearing 
[normal]Up?
[normal],
[normal] we recommended the Mayor and 
[normal]TfL
[normal] commit to introducing fundamental cycle safety improvements to
[normal] the road
[normal] junctions
[normal] 
[normal]in their
[normal] Better Junctions Review. 
[normal]They should 
[normal]prioritise the removal of one-way gyratory systems and examin
[normal]e
[normal] the case for introducing 20 mph speed limits at junctions.  
[normal]We also
[normal] recommended tha
[normal]t the Department for Transport
[normal] introduce legislative changes to traffic 
[normal]regulations to enable 
[normal]TfL
[normal] to use new cycle safety solutions such as cyclist eye-level traffic signals. In addition to
[normal] improving
[normal] infrastructure, we 
[normal]wanted to see
[normal] action
[normal] taken
[normal] to improve the interactions of cyclists with other road users especially HGVs.  We
[normal] expressed support for the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment and 
[normal]European Union
[normal] introduc
[normal]ing 
[normal]legislation to increase the number of vehicles that are retrofitted with cyclist safety equipment such as side guards, close proximity c
[normal]ameras and visual aids. We 
[normal]also recommended that th
[normal]e
[normal] Mayor and 
[normal]Tf
[normal]L
[normal] work with the London Boroughs 
[normal]to 
[normal]make HGV safety training a condition
[normal] 
[normal]in planning consents and for 
[normal]TfL
[normal] 
[normal]to do more with 
[normal]the Metropolitan Police Service to tackle dangerous road use
[normal]. This
[normal] should include
[normal] more
[normal] enforcement activity along busy cy
[normal]cle routes and at collision hotspots and improv
[normal]ing
[normal] driver
[normal]s’
[normal] awareness through education campaigns.  
[normal]In addition, we called on the
[normal] Department for Transport 
[normal]to 
[normal]examine evidence from leading cycling countries about the costs and benefits of stricter responsib
[normal]ility and penalties against dangerous driving 
[normal]and 
[normal]the
[normal] Mayor and 
[normal]TfL
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] develop a plan to roll out cycle training across London
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We will be following up 
[normal]our
[normal] work on cycling safety in London at our meeting on 10 December
[normal] 
[normal]2013 
[normal]with representatives of the Ma
[normal]yor, 
[normal]TfL
[normal] and cycling organisations
[normal]. In advance of the meeting, we have i
[normal]nvited Londoners 
[normal]to contribute their views 
[normal]through an online survey which has 
[normal]already 
[normal]attracted many responses.
