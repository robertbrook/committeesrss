[[[Written evidence submitted by the Solid Fuel Association (HOT03)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Solid Fuel Association is the organisation which represents the producers, distributors, retailers and manufacturers of the British domestic solid fuel sector including wood fuel producers. We provide consumer guidance and technical support for installers, other industry professionals and the general public. The SFA also administer the Approved Coal Merchant Scheme in accordance with the requirements of Trading Standards and in this capacity work very closely with the Coal Merchants Federation.We have recently launched the Approved Woodfuel Merchant Scheme to protect consumers in this rapidly growing sector of the solid fuel industry.Coal mining itself is worth around £1 billion to the UK economy. Around 5,000 British people are employed directly in the industry and at least another 20,000 are dependent on the various support industries around coal for their living. Many of this number are in areas that are already economically disadvantaged.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary]]]The SFA believe that the true value of coal to the UK, including its potential contribution to the domestic sector, is currently being completely disregarded.Recent initiatives from government and in particular the Green Deal seem to completely dismiss the benefits of solid fuel heating. There is a dichotomy at the heart of government policy which sets solid fuels apart from other fossil fuels.&#xa0;We have set out below in simple terms what our industry has to offer in terms of economy, security and sustainability and why coal has all the credentials to be a fuel of the future.&#xa0;

[[[Econom]]]

[[[y]]]In terms of running costs, solid fuel heating compares very favourably with its competitors. This is of particular note when solid fuel is compared with the fuels available to consumers who are beyond the reach of the gas grid.According to recent figures contained within the Sutherland Tables (www.sutherlandtables.co.uk), a switch to a gravity fed anthracite burner for central heating could yield savings of 17% against natural gas, 28% against electricity, 41% against oil or an incredible 57% against LPG.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The comparison below uses figures obtained from the Sutherland Tables Comparative Domestic Heating Costs – Jan 2012 (www.sutherlandtables.co.uk)

This effectively means that under an initiative designed in part to alleviate fuel poverty, solid fuel customers are not able to up-grade their heating without switching fuels. It is highly unlikely that a switch away from solid fuel would yield any financial savings and it is even possible that such a switch would plunge the consumer into fuel poverty. Ironically, the installation of an anthracite burner or a multifuel stove with boiler could result in an immediate and considerable improvement for very little capital cost.&#xa0;The economic advantage of solid fuel is even more clear-cut when considering secondary space heating. For a number of years, smokeless solid fuel has proved to be the single most cost effective way to heat a room.&#xa0;

More importantly, solid mineral fuel is dramatically less expensive than all other fuels in the off-grid sector.

[[[Security of ]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[upply]]]

[[[ and sustainability]]]The majority of solid fuel supplied to the domestic market is from indigenous sources. The UK domestic market for mineral fuel is estimated to be around 1 million tonnes. Total domestic production of coal is currently around 17 million tonnes and with a level playing field and a proper coal strategy in place to give more certainty for investors, this could easily be increased to over 20 million tonnes. With proven reserves of over 1.5 billion tonnes and potential reserves of over 3.5 billion, this level of production could be sustained for many years into the future.We believe it is fair to say that in the UK and the rest of the world, solid mineral fuel is the most secure of all fossil fuels. The security of solid fuel supplies contrasts starkly with natural gas, for example. During periods of sustained colder weather in Central Europe, history shows that the gas price rises steeply along with demand from both domestic and power markets. Other factors that impact on the security of gas include terrorism (gas supply lines from abroad and LNG storage terminals in the UK are obvious targets for terrorism), geo-political impacts (supplies across borders have been interrupted for arbitrary reasons) and temporary shortage (during periods of shortage, domestic supplies for gas producing countries will take precedence over exports) all of which have the potential to constrain supplies and massively increase the gas price. Moreover, as the gas price is also inextricably linked to oil, household heating costs are subject to the volatility of world energy prices.This year’s spring cold snap saw natural gas reserves plummet to dangerously low levels and the UK become wholly dependent on shipped supplies from the Middle East.&#xa0;For the individual domestic solid fuel consumer, the security of supply benefit of solid fuel is further enhanced by the fact that they themselves can hold stock. This not only insulates against the effect of price increases but it also gives a degree of self-sufficiency that other fuels just cannot match. Moreover, a solid fuel or multifuel boiler stove does not need electricity to heat  a room or produce domestic hot water and because of its high calorific value (about four times that of wood), it is likely that one full bunker of solid mineral fuel  could sustain a stove through the worst of the winter.A roomheater or stove of the type that many people use for secondary heating could easily heat one or more rooms throughout the winter with just one full bunker of fuel. If the stove was flat-topped, a kettle of hot water would also be available - even during power cuts.(A jacket potato cooked in the ashpit or hot buttered toast could also be on the menu with solid fuel!)In summary, we believe that security of supply and stability of price are two sides of the same coin and that indigenous solid fuel is stronger in both these areas than its competitors.&#xa0;

[[[Environment]]]Modern coal mining practices are very much geared towards protection of the environment. Where coal extraction at a site has ceased, mining companies are duty bound to restore the area affected. In some restoration projects, reclamation of derelict land means that the appearance and amenity of a site is an improvement on what was there before mining commenced. As a vivid illustration of the industry’s commitment to the environment, the coal mining company “UK Coal Ltd” plants 65,000 trees per year. Modern coal producers take great pains to respect natural environments and to accommodate conservation as part of the planning requirements of their projects.&#xa0;

[[[4. ]]]

[[[Emissions]]]Many solid mineral fuels are authorised for use in smoke control areas. This is because they are very low in moisture and volatile organic content (less than 10% volatiles compared to around 50-60% for wood fuel). Smokeless mineral fuels burn very cleanly with low levels of organic gaseous and particulate emissions. With regard to greenhouse gas emissions, it is an indisputable fact that when anything burns, carbon dioxide is emitted. However, the SFA believe that an artificial distinction is being made between coal and other competing fuels. For instance, woody biomass is assumed to be carbon neutral when in fact this is only partially true even for wood from a sustainable source. Any type of fuel requires the input of energy to bring it to the market – mechanical harvesting, transport and preparation/processing must be taken into account to arrive at an energy return against energy invested. This is sometimes expressed as an EPR (Energy Performance Ratio). An EPR of less than 1 indicates that more energy has been invested than returned. For timber obtained from non-sustainable sources, the carbon dioxide emissions are at least as great as for coal. For a highly processed and imported product such as wood pellets, the CO₂ emissions are likely to be greater than for coal.In reality, the total indigenous supply of sustainable wood fuel is extremely limited and when added to the growing demand from electricity generators, 80% of wood fuel will be imported in bulk carriers from overseas. In many cases, this imported timber is produced by the clear felling of thousands of acres of virgin forest which is not replanted. This not only has a catastrophic effect on local ecosystems but also means that this material is by no means renewable. Even if trees were replanted, it would take many decades or even centuries to re-sequester the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during combustion. This is known as a “carbon debt”. Because biomass emits more carbon dioxide than mineral fuel per kW of heat energy generated, emissions over any sensible timescale are greater than for coal.To make matters worse, the pellets themselves are a highly processed product requiring high levels of energy input throughout their production and transport.We understand that the Government’s own analysis shows that the use of whole trees as power station feedstock will increase greenhouse gas emissions by at least 49% compared to coal (Searchinger 2012). Power station use is likely to completely eclipse the domestic supply chain and eliminate even the very dubious environmental benefits of biomass.It should be obvious to all, regardless of political affiliation or views on climate change that measures aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions should not increase them. As far as wood fuel is concerned, the SFA firmly believe that the very limited supplies of indigenous wood fuel would be better burnt alongside mineral fuel on domestic stoves at 70% efficiency rather than in power stations at 30% efficiency.&#xa0;A 2012 report by Princeton academic Timothy Searchinger entitled “Dirtier than coal?”suggests that emissions from biomass are 49% greater than for coal.Locally sourced, well-seasoned logs will have the lowest emissions among biomass products. Indeed, a multifuel stove burning a 50:50 mix of coal and logs from a sustainable woodland source could have a smaller “carbon footprint” than a gas boiler.If we compare coal to natural gas, carbon dioxide emissions for gas at the point of use are lower than for coal, giving it a lower “carbon intensity”. However, the total “global warming potential” of gas may be very much greater than this figure indicates due to unintentional releases, leakages from pipelines etc. This is because methane (natural gas) is considered to have a global warming potential 23 times greater than carbon dioxide. Shale gas has been widely touted in some quarters as a “silver bullet” for energy supplies. Unfortunately, despite the hype, shale gas has one massive problem-the greenhouse gas emissions and environmental damage are likely to be far greater than for coal. According to a recent study (European Commission 1 September 2011), the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas is greater than that of both coal and oil.Losses of methane occur during the development of the wells, the extraction process and during the transport, storage and distribution of the gas.Overall, the life cycle estimated losses of methane emissions from a typical shale gas well amount to 3.6 to 7.9 per cent of the total amount of gas produced by the well. This compares with methane losses of 1.7 to 6 per cent of total gas production from conventional wells.As we have already seen, accepted climate theory has it that methane’s global warming potential is 23 times as great as carbon dioxide. Therefore, the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas production-primarily due to these uncontrollable methane emissions- could be up to twice the footprint for coal (data based on a European Commission report 1 September 2011).Other drawbacks for shale gas include the risk of groundwater contamination by the fracturing fluids, risk of earthquakes beneath residential areas and also the sheer number of wells that would be necessary to maintain a reasonable level of production because of the short-lived lifespan of each individual well. This could be as many as 10,000 wells across the UK (estimated by Bloomberg New Energy Finance). In summary, if climate change theory is accepted, the substitution of gas for coal as an energy source results in increased rather than decreased global warming.If the security of natural gas supplies depends on the rapid development of a UK shale gas industry, then even the very dubious environmental advantage of conventional gas over coal is completely lost. One could easily argue that if global warming can be safely ignored in the case of shale gas, why not in the case of coal?Moreover, if we are able to ignore risks from global warming, why try to reduce coal’s contribution to the UK energy and heating mix in the first place?The SFA fully supports the drive to exploit new sources of fossil fuels. However, it needs to be emphasized strongly that replacement of coal with shale gas has no environmental justification.&#xa0;

[[[Growth]]]

[[[ in the solid fuel market]]]The appeal of a real fire has never diminished and we believe that no other heating system can match the “wow” factor of a real fire or the cosy sense of comfort and well-being that an open fire or stove lends to a home. To many people, the cosy glow and flickering flames are part of what makes a house into a home.The current fashion for open fires and wood burning stoves has resulted in a corresponding rise in demand for mineral fuel as most “wood burners” should more correctly be called multi-fuel stoves. It is fortunate for the reputation of the stove industry that mineral fuel is still widely available. A rapidly expanding wood market which exceeded supply would lead to shortage and result in stoves being abandoned as a reliable source of heat or lead to the burning of poor quality wood fuel with dangerously high levels of moisture. Mineral fuels are to a large extent facilitating the sustainable growth of a domestic wood fuel market. The distribution system for coal is very well established and well regulated under the Approved Coal Merchant Scheme. After many years of decline, the number of approved coal merchants in the UK has stabilised and we are now seeing many new entrants coming into the industry. Many consumers who start off burning wood, later switch to mineral fuel or a mixture of the two fuels because they recognise the benefits of mineral fuel in terms of comfort, convenience and cost. The continuing popularity of solid mineral fuel is amply illustrated by the fact that the Approved Coal Merchant Scheme is now welcoming applicants who started out as log merchants but have identified the growing market for coal. As well as our commitment to coal, the SFA is committed to increasing the availability of good quality wood fuel on the market through our “Approved Woodfuel Merchant Scheme”. This runs alongside the coal merchant scheme and promotes good practice and quality fuel by adherence to a strict voluntary code of conduct.

[[[Conclusion]]]The UK coal industry stabilised at the end of the last decade after many years of decline and given the right conditions there is potential for growth. Domestic solid fuels are of excellent quality and are gradually gaining in popularity as consumers seeking a less expensive, more secure and more self-sufficient method of heating become aware of the advantages of solid fuels.The only barriers to growth for solid fuel are the artificial constraints imposed by government. These are now hurting the industry and the lack of certainty is discouraging much-needed financial investment for the future.We believe that the current approach is completely flawed.Solid fuel heating currently accounts for an estimated 2% of the total market in the UK. Using the government’s own figures, a switch from solid fuel to LPG could reduce carbon emissions for a heating system by a maximum of around 19%. Unfortunately, any consumer making this switch will also see their heating bill double and be placed at the mercy of the international oil price. To put things into their proper perspective, total domestic heating emissions from all fuels in the UK only amount to around 0.2% (1/500th) of the World’s anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (based on International Energy Agency estimates and assuming domestic heating at 15% of total UK emissions). Even if solid fuel was completely eliminated from the domestic market, the carbon saved would be a few hundredths of a per cent at most.The domestic solid fuel industry is looking for a level playing field so that we can sustain and increase the market for our product based on its advantages and benefits. We urge the Government to put the comfort, safety, security and prosperity of British people first by acknowledging the importance of the British coal industry.                       &#xa0;August 2013                                                                            &#xa0;
