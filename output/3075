defaultWritten evidence from BALPA (SRN 034)default&#xa0;defaultAbout BALPAdefault&#xa0;
default1. Over 80% of the UK’s commercial pilots are members of BALPA and we are
default 
defaultrecognised as the main partner in 26 airlines covering all major UK operations. In
default 
defaultaddition over 1,000 commercial pilots have joined us even though their airline has
default 
defaultno partnership agreement with BALPA and this includes a swath of Ryanair pilots.
default&#xa0;
default2. BALPA was formed in 1937 following the antics of the CEO of Imperial Airways who
default 
defaultwas for
defaultcing professional pilots to operate when it was not, in the professional
default 
defaultjudgment of those pilots, safe to do so. This led to the Cadman report. Those origins
default 
defaultremain a key feature of our DNA today and which is why our vision as an association
default 
defaultis still “to 
defaultmake every flight a safe 
defaultflight”
default. It is also perhaps why a recent public poll
default 
defaultby YouGov found that airline pilots belonged to one of the most trusted professions.
defaultIt is a responsibility we take seriously.
defaultBALPA’s positiondefault&#xa0;
default3. Although the Committee’s frame
default of reference is the impact of the adverse weather
default 
defaulton all transport sectors BALPA’
defaults
default response will be with regard to air travel.
default&#xa0;
default4. Any discussion around adverse weather operations needs to start from the stand
default 
defaultpoint of making sure that any operation is sa
defaultfe. However, we believe it is possible to
default 
defaultrun a safe, economically-viable winter operation out of UK airports, as it is
default 
defaultelsewhere in Europe and around the world. Pilots’ experiences and advice should
default 
defaultform part of the discussion about how to make sure
default recen
defaultt, poor experiences do
default not
default 
defaulthappen again and how to ensure that winter operations are safe.
default&#xa0;
default5. Pilots are a valuable resource for regulators, the industry and government 
default–
default a
default 
defaultresource we believe is not sufficiently well used.
default&#xa0;
defaultRemote vs on-stand de-icingdefault&#xa0;
default6
default. During cold weather and at times of snow, aircraft must be de-iced to ensure wings
default 
defaultare not contaminated with ice and snow. They then need to have an anti-icing layer applied to ensure no
default 
defaultprecipitation sticks to the now ice free surfaces.
default 
defaultContamination of
default aircraft wings and other
default 
defaultsurfaces degrades lift and has in the past been the cause of serious
default, including
default fatal
default,
default accidents.
default 
defaultDe-
defaulticing and anti-icing of aircraft is carried out by spraying a
default glycol solution 
defaultacross
default 
defaultthe wings, tail and fin of the aircraft, and
default the fuselage too if snow has accumulated
default 
defaultthere.
default2default7. The severity of the weather and volume of precipitation (rain, snow, freezing fog,
default 
defaultetc.) affects the ‘holdover’ time. Holdover time is the maximum time between
default 
defaultthe start of the anti-icing process and th
defaulte start of the take-off roll. In
default 
defaultweather suc
defaulth as that experienced during recent
default winte
defaultrs
default holdover time can be less than
default 
default20 minutes in some circumstances. Note that holdover time begins when the glycol
default 
defaultapplication starts, not when it ends.
default This is why it is 
defaultimportant to perform the de/anti icing operation as close to the take-off runway as possible.
default&#xa0;
default8. De-icing can take place either on-stand or (as is the case in many overseas airports)
default 
defaultremotely at special de-icing areas, usually close to the end of the 
defaultrunway. UK
default 
defaultairports 
defaultprimarily 
defaultemploy on-stand de-icing and do not have the facilit
defaulty for
default de-icing
default close to the take-off point
default.
default 
defaultBALPA believes that on-stand de-icing procedures 
defaulthave 
defaultcontributed significantly to the
default problems experienced in previous winters
default.
default&#xa0;
default9. On-stand de-icing, which may take 30 minutes or more, blocks up parking stands, so arriving aircraft cannot off-load their pa
defaultssengers. At Heathrow during recent winters
default, aircraft were landing and then waiting on the taxiways, with passengers and cargo s
defaulttill on board, for periods of four hours or more. This is not acceptable.
default&#xa0;
default10. Many more de-icing rigs are required to run an on-stand de-icing operation, because the de-icing rigs have to drive around the airport. Compare this to a remote de-icing facilit
defaulty where the entire de-icing operation can be carried out by a small number of static de-icing vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default11. With on-stand de-icing, the mobile de-icing rig operation has to be rigidly controlled. Rather than remaining static and waiting for aircraft to co
defaultme to them for de-icing, the rigs have to be directed by radio to drive around the airport, from stand to stand, to get to the next aircraft to de-ice which can result in long waits.
default&#xa0;
default1
default2
default. De-icing rigs have to keep returning to their base to fill up with f
defaultluid. Time spent
default 
defaultdriving back and forth is time spent not de-icing aircraft.
default&#xa0;
default1
default3
default. Correct timing of on-stand de-icing is difficult. Ideally the de-icer should be ready
default 
defaultto start the procedure exactly 20 minutes before the flight’s Air Traffic Control slot
default 
defaultt
defaulto maximise holdover time. If this calculation is wrong there is a possibility of
default 
defaultmissing the slot and of holdover time expiry.
default&#xa0;
default14. On-stand de-icing causes the apron (parking stand) to be awash with fluid
default 
defaultoverspray. We are extremely concerned about the he
defaultalth and safety implications of
default 
defaultcreating hazardous conditions 
defaultfor ramp staff and pilots. Aprons should be cleared
default 
defaultand gritted, not swimming in d
defaulte-icing fluid. (See paragraph 18
default below.)
default&#xa0;
default1
default5
default. After de-icing, aircraft have to push back, start engines, and tax
defaulti out to the runway.
default 
defaultIf holdover time expires, and snow is accumulating on the aircraft, it must be 
defaultde-iced
default 
defaultall over again. On-stand de-icing significantly increases the likelihood of
default 
defaultaircraft having to return to stand for repeat de-icing because of holdov
defaulter time
default 
defaultexpiry, compared to a remote de-icing operation which takes place close to the
default 
defaultrunway.
default&#xa0;
default1
default6
default. On-stand de-icing wastes de-icing fluid as the rigs have to spray excess quantities of
default 
defaultfluid, and with a far more concentrated mix, in order to maximise hol
defaultd-over time.
default 
defaultExcess fluid cannot easily be captured and recycled with on-stand de-icing. Remote
default 
defaultde-icing facilities can have in-built sumps for capturing, filtering and reclaiming
default 
defaultover-sprayed fluid. On-stand de-icing, therefore, in comparison to remote 
defaultfacilities,
default 
defaultdamages the environment and wastes resources.
default&#xa0;
default1
default7
default. Most airports with colder climates, such as those in Scandinavia, have remote 
defaultde-icing
default 
defaultfacilities, where winter operations are usually harsher for longer than in the
default 
defaultUK. However, even Madrid-Ba
defaultrajas Airport in Spain, which has higher average
default 
defaulttemperatures than London, maintains remote de-icing facilities. It is fair to say that
default 
defaultremote de-icing facilities are the norm at busy overseas airports, including those
default 
defaultwith significantly warmer winter weat
defaulther than the UK.
default&#xa0;
default18. We are also concerned about personal safety on the ramp. Our interest has been
default 
defaultespecially driven by two very serious injuries which occurred to pilots whilst
default 
defaultcarrying out pre-flight departure walk-rounds (aircraft external inspections
default). Both
default 
defaultoccurred during winter operations, after de-icing procedures on stand had been
default 
defaultunder way for a few days. Both incidents led to broken bones, hospitalisation and
default 
defaultlong recuperation periods after surgery, following slips on surfaces
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWider infrastrucdefaultture problemsdefault&#xa0;
default19. The Committee will be looking at the impact of adverse weather across all
default 
defaulttransport sectors. This is vital because the ability of a UK airport to operate during
default 
defaultadverse weather is impacted upon by the ability of staff to get to the 
defaultairport.
default&#xa0;
default20. More attention must be paid to staff access to and around the airport as well as on
default 
defaultthe runways and taxiways. This includes making sure landside and airside roads
default 
defaultand staff car parks are kept clear so that staff and operational equipment can 
defaultmove
default 
defaultaround the airport with reasonable safety.
default&#xa0;
defaultComparisons with other countries’ airportdefault defaultoperationsdefault&#xa0;
default21. Chicago’s O'Hare Airport has 440 staff, 400,000 gallons of de-icer, 21,000 tons of
default 
defaultsalt and nearly 200 pieces of snow removal equipment for car parks
default and public
default 
defaultroadways. In a crisis they can call on up to 600 drivers and almost 163 pieces of
default 
defaultsnow equipment to clear the gate, ramp and cargo areas.
default&#xa0;
default22. Charles de Gaulle, France’s biggest airport, spent £24 million on their snowclearing
default 
defaultequipment. 74 ma
defaultchines, including snowploughs, snow-blowers and de-icers,
default 
defaultand plans to further increase their budget. Paris’ climate is comparable to
default 
defaultLondon’s.
default&#xa0;
default2
default3
default. Stockholm’s Arlanda airport has never closed and boasts the world’s fastest
default 
defaultsnow-clearing team and a fleet 
defaultof 17 Plough, Sweep and Blow (PSB) machines
default 
defaultdesigned by Volvo. Nine machines are driven alongside each other, clearing the
default 
defaultrunways in less than ten minutes.
default&#xa0;
default2
default4
default. UK airports need to effectively compete especially against European hubs for
default 
defaulttraffic. This is 
defaultnot just about making travelling easier for the British public, as
default 
defaultimportant as that is, it is also about ensuring that passengers do not make a conscious effort to avoid UK airports in favour of those in the rest of Europe to make
default 
defaultconnections.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefaultsdefault&#xa0;
default2
default5
default. Pilots want to be able to operate during adverse weather conditions, but must do so
default 
defaultsafely. We believe this must be just as possible in the UK as it is at overseas airports.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2
default6
default. De-icing procedures are just one of the many areas that must be cover
defaulted in a
default 
defaultpilot’s preparations for take-off. The additional pressure of arranging for the
default 
defaultcorrect level of de-icing at the correct time, being conscious of holdover times and
default 
defaultthe commercial pressure to make the flight’s ATC slot, all add to a pilot’s workloa
defaultd
default 
defaultand stress levels. Added to this we have the additional effects of pilot fatigue,
default 
defaultwhich will be made much worse under the recently accepted proposals from EASA.
default 
defaultWe believe remote de-icing facilities provide for a much less stressful operation for
default 
defaultpilots 
defaultwhich in turn contributes to the safe operation of an aircraft.
default&#xa0;
default27. Remote de-icing areas should be constructed at all busy UK airports. Heathrow and
default 
defaultGatwick in particular must be provided with such facilities if 
defaultwe are not to see a repeat of previous dis
defaultastrous experiences.
default&#xa0;
default28. The infrastructure has to be put into place to ensure all staff have access to and
default 
defaultaround the airport in order to ensure a winter operation can be successfully
default 
defaultmounted.
default&#xa0;
default29. Pilots have been pointing out the deficiencies in UK air
defaultport infrastructure for many
default 
defaultyears. We are only too aware of the gaps in the UK operation, because we fly all
default 
defaultover the world, and see at first-hand how things are achieved elsewhere
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default30. Now is the time to act. BALPA offers its overwhelming support to 
defaultensuring a safer
default 
defaultand a more efficient UK Commercial Aviation winter operation and would gladly
default 
defaultmake our Flight Safety experts available if further information or support is needed
default 
defaultto achieve this.
