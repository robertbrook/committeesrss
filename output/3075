&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence from BALPA (SRN 034)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]About BALPA[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Over 80% of the UK’s commercial pilots are members of BALPA and we are
[normal] 
[normal]recognised as the main partner in 26 airlines covering all major UK operations. In
[normal] 
[normal]addition over 1,000 commercial pilots have joined us even though their airline has
[normal] 
[normal]no partnership agreement with BALPA and this includes a swath of Ryanair pilots.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. BALPA was formed in 1937 following the antics of the CEO of Imperial Airways who
[normal] 
[normal]was for
[normal]cing professional pilots to operate when it was not, in the professional
[normal] 
[normal]judgment of those pilots, safe to do so. This led to the Cadman report. Those origins
[normal] 
[normal]remain a key feature of our DNA today and which is why our vision as an association
[normal] 
[normal]is still “to 
[normal]make every flight a safe 
[normal]flight”
[normal]. It is also perhaps why a recent public poll
[normal] 
[normal]by YouGov found that airline pilots belonged to one of the most trusted professions.
[normal]It is a responsibility we take seriously.
[normal]BALPA’s position[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Although the Committee’s frame
[normal] of reference is the impact of the adverse weather
[normal] 
[normal]on all transport sectors BALPA’
[normal]s
[normal] response will be with regard to air travel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Any discussion around adverse weather operations needs to start from the stand
[normal] 
[normal]point of making sure that any operation is sa
[normal]fe. However, we believe it is possible to
[normal] 
[normal]run a safe, economically-viable winter operation out of UK airports, as it is
[normal] 
[normal]elsewhere in Europe and around the world. Pilots’ experiences and advice should
[normal] 
[normal]form part of the discussion about how to make sure
[normal] recen
[normal]t, poor experiences do
[normal] not
[normal] 
[normal]happen again and how to ensure that winter operations are safe.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Pilots are a valuable resource for regulators, the industry and government 
[normal]–
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]resource we believe is not sufficiently well used.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Remote vs on-stand de-icing[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]. During cold weather and at times of snow, aircraft must be de-iced to ensure wings
[normal] 
[normal]are not contaminated with ice and snow. They then need to have an anti-icing layer applied to ensure no
[normal] 
[normal]precipitation sticks to the now ice free surfaces.
[normal] 
[normal]Contamination of
[normal] aircraft wings and other
[normal] 
[normal]surfaces degrades lift and has in the past been the cause of serious
[normal], including
[normal] fatal
[normal],
[normal] accidents.
[normal] 
[normal]De-
[normal]icing and anti-icing of aircraft is carried out by spraying a
[normal] glycol solution 
[normal]across
[normal] 
[normal]the wings, tail and fin of the aircraft, and
[normal] the fuselage too if snow has accumulated
[normal] 
[normal]there.
[normal]2[bold]7. The severity of the weather and volume of precipitation (rain, snow, freezing fog,
[normal] 
[normal]etc.) affects the ‘holdover’ time. Holdover time is the maximum time between
[normal] 
[normal]the start of the anti-icing process and th
[normal]e start of the take-off roll. In
[normal] 
[normal]weather suc
[normal]h as that experienced during recent
[normal] winte
[normal]rs
[normal] holdover time can be less than
[normal] 
[normal]20 minutes in some circumstances. Note that holdover time begins when the glycol
[normal] 
[normal]application starts, not when it ends.
[normal] This is why it is 
[normal]important to perform the de/anti icing operation as close to the take-off runway as possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. De-icing can take place either on-stand or (as is the case in many overseas airports)
[normal] 
[normal]remotely at special de-icing areas, usually close to the end of the 
[normal]runway. UK
[normal] 
[normal]airports 
[normal]primarily 
[normal]employ on-stand de-icing and do not have the facilit
[normal]y for
[normal] de-icing
[normal] close to the take-off point
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]BALPA believes that on-stand de-icing procedures 
[normal]have 
[normal]contributed significantly to the
[normal] problems experienced in previous winters
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. On-stand de-icing, which may take 30 minutes or more, blocks up parking stands, so arriving aircraft cannot off-load their pa
[normal]ssengers. At Heathrow during recent winters
[normal], aircraft were landing and then waiting on the taxiways, with passengers and cargo s
[normal]till on board, for periods of four hours or more. This is not acceptable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. Many more de-icing rigs are required to run an on-stand de-icing operation, because the de-icing rigs have to drive around the airport. Compare this to a remote de-icing facilit
[normal]y where the entire de-icing operation can be carried out by a small number of static de-icing vehicles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. With on-stand de-icing, the mobile de-icing rig operation has to be rigidly controlled. Rather than remaining static and waiting for aircraft to co
[normal]me to them for de-icing, the rigs have to be directed by radio to drive around the airport, from stand to stand, to get to the next aircraft to de-ice which can result in long waits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal]. De-icing rigs have to keep returning to their base to fill up with f
[normal]luid. Time spent
[normal] 
[normal]driving back and forth is time spent not de-icing aircraft.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]3
[normal]. Correct timing of on-stand de-icing is difficult. Ideally the de-icer should be ready
[normal] 
[normal]to start the procedure exactly 20 minutes before the flight’s Air Traffic Control slot
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]o maximise holdover time. If this calculation is wrong there is a possibility of
[normal] 
[normal]missing the slot and of holdover time expiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. On-stand de-icing causes the apron (parking stand) to be awash with fluid
[normal] 
[normal]overspray. We are extremely concerned about the he
[normal]alth and safety implications of
[normal] 
[normal]creating hazardous conditions 
[normal]for ramp staff and pilots. Aprons should be cleared
[normal] 
[normal]and gritted, not swimming in d
[normal]e-icing fluid. (See paragraph 18
[normal] below.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]5
[normal]. After de-icing, aircraft have to push back, start engines, and tax
[normal]i out to the runway.
[normal] 
[normal]If holdover time expires, and snow is accumulating on the aircraft, it must be 
[normal]de-iced
[normal] 
[normal]all over again. On-stand de-icing significantly increases the likelihood of
[normal] 
[normal]aircraft having to return to stand for repeat de-icing because of holdov
[normal]er time
[normal] 
[normal]expiry, compared to a remote de-icing operation which takes place close to the
[normal] 
[normal]runway.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]6
[normal]. On-stand de-icing wastes de-icing fluid as the rigs have to spray excess quantities of
[normal] 
[normal]fluid, and with a far more concentrated mix, in order to maximise hol
[normal]d-over time.
[normal] 
[normal]Excess fluid cannot easily be captured and recycled with on-stand de-icing. Remote
[normal] 
[normal]de-icing facilities can have in-built sumps for capturing, filtering and reclaiming
[normal] 
[normal]over-sprayed fluid. On-stand de-icing, therefore, in comparison to remote 
[normal]facilities,
[normal] 
[normal]damages the environment and wastes resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]7
[normal]. Most airports with colder climates, such as those in Scandinavia, have remote 
[normal]de-icing
[normal] 
[normal]facilities, where winter operations are usually harsher for longer than in the
[normal] 
[normal]UK. However, even Madrid-Ba
[normal]rajas Airport in Spain, which has higher average
[normal] 
[normal]temperatures than London, maintains remote de-icing facilities. It is fair to say that
[normal] 
[normal]remote de-icing facilities are the norm at busy overseas airports, including those
[normal] 
[normal]with significantly warmer winter weat
[normal]her than the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. We are also concerned about personal safety on the ramp. Our interest has been
[normal] 
[normal]especially driven by two very serious injuries which occurred to pilots whilst
[normal] 
[normal]carrying out pre-flight departure walk-rounds (aircraft external inspections
[normal]). Both
[normal] 
[normal]occurred during winter operations, after de-icing procedures on stand had been
[normal] 
[normal]under way for a few days. Both incidents led to broken bones, hospitalisation and
[normal] 
[normal]long recuperation periods after surgery, following slips on surfaces
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Wider infrastruc[bold]ture problems[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]19. The Committee will be looking at the impact of adverse weather across all
[normal] 
[normal]transport sectors. This is vital because the ability of a UK airport to operate during
[normal] 
[normal]adverse weather is impacted upon by the ability of staff to get to the 
[normal]airport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20. More attention must be paid to staff access to and around the airport as well as on
[normal] 
[normal]the runways and taxiways. This includes making sure landside and airside roads
[normal] 
[normal]and staff car parks are kept clear so that staff and operational equipment can 
[normal]move
[normal] 
[normal]around the airport with reasonable safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Comparisons with other countries’ airport[bold] [bold]operations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]21. Chicago’s O'Hare Airport has 440 staff, 400,000 gallons of de-icer, 21,000 tons of
[normal] 
[normal]salt and nearly 200 pieces of snow removal equipment for car parks
[normal] and public
[normal] 
[normal]roadways. In a crisis they can call on up to 600 drivers and almost 163 pieces of
[normal] 
[normal]snow equipment to clear the gate, ramp and cargo areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22. Charles de Gaulle, France’s biggest airport, spent £24 million on their snowclearing
[normal] 
[normal]equipment. 74 ma
[normal]chines, including snowploughs, snow-blowers and de-icers,
[normal] 
[normal]and plans to further increase their budget. Paris’ climate is comparable to
[normal] 
[normal]London’s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal]. Stockholm’s Arlanda airport has never closed and boasts the world’s fastest
[normal] 
[normal]snow-clearing team and a fleet 
[normal]of 17 Plough, Sweep and Blow (PSB) machines
[normal] 
[normal]designed by Volvo. Nine machines are driven alongside each other, clearing the
[normal] 
[normal]runways in less than ten minutes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]. UK airports need to effectively compete especially against European hubs for
[normal] 
[normal]traffic. This is 
[normal]not just about making travelling easier for the British public, as
[normal] 
[normal]important as that is, it is also about ensuring that passengers do not make a conscious effort to avoid UK airports in favour of those in the rest of Europe to make
[normal] 
[normal]connections.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]s[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]5
[normal]. Pilots want to be able to operate during adverse weather conditions, but must do so
[normal] 
[normal]safely. We believe this must be just as possible in the UK as it is at overseas airports.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]6
[normal]. De-icing procedures are just one of the many areas that must be cover
[normal]ed in a
[normal] 
[normal]pilot’s preparations for take-off. The additional pressure of arranging for the
[normal] 
[normal]correct level of de-icing at the correct time, being conscious of holdover times and
[normal] 
[normal]the commercial pressure to make the flight’s ATC slot, all add to a pilot’s workloa
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]and stress levels. Added to this we have the additional effects of pilot fatigue,
[normal] 
[normal]which will be made much worse under the recently accepted proposals from EASA.
[normal] 
[normal]We believe remote de-icing facilities provide for a much less stressful operation for
[normal] 
[normal]pilots 
[normal]which in turn contributes to the safe operation of an aircraft.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27. Remote de-icing areas should be constructed at all busy UK airports. Heathrow and
[normal] 
[normal]Gatwick in particular must be provided with such facilities if 
[normal]we are not to see a repeat of previous dis
[normal]astrous experiences.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28. The infrastructure has to be put into place to ensure all staff have access to and
[normal] 
[normal]around the airport in order to ensure a winter operation can be successfully
[normal] 
[normal]mounted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29. Pilots have been pointing out the deficiencies in UK air
[normal]port infrastructure for many
[normal] 
[normal]years. We are only too aware of the gaps in the UK operation, because we fly all
[normal] 
[normal]over the world, and see at first-hand how things are achieved elsewhere
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30. Now is the time to act. BALPA offers its overwhelming support to 
[normal]ensuring a safer
[normal] 
[normal]and a more efficient UK Commercial Aviation winter operation and would gladly
[normal] 
[normal]make our Flight Safety experts available if further information or support is needed
[normal] 
[normal]to achieve this.
