[normal]The UK 
[normal]must
[normal] avoid a situation in which a US Administration is forced to choose between a deep and special bilateral relationship with the UK, and a more brittle, but much larger and important relationship with the rest of the EU. From the perspective of Washington the UK and EU are increasingly bound together and should remain so for the health and relevance of the transatlantic relationship.
[normal] Nor will the USA appreciate being drawn in to play the part of some form of common friend acting as a councillor 
[normal]trying to limit the damage, not least to its own relations with its European allies, from a UK-EU divorce.
