"              \nWritten evidence submitted by the BioIndustry Association (BIA) (AMR0026)&#xa0;\nAbout the BIA\n&#xa0;\nThe \nBioIndustry\n Association (BIA) is the trade association for innovative bioscience companies. The majority of our members are healthcare focused companies researching and developing new products and technologies to treat areas of unmet medical need. These range from large global biopharmaceuticals to small, pre-revenue companies operating at the translation interface between academia and industry. \n&#xa0;\nThe BIA has engaged with its membership in order to provide an informed response to this inquiry. \n&#xa0;\nThe BIA response \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\nAppendix&#xa0;\nThe below table lists brief details of some of the business-led projects which have been awarded Biomedical Catalyst funding, following an application process and subject to conditions, which relate to the development of new antibiotics, anti-\ninfectives\n and other research of relevance to the issue of AMR. These are projects across all application stages (feasibility, early stage and late stage) and from funding rounds one, two and three. \n&#xa0;\nCompanyGrant amountProject costProject duration (months)Brief descriptionAbsynth\n Biologics Ltd\n£150,000\n£201,103\n12\nBuilding a product pipeline – establishing the commercial potential of new products [innovative approaches to antibacterial vaccines] \nAbsynth\n Biologics Ltd\n£2,013,706\n£3,049,019\n36\nStaphylococcus \naureus\n infections - development of a novel, effective vaccine\nAi2 Ltd\n£150,000\n£205,491\n12\nAssessing the feasibility of developing Ai2's novel anti-infective peptide technology for topical anti-fungal applications\nApplied \nNanodetectors\n Ltd\n£149,709\n£199,612\n12\nPoint of care exhaled breath test for the diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia\nBase4 Innovation Ltd\n£2,250,000\n£7,214,060\n36\nA rapid, highly sensitive, adaptable diagnostic for broad spectrum pathogen screening\n&#xa0;\nBlueberry Therapeutics Ltd\n£150,000\n£213,944\n12\nDevelopment of a new class of bacterial resistance inhibitors for the treatment of multi-drug resistant infection\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCantab\n Biopharmaceuticals Limited\n£2,321,884\n£3,869,807\n30\nAddressing multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections by enhanced antibiotic uptake\nDiscuva\n Ltd\n£1,620,000\n£2,700,000\n24\nDiscovery of new, commercially valuable antibiotics to treat bacterial infections\nELISHA Systems Ltd\n£358,956\n£717,956\n30\nPhage \nlysin\n biosensor detection of MRSA: point of care prototype: PROMPT-Plus\nEnigma Diagnostics Ltd\n£148,338\n£197,785\n4\nResonant sensing, a novel form of DNA detection for low-cost highly informative tests; construction of an assay for multidrug resistant TB and bovine TB\nIndigix\n Ltd\n£150,000\n£200,000\n12\nDendrimer\n based drug for life threatening infectious diarrhoeal diseases\nMicroPharm\n Ltd\n£2,067,535\n£2,599,535\n36\nUse of ovine polyclonal antibodies to treat severe \nClostridium \ndifficile\n infections\nProteinLogic\n Ltd\n£76,922\n£102,562\n9\nFeasibility of developing a novel biomarker signature as an innovative diagnostic for tuberculosis (TB)\nUnion Life Sciences Ltd\n£150,000\n£262,936\n12\nNovel inhibitors for the treatment of infectious disease\nValevia\n UK\n£150,000\n£204,353\n10\nA novel agent for the treatment of \nC. \ndifficile\n infection\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nA recent POST note provides a succinct overview for example: \nhttp://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/POST-PN-446.pdf\n \n Antibiotics Resistance 2013: The Antibiotics Development Pipeline and Strategies to Combat Antibiotic Resistance, \nhttp://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/04/16/cid.cit152.full\n \n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.roche.com/media/media_releases/med-cor-2013-11-04.htm\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/244058/20130902_UK_5_year_AMR_strategy.pdf\n \nhttp://www.battlingsuperbugs.com/gain-act.html\n \n \nhttp://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm320643.htm\n \n This proposal was contained within the Strategy for UK Life Sciences.\n \nhttp://www.redxpharma.com/about-us-subsidiaries-redx-anti-infectives.php\n \nhttp://www.redxpharma.com/news-article-20130507.php?filter=Show_All\n \nhttp://www.bionow.co.uk/events/bioinfect2013.aspx\n \nhttp://www.bioindustry.org/document-library/bia-ey-state-of-the-nation-report/\n \nhttp://www.bioindustry.org/document-library/bia-ey-state-of-the-nation-report/\n \nhttp://www.bioindustry.org/policy-and-regulation/biomedical-catalyst/\n \nhttp://www.pherecydes-pharma.com/files/120118%20DGA%20Pherecydes%20ENG.pdf\n \nhttp://www.ampliphibio.com/news/47-ampliphi-signs-global-r-d-agreement-with-us-army-to-develop-bacteriophage-therapies-to-treat-resistant-bacterial-infections.html\n"
