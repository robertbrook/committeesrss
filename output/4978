defaultRooted in decades and generations of territorial, nationalist, and religious disputes, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has had devastating consequences on both Israel and the Palestinians in realizing their full potential, especially as Pales
defaulttinians vie for sovereignty in their land. The Department for International Development (D
defaultF
defaultID)'s policy to allocate funds to infrastructure, relief, and state-building in the OPTs is consistent with the current state in the OPTs. 
defaultThe £86 million that the D
defaultF
defaultID allocates to state-building in the Palestinian territories is consistent with the great need to strengthen key infrastructure in the territories. According to the World Bank, the Palestinian territories experience one of the weakest economies in the Mi
defaultddle East North Africa region. GDP growth in the territories has decreased dramatically in the last few years, falling from 9 percent in 2008-2011 to 5.9 percent in 2012 and to 1.9 percent in the first half of 2013 (with negative growth of -0.1 percent in 
defaultthe West Bank).
default According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 was at 23.7 percent. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMoreover, the quality of infrastructure including water and transportation are deteriorating, therefore limiting eco
defaultnomic growth.
default In a continued state of conflict with several Israeli restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the territories face impe
defaultding economic and state growth. Partially, r
defaultemoving Israeli restrictions would increase Palestinian GDP and 
defaultfacilitate implementation of sustainable economic systems as well as advance establishment
default of civil, political, economic 
defaultand social rights. 
defaultHencedefault, we maintain that infrastructure buildingdefault in the OPTsdefault, alongsidedefault defaultadvocacy in Israel defaultand confidence-building crdefaultoss border work aredefault integral to building a stable and prosperous defaultMEdefault with a viable Palestinian state living peacefully next to a secure Israeli statedefault.
default 
defaultThe State of Our Youth - defaultYoung Israelis and Palestinians as Change Agents default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe trend in Israel and the OP
defaultTs is such that "young Israeli and Palestinian people today have no positive association with peace" (Dalia Schniedlin, 
defaultHa’aretz
default, April 2011
default).
default 
defaultIn Israel and the OPTs, the younger generation is less inclined to support negotiations towards a real peaceful r
defaultesolution
default, since they 
defaulthave come of age during four wars (the Second Intifada, the Second Lebanon War, Operation 'Cast Lead' and the recent Operation 'Pillar of 
defaultDefence
default', both in the Gaza Strip). Direct interaction outside of the military context between th
defaulte two populations is almost non-existent. Furthermore, both Israelis and Palestinians mostly receive their information and form their opinions based on the polarized mainstream media coverage of the conflict and regional developments.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the Israeli side,
default in contrast to roughly 70 percent of Israeli adults supporting negotiations, just over half of the Israeli youth surveyed (including Israeli Arabs) support negotiations (Peace Index surveys in Israel). This gap in support for renewing negotiations between
default the Palestinian Authority and Israel can be attributed to the formative role that media plays in shaping public opinion regarding key issues and groups. Israel's youth (between the ages of 13 and 18) represent the highest media consumption rates in Israel
defaulti society at over 90% in contrast to 60% of the general Israeli population. This striking figure signifies the dominant role the internet serves in the sharing and receiving of information among Israel's youth. Through the media's oversimplification of the
default "other" and of the conflict, the youth understand the current situation to be acceptable and irreversible. Consequently, we also witness a drastic increase in young Israeli Jews defining themselves as right-wing (from 48% in 1998 to 63% in 2010) with 46% 
defaultof Israeli Jews preferring to maintain the status quo of the conflict rather than to advance the
default peace process (Friedrich Ebert, 
defaultYouth in Israel, 2010). 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimilarly, Palestinian youth exhibit parallel lack of trust and hope for a real resolution of the con
defaultflict and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. While Palestinian youth comprise 27% of the total Palestinian population, a third of them are unemployed and lack democratic outlets to mobilize change in the conflict among their leaders (Study by
default Sharek Youth Forum, 
default“
defaultThe Status of Youth in Palestine,
default”
default 2013). Nearly three quarters of youth from the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank are unaffiliated to any party and assert that no faction has proven trustworthy. Almost two-thirds of Pale
defaultstinian youth believe Israel's policies in the OPTs coupled with internal Palestinian politics will impede efforts to establish a Palestinian state (Reuters, April 2013). 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent regional developments, such as the Arab S
defaultpring and riots in Syria, Egypt and
default Turkey, have demonstrated the power of young people mobilizing change in society. 
defaultDue to the importance of youth in social and political transformation, Israeli and Palestinian youth are the prime target for peacebuilding work. 
defaultAs young people tend to be 
defaultreceptive and open-minded to competing ideas both through 
defaultmeeting
default their peers 
defaultand
default cultural/media exposure, we believe that the 
defaultmost effective approach to conflict resolution is to facilitate positive interactions between Israeli and Palestinian youthdefault. A re
defaultcent study 
default(
defaultUniversity of Haifa
default, 2013)
default established a direct link between culture and tolerance, showing that young Israelis' opinions of Palestinians changed after watching plays on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Following the viewing, the percentage of
default students blaming the Palestinians for the stalemate dropped 
defaultfrom 55% 
defaultto 38
default%
default, the percentage of those holding negative feelings 
defaulttowards Palestinians 
defaultdecreased 
defaultfrom 65% 
defaultto 47
default%
default, and those supporting roadblocks fell 
defaultfrom 78% 
defaultto 60%.

defaultThe following evidence is to present the case for more support to dialogue and cross-border cooperation groups, as their work is essential to laying the building blocks for propelling forward a negotiated two-state
default solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
default that will be supported by the majority of the public on both sides
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCP 
defaultdesigns cutting-edge programs geared at bringing together Palestinian and Israeli youth. 
defaultAt the core of our approach, we tackle the conflict from a non-politicized angle, avoiding the collective nationalist and historical narratives. Rather we focus on the individual young person's journey to becoming more confident, acquiring non-violent comm
defaultunications skills, getting to know the "other" and recognizing both sides' legitimacy. 
defaultOnce children and youth gain practical tools to deal with life’s challenges, and the moment they feel more confident they are able to come to terms with the "other" and 
defaultavoid prejudice. 
defaultTo strengthen the individual youth, 
defaultKCP
default 
defaultworks holistically
default with schools, community organizations, and civic institutions at the 
defaultlocal, 
defaultregional and national levels. We offer education programs for personal and societal conflict management 
defaultand resolution among youth in Israel and the OPTs. Our curricula are based on life skills
default, sensory and experiential methods tailored to engage

defaultexploring one another’s daily realities through weekly meetings, joint projects, and a bi-national 4-day summer camp in order to facilitate unprecedented cross-border dialogue. This program marked not only a shift among individual perceptions, but also pro
defaultmpted community involvement and enabled sustainable institutional impact. We offer a leadership, public speaking, and performing arts program for YCP graduates to further hone their leadership skills as well as to promote continued dedication to advocating
default for peace. Youth Creating Eco-Peace is a program that employs the concept of a “shared ground” into a “common ground” by uniting Israeli and Palestinian youth on environmental initiatives, working together to impact the land. We also offer the 'Game of Li
defaultfe,' a fun and interactive video curriculum that aims to achieve spiritual

defaultKCP's Strategic Modeldefault with Clear Multiplier Impactdefault10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCP programs both engage youth with the "other" and equip youth with the necessary conflict-resolution skills and decision-making processes to do so successfully. Furthermore, the programs foster a sense of "oneness" amongst t
defaulthe mixed Israeli and Palestinian groups by challenging them with a common end-project that places them as "one" group with a common cause "against" an outside force. Moreover, we believe that education is enhanced by strong role models, as evidenced by our
default committed and responsible teachers and instructors. The teachers 
defaultand instructors come from within the community itself, are
default experienced and skilled in delivering 
defaultdialogue and youth-
defaultcantered
default programs, and serve as role models for tolerance and cross-border
default dialogue. 
default&#xa0;

defaultNot only do

default's multifaceted approach 
defaultshift perceptions directly 
defaultamong 
defaultprogram participation, but it establishes a long-lasting shift in 
defaultbehaviours
default 
defaultand yields outputs and actions that have institutional and public impact
default. KCP often leverages past program's youth graduates to serve as leaders and active in recruitment and management of the new groups of 
defaultyoung Israeli and Palestinian participants
default, ensuring 
defaulteffective peer-to-peerdefault interaction and providing 
defaultpowerful role modeldefaultsdefault. These newly-cultivated youth leaders equipped with the necessary tools, then initiate and carry out creative peace educational campaigns and activities in their schools reaching thousands of additional youth. Through these leaders' work, we ensure the s
defaultustainable and longer-term impact of their work and their commitment beyond the program's period. Furthermore, our programs' outputs and tools ensure a broader sustainable impact, by utilizing online forums, new media campaigns, key messaging, visual brand
defaulting, and other creative means that frame peace in a fresh, young, and positive way that youth can relate to. KCP programs offer hands-on leadership of the youth empowering them as they demonstrate their power to act and affect others through concrete peace
default work in classes. Finally, throughout the program, parents, teachers, and stakeholders get involved; these influential community players such as teaching staff, elected officials from city councils, and representatives from the Ministry of Education gain e
defaultxposure to a positive model of bringing together Israeli and Palestinian youth uniting under a common goal to achieve a lasting peace in the region.

defaultEvidence of Impact of KCP's Approach default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2012-2013, KCP led the program Youth Creating Peace. This program brought 50 Israeli and Palestinian youth together through workshops, a f
defaultour-day summer camp, and joint 
defaultart project, demonstrating impact on several levels: 
default 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2010, one of KCP's successful programs - 
defaultSach Ten 
defaultthat engaged 
default24 Israeli (Jewish and Arab) and Palestinian youth, 
defaultresulted in an actual jo
defaultint youth-drafted peace agreement that 
defaultthe youth themselves presented to t
defaulthe French Parliament. 
defaultPart IV: Recommendationdefault15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCP
default respectfully makes the recommendation to the British Government to supplement D
defaultF
defaultID's work in the OPTs and t
defaulthe Conflict Pool's advocacy work in Israel with direct cross-border programs engaging young Israelis and Palestinians in joint work on common interests and issues.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecognizing that apathy and lack of hope,
default together with a void in policy, on both sides
default lay
default at the foundation of the current stagnation, KCP strives to serve as a model for cross-border 
defaultprojects 
defaultthat
default aim 
defaultat
default reinvigorating the younger generation with forward-looking optimism and creative peace
default-
defaultbuilding goals.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe maintain that an imperative stepping stone towards achieving a just and sustainable two-state solution is fostering inter-personal, direct 
defaultrelations
default and cross-border 
defaultcooperation in order to bring about change from the bottom-up and on a broader scale.  
defaultAs more people get involved and become pass
defaultionate about mobilizing change, 
defaultthe 
defaultleadership 
defaultwill be motivated 
defaultto 
defaultprogress
default towards achieving peace. 
defaultOnly if we reach wider and more diverse sectors in Israel and the OPTs in direct dialogue will we prepare the p
defaultublic opinion to accept the necessary concessions entailed in an agreement, 
defaultreinvigorating the possibility 
defaultof a sustainable peaceful ME
