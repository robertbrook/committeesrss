[normal]Written evidence submitted by Kids Creating Peace (KCP)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Part I: Executive Summary[bold]Factual Information[bold]Brief Introduction[bold] to K[bold]ids [bold]C[bold]reating [bold]P[bold]eace[bold]Recommendation[bold]s[bold]Part II: [bold]Factual Information[bold]Overview of the ME Conflict and root obstacles to [bold]peaceful[bold] resolution [bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rooted in decades and generations of territorial, nationalist, and religious disputes, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has had devastating consequences on both Israel and the Palestinians in realizing their full potential, especially as Pales
[normal]tinians vie for sovereignty in their land. The Department for International Development (D
[normal]F
[normal]ID)'s policy to allocate funds to infrastructure, relief, and state-building in the OPTs is consistent with the current state in the OPTs. 
[normal]The £86 million that the D
[normal]F
[normal]ID allocates to state-building in the Palestinian territories is consistent with the great need to strengthen key infrastructure in the territories. According to the World Bank, the Palestinian territories experience one of the weakest economies in the Mi
[normal]ddle East North Africa region. GDP growth in the territories has decreased dramatically in the last few years, falling from 9 percent in 2008-2011 to 5.9 percent in 2012 and to 1.9 percent in the first half of 2013 (with negative growth of -0.1 percent in 
[normal]the West Bank).
[normal] According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 was at 23.7 percent. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Moreover, the quality of infrastructure including water and transportation are deteriorating, therefore limiting eco
[normal]nomic growth.
[normal] In a continued state of conflict with several Israeli restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the territories face impe
[normal]ding economic and state growth. Partially, r
[normal]emoving Israeli restrictions would increase Palestinian GDP and 
[normal]facilitate implementation of sustainable economic systems as well as advance establishment
[normal] of civil, political, economic 
[normal]and social rights. 
[normal]Hence[bold], we maintain that infrastructure building[bold] in the OPTs[bold], alongside[bold] [bold]advocacy in Israel [bold]and confidence-building cr[bold]oss border work are[bold] integral to building a stable and prosperous [bold]ME[bold] with a viable Palestinian state living peacefully next to a secure Israeli state[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]The State of Our Youth - [bold]Young Israelis and Palestinians as Change Agents [bold]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The trend in Israel and the OP
[normal]Ts is such that "young Israeli and Palestinian people today have no positive association with peace" (Dalia Schniedlin, 
[normal]Ha’aretz
[normal], April 2011
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]In Israel and the OPTs, the younger generation is less inclined to support negotiations towards a real peaceful r
[normal]esolution
[normal], since they 
[normal]have come of age during four wars (the Second Intifada, the Second Lebanon War, Operation 'Cast Lead' and the recent Operation 'Pillar of 
[normal]Defence
[normal]', both in the Gaza Strip). Direct interaction outside of the military context between th
[normal]e two populations is almost non-existent. Furthermore, both Israelis and Palestinians mostly receive their information and form their opinions based on the polarized mainstream media coverage of the conflict and regional developments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]On the Israeli side,
[normal] in contrast to roughly 70 percent of Israeli adults supporting negotiations, just over half of the Israeli youth surveyed (including Israeli Arabs) support negotiations (Peace Index surveys in Israel). This gap in support for renewing negotiations between
[normal] the Palestinian Authority and Israel can be attributed to the formative role that media plays in shaping public opinion regarding key issues and groups. Israel's youth (between the ages of 13 and 18) represent the highest media consumption rates in Israel
[normal]i society at over 90% in contrast to 60% of the general Israeli population. This striking figure signifies the dominant role the internet serves in the sharing and receiving of information among Israel's youth. Through the media's oversimplification of the
[normal] "other" and of the conflict, the youth understand the current situation to be acceptable and irreversible. Consequently, we also witness a drastic increase in young Israeli Jews defining themselves as right-wing (from 48% in 1998 to 63% in 2010) with 46% 
[normal]of Israeli Jews preferring to maintain the status quo of the conflict rather than to advance the
[normal] peace process (Friedrich Ebert, 
[normal]Youth in Israel, 2010). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly, Palestinian youth exhibit parallel lack of trust and hope for a real resolution of the con
[normal]flict and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. While Palestinian youth comprise 27% of the total Palestinian population, a third of them are unemployed and lack democratic outlets to mobilize change in the conflict among their leaders (Study by
[normal] Sharek Youth Forum, 
[normal]“
[normal]The Status of Youth in Palestine,
[normal]”
[normal] 2013). Nearly three quarters of youth from the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank are unaffiliated to any party and assert that no faction has proven trustworthy. Almost two-thirds of Pale
[normal]stinian youth believe Israel's policies in the OPTs coupled with internal Palestinian politics will impede efforts to establish a Palestinian state (Reuters, April 2013). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recent regional developments, such as the Arab S
[normal]pring and riots in Syria, Egypt and
[normal] Turkey, have demonstrated the power of young people mobilizing change in society. 
[normal]Due to the importance of youth in social and political transformation, Israeli and Palestinian youth are the prime target for peacebuilding work. 
[normal]As young people tend to be 
[normal]receptive and open-minded to competing ideas both through 
[normal]meeting
[normal] their peers 
[normal]and
[normal] cultural/media exposure, we believe that the 
[normal]most effective approach to conflict resolution is to facilitate positive interactions between Israeli and Palestinian youth[bold]. A re
[normal]cent study 
[normal](
[normal]University of Haifa
[normal], 2013)
[normal] established a direct link between culture and tolerance, showing that young Israelis' opinions of Palestinians changed after watching plays on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Following the viewing, the percentage of
[normal] students blaming the Palestinians for the stalemate dropped 
[normal]from 55% 
[normal]to 38
[normal]%
[normal], the percentage of those holding negative feelings 
[normal]towards Palestinians 
[normal]decreased 
[normal]from 65% 
[normal]to 47
[normal]%
[normal], and those supporting roadblocks fell 
[normal]from 78% 
[normal]to 60%.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The following evidence is to present the case for more support to dialogue and cross-border cooperation groups, as their work is essential to laying the building blocks for propelling forward a negotiated two-state
[normal] solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
[normal] that will be supported by the majority of the public on both sides
[normal].

[normal]KCP 
[normal]designs cutting-edge programs geared at bringing together Palestinian and Israeli youth. 
[normal]At the core of our approach, we tackle the conflict from a non-politicized angle, avoiding the collective nationalist and historical narratives. Rather we focus on the individual young person's journey to becoming more confident, acquiring non-violent comm
[normal]unications skills, getting to know the "other" and recognizing both sides' legitimacy. 
[normal]Once children and youth gain practical tools to deal with life’s challenges, and the moment they feel more confident they are able to come to terms with the "other" and 
[normal]avoid prejudice. 
[normal]To strengthen the individual youth, 
[normal]KCP
[normal] 
[normal]works holistically
[normal] with schools, community organizations, and civic institutions at the 
[normal]local, 
[normal]regional and national levels. We offer education programs for personal and societal conflict management 
[normal]and resolution among youth in Israel and the OPTs. Our curricula are based on life skills
[normal], sensory and experiential methods tailored to engage
[normal], 
[normal]empower
[normal] and motivate youth. 
[normal]Our programs incorporate leadership and dialogue training, inspiring the youth to ch
[normal]oose the path 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]affect
[normal]ing
[normal] change within their communities
[normal].

[normal]KCP's
[normal] 
[normal]youth 
[normal]participants embark on a personal and collective journey, 
[normal]exploring one another’s daily realities through weekly meetings, joint projects, and a bi-national 4-day summer camp in order to facilitate unprecedented cross-border dialogue. This program marked not only a shift among individual perceptions, but also pro
[normal]mpted community involvement and enabled sustainable institutional impact. We offer a leadership, public speaking, and performing arts program for YCP graduates to further hone their leadership skills as well as to promote continued dedication to advocating
[normal] for peace. Youth Creating Eco-Peace is a program that employs the concept of a “shared ground” into a “common ground” by uniting Israeli and Palestinian youth on environmental initiatives, working together to impact the land. We also offer the 'Game of Li
[normal]fe,' a fun and interactive video curriculum that aims to achieve spiritual 
[normal]fulfilment
[normal] (security, happiness, love, and confidence) by engaging hundreds of 
[normal]youth
[normal] throughout Israel and the OPTs in 
[normal]a 
[normal]personal empowering
[normal] learning process
[normal]. 
[normal]KCP's Strategic Model[bold] with Clear Multiplier Impact[bold]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]KCP programs both engage youth with the "other" and equip youth with the necessary conflict-resolution skills and decision-making processes to do so successfully. Furthermore, the programs foster a sense of "oneness" amongst t
[normal]he mixed Israeli and Palestinian groups by challenging them with a common end-project that places them as "one" group with a common cause "against" an outside force. Moreover, we believe that education is enhanced by strong role models, as evidenced by our
[normal] committed and responsible teachers and instructors. The teachers 
[normal]and instructors come from within the community itself, are
[normal] experienced and skilled in delivering 
[normal]dialogue and youth-
[normal]cantered
[normal] programs, and serve as role models for tolerance and cross-border
[normal] dialogue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Not only do
[normal]es
[normal] KCP
[normal]'s multifaceted approach 
[normal]shift perceptions directly 
[normal]among 
[normal]program participation, but it establishes a long-lasting shift in 
[normal]behaviours
[normal] 
[normal]and yields outputs and actions that have institutional and public impact
[normal]. KCP often leverages past program's youth graduates to serve as leaders and active in recruitment and management of the new groups of 
[normal]young Israeli and Palestinian participants
[normal], ensuring 
[normal]effective peer-to-peer[bold] interaction and providing 
[normal]powerful role model[bold]s[bold]. These newly-cultivated youth leaders equipped with the necessary tools, then initiate and carry out creative peace educational campaigns and activities in their schools reaching thousands of additional youth. Through these leaders' work, we ensure the s
[normal]ustainable and longer-term impact of their work and their commitment beyond the program's period. Furthermore, our programs' outputs and tools ensure a broader sustainable impact, by utilizing online forums, new media campaigns, key messaging, visual brand
[normal]ing, and other creative means that frame peace in a fresh, young, and positive way that youth can relate to. KCP programs offer hands-on leadership of the youth empowering them as they demonstrate their power to act and affect others through concrete peace
[normal] work in classes. Finally, throughout the program, parents, teachers, and stakeholders get involved; these influential community players such as teaching staff, elected officials from city councils, and representatives from the Ministry of Education gain e
[normal]xposure to a positive model of bringing together Israeli and Palestinian youth uniting under a common goal to achieve a lasting peace in the region.

[normal]Evidence of Impact of KCP's Approach [bold]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2012-2013, KCP led the program Youth Creating Peace. This program brought 50 Israeli and Palestinian youth together through workshops, a f
[normal]our-day summer camp, and joint 
[normal]art project, demonstrating impact on several levels: 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2010, one of KCP's successful programs - 
[normal]Sach Ten 
[normal]that engaged 
[normal]24 Israeli (Jewish and Arab) and Palestinian youth, 
[normal]resulted in an actual jo
[normal]int youth-drafted peace agreement that 
[normal]the youth themselves presented to t
[normal]he French Parliament. 
[normal]Part IV: Recommendation[bold]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]KCP
[normal] respectfully makes the recommendation to the British Government to supplement D
[normal]F
[normal]ID's work in the OPTs and t
[normal]he Conflict Pool's advocacy work in Israel with direct cross-border programs engaging young Israelis and Palestinians in joint work on common interests and issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recognizing that apathy and lack of hope,
[normal] together with a void in policy, on both sides
[normal] lay
[normal] at the foundation of the current stagnation, KCP strives to serve as a model for cross-border 
[normal]projects 
[normal]that
[normal] aim 
[normal]at
[normal] reinvigorating the younger generation with forward-looking optimism and creative peace
[normal]-
[normal]building goals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We maintain that an imperative stepping stone towards achieving a just and sustainable two-state solution is fostering inter-personal, direct 
[normal]relations
[normal] and cross-border 
[normal]cooperation in order to bring about change from the bottom-up and on a broader scale.  
[normal]As more people get involved and become pass
[normal]ionate about mobilizing change, 
[normal]the 
[normal]leadership 
[normal]will be motivated 
[normal]to 
[normal]progress
[normal] towards achieving peace. 
[normal]Only if we reach wider and more diverse sectors in Israel and the OPTs in direct dialogue will we prepare the p
[normal]ublic opinion to accept the necessary concessions entailed in an agreement, 
[normal]reinvigorating the possibility 
[normal]of a sustainable peaceful ME
[normal].
