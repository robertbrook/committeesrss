[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]How the NHS is tackling winter[bold] pressures this year[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal] [bold]F
[normal]igures published in 
[normal]NHS England's winter health check
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]sh
[normal]ow that the percentage of patients spending under
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]four hours in A&amp;E 
[normal]slightly 
[normal]improved over the Christmas period 
[normal]compared to
[normal] previous years.
[normal] 
[normal]Performance was 95.5 per cent
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in week ending 22 December and 96.4 per cent
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in week ending 29 December, both weeks hi
[normal]gher than 2012. Attendances at A&amp;E have fallen, particularly in week ending 29 December, where attendances were lower than expected.
[normal] 
[normal]This is testament to effective planning 
[normal]at a local level 
[normal]and hardworking NHS staff. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 
[normal]However, figures also show that t
[normal]he A&amp;E target was narrowly missed in the week ending 5 January 2014. 94.29%
[normal] of patients
[normal] were seen in 4 hours or less, with 5,105 patients subject to waits of between 4 and 12 hours, the highest number since April
[normal] 2013
[normal]. While performance
[normal] on the target
[normal] is up
[normal] on the same week 
[normal]in 2013
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]where the proportion was 93.04%
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] the fact the target was missed continues to demonstrate the significant pressures felt in urgent and emergency care
[normal],
[normal] which are in turn symptomatic of pressures 
[normal]experien
[normal]ced across all parts of the NHS. 
[normal]The 4 hour target also needs to be viewed in context -
[normal] so far 
[normal]the weather this winter 
[normal]has been relatively mild.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]Our report 
[normal]Emergency care: an accident waiting to happen? 
[normal]published in September 2013 set out the 
[normal]findings of a survey we conducted with our members
[normal]. This report found considerable concern amongst our members about the forthcoming winter, with only 45.7 per cent of respondents saying they were likely to hit the 95% four hour target throughout the wint
[normal]er. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4 
[normal]As part of responding to this inquiry, we have spoken with some of our members to get a "snap shot" of the situation 
[normal]in the health service 
[normal]over the last few weeks. 
[normal]Anecdotally
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the overall sense is 
[normal]of
[normal] winter so far being "
[normal]challenging but manageab
[normal]le"
[normal] (Chief Executive, Community Health services provider). 
[normal]It can be
[normal] difficult to establish a common pattern, because experience
[normal]s
[normal] vary across the country and
[normal],
[normal] sometimes
[normal],
[normal] within the same trust
[normal]: 
[normal]"The number of patients attending medical wards is roughly the
[normal] same [if compared with last year]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]However, there is noticeable variation between week and week-end days, and variation between each week-end, up to 30%" 
[normal](Clinical Director, Acute NHS FT)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some providers are finding the period very difficult. One communi
[normal]ty provider told us:
[normal]"Our local a
[normal]cute (providers)
[normal] have come under intense pressure in the post-Christmas period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In part this is because community and social care services are still not available and responsive at scale 24/7 and the default to A&amp;E is stil
[normal]l sometimes the only option".
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some members have
[normal] also
[normal] raised concerns with us about demoralised staff. One
[normal] acute provider 
[normal]stated
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]"Front line staff are tired and demoralised – they do not see improvement or change and this is now urgently required".
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]4 
[normal]Many of the issues which we, the Committee and other
[normal]s
[normal] highlighted last year have remained 
[normal]problematic
[normal]. These include difficulties with recruiting and retaining emergency medicine clinicians, 
[normal]lack of seven day workin
[normal]g
[normal], handover delays
[normal] and 
[normal]the need for 
[normal]greater clinical
[normal] input in
[normal] 111 services in some parts of the country
[normal]. 
[normal]Some among our 
[normal]a
[normal]mbulance 
[normal]s
[normal]ervice providers highlighted that:
[normal]"
[normal]a
[normal]mbulance 
[normal]s
[normal]ervices are generally coping, and providing safe services for patients. (...)The handover delays have been slightl
[normal]y less than last year, but we have been fortunate to have a 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]mild winter to date which has not realised some of the activity we may have expected at this point in the season. NHS 111 may have also had a greater benefit on the wider health economy, had it b
[normal]een implemented fully in all areas to the original timescale, and been embedded fully before winter arrived, with the appropriate advertising undertaken
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5 
[normal]T
[normal]he NHS has been proactive in tackling these pressures - we know of a considerable amount of inno
[normal]vative work which is being done by our members to resp
[normal]ond to these concerns. These include
[normal] a different use of staff roles to support patient flow, such as Patient Flow Support Officers, d
[normal]eployed in some hospitals from 
[normal]midday
[normal] until 10pm
[normal] 
[normal]on days w
[normal]h
[normal]ere higher influx is registered; the use of rapid assessment and treatment teams, bringing together health and social care professionals; and 
[normal]greater support for
[normal] clinical staff decision making, for example through training and deploying Paramedic Practitio
[normal]ners to divert pressures from 
[normal]emergency departments, 
[normal]support managing patient flow and mitigate delays in handovers. 
[normal]Professionals are also being
[normal] used to improve links between sectors, such as mental health liaison psychiatrists. 
[normal]1.6 
[normal]Many of our members tell us that good planning and better joint working 
[normal]at a local level 
[normal]has helped ensure the NHS is coping with winter pressures more
[normal] effectively than
[normal] in past years. One comm
[normal]unity provider we spoke to said:
[normal]"Winter thus far feels less fra
[normal]ught than last year. Locally we think this is because of a number of factors but importantly includes us seeing the benefit of work implemented earlier in the year to help with winter."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Joint working across different sectors, in response to urgent and eme
[normal]rgency care pressures, seems to have improved. Some 
[normal]among the 
[normal]acute and community health 
[normal]providers which we consulted mentioned increased multi-disciplinary planning and service
[normal] delivery as having a 
[normal]positive impact on reducing urgent and emergency care pre
[normal]ssures
[normal]: 
[normal]"Better collaborative working has created more capacity outside of hospital, so we have achieved more timely discharge, which has helped enormously".
[normal](Chief Operating Officer, Acute Trust)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"The whole economy began planning for winter in June of 
[normal]last year and agreed a number of additional schemes that would be implemented. (...)The system is working in a much more integrated and collaborative way at ground level than ever before demonstrating benefits to the whole system and increasing staff moral
[normal]e as they are jointly achieving, and partnerships are being cemented"
[normal](Chief Executive, Community Health Trust)
[normal]1.7 
[normal]However, our members 
[normal]continue to
[normal] express
[normal] serious concern
[normal]s about lack of capacity, par
[normal]ticularly in terms of staffing. 
[normal]Many 
[normal]expressed the view
[normal] that urgent and emergency care is on a knife edge. 
[normal]While the situation feels under control at the moment, there is anxiety about the consequences of a sudden change in the weather, given how mild winter has been so far. A cold spell could lead to greatly 
[normal]increased pressure on our members when there
[normal] is little slack in the system:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"
[normal]It is important to remember that (acute trusts) do not have an army of clinical staff waiting to be called in for action, or additional bed capacity to be spared for moments of c
[normal]risis. The fundamental change (needs to be in) the way in which resources are used. Improving patient flow, especially at week-ends, will allow for efficiency gains, which in turn will create additional capacity, allowing the system to 'flex' when experien
[normal]cing spikes in demand"
[normal] 
[normal](Medical Director, acute FT)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8 
[normal]As part of effective joint planning, t
[normal]here is an opportunity to work better with the independent sector. Where the NHS does not have enough capacity and the independent sector is able to help alleviate this pressure, it would seem like a good option to involve independent providers. As NHS Eng
[normal]land begins planning for winter pressures for next year the NHS Confederation's NHS Partners Network, which represents independent sector providers, will look to work with NHS England to ensure there is better engagement with the sector in urgent and emerg
[normal]ency long term planning. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal] 
[normal]Our urgent and emergency care forum will be publishing a report later this year highlighting in more detail some of the 
[normal]innovative work being done
[normal]. 
[normal]The release of winter money has been welcomed by our members
[normal]. 
[normal]In some areas 
[normal]i
[normal]t 
[normal]has helped fund innovations including better use of telemedicine to tackle pressures. 
[normal]One community provider, for example, has funded 
[normal]"a virtual ward" where medically stable patients were discharged from hospital earlier and have access to the ongoing ca
[normal]re they need within the comfort of their own homes
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10
[normal] 
[normal]Ambulance Services have also received 
[normal]an additional 
[normal]£14 million 
[normal]funding, allocated in December 2013, which was very welcome. Predominantly, this is now 
[normal]"being used to increase staffing on the front
[normal] line to place more 
[normal]e
[normal]mergency 
[normal]a
[normal]mbulances on the road to respond to patients and maintain a safe, efficient and effective service. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Hospital 
[normal]A
[normal]mbulance Liaison Officers have also been increased to manage effective and smooth handovers at 
[normal]e
[normal]mergency 
[normal]departments"
[normal] (Chief Executives and Senior Operation Managers, several A
[normal]mbulance Service provider Trusts and FT)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.11
[normal] 
[normal]However, our members are 
[normal]still 
[normal]concerned about the relatively late rel
[normal]ease of winter pressure funding. This 
[normal]makes planning and st
[normal]aff recruitment very difficult, and 
[normal]"it would be beneficial to have (such) funding sooner so that recruitment into the additional capacity could commence at an earlier date" (Community Health Service provider)
[normal]. 
[normal]We argue in our report, 
[normal]Emergency care: an ac
[normal]cident waiting to happen? 
[normal]that local commissioners should be given a clear steer on funding 
[normal]which will be available 
[normal]at the start of the financial allocation cycle so the local NHS can develop 
[normal]long term 
[normal]plans on how best to use this money
[normal] and 
[normal]prepare
[normal] for peak periods of demand, 
[normal]such as
[normal] difficult winters. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.12
[normal] 
[normal]What all of our conversations with members tell us is that an approach which takes into account all parts of the health service is essential in tackling this. 
[normal]In particular, shifting resources
[normal] into community
[normal] based 
[normal]services
[normal], while ensuring sustainable provision of care for those patients who require treatment in acute and emergency settings, remains paramount:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"Unlike previous years where very little investment has been made in community servic
[normal]es over the winter period, 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]this year a third of the winter monies were spent directly on schemes within community health with further investment in additional social care capacity, which I believe has made a significant impact on the ability of the system
[normal] to flex and deliver"
[normal](Chief Executive, Community Health Service provider)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With many future challenges facing the NHS, we must continue to examine how best we can deliver healthcare to communities, ensuring that A&amp;E is only for those requiring urgent medi
[normal]cal attention.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. [bold]Responding to the Keogh review [bold]on[bold] urgent and emergency care[bold]2.1 
[normal]Sticking plaster solutions for emergency care 
[normal]are
[normal] not a 
[normal]sufficient
[normal] 
[normal]response
[normal] to the long-term problems the system faces.
[normal] 
[normal]As outlined above
[normal] the winter pressure money recently allocated by the Government is welcome as it will help ease pressures in the short term
[normal]. However,
[normal] on its own it will 
[normal]not 
[normal]be 
[normal]enough
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2.2 
[normal]We need to radically change the way we provide care to address pressures on urgent 
[normal]and emergency services and improve patient care. As we set out in our
[normal] Emergency care: an accident waiting to happe
[normal]n
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]report, 
[normal]and our previous submission to the Committee
[normal],
[normal] this means more emphasis on prevention and more investment in pri
[normal]mary, community and
[normal] social care, an approach that n
[normal]eeds to be supported by 
[normal]getting the right 
[normal]incentives in 
[normal]place across 
[normal]the system. Reshaping the urgent and emergency care system will 
[normal]involve fostering
[normal] new ways of working, for example 
[normal]building on the greater role being playe
[normal]d by ambulance trusts in helping to reduce demand for care. 
[normal]  
[normal]2.3 
[normal]We are 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]very positive about 
[normal]Bruce Keogh's review
[normal],
[normal] as it reflects what our members have been telling us and delivers a vision for sustainable emergency care of the future. 
[normal]The 
[normal]issues around urgent and emergency care are complicated and the
[normal]re are no easy answers. However,
[normal] the Keogh review helps to move
[normal] the debate 
[normal]concerning
[normal] urgent and emergency care 
[normal]away 
[normal]from a focus on
[normal] crisis
[normal],
[normal] to
[normal]ward
[normal]s
[normal] a serious conversation about potential
[normal] 
[normal]long
[normal]-
[normal]term, sustainable 
[normal]solution
[normal]s
[normal] to the extraordinary pressures our members face
[normal].
[normal]2.4 
[normal]The r
[normal]eview's narrative is 
[normal]also 
[normal]very much in tune with our own 
[normal]2015 Challenge
[normal] campaign
[normal], which calls on all political parties to create the space for change in the NHS so that patients can receive the care they need at the right time and in the right place. We welcome Sir Bruce's recognition that not all 
[normal]emergency departments
[normal] are the same an
[normal]d that the status quo is not sustainable. We believe there is a vital role for politicians in helping communicate this to the public
[normal], as part of a broader conversation about the future of the health service
[normal]. 
[normal]2.5 
[normal]There are some areas where the NHS is worki
[normal]ng 
[normal]closely with 
[normal]local partners 
[normal]to
[normal] put in place effective solutions 
[normal]to tackle pressures. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is important to note that
[normal] certain solutions work well in some areas but not in others. For example, centralised models, such
[normal] as
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]review's 
[normal]major emergency centres
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]modelled on major trauma units, 
[normal]may 
[normal]work well in urban settings but 
[normal]be
[normal] difficult to implement in rural areas
[normal] and could destabilise existing arrangements that benefit patient care
[normal].  
[normal]NHS England
[normal] must 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]ensure 
[normal]the implementation of the review allows 
[normal]local flexibility
[normal], takes into account the interactions between urgent and emergency care and other sectors,
[normal] and 
[normal]do
[normal]es
[normal] not disrupt the innovative work already being done in some parts of the NH
[normal]S. A one-size fits all approach will not be 
[normal]helpful in ensuring l
[normal]ocal areas have solutio
[normal]ns tailored to the needs
[normal] 
[normal]of their 
[normal]community
[normal]. 
[normal]2.6 
[normal]A key problem for urgent and emergency care is the complicated
[normal],
[normal] and in some places
[normal],
[normal] fragmented system
[normal] we currently have
[normal]. The different sectors which provide urgent and emergency care
[normal] 
[normal]still too frequently
[normal] work in isolation. It is vital there is greater 
[normal]collaboration
[normal] between all parts of the
[normal] system in order to join up work to improve unscheduled care for patients.
[normal] 
[normal]Our members have emphasised the importance of local leadership 
[normal]in
[normal] bring
[normal]ing
[normal] together the different parts of the urgent and emergency care system
[normal] and this could be provided by nominating a "lead" agency in a local area
[normal]. 
[normal]We would
[normal] 
[normal]welcome 
[normal] clarity from NHS England 
[normal]on where
[normal] it 
[normal]see
[normal]s
[normal] this leadership coming from
[normal] as part of 
[normal]the implement
[normal]ation of
[normal] the review
[normal]. 
[normal]2.7 
[normal]The Keogh review 
[normal]looks at
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]role urgent and emergency care networks can play in bringing a local system together. 
[normal]In our view, t
[normal]here is potential for these networks to play a key role in bringing the local system together and pr
[normal]oviding leadership on urgent and emergency care. 
[normal]If this is the case
[normal],
[normal]  w
[normal]e need to be clear on how they will work in practice. It will be particularly important 
[normal]to clearly set out 
[normal]their role
[normal] and 
[normal]responsibilities
[normal] in relation to strategic direction, day to da
[normal]y delivery, performance monitoring and accountability. 
[normal]In addition
[normal],
[normal] we will need to know if the networks 
[normal]will have a prescribed model set out by NHS England
[normal] or 
[normal]if 
[normal]they
[normal] 
[normal]will 
[normal]be established by local initiative and 
[normal]also 
[normal]where the leadership of the networks will sit. 
[normal]2.8 
[normal]Our understanding is that
[normal] the networks will be different from the Urgent and Emergency Care Grou
[normal]ps 
[normal](previously known as boards) 
[normal]which already exist. We need to be clear 
[normal]about whether
[normal] the groups and the ne
[normal]tworks will operate as separate entities
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]if
[normal] one will be absorbed by the other. 
[normal]Since the main objective of the Keogh review is rightly
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]simpler
[normal], 
[normal]more 
[normal]coordinated system, this potential duplication 
[normal]must
[normal] be addressed by NHS England. 
[normal]2.9 
[normal]Our members' e
[normal]xperience of how effective the g
[normal]roups ha
[normal]ve
[normal] so far 
[normal]is 
[normal]variable. 
[normal]Some of our members tell us that they have 
[normal]brought 
[normal]much needed coordination to the system. However, other members have expressed concerns, including in some places limited engagement with primary care. 
[normal]Some of our ambulance members have found it difficult
[normal] to engage with the boards
[normal],
[normal] as the boards
[normal] cover a 
[normal]cl
[normal]inical commissioning group
[normal] area
[normal]s while ambulances services operate on a regional level
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]n some places 
[normal]a single 
[normal]ambulance trust ha
[normal]s
[normal] had to engage with over 20 urgent and emergency care boards. 
[normal]NHS England must learn the lessons from these groups when imple
[normal]menting the recommendations of the review.
