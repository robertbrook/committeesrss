default defaultF
defaultigures published in 
defaultNHS England's winter health check
default&#xa0;
defaultsh
defaultow that the percentage of patients spending under
default&#xa0;
defaultfour hours in A&amp;E 
defaultslightly 
defaultimproved over the Christmas period 
defaultcompared to
default previous years.
default 
defaultPerformance was 95.5 per cent
default&#xa0;
defaultin week ending 22 December and 96.4 per cent
default&#xa0;
defaultin week ending 29 December, both weeks hi
defaultgher than 2012. Attendances at A&amp;E have fallen, particularly in week ending 29 December, where attendances were lower than expected.
default 
defaultThis is testament to effective planning 
defaultat a local level 
defaultand hardworking NHS staff. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultHowever, figures also show that t
defaulthe A&amp;E target was narrowly missed in the week ending 5 January 2014. 94.29%
default of patients
default were seen in 4 hours or less, with 5,105 patients subject to waits of between 4 and 12 hours, the highest number since April
default 2013
default. While performance
default on the target
default is up
default on the same week 
defaultin 2013
default 
default(
defaultwhere the proportion was 93.04%
default)
default,
default the fact the target was missed continues to demonstrate the significant pressures felt in urgent and emergency care
default,
default which are in turn symptomatic of pressures 
defaultexperien
defaultced across all parts of the NHS. 
defaultThe 4 hour target also needs to be viewed in context -
default so far 
defaultthe weather this winter 
defaulthas been relatively mild.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultOur report 
defaultEmergency care: an accident waiting to happen? 
defaultpublished in September 2013 set out the 
defaultfindings of a survey we conducted with our members
default. This report found considerable concern amongst our members about the forthcoming winter, with only 45.7 per cent of respondents saying they were likely to hit the 95% four hour target throughout the wint
defaulter. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4 
defaultAs part of responding to this inquiry, we have spoken with some of our members to get a "snap shot" of the situation 
defaultin the health service 
defaultover the last few weeks. 
defaultAnecdotally
default,
default 
defaultthe overall sense is 
defaultof
default winter so far being "
defaultchallenging but manageab
defaultle"
default (Chief Executive, Community Health services provider). 
defaultIt can be
default difficult to establish a common pattern, because experience
defaults
default vary across the country and
default,
default sometimes
default,
default within the same trust
default: 
default"The number of patients attending medical wards is roughly the
default same [if compared with last year]
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultHowever, there is noticeable variation between week and week-end days, and variation between each week-end, up to 30%" 
default(Clinical Director, Acute NHS FT)
default&#xa0;
defaultSome providers are finding the period very difficult. One communi
defaultty provider told us:
default"Our local a
defaultcute (providers)
default have come under intense pressure in the post-Christmas period.
default&#xa0;
default In part this is because community and social care services are still not available and responsive at scale 24/7 and the default to A&amp;E is stil
defaultl sometimes the only option".
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSome members have
default also
default raised concerns with us about demoralised staff. One
default acute provider 
defaultstated
default:
default 
default"Front line staff are tired and demoralised – they do not see improvement or change and this is now urgently required".
default&#xa0;
default1.
default4 
defaultMany of the issues which we, the Committee and other
defaults
default highlighted last year have remained 
defaultproblematic
default. These include difficulties with recruiting and retaining emergency medicine clinicians, 
defaultlack of seven day workin
defaultg
default, handover delays
default and 
defaultthe need for 
defaultgreater clinical
default input in
default 111 services in some parts of the country
default. 
defaultSome among our 
defaulta
defaultmbulance 
defaults
defaultervice providers highlighted that:
default"
defaulta
defaultmbulance 
defaults
defaultervices are generally coping, and providing safe services for patients. (...)The handover delays have been slightl
defaulty less than last year, but we have been fortunate to have a 
default&#xa0;
defaultmild winter to date which has not realised some of the activity we may have expected at this point in the season. NHS 111 may have also had a greater benefit on the wider health economy, had it b
defaulteen implemented fully in all areas to the original timescale, and been embedded fully before winter arrived, with the appropriate advertising undertaken
default"
default&#xa0;
default1.5 
defaultT
defaulthe NHS has been proactive in tackling these pressures - we know of a considerable amount of inno
defaultvative work which is being done by our members to resp
defaultond to these concerns. These include
default a different use of staff roles to support patient flow, such as Patient Flow Support Officers, d
defaulteployed in some hospitals from 
defaultmidday
default until 10pm
default 
defaulton days w
defaulth
defaultere higher influx is registered; the use of rapid assessment and treatment teams, bringing together health and social care professionals; and 
defaultgreater support for
default clinical staff decision making, for example through training and deploying Paramedic Practitio
defaultners to divert pressures from 
defaultemergency departments, 
defaultsupport managing patient flow and mitigate delays in handovers. 
defaultProfessionals are also being
default used to improve links between sectors, such as mental health liaison psychiatrists. 
default1.6 
defaultMany of our members tell us that good planning and better joint working 
defaultat a local level 
defaulthas helped ensure the NHS is coping with winter pressures more
default effectively than
default in past years. One comm
defaultunity provider we spoke to said:
default"Winter thus far feels less fra
defaultught than last year. Locally we think this is because of a number of factors but importantly includes us seeing the benefit of work implemented earlier in the year to help with winter."
default&#xa0;
defaultJoint working across different sectors, in response to urgent and eme
defaultrgency care pressures, seems to have improved. Some 
defaultamong the 
defaultacute and community health 
defaultproviders which we consulted mentioned increased multi-disciplinary planning and service
default delivery as having a 
defaultpositive impact on reducing urgent and emergency care pre
defaultssures
default: 
default"Better collaborative working has created more capacity outside of hospital, so we have achieved more timely discharge, which has helped enormously".
default(Chief Operating Officer, Acute Trust)
default&#xa0;
default"The whole economy began planning for winter in June of 
defaultlast year and agreed a number of additional schemes that would be implemented. (...)The system is working in a much more integrated and collaborative way at ground level than ever before demonstrating benefits to the whole system and increasing staff moral
defaulte as they are jointly achieving, and partnerships are being cemented"
default(Chief Executive, Community Health Trust)
default1.7 
defaultHowever, our members 
defaultcontinue to
default express
default serious concern
defaults about lack of capacity, par
defaultticularly in terms of staffing. 
defaultMany 
defaultexpressed the view
default that urgent and emergency care is on a knife edge. 
defaultWhile the situation feels under control at the moment, there is anxiety about the consequences of a sudden change in the weather, given how mild winter has been so far. A cold spell could lead to greatly 
defaultincreased pressure on our members when there
default is little slack in the system:
default&#xa0;
default"
defaultIt is important to remember that (acute trusts) do not have an army of clinical staff waiting to be called in for action, or additional bed capacity to be spared for moments of c
defaultrisis. The fundamental change (needs to be in) the way in which resources are used. Improving patient flow, especially at week-ends, will allow for efficiency gains, which in turn will create additional capacity, allowing the system to 'flex' when experien
defaultcing spikes in demand"
default 
default(Medical Director, acute FT)
default&#xa0;
default1.8 
defaultAs part of effective joint planning, t
defaulthere is an opportunity to work better with the independent sector. Where the NHS does not have enough capacity and the independent sector is able to help alleviate this pressure, it would seem like a good option to involve independent providers. As NHS Eng
defaultland begins planning for winter pressures for next year the NHS Confederation's NHS Partners Network, which represents independent sector providers, will look to work with NHS England to ensure there is better engagement with the sector in urgent and emerg
defaultency long term planning. 
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default 
defaultOur urgent and emergency care forum will be publishing a report later this year highlighting in more detail some of the 
defaultinnovative work being done
default. 
defaultThe release of winter money has been welcomed by our members
default. 
defaultIn some areas 
defaulti
defaultt 
defaulthas helped fund innovations including better use of telemedicine to tackle pressures. 
defaultOne community provider, for example, has funded 
default"a virtual ward" where medically stable patients were discharged from hospital earlier and have access to the ongoing ca
defaultre they need within the comfort of their own homes
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default 
defaultAmbulance Services have also received 
defaultan additional 
default£14 million 
defaultfunding, allocated in December 2013, which was very welcome. Predominantly, this is now 
default"being used to increase staffing on the front
default line to place more 
defaulte
defaultmergency 
defaulta
defaultmbulances on the road to respond to patients and maintain a safe, efficient and effective service. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHospital 
defaultA
defaultmbulance Liaison Officers have also been increased to manage effective and smooth handovers at 
defaulte
defaultmergency 
defaultdepartments"
default (Chief Executives and Senior Operation Managers, several A
defaultmbulance Service provider Trusts and FT)
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default 
defaultHowever, our members are 
defaultstill 
defaultconcerned about the relatively late rel
defaultease of winter pressure funding. This 
defaultmakes planning and st
defaultaff recruitment very difficult, and 
default"it would be beneficial to have (such) funding sooner so that recruitment into the additional capacity could commence at an earlier date" (Community Health Service provider)
default. 
defaultWe argue in our report, 
defaultEmergency care: an ac
defaultcident waiting to happen? 
defaultthat local commissioners should be given a clear steer on funding 
defaultwhich will be available 
defaultat the start of the financial allocation cycle so the local NHS can develop 
defaultlong term 
defaultplans on how best to use this money
default and 
defaultprepare
default for peak periods of demand, 
defaultsuch as
default difficult winters. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default 
defaultWhat all of our conversations with members tell us is that an approach which takes into account all parts of the health service is essential in tackling this. 
defaultIn particular, shifting resources
default into community
default based 
defaultservices
default, while ensuring sustainable provision of care for those patients who require treatment in acute and emergency settings, remains paramount:
default&#xa0;
default"Unlike previous years where very little investment has been made in community servic
defaultes over the winter period, 
default&#xa0;
defaultthis year a third of the winter monies were spent directly on schemes within community health with further investment in additional social care capacity, which I believe has made a significant impact on the ability of the system
default to flex and deliver"
default(Chief Executive, Community Health Service provider)
default&#xa0;
defaultWith many future challenges facing the NHS, we must continue to examine how best we can deliver healthcare to communities, ensuring that A&amp;E is only for those requiring urgent medi
defaultcal attention.

defaultSticking plaster solutions for emergency care 
defaultare
default not a 
defaultsufficient
default 
defaultresponse
default to the long-term problems the system faces.
default 
defaultAs outlined above
default the winter pressure money recently allocated by the Government is welcome as it will help ease pressures in the short term
default. However,
default on its own it will 
defaultnot 
defaultbe 
defaultenough
default.
default 
default2.2 
defaultWe need to radically change the way we provide care to address pressures on urgent 
defaultand emergency services and improve patient care. As we set out in our
default Emergency care: an accident waiting to happe
defaultn
default?
default 
defaultreport, 
defaultand our previous submission to the Committee
default,
default this means more emphasis on prevention and more investment in pri
defaultmary, community and
default social care, an approach that n
defaulteeds to be supported by 
defaultgetting the right 
defaultincentives in 
defaultplace across 
defaultthe system. Reshaping the urgent and emergency care system will 
defaultinvolve fostering
default new ways of working, for example 
defaultbuilding on the greater role being playe
defaultd by ambulance trusts in helping to reduce demand for care. 
default  
default2.3 
defaultWe are 
defaulttherefore 
defaultvery positive about 
defaultBruce Keogh's review
default,
default as it reflects what our members have been telling us and delivers a vision for sustainable emergency care of the future. 
defaultThe 
defaultissues around urgent and emergency care are complicated and the
defaultre are no easy answers. However,
default the Keogh review helps to move
default the debate 
defaultconcerning
default urgent and emergency care 
defaultaway 
defaultfrom a focus on
default crisis
default,
default to
defaultward
defaults
default a serious conversation about potential
default 
defaultlong
default-
defaultterm, sustainable 
defaultsolution
defaults
default to the extraordinary pressures our members face
default.
default2.4 
defaultThe r
defaulteview's narrative is 
defaultalso 
defaultvery much in tune with our own 
default2015 Challenge
default campaign
default, which calls on all political parties to create the space for change in the NHS so that patients can receive the care they need at the right time and in the right place. We welcome Sir Bruce's recognition that not all 
defaultemergency departments
default are the same an
defaultd that the status quo is not sustainable. We believe there is a vital role for politicians in helping communicate this to the public
default, as part of a broader conversation about the future of the health service
default. 
default2.5 
defaultThere are some areas where the NHS is worki
defaultng 
defaultclosely with 
defaultlocal partners 
defaultto
default put in place effective solutions 
defaultto tackle pressures. 
defaultI
defaultt is important to note that
default certain solutions work well in some areas but not in others. For example, centralised models, such
default as
default 
defaultthe 
defaultreview's 
defaultmajor emergency centres
default,
default 
defaultmodelled on major trauma units, 
defaultmay 
defaultwork well in urban settings but 
defaultbe
default difficult to implement in rural areas
default and could destabilise existing arrangements that benefit patient care
default.  
defaultNHS England
default must 
defaulttherefore 
defaultensure 
defaultthe implementation of the review allows 
defaultlocal flexibility
default, takes into account the interactions between urgent and emergency care and other sectors,
default and 
defaultdo
defaultes
default not disrupt the innovative work already being done in some parts of the NH
defaultS. A one-size fits all approach will not be 
defaulthelpful in ensuring l
defaultocal areas have solutio
defaultns tailored to the needs
default 
defaultof their 
defaultcommunity
default. 
default2.6 
defaultA key problem for urgent and emergency care is the complicated
default,
default and in some places
default,
default fragmented system
default we currently have
default. The different sectors which provide urgent and emergency care
default 
defaultstill too frequently
default work in isolation. It is vital there is greater 
defaultcollaboration
default between all parts of the
default system in order to join up work to improve unscheduled care for patients.
default 
defaultOur members have emphasised the importance of local leadership 
defaultin
default bring
defaulting
default together the different parts of the urgent and emergency care system
default and this could be provided by nominating a "lead" agency in a local area
default. 
defaultWe would
default 
defaultwelcome 
default clarity from NHS England 
defaulton where
default it 
defaultsee
defaults
default this leadership coming from
default as part of 
defaultthe implement
defaultation of
default the review
default. 
default2.7 
defaultThe Keogh review 
defaultlooks at
default 
defaultthe 
defaultrole urgent and emergency care networks can play in bringing a local system together. 
defaultIn our view, t
defaulthere is potential for these networks to play a key role in bringing the local system together and pr
defaultoviding leadership on urgent and emergency care. 
defaultIf this is the case
default,
default  w
defaulte need to be clear on how they will work in practice. It will be particularly important 
defaultto clearly set out 
defaulttheir role
default and 
defaultresponsibilities
default in relation to strategic direction, day to da
defaulty delivery, performance monitoring and accountability. 
defaultIn addition
default,
default we will need to know if the networks 
defaultwill have a prescribed model set out by NHS England
default or 
defaultif 
defaultthey
default 
defaultwill 
defaultbe established by local initiative and 
defaultalso 
defaultwhere the leadership of the networks will sit. 
default2.8 
defaultOur understanding is that
default the networks will be different from the Urgent and Emergency Care Grou
defaultps 
default(previously known as boards) 
defaultwhich already exist. We need to be clear 
defaultabout whether
default the groups and the ne
defaulttworks will operate as separate entities
default,
default or 
defaultif
default one will be absorbed by the other. 
defaultSince the main objective of the Keogh review is rightly
default a
default 
defaultsimpler
default, 
defaultmore 
defaultcoordinated system, this potential duplication 
defaultmust
default be addressed by NHS England. 
default2.9 
defaultOur members' e
defaultxperience of how effective the g
defaultroups ha
defaultve
default so far 
defaultis 
defaultvariable. 
defaultSome of our members tell us that they have 
defaultbrought 
defaultmuch needed coordination to the system. However, other members have expressed concerns, including in some places limited engagement with primary care. 
defaultSome of our ambulance members have found it difficult
default to engage with the boards
default,
default as the boards
default cover a 
defaultcl
defaultinical commissioning group
default area
defaults while ambulances services operate on a regional level
default. 
defaultI
defaultn some places 
defaulta single 
defaultambulance trust ha
defaults
default had to engage with over 20 urgent and emergency care boards. 
defaultNHS England must learn the lessons from these groups when imple
defaultmenting the recommendations of the review.
