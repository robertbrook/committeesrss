"&#xa0;\nFurther Written Evidence from James Patrick [CST0034]&#xa0;Introduction:This evidence is submitted in my capacity as holder of the independent office of Constable, warrant number P231501, but not on behalf of my current force the Metropolitan Police Service.\nThis evidence contains 2,823 words and spreads over 6 pages. The content is true to the best of my knowledge and honest belief.\nSummary of Evidence:The intent of this written submission is to clarify points which have arisen since the publication of my original evidence and my appearance before the Committee on the 19th of November 2013, and provide additional information, on the manipulation of crime statistics in London, which was not included in my first written submission due to the volume of material.\nA. In reference to my evidence the Metropolitan have made public comments which are not consistent with the facts publicly available.\nB. Additional evidence regarding crime statistics has come to light, supplementing the body of evidence regarding sexual offences in London, and showing similar behaviours outside of the capital.\nC. There are elements of my original evidence which warrant clarification, and it is necessary to provide an explanation of what was meant by \n\"you can physically see it it in the notes\"\n, as this has been raised by the Home Affairs Select Committee.\nBackground:5. This evidence is submitted further to my original statement dated September 2013, already published by the Committee. I am presently being prevented from raising or discussing these issues and have been, for that reason, unable to add context and clarification to the ongoing public debate sparked by the inquiry. I have already raised the issue of flaws in the police whistleblowing system.\nEvidence:A1. On the 3rd of December 2013, at the Home Affairs Select Committee session on Counter Terrorism, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, made the following statements in response to questions 335 and 336, which were specifically about my evidence to \nthis\n Committee: \n\"The HMI inspected our systems in 2012 and found them to be competent and reliable\"\n and \n“we think that some of the comments that this officer made to the Public Affairs Committee relate to a period of over two years ago when the no crime issue was around 25%”.\nA2. On the 11th of December 2013, on Victoria Derbyshire's BBC Five Live radio show, Commander Adrian Hanstock of the Metropolitan Service was discussing my evidence. When asked if he accepted the evidence his response was clear: \n“No, I don’t”\n. He went on to say that the Met believed I had been referring to figures from two years ago, or more, in line with the Commissioner’s statement to the HASC.\nA3. The periods referred to in my evidence are:\n              \nShift changes and London Riots \n              \n- \n              \n2010 – 2011\n              \nRobbery Downgrades\n              \n              \n              \n-\n              \n2011 – 2012\n              \nBurglary Baseline Analysis\n              \n              \n-\n              \n2012 - 2013\n              \nRape Analysis of NC/CRI 2012/13\n              \n-\n              \n2013\nA4. My original submission to this Committee discussed internal audits as follows: \n\"\nI consulted the Force Crime Registrar and disturbingly found that Rape was prioritised well under petty theft and subsequently was not regularly audited at all due to the volume of work\n\".\nA5. On the 17th of December 2013, Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of HMIC, appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committee and was clear that crime statistics were being manipulated. He made the following statement in response to the Commissioner's comments: \n\"Sir Bernard gave evidence, I think to this committee on December 3, where he said that, in 2012, HMIC inspected the Met and found their figures in terms of crime recording were 'competent and reliable'. I've written to Sir Bernard about this because what HMIC in fact said was that it looked at '244 incidents logged by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), 30 had been wrongly closed without a crime being raised, while in overall terms the MPS continues to improve its crime and incident data quality, this indicates that crime and ASB (anti-social behaviour) data recorded in London gives some cause for concern'. So there is a big difference between 'some cause of concern' and 'competent and reliable'. I have not yet received Sir Bernard's response”.\n&#xa0;\nA6. It is apparent, from points A3 to A5, that the public comments of Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (at A1) and Commander Adrian Hanstock (at A2) are not consistent with the facts available.\nB1. On the 19\nth\n of November 2013 The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, published the below data table (Fig 1) which displays Metropolitan Police data obtained through the FOIA, and relates to rape offences in the years 2009-2013: \nFig 1.\nB2. What can be seen in the data table is that, as the percentage of No Crimes falls from 19.4% in 2009 to its (March) 2013 level of 9.9% (which is largely consistent with my data), the percentage of Crime Related Incidents rises from 10.2% to 19.3% (again largely consistent with my data). It is also clear that the overall proportion of both No Crime and CRI combined, effectively offences kept off the books, remains between 25% and 29%. \nB3. As I have pointed out in my previous submission, there are anomalies in the Met data systems depending on dates of searches and which system is used. This may explain marginal differences between the FOI figures and the internal ones. However, on the whole the data table is consistent with my own analysis of the 2012/2013 data, which also showed a tight correlation between No Crime, CRI usage and detections. To me, it was clearly indicative of the extent of the use of all three in workload management. Further context, to the switch between No Crime and CRI in the period 2009 to 2013, is that significant efforts were made to specifically reduce “no criming” - the very thing so clearly documented by the IPCC in the Southwark report.\n&#xa0;\nB5. Within my internal report I included the following findings, the one redaction being the name of the civilian analyst: \n“\nInitially looking at the data on ‘reclassification’ of offences [REDACTED] found that: \n“No Crime / CRI's have basically doubled from 2009/10 to 2012/13”. \nThis references a numeric doubling of the use of two categories, (346 in the year 2009/2010 to 708 in the year 2012/2013). The percentages change very little over time, which shows that organisationally the behaviour impacts the same proportion of offences, regardless of the increases or decreases in reporting. It is this which gives the best indication of limited cultural change over the last five years”.\n&#xa0;\nB6. Further evidence of the longevity and organisational knowledge of the cultural issues is also provided within my report, the evidence coming directly in writing, from a leader in the SC&amp;O CMU describing the situation pre 2009: “\nI remember one year when Harringay were showing a 66% decrease in recorded rape offences (I can't remember which year but it wasn't long before the move across to SCD). I remember at about that time DAC Janet Williams forced a peer review of all rape records because of massive concerns over classification accuracy, this was in response to a paper by a Supt in the Violent Crime Directorate which showed many examples of incorrect classification of sexual offences”. \nHe goes on to give a very graphic example of a rape offence which was incorrectly classified and riddled with inaccuracies (which I have omitted here) and then continues, “\nWhen victims attended to report rape offences they were often left waiting for hours before anything was committed to CRIS. Many Borough's had 'policies' in place to not let anyone open a Rape CRIS until the victim had been seen by a DS from their Sapphire team (A similar tactic was used to reduce Robbery crime). A good proportion of the victims who attended to report just got fed up waiting &amp; walked away with no CRIS record ever being made, be it classified \nCRI'd or no crime”. \n&#xa0;\nB7. On the 17\nth\n of December the same journalist at The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported further figures obtained under the FOIA, this time covering 2012 alone but broken down by Borough. I was not surprised by the findings. To quote the article directly: \n“The data also reveals large variations across London in the percentage of rape reports classified in this way, adding to fears the use of the categories may be being abused by some boroughs. In Barking, just 19% of rape reports were classed as no-crimes or CRIs in 2012, compared with 40% of allegations made in Lambeth, 39% of those made in Bexley and 34% of reports made in Greenwich. Other London boroughs with high combined rates of no criming and CRIs include Bromley, Sutton, Tower Hamlets and Westminster”.\n&#xa0;\nB8. It is clear from the combination of evidence that the overall behaviour is not only cultural within the Met, but both prolonged and geographically identifiable. Much like any crime hotspot. Essentially, all that changes over the five year period is that CRI usurps No Crime as the favoured manipulative behaviour. Neither approach is any different from the old approach described at B6, it's simply evolution (and this is displayed aptly at point 21 of my original submission). With the correct resources and access to the data it would be possible to create a detailed map, even being able to follow the behaviours over time as officers and leaders move. Effectively we could potentially pinpoint not only what is occurring and where, but how, when and, most importantly who. \n&#xa0;\nB9. Beyond sexual offences and beyond London, further evidence of manipulation has emerged, with Essex being one example. These comments from an Essex Police whistleblower were reported in the 'Gazette' on the 25\nth\n of November 2013: \n“This is going on all over Essex. Operation Julep in Southend has been running for years. The way it works is officers are allocated a mobile phone. Retailers are told to not come through the switchboard, but to call the mobile phone. Then it doesn’t get recorded in the proper way, unless the person responsible is caught – and then it is recorded, so you get 100 per cent detection. They are totally bypassing the system. We were told attempted burglaries, where a window is smashed, should be marked down as criminal damage to reduce burglary figures. A yob goes down a road bashing in wing mirrors, but it is put down as a road traffic accident. It is wrong. We know it is wrong and it does not sit comfortably. Mobile phones being taken are not recorded as theft, but lost property. Hundreds of crimes are not recorded.”\n&#xa0;\nC1. In light of statements from the Met, including Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, that an internal inquiry is underway, I must make clear I have not had any contact from anyone in the Met wishing to investigate my evidence, or the issues raised. It is subsequently important to relay the recommendations (shown below in order of their appearance) that were made in my report this summer - before it was suppressed, as is documented at point 23 of my original  submission. \n&#xa0;\n“Trust and Confidence:\n&#xa0;\n1) A voluntary referral to be made to the HMIC, prior to any HMIC initiated inspection,\nrequesting external scrutiny under the following terms of reference:\n&#xa0;\na. To carry out an independent review, (using an enhanced representative sample),\nof the use of CRI and No Crime within SC&amp;O2/5 to ensure compliance with the\nHOCR and with the ethical standards expected.\n&#xa0;\nb. To carry out an independent review of the crime types of Robbery Person &amp;\nTheft from Person and Robbery of Mobile Phone &amp; Theft of Mobile Phone, (using\nan enhanced representative sample), to ensure compliance with HOCR and\nwith the ethical standards expected.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2) To present the ‘Crime Recording in the MPS’ PowerPoint to Management Board in\norder to ensure that the context, data and potential implications are understood at the\nhighest level, in order to support the request to the HMIC.\n&#xa0;\n3) To incorporate monthly searches for comparable offence trend correlations, and\nstatistical norm deviations in No Crime and CRI, into standard analytical practice across\nthe MPS, on all OCUs, at all Crime Fighters and Performance Board Meetings.\n&#xa0;\n4) To meet with the HMIC as soon as possible to establish the new inspection practices\nthat best identify issues within audits of crime figures, and to use this to overhaul the\naudit processes for DAT”.\n&#xa0;\n“Code of Investigative Ethics:\n&#xa0;\n1) To review the language and style used in the DETS section of crime reports, to build a\nprofessional uniformity and clarity, in order that the facts are reflected as coolly as\npossible and in a manner which would raise no doubt if subjected to external,\nunsympathetic scrutiny. This will also enhance the ongoing internal audit and\ncompliance regime for recorded crime.\n&#xa0;\n2) To rigorously enforce the prompt supervision and regular review of all crimes, non\ncrimes and CRIs in line with the good standards laid out in the TP policy on investigating\nMost Serious Violence and to engage DOI in the process of amending the CRI flagging\nfacility within CRIS.\nPage 5 of 63) For HR to investigate the historic use of and, in liaison with OCUs, withdraw any\nremaining statistical targets from the personal PDRs of investigative staff.\n&#xa0;\n4) To develop a methodology for identifying location or team specific performance risk,\nrather than drive performance to targets. The aim of this is to direct additional resource\nto support performance risk areas as they arise, rather than raise the likelihood of\nperverse performance in response to pressure to meet targets.\n&#xa0;\n5) To review and remove the use of CRI for the purposes of Rape and Sexual Offences.\nThis will enable a more simplified view of Undetected, Detected and proven No Crime\nacross the MPS, and ensure that nothing is slipping through the Offender Management\nnet. This also complies with the judgement of the IPCC on the importance of ‘recording\nat first contact’ and steps away from the ‘Charging Standards’ approach to recording\ncrime, which is incorrect.\n&#xa0;\n6) To cease the use of withdrawal and retraction statements for sexual offences and to\ndevelop an improved procedure and rigorous withdrawal verification method,\nincorporating enhanced victim care instead. This will require a mature conversation at\nManagement Board around the need to accept a certain amount of undetected crime,\nalbeit in an environment that is subject to more stringent controls. Again, this would bring\nthe MPS into line with the judgements of the IPCC and third sector recommendations.\n&#xa0;\n7) Consideration to be given to the temporary allocation of resource to review the last\ntwelve months of No Crime and CRI, with a view to identifying any reports which should\nbe subject to immediate investigative review, in order to minimise risk to the public.\n&#xa0;\n8) An investigation into the development, management and impact of local policies on\nthe recording of Robbery vs. Theft, taking into account critical events such as the\ndiscovery of the ‘No IMEI, No Crime’ campaign, which is grossly inappropriate”.\n&#xa0;\n“Crime and Misconduct:\n&#xa0;\n1) To develop a cross rank MPS Ethics Committee (not hierarchically chaired), to identify\nand challenge the organisation on areas of ethics, culture, potential crime and\nmisconduct that currently fall outside of the traditional DPS understanding and strategy.\nThis committee should also act in consultation with the HMIC and MOPAC on the\ndevelopment of the new MOPAC Ethics Commission. Any such committee should have\nrotating membership every twelve months, direct access to Management Board and the\nability to challenge the MPS robustly without fear of any topic being too uncomfortable”.\n&#xa0;\nC2. One further clarification relates to the Home Affairs Select Committee and an interpretation by the Chair, on the 17\nth\n of December during the session with Tom Winsor, that I had intended the comment “you can physically see this in the notes...” to mean that notes had been changed. That was not my intention and perhaps I should have phrased it better. What I meant by this was: “when reading the investigative notes of the crime reports (on a computer system), you can clearly see through the language used, or the number of visits to the victims, or the described activities themselves...” I hope this clarification and, my apology for any misunderstanding, is accepted.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion:6. Once again, \nI thank the Committee for their time in reading and their consideration of this written evidence, and I also welcome any questions that the Committee may wish to ask. I am happy to be called before the Committee at their convenience. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
