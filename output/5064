defaultSupplementary written evidence from the defaultRtdefault Hon Hugh Robertson MP, defaultMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Officedefault (USA 18)default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for giving me the opportunity to present evidence to the Committee as part of your inquiry into the Government’s foreign policy towards the United States.  I promised to provide you with further details in response to some members’ questions, as well as answers to some additional questions subsequently raised in the Committee Specialist’s follow-up letter of 9 December 2013.  
defaultYou will find responses to the Committee’s questions on the policy-making machinery (3, 4, 6-9) and on other issues (9-11) in Annex A. Other Whitehall departments, including the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office, have contributed to these answers. 
defaultThe Committee also posed a series of questions on the UK Government’s position on humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect. As agreed with the Committee, we will write separately on these issues shortly.  
defaultI understand the National Security Adviser is writing separately on other matters raised.
defaultI hope the Committee finds this additional information useful as it prepares its reports.  
defaultAll my very best wishes,
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTHE RT HON HUGH ROBERTSON MP
defaultMINISTER OF STATE

defaultAnnex Adefault&#xa0;
defaultQuestion default3default: How many staff comprise the US team in the FCO’s Americas team under Kate Smith? How, if at all, has the size of the US team changed since 2010? Does the US team include a Research Analyst? Is there anyone in the FCO in London tasked with the longer-term analysis of US politics and policy, or is this work carried out exclusively by FCO staff working in the US?defaultThe
defaultre are five officials in the FCO’s
default North America Department under Americas Director Kate Smith working on the UK’s bilateral relationship with the United States
default.
default The staffing levels were the same in 2010. 
defaultAdditionally, the Americas Research Group includes one analyst dedicated to the US, as well as other North American issues. 
defaultLonger-term analysis of US politics and policy is factored in to all the work carried out by North Americas Department, as well as by 
defaultFCO 
defaultstaff working in Washington and the wider US network. Much of the work carried out by the North Americas Department Research Analyst also looks at the future of US politics, which in turn informs the work undertaken by staff both in London and in the US. As you will be aware, the FCO also has a separate Policy Unit which plays an important role in longer term strategic analysis of the US 
defaultand US policy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion default4default: How widely within the FCO and across Government is the Washington Embassy’s reporting distributed? How does this compare to the distribution for reporting from the UK’s Embassies in other major international partners, such as France? defaultReporting originating from the British Embassy in Washington and the US network (the Consulates-General in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco, Consulate in 
defaultOrlando
default and government office in Seattle) 
defaultreaches all parts of government
default, depending on the subject matter.  This includes
default No 10
default, 
defaultCabinet Office
default, 
defaultHer Majesty’s Treasury
default, the 
defaultDepartment for International Development
default, the
default Ministry of Defence
default, the
default; Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
default,
default UK Trade and Investment
default, the
default Bank of England
default, the
default Department of Health
default, the 
defaultDepartment of Work and Pensions
default, the
default Department for Education
default, the
default Department of Energy and Climate Change
default, the
default Department for Transport
default, the
default National Crime Agency. The reporting is also circulated widely to 
defaultd
defaultepartments within the FCO in London, as well as to 
defaultFCO p
defaultosts across the world.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultEmbassy 
defaultand network’s reporting covers
default the full range of issues that have the potential to affect UK interests
default, from 
defaultUS foreign and security policy 
defaultto 
defaulteconomic and global issues such as finance, trade, energy and climate.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultR
defaulteporting also covers domestic political and social issues – from developments in Congress and national and regional elections, to some of the longer term trends in US society.
default&#xa0;
defaultR
defaulteport
defaults
default come in many formats: diplomatic telegrams which are distributed widely within the FCO global network and across Government; e-mails of a more technical nature aimed at experts within the relevant parts of government; letters and emails of a more sensitive nature
default, 
defaultoften sent from the Ambassador to a narrower, senior Whitehall audience.
default&#xa0;
default The 
defaultEmbassy and
default Consulates General produce more reporting by diplomatic telegram than any other bilateral network in the world. 
defaultG
defaultiven the breadth of subjects it deals with on a daily basis, the reporting is one of (if not the) most shared of all the Foreign Office’s reporting. 
defaultTo give the Committee a sense of the type and quality of the reporting, we would be pleased to offer the Committee the opportunity to view some of it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion default6default: Has the National Security Council ever had a dedicated agenda item on any aspect of US politics or policy? (i.e. not simply a discussion of US policy in the context of an agenda item on, say Afghanistan or Syria or another policy issue)defaultHer Majesty’s Government does not comment on any specific agenda items discussed at the National Security Council.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion default7:default Is there a cross Government country strategy for the US?defaultUK interests in and with the US cover a vast range of issues and engage most if not all UK government departments. It has not been considered feasible to capture the totality of this interest and engagement in a single US strategy document shared across Whitehall.  But engagement with the US i
defaults an integral part of
default the strategic objectives of
default many Whitehall departments
default 
default– including FCO, MOD, Home Office, DECC, BIS and HMT. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis 
defaultis reflected in 
defaultdocumentary form in 
defaultthe 
defaultUS Network’s annual 
defaulthigh-level
default Country
default Business Plan – which
default is drawn up with input from across government and reflects cross departmental objectives for the forthcoming year. 
default 
defaultIt is designed to be a short snapshot of the top line UK priorities in the US, and is underpinned by additional team and personal objectives across the network. The US network’s 
defaultcore business in the US is the 
defaultimplementation of this Business Plan, as well as the analysis and investment in relationships necessary to sustain our overall engagement and pursue UK interests. A copy of the plan can be found in Annex B.
defaultTo inform and guide this work, the
default Government does look at longer term dynamics
default - 
default where American politics, economy and society are heading, how we expect the relationship to evolve over time, and what risks and opportunities these trends bring for the UK.
default&#xa0;
default Much of this work is led by the Embassy and wider US network, 
defaultincluding its cross Whitehall representation, 
defaultwh
defaultich
default 
defaultare specifically resourced and best placed to draw on the array of policy practitioners, analysts and experts in the US, including think tanks,
default commentators
default and academics. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion default8default: Does the National Security staff in the Cabinet Office, or the Defence Strategy and Priorities team in the defaultMoDdefault, or the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) at defaultShrivenhamdefault, have any staff tasked with the longer-term analysis of US politics and policy?defaultThe relationship with the US is fundamental to almost all of the work undertaken by National Security Staff in the Cabinet Office. Staff maintain close working relationships with key US contacts and share analysis of politics and policy with colleagues across Whitehall, including the FCO and MoD.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith regards to the Defence Strategy and Priorities (DSP)
default team in MOD
default, whil
defaulte
default 
defaultit
default do
defaultes
default not have any staff permanently assigned to longer-term analysis of US politics and policy
default,
default 
defaultit 
defaultkeeps a very close eye on the strategic direction of our paramount security partner as the Committee would expect. This is 
defaultcentred
default upon a close working relationship with the team in the US Office of the Secretary of Defense which is 
defaultresponsible for leading the Quadrennial Defense Review. We co-operate on strategic planning, sharing analysis and emerging conceptual thinking. DSP has US and French Exchange Officers embedded within it, and there is also a UK Exchange Officer inside the US strategy team in the Department of Defense. Within the UK Embassy in Washington, MOD has a large Defence Section dedicated to strengthening the UK/US bilateral relationship, but wh
defaultich
default also report
defaults
default and provide
defaults
default comment on US Defence policy. 
defaultThe Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) also undertake longer-term analysis of US politics and policy, particularly through their work on ‘Global strategic trends to 2045’. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 9: defaultWhat work on the US has the DCDC done or commissioned as part of its current work on its ‘Global strategic trends to 2045’ document, due for publication in the first half of 2014?defaultDCDC has conducted 
defaulta 
defaultstudy in support of Global Strategic Trends 2045 on the US.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe study (titled ‘US focus on the Asia-Pacific Region’) aims to examine the effect of Washington’s reorientation of its foreign policy focus away from Europe towards the Asia Pacific region and will be published in December 2014.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 10: defaultFor the US-UK bilateral relationship, I would be grateful for a list of outward ministerial, and inward Administration and Congressional visits, so far this year – as some indicator of the intensity of contact (and in the awareness that patterns may have been disrupted this year by the establishment of the second Obama Administration and 113defaultthdefault Congress after the 2012 elections).defaultWe are aware of
default at least
default 59 outward Ministerial visits to the US
default during 2013. Whilst we do not keep a track of all the inward Administration and Congressional visits to the UK, Annex C gives a 
defaultflavour
default of some 
default1
default7 inward visits that took place during 2013.
default 
defaultMany of these visits
default compromised a num
defaultber of Senators and Congressmen/
defaultCongresswomen.
defaultG
defaultiven the high volume and frequency of visitors to both the US and UK, 
defaultthere will
default 
defaultcertainly have been other outward and inward visits which are not listed, many of which will have been 
defaultorganised
default independently. The FCO is not always involved in inward visits, particularly when Members of Congress undertake private trips. We are also aware of a number of short stopover visits to the UK by Senator Kerry, as well as numerous visits by senior State Department officials to discuss the situation in Syria which are not listed. 
defaultQuestion 11: defaultDid the US Administration inform the UK that it was conducting private bilateral talks with Iran between August and November 2013? defaultMany of the E3+3 (France, Germany, UK + China, Russia, US) have had bilateral discussions with Iran, of which we were aware. The Joint Plan of Action is the
default&#xa0;
defaultresult of the E3+3 negotiations with Iran
default.
