[normal]University and College Union – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]FE and Skills Measures 
[normal]1.1. 
[normal]UCU
[normal], the University and College Union represents over 120,000 members working in higher education, further education (FE), adult and prison education. The De-regulation Bill proposes the revocation of various existing regulations. This submission gives 
[normal]UCU
[normal]’s views about the proposals to abolish a number of regulations concerning FE colleges.
[normal]1.2. 
[normal]The government proposed in 2012 to revoke two sets of regulations: The Further Education Teachers’ Continuing Professional Development and Registration (England) Regulations (2007) and the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations (2007). The first set was revoked on 
[normal]30
[normal]th
[normal] September 2012
[normal].
[normal] The De-Regulation Bill proposes in Section 13 to repeal the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulation (2007) which would mean there would no longer be a requirement for FE lecturers and trainers to have or obtain a professional FE teaching qualification 
[normal]1.3. The De-regulation Bill, if passed, also proposes to remove what is considered unnecessary regulation so that colleges and skills providers are free to better respond to the needs of their local communities. 
[normal]1.4. This submission will give 
[normal]UCU
[normal]’s views and concerns regarding the removal of the requirement around FE teachers’ teaching qualification requirement and those around removing regulations to give colleges ‘more freedom and flexibility.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1. This Regulation was part of a package of Regulations concerned with the FE workforce introduced in September 2007. There were a number of regulations on FE teacher and Principal qualifications, a requirement around the undertaking of Continuous Professional Development by FE teachers and Regulations introducing Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills status (QTLS), and mandatory membership of the then FE professional body, the Institute for Learning (
[normal]IfL
[normal]). 
[normal]UCU
[normal] did not oppose the revocation of the Regulations on CPD, QTLS and the end of mandatory membership of 
[normal]IfL
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 2.2. Some aspects of the 2007 Workforce Regulations proved to be very contentious. The requirement for a certain amount of CPD was not contentious, but had become somewhat redundant as virtually all FE lecturers were undertaking the required amount, (30 hour per year and pro rata for those working part time). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3. The Regulation around QTLS status was introduced to give equivalency in terms of status between FE lecturers and school teachers. This was needed at the time as schools were increasingly offering vocational courses and qualified FE staff who wished to work in school were seen and paid as unqualified staff, even if they held a FE teaching qualification. The equivalency between QTLS and QTS has also becoming somewhat unnecessary, as in the 
[normal]summer of 2012, the Secretary of State for Education announced that academies, free, studio and UTC need no longer employ qualified teachers. The main rationale for QTLS was considerably diminished.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4. Most of the 2007 Workforce Regulations have already been revoked. This was a result of the 
[normal]Lingfield
[normal] Review Panel on FE workforce professionalism whose final report came out in 2012. The Review was set up as a result of a dispute with 
[normal]IfL
[normal] and many staff in FE. This arose out of the decision that 
[normal]BIS
[normal] would no longer pay the 
[normal]IfL
[normal] membership fee for FE teachers. 
[normal]BIS
[normal] has paid this since 2007 and the introduction of the Workforce Regulations. This payment ended in 2011 and 
[normal]IfL
[normal] members were required to pay a higher membership fee themselves. 
[normal]UCU
[normal] members and other staff in FE felt strongly that the benefits of 
[normal]IfL
[normal] membership were not worth the membership fee and refused to pay it. 
[normal]UCU
[normal] declared a dispute on the issue. 
[normal]UCU
[normal] members were not alone in this view. Of the 200,000 members 
[normal]IfL
[normal] claimed, 130,000 also refused to pay the 
[normal]IfL
[normal] membership. To try to resolve this conflict the Government set up the 
[normal]Lingfield
[normal] Review in the 
[normal]Spring
[normal] 2011. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5. The 
[normal]Lingfield
[normal] Review produced an interim and a final report in 2012. Among its recommendations was the revocation of the 2007 Workforce Regulations, a review and re-writing of the FE teaching qualifications and that 
[normal]IfL
[normal] membership cease to be mandatory. The regulations on these issues were revoked following a 
[normal]BIS
[normal] consultation in 2012. The decision to revoke the Regulation on the requirement for staff to hold a FE teaching qualification was postponed for a year. It is this Regulation that comprises the main proposal for the De-regulation Bill impacting on FE Colleges.
[normal]3.1. The maintenance of this Regulation is crucial for a high quality FE teaching workforce and for high quality teaching and learning. At a time when the government rightly 
[normal]emphasises
[normal] the need for the highest quality teaching and learning across education, the removal of this requirement could potentially damage the capacity of colleges to continue to offer this.
[normal]3.2. This is not just 
[normal]UCU
[normal]’s view.  Most, if not all, the major stakeholder and representative 
[normal]organisations
[normal] oppose the revocation of this Regulation. 
[normal]3.3. The responses to the 
[normal]BIS
[normal] consultation on revoking the Regulations clearly show grave concerns across the Sector, especially around the removal of the requirement for a teaching qualification.
[normal]“The consultation shows that, amongst those who responded, there is some concern about the revocation of the regulations and the impact that this would have on providers and staff and their ability to serve their learners, communities and business. This concern is particularly acute with regard to the qualifications regulations
[normal]”
[normal]“There were widespread concerns about unintended consequences that could arise if all the regulations are revoked without substantial and clear alternative arrangements to replace them. A major view was that this could damage the quality and reputation of the 
[normal]sector and lower the status of FE teachers and lecturers. However, the major representative 
[normal]organisations
[normal] did not support continued mandatory registration with the Institute for Learning.
[normal]”
[normal]“Concerns were expressed that this could undermine efforts to 
[normal]professionalise
[normal] the sector since the introduction of the regulation in 2007. Respondents also feel that regulation of teaching qualifications provides a very important assurance for the public, taxpayers and students that the lecturers in colleges are qualified to teach, and are concerned about equivalence with school teachers.
[normal]3.4. The 
[normal]AoC
[normal], the professional body for FE colleges, in their submission to the 
[normal]BIS
[normal] consultation said the following, putting their opposition to the revocation of this regulation alongside their support for the government policy of giving colleges ‘freedom and flexibility’:
[normal]“The 
[normal]AoC
[normal] has strongly supported the Government’s efforts to free further education and Sixth Form Colleges from bureaucratic burdens through the ‘freedoms and flexibility’ agenda. We agree that the current regulations on teaching qualifications are not fit for purpose and that they should be revoked. …However, on balance we think regulation is necessary in this instance.”
[normal]3.5. A  Research Paper 66: An Evaluation of FE Teachers Qualifications Regulations (England) 2007
[normal] published in March 2012, concluded that there was evidence that ‘good progress has been made towards ensuring a qualified and expert teaching profession with new entrants to the sector enrolled on or have achieved a 
[normal]recognised
[normal] teaching qualification’.  The Paper noted that the good progress of staff towards professional qualification at level 5 had been continued after the introduction of the Regulation.  
[normal]3.6. The Research Paper
[normal] also noted the impact of the Regulation on part time teachers in the Sector and that impact was greater on part time staff. It quoted a 2010 review of the Success for All targets which reported that the percentage of teaching staff qualified or enrolled has increased by 16.3 percentage points over seven years among part-time staff, as opposed to a 6.1 percentage point increase among full-time staff.  This is a crucial point in a Sector so dependent on part time teachers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7. The Paper stated that all providers were supportive of the wider agenda to 
[normal]professionalise
[normal] the FE workforce and many were extremely positive about the principle of having Regulations to ensure the workforce is appropriately qualified. They considered the Regulations to be an “appropriate and necessary” tool to improve teaching and learning, achieve greater parity with the school sector and improve perceptions of the professionalism of the sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It went on to point out that high-achieving’ general FE colleges (typically those that are OFSTED graded as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ in most or all areas, but which may not have obtained an outstanding teaching and learning grade) tended to use the Regulations as a management tool or lever to reinforce existing policy and practice. One medium-sized general FE 
[normal]college
[normal] noted that 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]the
[normal] Regulations have given a clear framework within which there is a clear expectation to be qualified and if this does not happen there will sanctions- it’s a very good management  tool”. Senior managers consider that staff qualification levels have “always been on the agenda” but the Regulations have led to a more formal approach within the college to monitoring.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8. The Research Paper concluded that there was emerging evidence that staff required to undertake qualifications as a result of the Regulations were likely to have increased aspirations to progress in their careers within the sector. This was linked to a clearer qualification and career pathway and that 
[normal]the  that
[normal] the Regulation was having a positive effect. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9. There is also a great of evidence from OFSTED reports and surveys on FE initial teaching training on its beneficial impact on teaching and learning in the Sector. From 2003
[normal] and the 1
[normal]st
[normal] critical survey of FE initial teacher training through to the 2011-12 survey, there are numerous references to this. 
[normal]3.10. The OFSTED 
[normal]2011–12 review of the FE Initial Teacher Training inspections of courses leading to awarding body qualifications in FE teaching, reported that trainees felt they had become better teachers as a result of the training they received on these courses. It also reported that the large majority of teachers who completed their course made good progress and improved their teaching as a result of the training they received, including improvements in planning and using a wider range of teaching methods; using their increased understanding of how learning takes place and the factors that promote and inhibit learning to match their teaching better to the group of learners; monitoring and assessing learning in order to provide better focused interventions and support, and/or modify the approaches used 
[normal]supporting learners with varying needs and learning preferences
[normal] 
[normal]4.1. UCU was and is opposed to the revocation of the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations (2007) Sections 136 (a), 136 (c), 145, and 210 (7) of the Education Act 2002. Our understanding is that the De-regulation Bill will repeal 136 (a) and (b) making the repeal of Section (c) redundant.  The UCU submission to the BIS Consultation on 
[normal]revoking the 2007 Workforce Regulations stated its opposition to the revocation of this particular Regulation:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“UCU considers that there is still an on-going need for FE lecturers to undertake initial teacher training 
[normal]programmes
[normal] even in what is likely to become a far less regulated area.”
[normal]“Teacher training is essential if FE is to respond positively to the very diverse student body that FE serves. The various OFSTED reports on FE initial teacher training have stated, and this has not been contested by the Sector that FE teachers and trainers need both generic knowledge and skills around delivering learning 
[normal]programmes
[normal], and appropriate subject knowledge and skills. Initial teacher training in FE and subsequent teaching and training needs a combination of practical training and relevant theory, as well as experience, so lecturers and trainers are able to deliver high quality teaching and learning.”
[normal]   
[normal]This remains our policy.
[normal]4.2 UCU was not opposed to the revocation of the other Regulations around the FE workforce. Although we had supported their introduction and worked with other stakeholders on their creation and implementation, UCU considered that they had their affect on FE college employers and on FE teachers. We felt that they were no longer necessary in the light of the Government’s clear policy of de-regulation of the FE and Skills sector.
[normal]4.3. UCU remains committed to both initial and continuing professional training and development. We have supported the development of both since before the introduction of the first regulation requiring FE staff to have a professional qualification in 2001. We took part in many discussions and consultations following OFSTED’s critical survey of FE initial teacher training in 2003, and in the various developments in the sector on initial teacher training and continuous professional development following similar surveys in 2008 and 2010.
[normal]4.4. The 
[normal]Lingfield
[normal] Review criticized the then current FE teaching qualifications, the Award in preparing to teach in the lifelong learning sector (PTLLS), the certificate in teaching in the lifelong learning sector (CTLLS), the Diploma for teaching in the lifelong learning sector (DTLSS) and the specialist diploma for teaching literacy, numeracy and ESOL. 
[normal]Lingfield
[normal] called for a thorough going review of these qualifications to simplify and make them more coherent. The Learning and Skills Improvement Agency were tasked with this review and establishing new simpler qualifications. This they have done and UCU took a prominent part in the consultations on the new qualifications and sat on the LSIS project’s advisory board. We consider the new qualifications to be an improvement on the past qualifications and 
[normal]gives
[normal] a coherent base for FE teacher education and development.
[normal]4.5. The Regulation requiring the holding 
[normal]of a teaching qualifications
[normal] provides a very important assurance for the public, taxpayers and students that the lecturers in colleges are qualified to teach. To dismantle this whilst school teaching is a graduate profession does not make sense. There has to be assurance for parents in particular that FE lecturers meet the same standards as school teachers. 
[normal]4.6. There is a danger that the reputation of Colleges in the eyes of the public could diminish following any revocation of regulations.
[normal]4.7. The concept of a qualified workforce imposed by regulation is easy for the public and other stakeholders to understand whereas we fear a real reputational risk, both to individual Colleges and the College sector as a whole, if regulations are revoked without anything substantial and clear being put in their place.
[normal]4.8. FE teacher training is essential if FE is to respond positively to the very diverse student body that FE serves. The various OFSTED reports on FE initial teacher training have stated, and this has not been contested by the Sector that FE teachers and trainers need both generic knowledge and skills around delivering learning 
[normal]programmes
[normal], and appropriate subject knowledge and skills. Initial teacher training in FE and subsequent teaching and training needs a combination of practical training and relevant theory, as well as experience, so lecturers and trainers are able to deliver high quality teaching and learning.   
[normal]4.9. The consequences of revoking this Regulation would be:
[normal]There would be a huge educational and personal risk in placing unqualified teachers in classes of very challenging learners. The potential for staff turnover and learner underachievement cannot be overstated.
[normal]4.10. Since the 
[normal]Lingfield
[normal] Reports and the BIS Consultation on the Revocation of the 2007 Workforce Regulations, the voluntary approach to FE professionalism as been further 
[normal]developed with the creation of the employer-led Education and Training Foundation to lead developments around FE professionalism and qualifications. UCU has supported this development and it may be that the Foundation may well lead the sector in relation to professional qualifications.  However the removal of this Regulation just as the Education and Training Foundation is establishing itself may damage the Foundation’s work to ensure a fully 
[normal]professionalised
[normal] FE teaching workforce.
[normal]4.11. However with extreme financial stringency in the Sector set to continue until at least 2015, and probably beyond that date, there is a real danger that without a Regulation enforcing a requirement for Sector staff to hold an appropriate teaching qualification, many providers will not support their teachers gaining a FE teaching qualification and recent improvements to teaching and learning may be lost.
[normal]5.1. UCU considers there is a particularly strong case for the retention of this Regulation in relation to vocational education and training (VET). VET and FE Colleges’ role in it are particularly important in terms of developing the skills that employers will need for economic recovery. There is a renewed and very welcome focus by Government and the Sector on VET. 
[normal]5.2. The recent Report of the Commission on Vocational Teaching and Learning stated that:
[normal]“Education and training for VET professionals: the evidence we have received makes a strong case for well-trained and well qualified teachers and trainers….Vocational teaching, learning and assessment is a sophisticated professional occupation and demands, therefore, robust initial and continuous development of expertise. It has always been sophisticated, but in the contemporary world, with greater complexity in the workplace, increasing use of technology for teaching and learning, and the need for teachers and trainers to be externally facing to keep their occupational expertise up-to-date, we need a broader concept of what a vocational teaching and learning professional is, whether they work in industry, a college, or with a training provider.
[normal]5.3. A survey that UCU undertook for this Commission found that UCU members who are vocational teachers valued their initial teaching 
[normal]programme
[normal] and qualification. It was vital because nearly 72% of the respondents undertook their teaching qualification as an in-service course. This means they had been working in their industry before they became lecturers. Their initial teach training 
[normal]programme
[normal] was essential for giving them the teaching and pedagogic skills to set alongside their industry skills and knowledge. 25% regarded their initial teacher training was very effective in helping them teach their vocational subject and another 39% felt the 
[normal]programme
[normal] was somewhat effective. 
[normal]5.4. If FE colleges continue to attract highly skilled and knowledgeable people from industry into teaching, there is a great need for such new teachers to undertake a FE teaching qualification to give them the knowledge and skills to teach their subject which would sit alongside their industry skills and professionalism. A requirement for this enforced by Regulation would ensure that this happened.
[normal]6.1. UCU notes the proposals in the Draft Deregulation Bill for removing Secretary of State’s power to direct the content of articles of association of designated institutions that are conducted by companies. In line with our general policy, we are concerned that the general move to de-regulate the provider base in Further Education is leaving the sector exposed to poor governance and the 
[normal]mis
[normal]-use of public funds and removes instruments by which governing bodies may be held to account without putting in place other safeguards either of the public interest or those of students.
[normal]6.2 This is no less the case for providers who are companies than it is for incorporated colleges. Indeed as UCU’s own research has shown, the need to embed greater levels of transparency and accountability, as well as building in mechanisms for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers and students is arguably greater for companies which may take a variety of different corporate forms. 
[normal]6.3. Similarly, we understand the desire to remove sections 23 to 26 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to remove ‘obsolete’ provisions covering the transfer of assets to designated institutions dating back to initial incorporation. However, we are concerned that this leaves the position of designated institutions who change their corporate form or who dissolve themselves and 
[normal]redesignate
[normal] themselves, unclear. While the positions of 
[normal]corporations
[normal] that dissolves themselves (through section 27 of the FHEA 1992 as amended in 2011) is clearly set out, it is unclear that designated institutions that may be conducted as 
[normal]companies
[normal] have to observe any such process. 
[normal]6.4. UCU believes that this threatens to institutionalise a two-tier system in which providers which are companies are less regulated and less transparent than those which continue to be corporations, while potentially being just as dependent on recurrent and accumulated public funds. We believe that this constitutes a threat to the public interest and the interests of students. We seek urgent clarification as to the process that will be used in the case of changes to the status of designated institutions that are conducted as companies
