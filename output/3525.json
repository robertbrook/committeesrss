"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Department of Health (AMO0002)Introduction1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis evidence has been prepared for the Health Select Committee by the Department of Health in response to the Committee's invitation to provide written evidence to assist it in its 2013 accountability meeting with Monitor.  The Department is grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this process.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis memorandum outlines the considerable work Monitor has done since the last accountability hearing in 2012.  It also updates the Committee on the progress of some of the main issues since the Government’s response to the report from that hearing. \n&#xa0;\nBackground3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitor is the sector regulator for health services in England. Its job is to protect and promote the interests of patients by ensuring that the whole sector works for their benefit.  Monitor exercises a range of powers granted by Parliament which include setting and enforcing a framework of rules for providers and commissioners - implemented in part through licences it issues to NHS-funded providers.  \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitor was originally established in 2004 but the regulatory landscape has changed significantly in the last twelve months and t\nhe Health and Social Care Act 2012\n expanded the regulator’s role considerably.  From \n1\nst\n April 2013 it has been Monitor’s overarching responsibility to protect and promote the interests of patients by ensuring that the whole sector works for their benefit.  \nIn fulfilling its role Monitor is responsible for ensuring that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe past twelve months have been transitional for Monitor, both in terms of the changes to its role and in respect of the significance of the work that the regulator has been engaged with.  However, since the last accountability hearing, Monitor has adapted to its new role effectively.  \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn February 2013, Robert Francis QC published the \nReport on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust (MSFT) Inquiry, which has wide ranging implications for the provision and regulation of the NHS in England.  The Report made a number of specific recommendations in relation to Monitor and its role with the health system.  Monitor is continuing to make progress in taking forward these recommendations, engaging well \nwith the Department of Health and other stakeholders.  The Government’s response to the Francis report will be published in November, which will set out the actions that Monitor has taken. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the changes to its functions, Monitor has been working to recruit new staff and diversify its skills base.  Monitor’s staff base has increased from around 160 in March 2012 to nearly 300 by March 2013. It is predicted to increase further to around 420 by March 2014. This period of transition has been overseen by David Bennett who has been acting Chair alongside his permanent role as Chief Executive. \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the Health Select Committee’s vote not to endorse the appointment of Dominic Dodd as the permanent Chair of Monitor, the Department is considering the next steps for filling the role of Chair. We will be making an announcement on next steps shortly. We will also be taking steps to recruit at least one new Non-Executive Director in due course. \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitor has also been developing its relationships with other health and social care system partners, in particular NHS England, the NHS Trust Development Authority (NTDA) and the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The deepening of these relationships has been crucial to the overall effectiveness of the system. \n&#xa0;\n10.\n \nMonitor is about to launch a consultation on its draft strategy for the period 2014-2021. This will set out their medium term strategy for the organisation. The specific deliverables that it will be working towards each year will be set out in its annual business plan.\n&#xa0;\n11.\n \nOver the past year, Monitor has continued to work closely with the NTDA to assess NHS Trusts that are working towards Foundation Trust (FT) status. In assessing aspirant NHS Trusts, NTDA and Monitor now expect Trusts to achieve ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ rating from the Chief Inspector of Hospitals to allow their FT application to proceed.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n \nThe current CQC rating regime has not yet defined the standards trusts need to achieve to obtain a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ rating. The CQC is in the early stages of deploying its new inspection and rating regime for acute hospitals but it will take several months for the Chief Inspector of  Hospitals to have inspected a sufficient number of acute trusts to firm up the standards that need to be met for a trust to be considered ‘good’ or ‘excellent’. \n&#xa0;\n13.\n \nIn addition, a number of NHS Trusts are currently experiencing significant in-year pressures and, as such, making a standalone FT application may not be a credible option for them. The NTDA is working closely with these Trusts on the best options for them; this has had a knock-on effect for Monitor in its role of authorising trusts to FT status.\n&#xa0;14.\n \n However, taken together, this means that the Department now considers that the majority of aspirant Trusts will now not become FTs in 2014. The key challenge now is that we ensure that aspirant trusts achieve the transition to FT at the right time for them. Monitor and the NTDA will continue to work closely with the Department and the CQC to achieve this. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;15.\n \nIn April 2013, \nMonitor published guidance for Boards on how to ensure their organisation is working effectively to improve patient care; this is to support Monitor’s Quality Governance Framework. \nAssessing themselves against the Framework allows NHS Trusts to satisfy themselves, patients and Monitor that effective arrangements are in place to continuously monitor and improve the quality of healthcare provided and that areas highlighted through the process as requiring further work are effectively addressed.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n \nUnder the Health and Social Care Act 2012, changes to the regulation of NHS service providers introduced a Monitor licence for providers of NHS services. Monitor has licenced Foundation Trusts since April 2013 and will begin to licence other providers from April 2014, accepting licence applications from January 2014.  Monitor is currently taking enforcement action in relation to twenty one FTs under the new licence for providers, to ensure that they deal with the continuing issues they face.  Since July 2013, Monitor has placed seven FTs into special measures and put in place appropriate turnaround support. This represents progress since the last accountability hearing with Monitor, where the Committee was keen to see evidence of progress on special measures.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n \nMonitor has also been given powers to remove, suspend or replace NHS FTs’ Directors or Governors.  \nIn relation to three of the FTs in special measures, Monitor has put in place additional licence conditions relating to governance, using the new powers. \n&#xa0;\n18.\n \nMonitor has also taken steps to strengthen the role of FT Governors, issuing new guidance, setting up a panel for advising Governors and working with the NHS Leadership Academy and the Foundation Trust Network to provide a new national training programme.  \n&#xa0;\n19.\n \nIn the transition period from 1\nst\n April 2013, these steps have ensured that Monitor has remained proactive in regulating and improving leadership in the sector.   \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n20.\n \nUnder the Health and Social Care Act 2012, Monitor and NHS England must publish a statutory consultation on the National Tariff Payment System and ensure that the following groups are informed of this and invited to take part in the consultation:\n&#xa0;\n21.\n \nThe consultation period for the National Tariff document closed on 31\nst\n October 2013 and both Monitor and NHS England are considering the responses. The final Tariff is expected to be published in December 2013, subject to Monitor not receiving a significant proportion of objections from Clinical Commissioning Groups and other relevant providers. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;22.\n \nMonitor is responsible for enforcing rules on procurement, patient choice and the prohibition of anti-competitive behaviour that works against the interests of patients.\n&#xa0;\n The rules aim to benefit patients and maintain the sector specific approach to managing competition within the NHS.\n&#xa0;\n Monitor has established a Cooperation and Competition Directorate to undertake its work in this area.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n23.\n \nAs of October 2013, Monitor has accepted \nthree\n complaints of potential breaches of the rules for investigation.\n&#xa0;\n To date, Monitor has not used its powers to address anticompetitive behaviour under the Competition Act 1998 or to investigate markets under the Enterprise Act 2002.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n \nOn mergers, Monitor has provided advice to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) on the benefits of the mergers involving FTs that the OFT has investigated, and has issued a joint statement with the OFT and the Competition Commission, expressing its commitment to ensuring that patients are at the heart of the merger review process.  \nThe joint statement also set out a more active role for Monitor.  Where hospitals are in clinical or financial difficulty Monitor and the NTDA (where this involves an NHS Trust) will be closely involved with the hospitals concerned in the process of developing a strategy for safeguarding patient services. Monitor’s and the NTDA’s involvement should ensure that any merger proposal considers the implications for quality of services and patient safety from the outset.\n&#xa0;\n25.\n \nMonitor will also offer informal advice to Trusts on how they might assess the prospective patient benefits of any merger and also on the possible competition implications of the proposal. Monitor will also be active in scrutinising and challenging the strategies of FTs, including emerging merger proposals at an earlier stage. This will assist parties to identify at an early stage whether a merger will have a positive effect for patients.  \n&#xa0;\n26.\n \nThe steps set out in the joint statement should help to reduce the number of mergers requiring notification and minimise the risk of lengthy merger reviews.\n&#xa0;\n27.\n \nMore broadly, in March 2013, Monitor published its report: Fair Playing Field Review: a fair playing field for the benefit of NHS patients.\n&#xa0;\n At the request of the Secretary of State for Health, Monitor investigated matters that may affect the ability of different providers of NHS services to participate fully in improving patient care.\n&#xa0;\n At the request of the Secretary of State, Monitor has subsequently established a high-level group to provide oversight of, and review progress against, the recommendations.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n28.\n \nFurther to the recommendations of the review, Monitor has published a ‘call for evidence’ in relation to GP services in England, the purpose of which is to examine whether there are barriers preventing patients accessing the best possible care.\n&#xa0;\n A report is expected by the end of 2013.\n&#xa0;\n29.\n \nMonitor is working jointly with NHS England to establish and publish an online resource - the 'choice and competition framework' - to help commissioners and providers understand and use choice and competition in the health system. This will include guidance on procurement practice and requirements.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n30.\n \nSince April 2013, Monitor has had new powers to ensure the continuity of services for patients if a provider's financial viability puts them at risk.\n&#xa0;\n31.\n \nIn the past year, Monitor has appointed Contingency Planning Teams (CPTs) to MSFT and Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in response to on-going financial deficits at the Trusts. In each case, the Contingency Planning Team (CPT) was asked to make an assessment as to the operational, financial and clinical sustainability of the Trust and, if necessary, to develop a plan for achieving sustainability.\n&#xa0;\n32.\n \nIn the case of MSFT, the CPT’s conclusion that the Trust is neither financially nor clinically sustainable in its current form led Monitor to appoint Trusts Special Administrators (TSA) to the Trust in March 2013, thereby triggering the first use of the Special Administration regime for FTs. Monitor has been overseeing the TSAs since their appointment and, in response to the need for additional time at various stages in the process, has used its powers to make extensions to the timetable. \n&#xa0;\n33.\n \nIn the case of Peterborough, the CPT concluded that the Trust was clinically and operationally sustainable, but not financially sustainable in its current form.  The CPT worked with key stakeholders to make recommendations for tackling the financial deficit and securing the long-term sustainability of the Trust.  The CPT came to the decision that it was not necessary to appoint a TSA to take forward the recommendations, but that implementation should be led by the Trust, backed by the necessary enforcement action from Monitor. \n&#xa0;\n34.\n \nEnsuring continuity of services has been a high priority for Monitor and the Department over the last twelve months and Monitor is continuing to make good progress in this area compared to the last accountability hearing, where the Committee highlighted that it wanted to see evidence of greater progress being made on ensuring the continuity of services and establishing arrangements for Trust Special Administration.  \n&#xa0;\n35.\n \nThe Department looks forward to continuing to work closely with Monitor on this agenda over the next twelve months.\n&#xa0;\n36.\n \nOver the last year, Monitor has undergone significant change to its role following the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Monitor has adapted well to this change, making good progress in authorising new FTs, ensuring the continuity of services in under-performing FTs, and by ensuring that its organisational capacity is stronger. The Department believes that Monitor is well placed to go from strength to strength as an effective regulator in the health and social care system.  \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
