defaultWritten evidence from Margaret Thomas (TWR0010)
defaultDear Sir
default/Madam
default,
defaultGatwick Airport – Dec 24
defaultth
default 2013.
default1.
defaultAlthough we appreciate these were clearly exceptional circumstances
default,
default it is abundantly clear that NO provision or fore-thought had ever been given to an event of this magnitude, no man
defaultual override for computer and power failure had ever been perceived, no alternative announcement facilities had been put aside to cover such an event and personnel were not aware or trained to deal with such an event and had no idea what to do next.
default2.
defaultAt t
defaulthe time of writing this letter you find me and my family 
defaultat homedefault at 19:00default on Christmas Eve, but unfortunately for my children, 
defaultWITHOUTdefault, the provision for making their Christmas a memorable and special occasion
default,
default as we had planned and hoped for.
default3.
defaultWe started
default our day at 03:00am
default.  Santa’s special presents duly packed and ready for the next day for Matthew 7 and Owen 8. 
default 
defaultW
defaulte 
defaultarrived at 
defaultthe airport 
defaultat 04:45 in plenty of 
defaulttime for our scheduled 09:00 take off flight to Sham

default on EZY8851
default.
default  E
defaultven with the 
defaultdelay
default for the 
defaultroad traffic accident on the M25
default/M23
default just outside the airport
default and the extreme weather conditions
default,
default 
defaultWE
default had managed to plan ahead and anticipate all
default the 
defaultlikely problems
default.  The car 
defaultparking 
defaultvalet company were as good as their word and
default met us on time 
defaultto 
defaultcollect our car and take
default it
default to a place of safety for the 
defaultfull 
defaultduration of our holiday.
default  ALL PLANNED AND PERFECTLEY EX

defaultAt 05:
default30 we joined the 
defaulthordes
default in the 
defaultNorthdefault terminal,
default w
defaulte
default are advised through
default a 
defaultgarbled message delivered by a” foreign tongued” person wearing what we presume to be a uniform and therefore representing the 
defaultairport 
defaultcompany a message, saying that the” power is down” but they will have it fixed shortly.
default 
defaultWe wait.
default5.At 08:00 we are advised that the 
defaultNorthdefault terminal is 
defaultinoperable and
default we are advised to 
defaultproceed to the 
defaultSouthdefault terminal, by internal train, where the whole operation will be managed and we will be “on our way soon.”
defaultWe wait
default6.At 12:44 we are asked to check in 
defaultour luggage at a make-shift Virgin Atlantic check in desk, run by Easy Jet.  Once checked in we ask our Easy Jet representative “What next
default?
default” he replied
default. 
default “Your 
defaultg
defaultuess is as good as mine, “Listen out for announcements
default”.
default 
defaultWe wait.
default7.At 13:50 we make our way t
defaulto departures lounge in the 
defaultSouthdefault terminal.  Nobody in the 
defaultSouthdefault terminal has any idea on the 
defaultNorthdefault terminal Easy Jet flight situation.  By chance, we are informed by 
defaulta fellow passenger  “all Easy Jet 
defaultNorthdefault terminal passengers should head for gate 95” -  to make their way back to the original starting point - 
defaultNorth terminaldefault……………..
defaultwhere we started
default at 05:30am!!!!!
defaultWe embark on to the coach, duly allocated
default and 
defaultas instructed by the uniformed airport perso
defaultn
defaultne
defaultl at
default gate 95
default. 
default8.We disembark the coach and are directed though the 
defaultterminal buildings to the North terminal departure lounge
default.
defaultWe wait.

defaultAt 
default14:55 we happen to be in the 
defaultvi
defaultcinity
default of a loud speaking 
defaultEasy Jet 
defaultrep.
default -
default she announces that our flight is now CANCELLED
default and that we should make our way to the Sea food counter 
defaultto
default await further instructions from a
default “
defaultGatwick 
defaultServis A
defaultir
default”
default representative.  At this point we are told to exit the building through a STAFF ONLY EXIT
default, this we do
default.  We join another extensive queue for w
defaulthat we discover
default is 
defaultan

defaultincomingdefault 
defaultPassport Control 
defaultarea.
default  After 45 minutes in this queue we are directed to a baggage reclaim area.
default  An “Evacuation Marshall” is waiting at the baggage carousel.  
defaultWhen asked what procedure we should follow to retrieve our lugga
defaultge she responds with” I have NO IDEA! 
default-t
defaulthere is no plan or procedure in place to resolve this type
default 
defaultof situation and there are no representatives of Easy Jet available to help with retrieving our LOST luggage
default”
default.
default  With nobody available to turn to we, exhauste
defaultd, 
defaultresolve to exit the building retrieve our 
defaultcar and go home…………….without our luggage.  It is obviously “lost in the system”
