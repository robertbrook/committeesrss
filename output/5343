[normal]Written evidence from Margaret Thomas (TWR0010)
[normal]Dear Sir
[normal]/Madam
[normal],
[normal]Gatwick Airport – Dec 24
[normal]th
[normal] 2013.
[normal]1.
[normal]Although we appreciate these were clearly exceptional circumstances
[normal],
[normal] it is abundantly clear that NO provision or fore-thought had ever been given to an event of this magnitude, no man
[normal]ual override for computer and power failure had ever been perceived, no alternative announcement facilities had been put aside to cover such an event and personnel were not aware or trained to deal with such an event and had no idea what to do next.
[normal]2.
[normal]At t
[normal]he time of writing this letter you find me and my family 
[normal]at home[bold] at 19:00[bold] on Christmas Eve, but unfortunately for my children, 
[normal]WITHOUT[bold], the provision for making their Christmas a memorable and special occasion
[normal],
[normal] as we had planned and hoped for.
[normal]3.
[normal]We started
[normal] our day at 03:00am
[normal].  Santa’s special presents duly packed and ready for the next day for Matthew 7 and Owen 8. 
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]arrived at 
[normal]the airport 
[normal]at 04:45 in plenty of 
[normal]time for our scheduled 09:00 take off flight to Sham 
[normal]E
[normal]l 
[normal]Sheikh
[normal] on EZY8851
[normal].
[normal]  E
[normal]ven with the 
[normal]delay
[normal] for the 
[normal]road traffic accident on the M25
[normal]/M23
[normal] just outside the airport
[normal] and the extreme weather conditions
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]WE
[normal] had managed to plan ahead and anticipate all
[normal] the 
[normal]likely problems
[normal].  The car 
[normal]parking 
[normal]valet company were as good as their word and
[normal] met us on time 
[normal]to 
[normal]collect our car and take
[normal] it
[normal] to a place of safety for the 
[normal]full 
[normal]duration of our holiday.
[normal]  ALL PLANNED AND PERFECTLEY EX
[normal]E
[normal]CUTED SO FAR……………YES!!!!!
[normal]?
[normal]  
[normal]THEN…………………
[normal]In steps
[normal] Gatwick Airport and
[normal] Easy Jet. 
[normal]4.
[normal]At 05:
[normal]30 we joined the 
[normal]hordes
[normal] in the 
[normal]North[bold] terminal,
[normal] w
[normal]e
[normal] are advised through
[normal] a 
[normal]garbled message delivered by a” foreign tongued” person wearing what we presume to be a uniform and therefore representing the 
[normal]airport 
[normal]company a message, saying that the” power is down” but they will have it fixed shortly.
[normal] 
[normal]We wait.
[normal]5.At 08:00 we are advised that the 
[normal]North[bold] terminal is 
[normal]inoperable and
[normal] we are advised to 
[normal]proceed to the 
[normal]South[bold] terminal, by internal train, where the whole operation will be managed and we will be “on our way soon.”
[normal]We wait
[normal]6.At 12:44 we are asked to check in 
[normal]our luggage at a make-shift Virgin Atlantic check in desk, run by Easy Jet.  Once checked in we ask our Easy Jet representative “What next
[normal]?
[normal]” he replied
[normal]. 
[normal] “Your 
[normal]g
[normal]uess is as good as mine, “Listen out for announcements
[normal]”.
[normal] 
[normal]We wait.
[normal]7.At 13:50 we make our way t
[normal]o departures lounge in the 
[normal]South[bold] terminal.  Nobody in the 
[normal]South[bold] terminal has any idea on the 
[normal]North[bold] terminal Easy Jet flight situation.  By chance, we are informed by 
[normal]a fellow passenger  “all Easy Jet 
[normal]North[bold] terminal passengers should head for gate 95” -  to make their way back to the original starting point - 
[normal]North terminal[bold]……………..
[normal]where we started
[normal] at 05:30am!!!!!
[normal]We embark on to the coach, duly allocated
[normal] and 
[normal]as instructed by the uniformed airport perso
[normal]n
[normal]ne
[normal]l at
[normal] gate 95
[normal]. 
[normal]8.We disembark the coach and are directed though the 
[normal]terminal buildings to the North terminal departure lounge
[normal].
[normal]We wait.
[normal]9.
[normal]At 
[normal]14:55 we happen to be in the 
[normal]vi
[normal]cinity
[normal] of a loud speaking 
[normal]Easy Jet 
[normal]rep.
[normal] -
[normal] she announces that our flight is now CANCELLED
[normal] and that we should make our way to the Sea food counter 
[normal]to
[normal] await further instructions from a
[normal] “
[normal]Gatwick 
[normal]Servis A
[normal]ir
[normal]”
[normal] representative.  At this point we are told to exit the building through a STAFF ONLY EXIT
[normal], this we do
[normal].  We join another extensive queue for w
[normal]hat we discover
[normal] is 
[normal]an
[normal] 
[normal]incoming[bold] 
[normal]Passport Control 
[normal]area.
[normal]  After 45 minutes in this queue we are directed to a baggage reclaim area.
[normal]  An “Evacuation Marshall” is waiting at the baggage carousel.  
[normal]When asked what procedure we should follow to retrieve our lugga
[normal]ge she responds with” I have NO IDEA! 
[normal]-t
[normal]here is no plan or procedure in place to resolve this type
[normal] 
[normal]of situation and there are no representatives of Easy Jet available to help with retrieving our LOST luggage
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]  With nobody available to turn to we, exhauste
[normal]d, 
[normal]resolve to exit the building retrieve our 
[normal]car and go home…………….without our luggage.  It is obviously “lost in the system”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.Starting on the laptop in the car before returning home
[normal] 
[normal]we
[normal] Check Online
[normal]:-
[normal]11. 
[normal]You are our holiday/dream makers.
[normal]What do we do 
[normal]now?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. We await, with much anticipation, your response.
