[[[e International Energy Agency (IEA) (CCS43)]]]&#xa0;The IEA is an intergovernmental organisation which acts as energy policy advisor to 28 member countries in their effort to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for their citizens. It is committed to promoting the “Three E’s” of balanced energy policy making: energy security, economic development and environmental protection. The United Kingdom has been a member country of the IEA since it was formed in 1974.&#xa0;In its Technology Roadmap for Carbon Capture and Storage, 2013 update, the IEA reported that the next seven years are critical to the accelerated development of CCS. The basis for this assessment was a review of the status of CCS globally, which found that:The seven key actions below require serious dedication by governments and industry, but are realistic and cover all three elements of the CCS process.
