"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Ramblers\nOur perspective on rural transport\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs chair of the \n‘\nGet Your Boots On\n’\n Ramblers group and a keen proponent of public transport, I am dismayed\n t\no find that we are being faced with seriously damaging cuts to bus services in our area next year. We run a series of linear walks, and always try to fit these around public transport options.\n \nThis year, we have been walking the Abbey Trail, from Kirkstall (Leeds) to Whitby over a series of 10 stages, and for 7 of those we have been able to get from one end of the walk to the other by public transport\n—\nthis simplifies the logistics significantly and means that even if people are driving to the walk, they can car-share efficiently\n \n     \nBut North Yorkshire County Council have stated that next year, funding for the Moorsbus network will be stopped completely. This Moorsbus has provided leisure services across the North York Moors for over 30 years. In recent years, the network has been salami-sliced, bit by bit. In 2004, all routes ran on Sundays and bank holidays from Easter to October and some weekdays during t\nhe school summer holidays; the ‘\ncore\n’\n routes ran daily May\n–November\n. That has gradually whittled away; it now only runs on Sundays, no weekday or Saturday service at all. And for most of these areas, the Moorsbus is the only bus service.\n     For the local communities, these buses are essential. Throughout the summer, they bring hundreds of visitors to the region, many of whom are walkers. The loss of these buses will be hugely damaging to tourism in this wonderful part of the country, and will reduce the potential for walkers to enjoy environmentally friendly transport to and from their walks.\n     The Moorsbus, and the Dalesbus\n—\nits counterpart in the Yorkshire Dales\n—\nare great examples of how to make leisure transport in rural areas work very well. The networks are designed around key hubs where different routes connect with each other. Because connections are guaranteed, and timings are well worked out, a much more comprehensive network can be designed efficiently and passengers are happy to change buses, so direct services between each point are not needed. Multi-operator all-day tickets make them affordable and easy to use. \n      It is disappointing that the networks often only run on summer Sundays, limiting the potential for walking and tourism at other times of the year. Where there are services through the week, they typically don\n’\nt run as a coordinated network\n—\nthere aren\n’\nt well planned connections between routes, there aren\n’\nt multi-operator tickets, and information about the buses is typically hit-and-miss. Buses during the week are generally timed around getting residents from villages into the nearest towns, rather than getting people out to the villages, and this often makes them unsuitable for walkers.\n     But perhaps the biggest problem, as I mentioned further up, is that free travel is making these networks unaffordable. Even where, as Dalesbus has managed, outside subsidy has been secured to cover the operational costs, the cost to councils of English National Concessionary Travel Schemes usage is crippling local authority budgets. This is the elephant in the room that needs to be \naddressed if rural leisure buses are to have a sustainable future. [Ramblers member, East Yorkshire\n.\n]\n[In July 2013] I returned from a week\n’\ns holiday in Northumberland. To do so, I had to catch the \nonly\n bus of the day from Knowesgate at 09.55 via Ponteland to Newcastle (service 131 from Jedburgh along the A68). The bus was 20 minutes late at Knowesgate, and not in the best of condition (the contract had been given to a new operator recently). One elderly passenger getting off at Ponteland to do her shopping was very concerned she might not be able to get home again if the return service later in the day did not run. I don\n’\nt know if she did get home, but the incident brought home to me that these infrequent rural services \nneed to\n be operated by reliable vehicles and on time. [Ramblers member, Surrey\n.\n]\nI live in Kirk Ireton [Derbyshire], a hill village at the southern end of the Pennines. The population is 500. There is a village shop (restricted hours), a primary school, \ntwo \nchurches, a village hall and one pub. Few are employed in the village; workers commute to Derby (13 miles), Matlock (8 miles), Belper (8 miles), or Ashbourne (7 miles). The 1:5 gradient of the village\n’\ns approach road makes it unsuitable for commuting by \nbi\ncycle.\n \n But of buses suitable to allow employment outside village there is only one a day to both Ashbourne and Matlock.  The return times make commuting difficult. There are no direct links to other towns. There are no weekend buses, though this is prime walking country. Elderly, those unable to drive (medical, sight, age reasons) and teenagers (for social or employment reasons) are severely restricted by lack of bus transport and its scheduling.  [Ramblers member, Derbyshire\n.\n]\nPublic transport managers are focused on education trips, trips to work and perhaps trips into a local centre where facilities exist\n—\nall else falls way down the agenda. Yet, the shopping and leisure market is the only growth market there is; buses feeding into town centres from rural areas help with the local economy. There is little joined up thinking \nre\n using tourism in rural areas as a mechanism to support buses for local residents.... The main deterrent we find for young people is th\ne level of fares on many routes—\nthey are just perceived as being too expensive.    [Ramblers member, Shropshire\n.\n]\nBlackborough [Devon] is a small village with about 100 adults and lots of children.  The 2 oldest adults are over 90\n \nyears old and the children are from toddlers upwards. All of us adults drive, with the one\n exception of one of the 90-\nyear\n-\nolds.  We have to\n.\n  We lost our last bus about three years ago, and were offered a car service wh\nich we had to ring for and would cost \nus £3.50 per journey, \neach\n, and the same again for the return journey.  We could not say the time we wanted to travel. The bus used to travel in a figure of eight way picking up people from several villages on a Wed\nnesday, market-\nday. Now Cullompton is nearly empty. The nearest bus can be picked up in Kentisbeare, about two miles away, down a small, twisty lane, which is downhill.  I certainly would not like to walk back up it with my weekend\n’\ns shopping!   It would take me 2–3\n \nhours to get to Ramblers meetings if I had to rely on public transport. I go to Cullompton (5 miles) twice a week for shopping and socialising and picking up medicines. I also have to go to Honiton (7 miles) for things we haven\n’\nt got in Cullompton. Older people in villages really do need public transport to get them to shops and medical practitioners.  Also it\n’\ns good to get out for social and other reasons, including walking. \nLocal buses to link in with the longer routes are important\n. [Ramblers member, Devon\n.\n]\nBenefits brought to the nation by encouraging rural walking\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe need for improved and increased rural transport on which users can confidently rely\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBetter promotion and information necessary \nMy partner and I, both environmentally-aware\n users of public transport\n, \nintending to walk in the Peak District, \narriv\ned by train \nin Derby\n having\n looked up the local buses on the internet. A bus was billed to leave Derby (where the station is, 15 miles from the Peak) from a certain road, to connect in Ashbourne with a privately operated bus to Hartington YHA, our first night destination; but the most up-to-date timetable gave the wrong departure point in Derby. \nThough we\n had got there extra-early to be sure of this crucial bus, \nwe\n missed it because it went from the wrong place. Reaching the ‘right’ stop we were told that it left empt\ny. \n     We find buses in Snowdonia better than many places, though once (\nthe h\notelier at Pen-y-Gwryd having observe\nd that ‘you need a Ph D to understand the timetable’) \na \nbus came to where we were intuitively waiting for it, drove round the turning circle, drove back the way it came despite our hailing it, pulled in to \nthe unsigned \n‘real’ stop 25 yards away, and drove off before we got to it. It is scandalous if operators are being subsidised to drive buses around that are empty through wrong or unclear information being fed to those intending to use them. \nW\nhat chance of converting the car-drivers, when committed bus users cannot be told right where to catch them?\n \n[Ramblers member, London\n.\n]  \n&#xa0;\nAt Ruthin, Corwen and L\nlangollen there is parking, \ncaf\né\ns a\nnd pubs. In summer there is the steam railway from Llangollen to Carrog, which is promoted, but the bus route along the Dee Valley is not.\n \nI suggested promoting these bus routes for tourists, but received no reply. [Ramblers member, North Wales.]\nWhen \n‘\nsocial communities\n’\n are formed as part of a walking programme demand for buses and trains can be solid and sustained-Rail Rambles is a classic example, another is Dales Bus and another MADS in Manchester. [Ramblers member, Shropshire.]\nClosing\n&#xa0;\nAs we said above, this has been no empirical study. But all the experience is that provision for public transport is in most places grossly inadequate; that it would benefit country-dwellers and town-dwellers alike if there were reliable public transport; and that frequency, imaginativeness, reliability and readily-accessible up-to-date and accurate information about services are the key to persuading people to use public transport in favour of cars. It would also complement the experience of rural walking by getting cars off the roads and by providing recreational walkers with a ‘real’ destination as opposed to the place they began, i.e, where they left their car. And it would encourage more people to walk and reap its health-benefits, including some members of the 25% \nof carless households, thus reducing the nation’s health-bill and boosting the rural economy.  \nThe case for frequent, reliable, imaginative and accessible and affordable rural passenger transport is clear.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;—Endnotes—&#xa0;\n \nLetters, \nThe Times\n&#xa0;\n2 October 1970\n—\n \n‘\nSir, I wonder how many people are aware of the isolation threatening an increasing number of rural communities, due to the ending of public transport services because they are said to be uneconomic. I take, as an example, the village of Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, in Somerset, where I live.... This area has been deprived of an excellent rail service. On November 28 1970, this village and many others will be deprived of their daily bus service by the decision of the Western National Omnibus Company to end it. No alternative is offered. It may be true that the service is not a profit-making one, but \nis there not a social obligation to provide some public transport for people who are not car owners or drivers and to whom such a service is essential\n?\n’\n Miss \nMarjorie Salmon\n, Pilton, Somerset\n [Emphasis added]\n&#xa0;\nand\n, \n18 December 1973\n—\n‘\nSir, ... We used to have a railway, and a modest bus service feeding it from the villages around, But Beeching pointed out the undeniable fact our railway was uneconomical, so it was closed. Three years later the bus company announced that, without a railway to feed, their services had also become uneconomic, so they stopped running them.... The fact is that since the Beeching closures the whole economy of rural transport has changed and the car has perforce become an integral part of rural life.... Our nearest railway station is [now] 24 miles away; to visit a relative in the nearest large hospital entails a round trip of 84 miles (or 48 miles plus the rail trip if one can spare a whole day away from work for it\n)\n.\n’\n \nNorman Hicks\n, Boscastle, Cornwall\n&#xa0;\nand\n, \n24 March 1987\n—\n‘\nSir, ...Today we can observe two nations in one village. Affluent incomers are juxtaposed with deprived locals who have suffered severely from the ever-rising cost of houses, lost job opportunities and cuts in rural transport and other services.\n’\n \nProfessor Howard Newby\n, Essex University.\n&#xa0;\nand\n, \n7 August 1987\n—\n‘\nSir, ... In Somerset, we still regret the first round of Beeching cuts. It is almost impossible now to travel across Somerset and back in one day by public transport. Between the main towns of Yeovil and Taunton there are only two buses a day and it is not possible to make the journey by train except by staying overnight. \nThose too young, too elderly or too infirm to drive a car are becoming more and more isolated\n.\n’\n Mrs \nMary Rose Mangles\n, Chairman, Public Transport Subcommittee, Somerset County Council.\n [Emphasis added]\n&#xa0;\nand\n, \n15 July 1999\n—\nSir, ... A local authority, backed by the Department of Transport and helped by private entrepreneurs, could quickly set up a bus service tailored to supporting village life. Such a scheme was tried last winter by the Wensleydale Railway Company, funded by Mr John Prescott\n’\ns rural bus grant via North Yorkshire County Council. High quality buses were used, which offered comfort and easy access for the elderly and disabled. The buses ran seven days a week from early morning to late at night, the timetable was integrated with nearby rail services and the routes were carefully designed by local people. A voluntary supporters\n’\n group ensured that bus stops displayed current timetables. The four-month trial was a success\n. After a slow start, passenger \nnumbers rose and, by the end, were rising at 1 per cent per week compared with three per cent \nper annum\n for \nbus travel nationally. The service was particularly popular with young people who, for the first time, could independently visit their friends and sample urban night life. Unfortunately the county council stopped the trial and started a cheaper contract with a bus company offering a reduced service and fewer routes. The buses now run virtually empty. The trial showed that public transport can help rural life. It also showed that a transport grant is a sensitive tool; a few per cent wrongly trimmed can reduce its effect to nil.\n’\n \nMr Stephen Deane,\n Wiltshire.\n&#xa0;\n \nDepartment of Health, \nAt least five a week: evidence on the impact of physical activity \nand its relationship to health—\na report from the Chief Medical Officer,\n 2004.\n&#xa0;\n \nWen and Wu, \n‘\nStressing harms of physical inactivity to promote exercise\n’\n, \nThe Lancet\n 2012 380 192\n–\n3.\n&#xa0;\n \nDepartment of Health, \nStart active, stay active: a report on physical activity from the four home countries\n’\n Chief Medical Officers\n, 2011\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nForesight, \nTackling obesities: future choices\n, Government Office for Science.\n&#xa0;\n \nDepartment of Health, \nCoronary\n heart disease, NHS framework—\nmodern standards and service models, \n2000.\n&#xa0;\n \nE McAuley \net alitur\n, \n‘\nPhysical activity, self-efficacy and self-esteem: longitudinal relationships in older adults\n’\n, \nJournals of Gerontology Series B \n60(5) 268\n–\n75.\n&#xa0;\n \nHM Government, \nBe active, be healthy—\na plan for getting the nation moving,\n 2009.\n&#xa0;\n \nM Christie and J Matthews, \nThe economic and social value of walking in rural England\n, report for the Ramblers\n’\n Association, 2003.\n&#xa0;\n \nWales Tourist Board, 2005.\n&#xa0;\n \nSee the Department for Transport\n’\ns statistics, published 30 July 2013, in which household \ncar availability is analysed by household economic quintile, at\n—\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts07-car-ownership-and-access\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n"
