We are\n \nbecoming more successful at prosecuting and convicting individuals \nengaging \nin\n \nterrorist activity\n. \nWe delivered a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games in\n \n2012\n. \nAnd our CONTEST strategy, and the way we implement it\n, \ncont\ni\nnue to be held\n \nup as examples of good practice around the world\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n. \nKey to this success is our commitment to continuous improvement: we\n \nregularly review our powers and capabilities to ensure they remain both effective and\n \nproportionate\n. \nA \n·\nroot-and-branch review of CT and security powers \nwas \nan \nearly\n \npriority for this Government and led to considerable reform\n; \nbut monitoring \nand\n \nevaluation is an ongoing process\n. \nAs we develop our powers and \ncapabilities \nto\n \nmeet new challenges, we will continue to ensure that we get the balance between\n \nsecurity and civil liberties right. Recent events have led to some debate about the\n \npowers we have and the way we and our partners use them\n. \nWhilst it is not \nthe\nGovernment's policy to comment on intelligence matters or leaked material, the\n \nCommittee will be aware that the Intelligence and Security Committee \n(ISC) \nhas\n \nalready published a report into allegations made by former US government\n \nemployee Edward Snowden, which found that GCHQ acted entirely properly\n. \nIn\n \nrespect of the detention of David Miranda\n, \nwe await the report \nof \nDavid Anderson\n \nQC, the Independent Reviewer of CT Legislation\n.\n&#xa0;\n5. Despite our \nsuccesses, \nthere is no room for complacency: the threat\n \ncontinues to diversify both in terms of geography and methodology\n, \nand maintaining\n \ncurrent \nlevels of assurance will be challenging \n. \nWhilst we still face a significant threat\n \nfrom AI Qa'ida (AQ) in the border areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, groups\n \naffiliated or associated \nwith \nAQ have become stronge\nr \nand \nmore \nactive across \na\n \nrange of unstable states\n, \nsuch as AI Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula \nin \nYemen and\n \nAI Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb in West Africa\n. \nIn Somalia\n, \nAI \nShabaab \nremains\n \ncapable of mounting attacks throughout the country and against targets \nin \nthe wider\nregion\n. \nThe conflict in Syria has drawn extremists on both sides\n; \nwhilst \ninstability\n \nacross that \nregion \nhas provided new ungoverned spaces for terrorists to operate in\n.\n Domestically\n,\n. \nthere has been a trend towards 'low signature\n' \nterrorism by self-directed groups and lone actors\n. \nThese individuals or groups develop the intent and\n \ncapability to conduct attacks without support or direction from AQ or AQ-affiliates\n. \nOf\n \nsimilar concern\n· \nare 'self\n-\nstarters' who radicalise themselves over the internet and\n \nplan attacks independently. Their attack methods tend to be simple\n, \nrequiring little\n \nmoney or technical ability\n, \nbut detecting and disrupting such threats is a significant\n \nchallenge\n.\n&#xa0;\n6. To put these words in context\n, \nthere have been six foiled terrorist plots in\n \nGreat Britain since April 2010\n. \nOther terrorist incidents of note over this period\n \ninclude the attempted murder of an MP by a student in May 2010 and the discovery\n \nof printer cartridge bombs in transit at East Midlands airport in October 2010\n.\n \nHowever, attack plots represent just a small proportion of all terrorist activity in the\n \nUK, and they tend to develop in groups already involved in terrorist facilitation.\n \nTimely disruption of these groups has prevented further attack plans developing\n.\n&#xa0;\n7\n. \nBetween April 2010 and March 2013, 580 individuals were arrested in Great\n \nBritain for terrorism\n-\nrelated offences. The majority of arrests over this period (446)\n \nwere categorised by the police as international terrorism\n \n(77\n°(\no), with 80 categorised\n \nas domestic terrorism (14\n%\n) and 9 as Northern Ireland related terrorism\n. \nThe\n \nnumber of arrests has increased in each of the past two years. In the most recent\n \nyear from April2012 to March 2013\n, \nthe number of arrests increased by 21% to 249\n \nfrom 206 in the previous year\n. \nThe longer term trend is fairly stable\n: \nsince 2002\n,\n \nthere have been on average 210 arrests per year. It should be noted that the\n \nrelatively small number of terrorism\n-\nrelated arrests each year means that\n \nproportionately large fluctuations in percentage terms are not uncommon\n.\n&#xa0;\n8. Of the\n.\n580 arrested between April 2010 and March 2013, 241 (42%) were\n \ncharged with an offence\n.\n \nOf the total arrested\n, \n98 (17\n%\n) were charged with a\n \nterrorism\n-\nrelated offence\n, \nof whom 35 (36%) were charged with preparation for\n \nterrorist acts (Terrorism Act 2006, section 5)\n. \nThis has led to 64 people being\n \nconvicted of a terrorism-related offence so far\n. \nOf these\n, \n31 (48%) were convicted of\n \npreparation for terrorist acts (Terrorism Act 2006, section 5)\n. \nFollowing a number of\n \ntrials relating to the most recent foiled plots\n, \n2012/13 saw a significant number of\n \nindividuals (13) convicted of preparation for terrorist acts. Since current records\n \nbegan in September 2001 and March 2013, 64% of those charged with terrorism\n \nrelated offences have been convicted\n.\n&#xa0;9\n. \nAs the threat changes\n, \nwe will continue \n.\nto focus on improving our\n \nunderstanding of the threat picture and maintaining our ability to disrupt and detect\n \nterrorist plots\n. \nNo strategy can be 1 00\n% \neffective in mitigating the threat\n, \nand th\ne \nrisk\n \nof a successful attack is always present. Recent tragic ev\ne\nnts here and abroad have\n \nonly strengthened our resolve to do all we can to protect the public from those who\n \nwould do us harm, and we will continue to monitor\n, \ndevelop and ref\ni\nne our powers\n \nand capabilities to ensure they remain both effective against \n- \nand proportionate to -\n \nthe threat we face.\n&#xa0;\n1. Pursue Structures&#xa0;\n10\n. \nOwnership and governance of \nPursue \nsit\n, \nlike the rest of CONTEST\n, \nwith the\n \nOffice of Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) in the Home Office\n, \nbut a wide\n \nrange of organisations and partners are responsible for contributing to the\n \ndevelopment and delivery of \nPursue \npolicy. Whilst the police and the security and\n \nintelligence agencies \n- \nthe Security Service (MI5), Secret Intelligence Service (MI6)\n \nand Government Communication Headquart\ne\nrs (GCHQ\n) \n- are at the forefront of\n \noperational delivery\n, \na number of other Whitehall departments and their agencies\n \nhave important roles to\n. \nplay in \nPursue, \nincluding the FCO\n, \nCabinet Office\n, \nHM\n \nTreasury and HMRC, along with other bodies such as the Charity Commission and\n \nFinancial Conduct Authority\n. \nClose co-operation and dialogue between these\n \norganisations\n, \nunderpinned by common objectives and priorities\n, \nand effective\n \ninformation and intelligence sharing\n, \nform the basis of suc\nc\nessful \nPursue \ndelivery\n.\n&#xa0;\n11 \n. \nThe work of the \nsecurity and intelligence agencies falls mainly within the\n \npurview of the ISC\n. \nThese organisations play an important role in delivering and\n \nsupporting policy\n, \njudiciary and law enforcement partners alike in combating \n·\nthe\n \nterrorist threat. On the operational side\n, \nthe most important of these is the police.\n&#xa0;\n12\n. \nPolicing is key to \nPursue \ndelivery in the UK\n, \nand whilst the Metropolitan\n \nPolice Service (MPS) plays a leading role in Great Britain\n, \nCT policing is delivered by\n \nevery police force in the\n· \ncountry\n. \nThe national Polic\ne \nCT Netwo\nr\nk comprises the\n \nCounter-Terrorism Command (S015) within the MPS\n; \nfour Counter-Terrorism Units\n \n(CTUs) in the West Midlands\n, \nWest Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Thames\n \nValley; and Counter\n-\nTerrorism Intelligence Units (CTIUs\n) \nin the East Midlands\n, \nSouth\n \nWest and Eastern regions\n, \nand Wales and Scotland\n. \nIndividual forces also have their\n \nown Special Branch capability or equivalent.\n&#xa0;\n13\n. \nThe police contribution to delivering CT is co-ordinated by an ACPO\n \ncommittee - the ACPO (TAM) Board - using authority delegated by the Chief\n \nConstables\n' \nCouncil\n; \nmajor CT investigations are co-ordinat\ne\nd a\nc\nross force\n \nboundaries by the Senior National Co-ordinator under a national agreement. Police\n \nactivity is funded by dedicated CT grants\n, \nthe level of which is based on advice from\n \nthe police and \n·\nthe agencies\n. \nFunding for CT policing has been protected since 2010\n,\n \nmaintaining core capabilities\n, \nand as announced in the recent Spending Round\n, \nit will\n \ncontinue to be ring-fenced until 2015\n-\n16. The intelligence agencies also received a\n \n3.4\n% \nincrease in their combined budget for 2015\n-\n16\n.\n&#xa0;\n14. A key aspect of police \nPursue \nwork focuses on protective security at \nports and airports. The National Border Targeting Centre uses advance passenger\n \ninformation to issue alerts to Special Branch officers at ports about subjects of\n \ninterest travelling to and from the UK, and \nto\n \ndeny airlines authority to carry to the\n \nUK individuals who pose a threat. These officers investigate people and goods\n \ninvolved in terrorism to obtain intelligence, and make arrests where appropriate. \n·\n&#xa0;\n15. \n· \nThe creation of the \nNational Crime Agency (NCA), which will be formally\n \nestablished in October 2013, represents a significant change to the policing\n \n.\nlandscape. The NCA will lead work on serious, organised and complex crime,\n \nincluding cyber crime and border security.\n  \nOnce the agency is up and \nrunning \nthe\n \nGovernment will consider what \n- \nif any - role, it should play in respect of CT. Until\n \nthen, the NCA will work with the Police CT Network on issues of. common interest.\n&#xa0;\n16. Successful disruption and prosecution of terrorist suspects does \nnot\n \nnecessarily eliminate the risk they pose, meaning partners such as the \nNational Offender Management Service (NOMS) are also vital to Pursue delivery\n. \nNOMS\n \nhas a well\n-\nestablished intelligence infrastructure which identifies risk and threats\n \nwithin prisons, from evidence of attack planning to radicalisation and recruitment\n \nactivity, and ensures that relevant intelligence is shared and jointly analysed with\n \npartner agencies and the police to disrupt extremist activity. \nThis \nincludes informing\n \ndecisions about how and where high risk offenders are held, to developing\n \nappropriate interventions to tackle extremism and radicalisation within prisons.\n&#xa0;2. Counter-Terrorism &amp; Security Powers&#xa0;Prosecution17. The most effective way of dealing with terrorist suspects is to prosecute them\n \nand, in the case of foreign nationals, subsequently to deport them. Responsibility for\n \nprosecuting terrorism-related \ncases \nin Great Britain lies with the Special Crime and\n \nCounter-Terrorism Division of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Suspected\n \nterrorists are prosecuted for \n'\nordinary\n' \ncriminal offences as well \nas \nthose provided for\n \nby specific CT legislation\n; \nmany of those involved in serious terrorist \nactivity \nare\n \nprosecuted for offences based on the wider legal framework, most notably offences\n \nsuch \nas \nconspiracy to murder. Last year, 43 people were charged with terrorism\n \nrelated\n \noffences in Great Britain, with 18 prosecuted and 16 convicted. A further \n24\n \nwere awaiting trial on \n31 \nDecember 2012, with 2 individuals having been acquitted.\n \nThese figures represent a strong performance.\n&#xa0;\nDisruption18\n. \nWhile prosecution is always our preferred option, it is not always possible.\n \nThe first priority must be to protect the public; as such, the police often need to take\n \naction to disrupt terrorist activity before they have be\ne\nn \nable \nto gather \nenough\n \nevidence for a prosecution\n. \nIn other circumstances, \na \nprosecution might not be\n \npractical because information against the suspect is not admissible in court due to\n \n. national security concerns \n- \nfrequently, the need to \nprotect \nour capabilities. \nFor \nthis\n \nreason\n, \nother means of disrupting terrorist activity are necessary to address the\n \nthreat these individuals pose to public safety. Again, these measures are subject to\n \nrobust safeguards to ensure they are effective, proportionate and consistent with our\nlegal and human rights obligations. The main measures are as follows:\n&#xa0;\n• \nTerrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs): Examined\n \nextensively by the Committee in the past, the TPIM regime restricts the ability\n \nof terrorist suspects to engage in terrorist-related activity, thus reducing the\n \nrisk they pose to the public. In his 2012 report\n, \nDavid Anderson QC concluded\n \nthat \n\"so \nfar TPIMS have been\n effective in preventing terro\nrist related activity\n\"\n.\n• \nExclusion: The Home Secretary has the power to exclude from the UK\n \nindividuals from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) whose presence\n \nshe does not consider \n'conducive \nto the public good.' Since January 2005,\n \n442 people have been excluded from the UK\n, \nincluding on grounds of national\n \nsecurity (234) and unacceptable behaviour (extremism) (162)\n.\n• \nDeprivation of citizenship: Since 2006 over 20 individuals who posed a \nreal\n \nnational security threat to the UK have been deprived of their British\n \ncitizenship and either prevented from returning to the UK or removed from this\n \ncountry. Deprivation of British citizenship results \nin \nsimultaneous loss of the\n \nright of abode in the United Kingdom and so paves the way\n, \nfor possible\n \nimmigration detention, deportation or exclusion from the UK.\n• \nDeportation with assurances (DWA): Deportation with assurances\n \nagreements are an important component of CT co-operation with \ninternational\n \npartners. They enable the UK to deport foreign nationals suspected of terrorist\n \nactivity in compliance with its obligations under human rights law. DWA\n \narrangements have been agreed with Jordan (to which the Government\n \nrecently succeeded in deporting Abu Qatada), Lebanon, Algeria\n, \nMorocco,\n \nEthiopia and Libya (not currently operational).\n• \nRoyal Prerogative: The Government's ability to stop individuals from\n \ntravelling abroad to engage in terrorism-related activity has become\n \nincreasingly important with recent developments in Syria and other places of\n \nconcern. A range of measures are in place which \ncan \nbe used to disrupt such\n \ntravel\n, \nwhich include the Home Secretary\n's \nRoyal Prerogative power to refuse\n \nor withdraw a British passport on public interest grounds\n. \nThis is an important\ntool to disrupt individuals who plan to \nengage \nin fighting, extremist activity or\n \nterrorist training overseas and then return to the UK with those \nskills. \nNew\n \npowers to\n search\n \nfor and seize passports cancelled by the Home Secretary\n \nunder the Royal Prerogative, as well as other invalid \n-\ntravel documents\n, \nhave\n \nbeen introduced into the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill.\n&#xa0;\nPreventative Measures19. As well as targeting individuals, an important element of \nPursue \nis to disrupt\n \nthe activities \nof \nterrorist groups\n, \nincluding their recruitment and funding activities\n.\n&#xa0;\n• \nProscription enables \nprosecution for membership \na\nnd other \nactivities in\n \nsupport \nof terrorist groups\n; \nit \nalso \nshows \nsolidarity \nwith international partners\n.\n \nProscription also facilitates other disruptions, including prosecutions and\n \nimmigration disruptions such as exclusion. In July 2013 Boko Haram and\n \nMinbar Ansar Deen in Nigeria were proscribed, and the AI Nusrah Front in\n \nSyria was recognised as an alias of AI Qa'ida.\n• Working through the UN and EU\n, \nthe UK also uses targeted international\n \nsanctions against individuals and groups suspected of terrorist activity which\n \ncan severely restrict their ability to operate. In July 2013\n, \nafter a sustained\n \nperiod of UK lobbying\n, \nEU Foreign Ministers agreed to list Hizb\n'\nallah\n'\ns military\n \nwing as a terrorist organisation\n; \nand in the first half of 2013\n, \nthe UK worked\n \nwith other Member States at the UN to ensure that the UN AI Qa\n'\nida sanctions\n \nregime reflected the emerging terrorist threats in north and west Africa\n. \nThe\n \nrestrictive measures imposed by CT sanctions include travel bans\n, \narms\n \nembargoes and asset freezes on designated individuals or entities\n.\n&#xa0;\nReviewing our powers20\n. \nEnsuring our CT powers - and the legislation underpinning them \n–\n remain\n \nboth effective and proportionate is a cornerstone of our strategy, one which reflects\n \nour commitment to protecting the people of this country and our interests overseas in\n \na way which is consistent with British values\n, \nincluding transparency\n, \nhuman rights\n \nand the rule of law. The Government's review of CT and security powers\n, \npublished\n \nin January 2011\n, \nmade changes to the toolkit to make it more effective\n, \ntargeted\n \nand proportionate.\n• We concluded that \nstop-and-search powers under Section 44 of the TACT\n \nTerrorism Act 2000 must be repealed\n, \nand replaced them with a more limited\n \npower which enables the police to stop and search people and vehicles\n \nwithout reasonable suspicion only in exceptional circumstances where th\ne\nre is\n \na real threat of terrorist attack\n.\n• We also reduced the maximum \n·\nperiod of \npre-charge detention from 28 to 14\n \ndays \n- \nthough recognising that in exceptional circumstances a temporary\n \nincrease to a maximum of 28 days might be necessary, an emergency Bill has\n \nbeen prepared as a contingency, subject to Parliament's approval.\n• We also recently commenced \npost-charge questioning pow\ne\nrs in Great\n \nBritain to enable terrorist susp\ne\ncts to be question\ne\nd after b\ne\ning charged \n–\n an\n \nadditional investigative tool for the police and prosecutors where further\n \nevidence emerges after charges have been brought. The purpose is to allow\n \nprosecutors to build more robust evidential cases\n.\n&#xa0;\n21. Evaluation of our powers is an ongoing process\n. \nSchedule 7 of the Terrorism\n \nAct 2000 enables police officers to stop, question\n, \ndetain and sear\nc\nh p\ne\nople\n \ntravelling through ports to d\ne\nt\ne\nrmin\ne \nwhether they are or hav\ne \nbe\ne\nn involved in\n \nterrorism\n. \nSchedule 7 confers an important CT power\n, \nbut the Government\n \nrecognises there are concerns about its use\n. \nWe recently conducted an extensive\n \npublic consultation on Schedule 7\n; \namendments will be proposed in the Anti-Social\n \nBehaviour\n, \nCrime \n&amp; \nPolicing Bill, including reducing the maximum examination\n \nperiod to six hours\n.\n&#xa0;\n22\n. \nRecognising the need to protect intelligence and the capabiliti\ne\ns for gathering\n \nit\n, \nwe also introduced the \nJustice and Security Act, which allows for closed material\n \nproceedings in the small number of civil cases involving national se\nc\nurity sensitive\n \nmaterial\n; \nand for judicial reviews of exclusion and deprivation decisions to be heard\n \nby the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC\n)\n. These measures have\n \nequipped the courts better to handle sensitive materia\nl \nto serve the interests of both\n \njustice and national security\n, \nwhile allowing the Government to defend its case for\n \nthe use of these executive actions\n, \neven where decisions are based fully or partly on\n \nmaterial which cannot be disclosed in open court without damaging national security\n.\n&#xa0;\n23\n. \nThe Government also remains committed to ensuring that the law\n \nenforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers they need to investigate\n \ncrime\n, \nprotect the public and ensure our national security\n, \nincluding maintaining\n \naccess to communications data\n. \nThe Government's approach will be proportionate\n,\n \nwith robust safeguards in place\n, \nbut we cannot let cyberspace become a haven for\n \ncriminals and terrorists\n.\n&#xa0;\n3. Counter-Terrorist Finance&#xa0;\n24\n. \nThe need to tackle terrorist financing is an important aspect of \nPursue\n:\n \nterrorists need money to organise and conduct attacks, maintain their networks,\n \ntravel\n, \nand radi\nc\nalis\ne \nand train others\n. \nThis is challenging\n: \nthe amounts of money\n \ninvolved are often small and difficult to trace\n, \nand the means by which terrorists\n \nraise\n, \nmove and store money are diverse\n, \nranging from abuse of charity to exploiting\n \nweak regulatory environments to conducting kidnaps for ransom.\n&#xa0;\nBanking &amp; Money Service Businesses25\n. \nTerrorists use banks and money service businesses (MSBs) to move and\n \nstore funds; the \nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) and \nHMRC are therefore key\n \npartners\n. \nThe FCA supervises banks\n1 \ncompliance w\ni\nth the Money Laundering\n \nRegulations and focuses on ensuring that banks have robust systems and controls \ni\nn\n \nplace to \n·\nprevent money laundering and highlight suspicious activity. HMRC\n \nsupervises money service businesses under the same regulations\n; \ninformation\n \nrelating to terrorism is passed to law enforcement agencies\n.\n&#xa0;\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF)26\n. \nEnsuring robust regulatory regimes in overseas jurisdictions is an important\n \ndimension in countering terrorist finance\n. \nThe UK is a strong supporter and active\n \nmember of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)\n, \nwhich sets international\n \n· \nstandards for legal\n, \nregulatory and operational measures to \nc\nombat money\n \nlaundering and terrorist finance\n. \nFATF conducts regular evaluations of countries\n'\n \nregimes and sets actions plans for those with def\ni\nciencies\n; \nhigh-risk jurisdictions\n \nwhich do not take steps to improve their regimes can be \n'\ng\nr\ney\n-\nlisted\n' \nor 'black-listed\n'\n \nby FATF\n, \nwhich can limit investment and participation in international markets\n. \nThis\n \nhas produced tangible results\n: \nKuwait has recently taken significant steps to improve\n \nits regime\n, \nincluding ratifying the Terrorist Finance Convention and enacting\n \nlegislation\n; \nand both Kenya and Ethiopia have also introduced legislation due to\n \nFATF pressure.\n&#xa0;\nCharities27\n. \nThe conviction in February 2013 of three individuals for raising money for\n \nterrorist purposes by posing as charity fundraisers\n, \nunderl\ni\nned the importance of the\n \nrole of the Charity Commission\n, \nthe charity regulator in England and Wales\n, \nin\n \ncountering terrorism and extremism. Traditionally\n, \nthe Commission has focused on\n \nregulatory monitoring and compliance. We have been working closely with the\n \nCommission and its new chair William Shawcross to look at how it can take a\n \ntougher line with those who seek to abuse the sector for ter\nr\norist purposes\n, \nincluding\n \nthrough more effective and targeted use of its existing powers against charities of CT\n \nconcern. Where necessary we will seek to enhance those powers to improve th\ne\n \nCommission\n'\ns ability to regulate the sector as a whole\n.\n&#xa0;\n28. Working with the Home Office\n, \nlaw enforcement and other partners\n, \nthe\n \nCommission has already increased the number of compliance visits it conducts into\n \ncharities of CT concern\n, \nboth to identify and investigate abuse by terrorists and to\n \nimprove awareness of and increase resilience to such abuse\n. \nAs part of that\n \nawareness\n-\nraising the Commission has published guidance to the sector on stopping\n \nextremist speakers and monitoring charitable funds\n, \nincluding its successful 'Safer\n \nGiving' campaigns\n. \nMore recently\n, \nit has run workshops on sending aid to Syria and\n \nother high risk areas. Internationally, we will continue to work with the Commission\n \nand other partners to improve its visibility of charities' activities - and of their financial\n \nfootprints- overseas\n.\n&#xa0;\n4. International Co-operation&#xa0;Bilateral and Multilateral Engagement29\n. \nMany threats to the UK involve an international dimension\n, \nand the\n \ndiversification of the threat in recent years has made it ever more important that we\n \nwork with a wide range of countries to disrupt the threat to the UK and to build\n \ncapability to counter terrorism at source\n. \nWe work in close co\n-\noperation on both\n \npolicy and operational channels with our international counterparts in accordance\n \nwith our values, the rule of law and our own legal obligations\n.\n&#xa0;\n30\n. \nOur most developed C\nT relationships\n \nare with our \n'\n5 Eyes\n' \npartners\n: \nthe US\n,\n \nCanada, Australia and New Zealand\n. \nWe have unique intelligenc\ne \nrelationships with\n \nthese countri\ne\ns and hold r\ne\ngular\n, \ndetailed exchanges of views on CT pol\ni\ncy and\n \nstrategy issues\n. \nWe also have close relationships w\ni\nth European countries\n, \nboth\n \nbilaterally and through the European Union\n. \nThe UK is regarded as a source of\n \nexpertise on CT within Europe, and we work closely with \nE\nU bodies (CT Coordinator,\n \nCommission, Europol\n, \nExternal Action Service) and oth\ne\nr Member States\n \nto set the direction for European CT activity\n. \nThe UK opt\n-\nout of Justic\ne \n&amp; Hom\ne\n \nAffairs measures will not restrict our ability to co-operate fully with other European\n \ncountries to tackle terrorism\n. \nWe are also engaged in agreeing priorities and action\n \nplans for the EU\n'\ns external work\n, \nnotably in building capability in the security and\n \njustice sectors in priority countries.\n&#xa0;\n31 \n. \nThe UK promotes greater international co\n-\noperation on CT \nthrough \nother\n \nmult\nilateral\n forums such as the G8 and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF).\n \nThis year's UK Presidency of the G8 focused on kidnap for ransom \n–\n achieving\n \nunequivocal rejection of the payment of terrorist ransoms - while the GCTF is\n \ndeveloping its work in the areas of rule of law and criminal justice capacity building,\n \nincluding the establishment of an International Institute for Justice and the Rule of\n \nLaw (opening in 2014), which will t\nr\nain legal practitioners to international standards.\n&#xa0;\nOverseas Capacity-Building32. In 2013\n, \nthe Government introduced a more strategic approach to its efforts to\n \ndevelop the capacity of international partners to investigate and prosecute terrorists\n \nby building justice and human rights partnerships with countries where there is both\n a threat to UK secu\nrity and weaknesses in the law enforcement, human rights and\n \ncriminal justice architecture. Supported by a £30m CT Programme Fund, these\n \npartnerships include work to\n:\n• Build the CT capacity of overseas security services to improve compliance\n \nwith the law and human rights and to make them more effective;\n• Improve the ability of loca\nl investigators \nto build cases based on evidence\n \nrather than confession\n. \nThe police CT network plays a critical role in this\n \nregard\n: \nsupport is delivered through the network of Counter-Terrorism and\n \nExtremism Liaison Officers (CTELOs) posted overseas who work with\n \norganisations in their host countries and regions;\n• Ensure prosecutors and judges are capable of processing terrorism cases\n \nthrough the court systems, effectively\n, \nfairly and in line with the rule of law\n;\n \n• Improve and where appropriate monitor conditions in detention facilities so\n \nthat convicted terrorists can be held securely and their treatment meets with\n \ninternational standards\n.\n&#xa0;\n33. Safeguards have been designed to ensure that this work is carried out within\n \na framework\n built \non accountability and respect for human rights; it is vital that our\n \nCT work supports justice and the rule of law as well as meeting our security\n \nobjectives\n. \nAlthough work on the partnerships is in its early stages, we have already\n \ndelivered progress in a range of areas\n, \nincluding the establishment of focused CT\n \nprosecutor cadres in key countries, more effect\ni\nve handling of CT cases through the\n \ncourts and improvements in CT investigators\n' \nevidence gathering and forensics\n \nskills.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion34\n. \nThe latest version of CONTEST considered what success in \nPursue \nlooked\n \nlike: effective disruption of terrorist-related activity in the UK and more prosecutions\n \nor deportations of those responsible; reducing the threat from AI Qa\n'\nida\n, \nits affiliates\n \nand other organisations overseas, including disrupting attacks planned against the\n \nUK\n; \nand ensuring that our CT work is effective, proportionate and consistent with our\n \ncommitment to human rights\n.\n&#xa0;\n35\n. \nJudged against these indicators\n, \nwe are confident that our performance in\n \ndelivering \nPursue \nhas been and continues to be strong. However\n, \nas the threat\n \ncontinues to diversify and originate from a wider geographical area\n, \nour ability to\n \ndetect and disrupt potential plots will become ever more challenging. We cannot\n \nreduce the risk from terrorism to zero, but we will continue to work to disrupt those\n \nsuspected of terrorist activity in the UK\n; \nto prosecute and convict them where we\n \ncan\n; \nand where we cannot but they are foreign nation\n.\nals\n, \nto take action to remove\n \nthem from the UK\n. \nWe do this by ensuring that our partners have a robust range of\n \npowers which enable them to do their job and their work is integrated and coordinated\n.\n \nWe keep our powers and capabilities under regular review to ensure that\n \nthey are effective and proportionate, and we are working ever more closely with\n \noverseas partners and organisations to improve both their and our capabilities to\n \ncounter terrorism.\n&#xa0;\n \n'\nFoiled plots\n' \nare defined as plots involving one o\nr \nmore individual engaged in attack planning of any\nform who have been arrested\n, \ncharg\ne\nd and conv\ni\ncted of a terrorism-related offenc\ne \nwithin the stated\ntime period\n. \nThe figure includes all f\no\nrms of terror\nis\nm \ni\nn Great Bri\nt\nain\n, \nbut e\nxc\nludes Northern Ireland\nRelated \nT\nerrorism in Northern Ireland\n.\n \nThe remainder we\nr\ne not categorised\n.\n I\nn some instances\n, \nan individual arrested for terrorism-related offences may be charged with a non\nterro\nr\nism\n-\nre\nl\nated offen\nc\ne\n.\n \nData refers to the princ\ni\npal \nc\nharg\ne \nfor ea\nc\nh individual and \nd\noes not \ni\nn\nd\nicat\ne w\nh\ne\nr\ne \nind\ni\nviduals ar\ne\ncharged with multiple offences\n.\n \nIncludes all those arrested between April \n2\n010 and Mar\nc\nh \n2\n013 who had been convicted of a\nterroris\nm \nr\ne\nlated offence as of 10 July \n2\n01 \n3\n. \nSome individuals are still awa\ni\nting tr\ni\nal and \ns\no conv\ni\nction\ndata should\n. \nbe interp\nr\neted \nw\nith caution\n.\n \nA\nv\na\nil\nab\nl\ne \na\nt \nhttps\n:\n//www\n.\nqov\n.\nuk/governmenUpublications/review-of-counter-terror\ni\nsm\n-\nand\n-\nse\nc\nurity\npowers\n"
