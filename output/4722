[normal]When Healthwatch England provides this information and advice to the CQC, the Secretary of State, the NHS Commissioning Board, Monitor or local authorities, they are obliged under the Act to inform Healthwatch in writing of their response or proposed response to the advice, although there is no limit on the amount of time these bodies have to respond and no guidance on how they must consider whether or not to take action.
[normal] 
[normal]It is too early to know how Healthwatch will use these powers, but it is conceivable that they could be used as a form of super complaint to any of these bodies.
