"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mind (JRR 0023)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWho we are&#xa0;\nMind is the leading mental health charity in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n. \nWe provide advice and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem. We campaign to improve services, raise awareness and promote understanding.\n&#xa0;\nOur network of over 150 local Minds provides a variety of services, tailored to t\nhe needs of each local community. They are independent charities that share Mind’s values and adhere to quality standards. We have over 1,600 services across \nEngland\n and \nWales\n and last year provided direct support to over 285,000 people. Services on offer \ninclude supported housing, crisis help lines, drop-in \ncentres\n, \ncounselling\n, befriending, advocacy, and employment and training schemes.\n&#xa0;\nMind’s \nLegal\n Unit\n prepares legal information on key areas of law, including: mental \nhealth, mental capacity, \ncommunity \ncare\n, \ndisability discrimination\n and human rights\n. Mind runs a \nLegal\n Advice Service via telephone and email for people based in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n, which processes around 5,000 legal enquiries each year. Mind’s \nLegal\n Team undertakes casework on behalf of Min\nd largely by way of interventions in \npublic law\n c\nhallenges\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.              Summary &#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMind responded to the government’s consultation \n“Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform\n.\n”\n \nMind considers j\nudicial review \nto be \na key tool for ensuring that the rights of people with experience of mental health problems are protected, promoted and upheld. \nThe ability to hold the executive to account is a fundamental tenet of a democratic society\n and \nMind’s view is that the \ngovernme\nnt’s proposals will severely dilute the constitutional rights of citizens and undermine the role of the judiciary in holding public bodies accountable.\n \nMind \ni\ns deeply concerned about the impact of the proposals on people who expe\nrience mental health proble\nms and we have outlined our concerns below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.              Standing: The proposed introduction of a narrower test for “standing” to apply for judicial review, so as to limit the range of people and groups who are entitled to invoke the procedure&#xa0;&#xa0;\n2.\n1\n              \nThe courts \nhave \nrecognised\n the value of claims being brought by those without a direct interest in the proceedings:\n&#xa0;\n“Public law is not at base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs - that is to say misus\nes of public power; and the courts have always been alive to the fact that a person or \norganisation\n with no particular stake in the \nissue or the outcome may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the co\nurt to an apparent misuse of public power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for leave, the court's only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive.”\n&#xa0;\n2.\n2\n              \nAdditionally, the government itself \nacknowledge\nd\n \nin the consultation \nthat cases brought by NGOs, charities and pressure groups tend to be valid claims:\n&#xa0;\n“From Administrative Court records for cases lodged between 2007 and 2011 around 50 judicial reviews per year have been identified that app\near to have been lodged by NGOs, charities, pressure groups and faith \norganisations\n, i.e. by claimants who may not have had a direct interest in the matter at hand. The identified cases tended to be relatively successful compared to other JR cases.”\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOrganisations\n that bring cases as representatives of a group of individuals are best placed to provide the court with an expert view. This means that the court can focus on the underlying issue rather than on the specific facts of an individual case. The r\nisk posed by the proposal to change the rules on standing is that the courts will face a series of claims from various individuals when one would do. This would be neither cost effective nor efficient. \nThe proposals to limit those with standing will impact\n on a minority of cases which are generally highly meritorious by virtue of their wider public interest.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Mind’s view, a test for standing that is any narrower than having to demonstrate “sufficient interest” risks interfering with the right to a remedy under Article 6 ECHR.  \n \n&#xa0;3.              Third Party Interventions: The proposed modification of the rules to discourage the involvement of interveners and third parties&#xa0;3.1\n              \nThird parties make applications to intervene in a minority of cases in order to assist the court in understanding the wider implications of a case on often large numbers of people. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nMind has \nintervened in a number of cases\n, \nthe majority \nof which have involved \nbreaches of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms\n under human rights and equality legislation\n. Some examples are given below:\n&#xa0;\nSavage v \nSouth Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust\n and \nRabone\n and another v \nPennine\n Care NHS Foundation Trust\n \nestablished \na positive duty on hospitals to ensure that they take reasonable steps to prevent mental health patients from taking their own lives. It was a challenge relating to the application o\nf Article 2 ECH\nR\n.\n&#xa0;\nMM and DM v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions\n involves a challenge to the Employment Support Allowance (“ESA”) determination process based on the \nfact that \nit places people with mental health problems at \na \nsubstantial \ndisadvantage.\n \n&#xa0;\nDas v Secretary of State for the Home Department\n concern\ned the threshold for determining whether p\neople with mental health problems should be detained in immigration removal \ncentres\n. \nThis case was brought against the backdrop of four previ\nous cases in which the \nc\nourt found breaches of Article 3.\n \n&#xa0;\nP v Cheshire West and Chester Council\n &amp; P and Q v Surrey County Council\n concerned the proper approach to the question of when a person is deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article\n 5 ECHR. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe above case examples concern matters of fundamental importance to \nMind’s beneficiaries and it \nis imperative, in Mind’s view, that \nthe rules on interveners remain as they are in order for the court to decide whether it would benefit from the \nex\np\nert evidence \nthat \nthird parties \nare in a unique position to \nprovide. \n&#xa0;\n4.              \nCosts: The proposed rebalancing of financial incentives so that providers are only paid for work carried out on judicial review cases where permission is granted, or exceptionally in the Legal Aid Agency’s discretion &#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nAside from the fact that the government a\nppears\n to be suggesting that public lawyers pursue cases for reasons other than that their client has a valid claim and that the Legal Aid Agency \n(LAA) \ngrants funding for unmeritorious cases, Mind has \na number of concerns relating to this proposal.  \n \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nT\nhere is a risk that the courts will become clogged with applications for costs determinations. This can be a lengthy process and will require provider\ns to \nsubsidise\n the costs of litigation which is not viable for many firms, particularly those which undertake predominantly legal aid work. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nAnother\n undesirable result of th\ne\n proposal is that specialist public law firms, with many years experience of \njudicial review, may cease taking on judicial review cases because it is not financially viable for them to do so. \nThe risk is that \nnon-specialist lawyers \nwill \nattempt to turn their hand to judicial review which will increase the likelihood of unmeritoriou\ns/vexatious and poorly prepared claims being brought. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nV\nulnerable clients, for example those wit\nh mental health problems, sometimes \nchange their mind about pursuing a claim part way through the \nprocess – i.e. between issuing the proceedings and permission being granted. They may choose to discontinue a claim because they find the process too stressful, or because they have a lack of tr\nust in the process as a result \nof a previous bad experience. Therefore, pr\noviders may be less willing to act for vulnerable clients due to the risk of not getting paid.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n5\n              \nT\nhe introduction of \ndiscretion\n for the \nLAA\n to pay providers in cases where proceed\nings are issued, but the case concludes prior to a permission decision, \nis likely to lead to a significant number of claims being brought against the LAA. Where its application of the criteria leads to non-payment, providers will have no choice but to moun\nt such challenges. Ironically, this would increase the number of judicial review applications made.   \n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nPeople with mental health problems are more likely to access health and community care services. Where the provision of such services is refused or \nreduced, the appropriate remedy is judicial review where all other avenues have been exhausted. If these proposals go ahead, such individuals will effectively have no remedy beyond pursuing a complaint, as they will struggle to find a lawyer able and/or wi\nlling to take their case on. \nMind considers that the proposals to further curb access to legal aid risks \nbreaching \nindividuals\n’\n rights under Article 6 ECHR. \n&#xa0;5.              The Public Sector Equality Duty: The proposal to make non-justiciable the statutory duty imposed on public bodies by the Equality Act, to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, by providing an alternative, non-judicial mechanism for resolving disputes about whether public bodies have complied with the duty &#xa0;           \nTh\ne Pu\nblic S\nector Equality Duty provides\n an important safeguard for\n our          \n           beneficiaries’ \nrights,\n if public authoritie\ns \ncomply with it when providing \n           \neducation,\n health and social care, planning and \npolicing. If \na public authority \n          \n fails to follow\n its obligations, judicial review may sometimes be the \n           \nonly means by which an individual can challenge this failure\n. Raising a   \n       \n    \ncomplaint is usually a lengthy process and does not prompt urgent action.  \n \n           \nThis remedy is important\n for people who have mental\n         \n \n \nhealth\n problems as th\ney are likely to be more depende\nnt upon public \n          \n \nauthorities.\n A pre-action protocol letter may be enough to secure change\n           \nswiftly and so the number of cases where s 149 Equality Act is actually  \n            \n   \n        litigated wi\nll be small.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n             \n \n&#xa0;6.              The combined effect of these proposals with the government’s proposals to reform legal aid, in particular the introduction of a residence test  &#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nUnder the \nresidence test\n, a person detained in \na \npsychiatric hospital would \nbe entitled \nto advice as \nthose subject to detention under the Mental Health Act are\n not\n e\nxc\nluded from \nthe 12 month rule. However, once discharged into the \ncommunity, \nsuch an individual \nwould \nnot be entitled to legal aid to enforce their rights to social care support and housing \nif the\ny\n could not satisfy the \n12 month\n residence test\n. \nA lack of adequate after\ncare services and/or accommodation \np\nlaces people \nat serious risk of relapse and r\ne\nadmission \nto hospital\n. \nFrom enquiries to our Legal Advice Line, and from our work with advocates and service providers in local Minds, we know that some psychiatric patients, whether they have been detained or were admitted as voluntary inpatients, are discharged from hospital w\nithout any, or any adequate, aftercare services including social care support and housing. These people require legal assistance to enforce their rights. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilarly, the \n12 month residence test will \nalso \nnot apply to those in immigration detention\n. Howeve\nr, Home Office guidance stipulates that people with\n a \nserious mental \nillness which \ncannot be satisfactorily managed in detention \nare normally considered suitable for detention in only very exceptional circumstance\ns\n.\n \nThe \n12 month residence test \ncreate\ns\n an \nanomaly as those who are detained will be entitled to legal aid, but those who are living in the community, often with serious mental health problems\n and therefore significant support needs\n, will not.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nIn a climate of increasing cuts to public services, of which people with mental health problems are often beneficiaries, the government is attempting to severely restrict the ability of individuals to challenge the decisions, acts and omissions of public b\nodies. Combined with the further reforms to legal aid, in Mind’s opinion, the government’s plans \nwould be catastrophic\n for people with mental health problems.\n&#xa0;\n27 November 2013\n5\n&#xa0;\n \nSedley\n J in \nR v Somerset County Council, ex p \nDixon\n [1998] \nEnv\n LR 111\n Paragraph 78\n \n[2007] EWCA \nCiv\n 1375\n [2012] UKSC 2\n 2013 UKUT 260 AAC\n \n[2013] EWHC 682 (Admin)\n \nR (S) v SSHD \n[2011] EWHC 2120 (Admin), \nR (BA) v SSHD \n[2011] EWHC 979 (Admin), \nHA (\nNigeria\n), \nand \nR (D) v SSHD \n[2012] EWHC 2501 (Admin\n UKSC/2012/ 0068\n UKSC/2012/0088P\n Chapter 55.10 Enforcement Instructions and Guidance, Home Office, August 2010\n.\n \n"
