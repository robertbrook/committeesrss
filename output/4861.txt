[[[PREVENTION ]]]

[[[PROJECTS]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 24 May following the attack in Woolwich asking about radicalisation prevention projects in London that work specifically with black converts to Islam.&#xa0;Under the revised Prevent strategy, local authorities are responsible for identifying project which they consider relevant to the risks in their local areas. We have funded a number of projects put forward by local authorities in London which work with young Muslims, including those who are converts. We do not currently fund any projects which work specifically with black converts, and we have not received any proposals for such funding.&#xa0;Our approach to protecting vulnerable people builds on Channel, the existing multi-agency programme to identify and provide support to people at risk of radicalisation. Channel is available to all vulnerable people regardless of their ethnic or religious background.&#xa0;You also asked whether either suspect was known to prevention projects prior to the attack in Woolwich. As there is a criminal investigation underway, I am sure that you will appreciate I am not able to comment further on this at thistime.&#xa0;Rt Hon Theresa May MPHome SecretaryJune 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
