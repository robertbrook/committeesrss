defaultI totally agree with, and support, the proposals of the YORKSHIRE DALES GREEN LANES ALLIANCE that
default&#xa0;
defaultAll unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.default&#xa0;defaultWhen a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.default&#xa0;
defaultUntil such legislation is implemented, BOAT’s and UCR’s shall continue to be devastated by 4x4’s and motor cycles.
