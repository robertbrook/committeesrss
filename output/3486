[normal]Written evidence submitted by  [bold]Novolytics[bold] Limited[bold] (AMR0048)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I am the CEO of Novolytics Limited, a small early stage biotechnology company that was originally a spin out from The University of Warwick. Novolytics seeks to combat the threat posed by antibiotic resistant bacteria through the use of bacteriophages (“phages”). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Phages are viruses that are 
[normal]harmless to mankind but
[normal] potentially lethal to bacteria. Phages replicate by a process of bacterial infection followed by the “hijacking” of the bacterial reproductive machinery so as to make multiple phage progeny. Release of phage progeny is achieved through lysis of the invaded bacterial cell, resulting in bacterial cell death. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The idea of using phages as therapeutic agents is based on this process and is not new in principle. Indeed the use of phage to control a variety of bacterial pathogens, including those responsible for dysentery and cholera, became well established in the 1920s and 1930s. However a poor understanding of phage molecular biology, coupled to an unscrupulous attitude within some major drugs companies at the time, meant that phage cocktails were sold as “cure- alls”. For example cocktails could be purchased for the treatment of polio and influenza, both of which are caused by viruses rather than bacteria. Cynicism grew amongst the general public and the scientific community throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The discovery and subsequent widespread availability of antibiotics consigned phage therapy to a medical backwater, at least in The West. Continued use of phages as therapeutic agents survived only behind the Iron Curtain. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Today Georgia and Poland are the only two countries where phages are routinely offered as treatment for infectious disease. However phage therapy products made in either of these two countries are not available elsewhere because they would not pass the regulatory demands imposed on any putative therapeutic for human use. This is for two main reasons:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novolytics is amongst a handful of companies in the West who seek to make available phage therapy products by ensuring that the two hurdles described above are overcome in a commercially viable way. The generation of clinical trial data is always expensive, but because of the inherent safety profile of phages the costs are significantly lower than in drug development. This is because there is little or no need for dosage response or toxicity concerns to be addressed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novolytics has been funded to date through business angel investment. Almost £3 million has been raised and this has enabled the company to develop an anti-Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( “anti MRSA”) phage cocktail that is made in a way which is compliant with the requirements of the UK’s regulatory body The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Today Novolytics is the
[normal] only
[normal] company worldwide to have achieved these milestones, but there are better funded phage therapy development companies elsewhere in the world that are catching up fast. These foreign companies are funded with a mixture of public sector and private venture capital money.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novolytics
[normal] dealings with the MHRA have been reasonable. Over recent years we consulted on specific points in relation to the content and scope of pre-clinical toxicity programmes, human clinical trial design, and manufacturing process requirements. The process is inevitably time consuming and had expensive consequences, particularly for a business of our size. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The MHRA’s primary role is to safeguard the public. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the volume of drug applications from “big Pharma” there appears to be a “Big Company” mentality. Such characteristics are reasonable in the normal course of events but in my view insufficient if the threat posed by AMR is to be addressed in a reasonable timeframe. Account must be taken of where the R&amp;D effort is located and also of its breadth in nature. Drug development is NOT the only approach available in tackling AMR.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In my view too many people who represent the MHRA understand only one route, namely small molecule drug development. For reasons that are well documented elsewhere, sole reliance on the development of new classes of antibiotics is unlikely to solve the threat from AMR. This is because there is simply too little R&amp;D being undertaken by large pharmaceutical companies to ensure a sufficiently robust pipeline of new products. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novel approaches to AMR necessarily require imaginative and collaborative engagement by all parties. This must include the regulatory gatekeeper. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The suggested actions contained in the 5 year AMR Strategy Document are sensible. However it is the financial commitment from the public sector which I fear will be the stumbling block in relation to key area 4 on the action list of seven (developing new drugs, treatments and diagnostics). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novolytics, for example, has been solely funded by business angels to date. We have made applications to various public sector bodies including the TSB, under various “calls” but to no avail. This would be of little consequence to Parliament if, for example, our business was concerned with the development of a new diagnostic or even a new cancer drug. There are dozens of other businesses doing the same thing and competition per se for scarce public resources is a good thing. However in the area of infectious disease therapeutics there is market failure. It appears that resource availability, rather than the quality of therapeutic endeavour, is stifling new therapeutic development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Venture Capital firms and “Big Pharma” are both reluctant to fund businesses in the novel therapeutics space, particularly early stage businesses. They perceive that the risk/reward profile in infectious disease drug development will remain askew for the foreseeable future, at least for businesses that are at pre phase II clinical trial data generation. And yet to get to that stage remains a tall order on business angel funding alone. We know from our contacts in Poland that there are anti-MRSA phage cocktails that have been developed in the laboratory and used on people with no adverse outcomes. So although we accept the need to undertake clinical trials we do not believe the risk profile in our line of endeavour is as severe as that for traditional antibiotic development. Remember 
[normal]antibiotics are effectively selective poisons. Accordingly the funding amounts required to bring phage therapy products to the marketplace should be significantly lower compared to antibiotics. As an ex VC myself this situation is both understandable and frustrating. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In my view the best solution remains public sector matched funding but on a more ambitious scale than that seen to date. The TSB’s Biomedical Catalyst Fund is simply not big enough for therapeutic development and in my view is better suited to devices and diagnostics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However perhaps what people underestimate is the value and leverage that can be derived from the “endorsement” that comes from projects that are received favourably after review by entities such as the TSB. This third party validation can be the cornerstone of successful fundraising effort with the balance drawn from the private sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have been struck by the support which our kind of work is receiving elsewhere in the World. In my view it validates the assertions made in paragraphs 3.4 and 3.5 above. For example, two companies doing similar work to Novolytics, and based in the US and France respectively, are supported by their Departments of Defence. The two companies that are being supported are Ampliphi Biosciences in the US and Pherecydes Pharma in France. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recently Ampliphi Biosciences announced a tie up with a Leicester University based research group who have identified phages effective against 
[normal]Clostridium difficile
[normal]. The work at Leicester has been in part funded by grants from the UK’s MRC. Whilst it is great news that the work carried out at Leicester will not be wasted, is it really great news for the UK taxpayer to underwrite high risk early stage science only to allow for its commercial exploitation by US businesses? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ampliphi is funded by three private sector venture capital companies. However its financial strength was bolstered significantly 
[normal]and contemporaneously with the announcement that active support from the US Military had been obtained (

[normal]June 2013 “
[normal]AmpliPhi
[normal] Closes $7 Million Private Placement”). Is it really coincidental that the VCs committed at the same time as the US Military underpinned some future big ticket expenditure items?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novolytics applied to the UK’s MOD quite recently in response to one of their periodic “calls” which related to novel antimicrobial approaches. The application was not considered because we are not developing new drugs.  It was not the quality of our work that was questioned. I remain unsure why the recent military experiences of our allies in the same theatre of conflict can lead to such a different interpretation of the potential value phage treatment offers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion perhaps the UK government should consider the provision of a continuum of public funding for novel therapeutics development 
[normal]to the point where the private sector will accept the ongoing risks of development.
