"              \n              \nDIS 50\nThe Australian Government’s approach \nto ensuring \npeople with disability\n \nbenefit from our \naid program is set out in the strategy document, \nDevelopment for All: Towards a disability-inclusive Australian aid program 2009-2014\n (\nDevelopment for All\n).\n The strategy aims to ensure that people with disability are included in and benefit equally from Australia’s aid program.  I\nn 2011-2012 Australia provided AUD \n108.7 million to improve the quality of life for people with disability throughout the aid program.\nDevelopment for All\n is informed by the principles of Article 32 of the \nUN \nConvention\n on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n, including non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society\n,\n and equality of \nopportunity and accessibility.  \nIn \n2013 \nthe \nOECD\n Development \nAssistance Committee Peer Review highlighted \nAustralia’s\n ‘exceptional emphasis on disability which makes it a leader in this area internationally’.\n  \n  \nAustralia’s success in this area has been supported by strong (and bipartisan) political leadership and commitment as well as clear direction from the Executive of AusAID (now the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)).\nIn developing the strategy, comprehensive consultations were undertaken with a wide range of stakeholders including people with disability in our partner countries, and their families.  This has reaped real benefits in terms of internal and external commitment to the strategy, as well as its relevance. \nEnsuring an active central role by people with disability is a guiding principle of the \nDevelopment for All\n strategy, and including people with disability in aid program decision making has contributed to more effective programming.  A \nDisability-Inclus\nive Development Reference Group was established in 2009 to provide\n \nhigh-level \nguidance on the\n implementation of the \nDevelopment for All\n strategy.  This Group includes \ninternational and Australian leaders in disability-inclusive development, several of whom themselves have a disability\n. \nMost recently, \nthe\n Australian Government \nannounced\n \non December\n \n3, 2013 \nthat\n a new disability\n-inclusive development\n strategy \nwould be prepared in 2014\n.  \nT\nhe \nfocus of the \nnew \nstrategy will \nbe consistent with \nAustralia’s \nbroader aid strategy to promote poverty reduction through sustainable \neconomic \ndevelopment by\n building skills, creating jobs and fostering economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region.\n \nIn addition to a strategic focus on our region, the Australian Government will also be strengthening performance measures and introducing rigorous benchmarks to make sure our aid program is delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible.\n&#xa0;\nA dedicated tea\nm\n in DFAT\n, the Disability Policy Section,\n \nprovides\n advice and guidance to staff in\n \nintegrating disability concerns into aid programs\n.  I\nn addition\n,\n \nregional specialist positions \nbased in \nFiji\n, to cover the Pacific\n \nregion;\n \nand Cambodia\n, to c\nover the Mekong and \nPhilippines;\n \nhave\n \nraised \nthe profile of disability-inclusive development in the\nir respective\n regions\n and are seen as a valuable resource by our country programs.\n  \nThe Department’s d\nisability-inclusive development focal points \nare \nstaff who \nhave \nvolunteer\ned\n to play an advocacy and advice role on disability-inclusive development issues within their team\ns\n, and who are trained and supported to play this role\n.  Around sixty focal points \nare located in \npolicy areas in \nCanberra and at 15 overseas posts.\nA series of guidance notes \nprovides policy direction for staff. \n \nGuidance notes finalised to date include \na\n \nhandbook for\n accessible design (with a focus on physical accessibility of the built environment) and \na note \non \ndisability-inclusion in \nsocial prot\nection programs.  W\nork\n is \nunderway on a disability-inclusive education note.  \nAustralian Government\n support to build the leadership skills of \ndisabled people’s organisations (\nDPOs\n)\n and people with disability,\n \nincluding \nthrough the Pacific Disability Forum, Disability Rights Fund and scholarships \nschemes\n,\n \nis\n assisting people with disability to advocate for greater inclusion of people with disability within their countries\n and to demonstrate the contributions that people with disability can make\n.  \nAustralia recognises that there is \nlimited evidence \ninternationally \non what works \nin relation to disability-inclusive development.  \nDFAT is\n assisting to build \nthe evidence base\n by supporting \nrelevant \nresearch.  \nThe lack of data on people with disability has also been regularly raised by our country programs as a barrier to getting governments to take this issue seriously.  We are looking at opportunities to support inclusion of questions on disability within upcoming censuses\n in partner countries\n, and are supporting work to improve internationally comparable data, such as through the World Health Organisation’s development of a model disability survey.\nThe interaction of efforts to prevent disability (for example, through activities which tackle avoidable blindness or clear land mines) with disability-inclusive development can be a sensitive issue.  In\n line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabil\nities, the Australian Government’s \nwork to promote disability-inclusive development \nis focused\n on improving the quality of life for people with existing disability, rather than \ndisability \nprevention activities.  Prevention of disability, while an important public health objective, is not the same as disability-inclusive development\n,\n and \nthere has been criticism of the \nDevelopment for All\n strategy from some stakeholders\n for \nits inclusion of prevention\n within a broader disability-inclusive development strategy.  \nTo respond to these concerns\n,\n prevent\nion\n activities\n have been managed\n outside of the Disability Policy Section since 2011, in health, infrastructure and mine action\n sections\n.  \nAustralia works closely with the UK on disability-inclusive development, including through the current secondment of a DFID officer to DFAT’s Disability Policy Section, for two years from July 2013.\nFurther information is available on the
