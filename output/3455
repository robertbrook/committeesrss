default&#xa0;
default“It has now been clarified that DPHs and their teams will provide public health expertise, advice and analysis to CCGs, HWBs and the NHS Commissioning Board; and this will be one of the mandated public health services that local authorities must commission or provide. However, this is not enough. The local DPH should be a member of the Board of each CCG. There should be a qualified public health professional on the NHS Commissioning Board; and the Board should routinely take advice from qualified public health professionals when commissioning decisions are being taken.”

default BMA members who work for PHE have expressed their concern that working for a civil service body has a significant impact on their ability to do their work. One doctor said that the regulations imposed by the civil service will “
defaultslowly strangle PHE to death
default.”
default 
defaultThe doctor gave as an example the way in which cancer screening reports that are normally sent out after a quality assurance visit are regulated by having all of the commentary removed. The reports are then placed on the civil service publications list (the Gateway) which can cause significant delays and extra work. The doctor felt that this process could result in these reports becoming simply a box-ticking exercise.
