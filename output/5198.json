"&#xa0;\nThe keeping of primates as pets - written evidence from the RSPCAThe RSPCA greatly welcomes this inquiry. Keeping primates as pets is an issue the Society feels very strongly about and on which it has campaigned for many years. This inquiry is timely given that Defra’s Code of Practice for the Welfare of Privately-Kept \nPrimates has been in place for almost three years and its effectiveness has yet to be reviewed. Due to the specialist, complex needs of primates and their capacity to suffer, the RSPCA believes that primates should not be kept as pets and that the current \nregulatory system is not working. Evidence shows that primates are easily obtained and somewhere in the region of 3,000-9,000 may be kept as pets in Great Britain. From the RSPCA’s experience, as well as that of specialist primate sanctuaries, welfare prob\nlems are widespread and serious. Regulations should be brought in to prohibit the keeping and trade of primates pets with the current population registered, and capped, to live out the rest of their lives with as high a level of welfare as possible.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDangerous Wild Animals Act (1976)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDefra Code of Practice for the Welfare of Privately-Kept Primates (‘Primate Code’)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n14 January 2014\n____________________\n[1] Defra\n (2009) Impact Assessment of the Code of Practice on the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Human Primates, 14 August 2009.\n[2] RSPCA &amp; Wild Futures (2012) Primates as Pets: Is there a case for regulation.
