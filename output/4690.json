Given the headteacher has been without a deputy headteacher or any senior leader for most of the autumn term her time has been too stretched. Lengthy and time-consuming meetings with parents, unions, sta\nff and external agencies have taken leaders’ and governors’ focus away from school improvement and building capacit\ny to improve within the school.\n&#xa0;\nLack of process / transparency in the selection process and criteria for the selection of sponsorsLack of coordination and planning – especially in relation to free schools and primary schools placesPoor treatment of school leaders during / immediately following conversionInaccurate information provided by the Department for Education, particularly in relation to sponsors and the school in their chains.
