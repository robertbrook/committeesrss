&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Paul Luton (CYS0086)&#xa0;Cycling Safety&#xa0;Please do not try to re-invent the wheel. There is widespread application of successful techniques in northern Europe and especially the Netherlands. Drivers, cyclists and pedestrians can all make mistakes and infrastructure should prioritise making such mistakes non-lethal. &#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Restrict through traffic to main roads. Shopping centres to be pedestrian priority with cycling and careful deliveries tolerated. Minor roads to be limited to 20mph.2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On main roads the provision of segregated cycling facilities as essential as the provision of footways. (This does not mean cycling on footways). 3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Main junctions should have clear separation of motor vehicles, cycles and pedestrians.4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  As different vehicles cause different degrees of danger a greater responsibility lies with the driver of a heavier vehicle. Some form of default liability operates in most European countries. Making cyclists default liable in collision with pedestrians might make this more palatable. 5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HGVs that are allowed into towns need to be designed to be able to operate safely in the presence of pedestrians and cyclists. &#xa0;&#xa0;You will have heard these ideas before â€“ please do not allow yourselves to be deflected into a futile blame-game between drivers and cyclists. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
