"&#xa0;\nAge Scotland (TIC 0003)\n&#xa0;\nWe received the notification of the Transport Committee’s inquiry into ‘Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities’.\n&#xa0;\n You may be aware that the Scottish Parliament’s Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee recently held an inquiry into community transport.\n&#xa0;\nAs part of our campaign, Still Waiting, Age Scotland has been lobbying for a review of the existing National Concessionary Travel scheme in order that this is made more widely available on community transport services.\n&#xa0;\n We submitted evidence to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee and, while we are aware that transport in Scotland is a devolved matter, we hoped that the findings of our research and the key questions which it raises may be of interest in your own investigation.\n&#xa0;\nA copy of Age Scotland’s submission to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee’s inquiry is available here.\n&#xa0;\nIf you have any questions in relation to this or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
