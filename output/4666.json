"&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAFS0073Written evidence submitted by the Local Government Association (LGA)&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;The LGA supports greater \nautonomy for schools as a way of driving up standards. We believe that giving frontline professionals the freedom to innovate and respond to the needs and priorities of local children and young people and their families will improve educational attainment \nand overall outcomes. We have called for greater devolution of power from the Government to councils and would not want to deny schools greater freedom.\n&#xa0;\nWe have encouraged councils to play a more strategic role and to work with all local schools\n, \nincludin\ng the in\ncreasing numbers of academies, \nto drive improvement; promote fair access; support pupils with Special Educational Needs; and ensure there are sufficient school places at a time of sharply increasing demand. Councils across the country have also sup\nported a greater role for school-to-school improvement in improving educational outcomes for children and young people\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, we have argued that\n,\n as schools are given more freedom, it becomes more important that they are effectively held to account a\nnd swift action is taken in the case of underperformance. As more schools take responsibility for their own admissions\n,\n it is also vital that admissions are fair, and seen to be fair, particularly for the most disadvantaged children and young people and th\nose with\n S\npecial \nEducational N\needs.\n&#xa0;\n1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0; \nCouncils \nalone \nhave \na legal responsibility \nto \nmake sure \nsufficient school places \nare provided to meet \nlocal need\n. The Education Funding Agency \n(EFA) \nestimates that an additional 417,000 primary school places will be needed over the lifetime of the current Parliament and councils face an enormous challenge in providing these places in time and with limited \ncapital resources. \nU\nntil now, the majority of places have been provided by expanding existing schools because this is the most cost-effective way of providing new places.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nHowever, as the room for expansions is exhausted, councils are concerned that the p\nrocess of building new schools will be hampered by the ‘academies presumption’ which places all the final decisions about new schools in the hands of the Secretary of State and \nDepartment for Education\n-approved academy sponsors. We believe this hampers eff\nective local decision-making and partnership working with schools and sponsors. In many cases\n,\n it is likely \nto override the input of local parents and local communities. It is not sustainable to continue to remove decision-making from councils in this way.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0; \nWe would like to see the restoration of decision-making on \nthe \nprovision of new schools to local level, as it was prior to the Academies Act 2011. \nCouncils need the flexibility to deliver whatever new type of school is required to fulfil their statutory \nduty to offer places and to contribute to the local education offer\n. \nThis \nmay\n include the option of establishing community schools if that is the locally preferred option. Where academies are the preferred option, decisions about sponsors should be taken locally to meet the needs and wishes of local parents and communities.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0; \nThe pr\nocess for establishing and funding free schools is completely outside the control of local councils, although councils are increasingly trying to engage potential free school sponsors to make sure that new schools are established in areas of need. \nThe Depa\nrtment for Education (DfE)\n have said that they are taking local need into account \nmore \nin making decisions about free schools. \nHowever, \nwe would like councils to be given a greater role in judging and approving free school proposals to \nensure \nthat new free\n schools are established where they are needed and in a way that supports councils in their place planning duties.\n  \n&#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands; and the functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level.&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0; \nCurrently there is a two-tier system of school accountability. Local councils have oversight of the performance and finances of maintained schools. They have powers to intervene in the case of underperformance and to direct them to take individual pupils t\no support local fair access protocols. However, they do not have these powers for academies – these rest with the Secretary of State for Education and \nthe \nEFA.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhis two-tier system might have been viable while there were low numbers of academies, \nhowever \nwe do not believe that the \nDfE\n has either the capacity or the local knowledge and connection to exercise effective oversight of standards and financial propriety in a situation where the majority of secondary schools and a growing number of primary schools\n are now academies.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe DfE’s recent adver\ntisements for \nRegional \nSchools \nCommissioners to exercise the Secretary of State’s powers in relation to underperforming academies are an acknowledgement that the current arrangements are no longer sustainable. How\never, we do not believe that th\ney\n \nare\n a sustainable long-term solution either. A region is too big an area to carry out detailed oversight of the performance and financial propriety of schools. If all 24,000 schools become academies, rather than the curren\nt 3,500, then a middle tier at the level of a council is likely to have to be re-introduced.\n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nWe believe that the R\negional \nCommissioners \nwill \nadd\n a new confusing layer of bureaucracy for parents\n. The regions covered by the Regional Commissioners do not alig\nn with the standard regions, and London will be split in three by the new regions, which will confuse parents who are familiar with the standard regions. \n Furthermore, i\nt is unlikely they \nwill \nbe able to raise their concerns about a local primary school wi\nth a\n R\negional \nCommissioner which\n might be hundreds of miles away, in the same way as they do with the local council. \nI\nt is unlikely that the \nR\negional \nCommissioner \nwill be able to deal with all the issues a parent is likely to raise – they are likely to hav\ne to refer them back to the \nEFA\n, the DfE or to the local council.\n2.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe Ofsted framework for inspection of council school improvement support, introduced in June 2013, makes clear that councils are expected to have a role in driving and supporting improvemen\nt in all local schools, including academies. In support of this, Ofsted point to Section 13A of the Education Act 1996. This places a duty on councils to exercise their relevant education functions with a view to promoting high standards. \n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0; \nWith the increasing number of academies, we do not think it is sustainable for oversight of, and intervention in, failing academies and free schools to rest with the Secretary of State or with regional bureaucrats. We do not believe it is reasonable for Of\nsted to hold councils accountable for performance in academies when they have no funding or powers in this area. \n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0; \nParents ask for clear accountability in order to ensure swift action when issues arise during their child's \none opportunity to get a good \nedu\ncation\n. The\n proliferation of different agencies with different areas of responsibility and improvement offers puts this at risk. Parents with concerns will be faced with dealing with local and national Ofsted offices, their local council, and \npotentially \na\n Regional School Commissioner\n. \nC\nouncils responding to their concerns may have to engage the DfE, the EFA, regional and national Ofsted and a Regional School Commissioner. This is not an efficient way of supporting improved standards.\n&#xa0;\n2.8.\n&#xa0; \nWe believe that counc\nils, as local champions of children and young people, their families and their communities\n,\n are best placed to provide the local oversight needed to continue to drive up standards and ensure that all children and young people have fair access to a good loc\nal school\n.  \nWe think that councils should have the same powers in relation to \nall\n local schools to intervene in cases of underperformance or designation in an Ofsted ‘category of concern’, including the power to select new academy sponsors.\n&#xa0;3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0; \nW\ne think academy chains will have an increasing role to play in the new school landscape \nw\nith the \ngrowing number of academies\n, \nparticularly in supporting school-to-school improvement and providing additional capacity for severely underperforming schools. However, if councils\n’\n improvement support to maintained schools \nis \nto be inspected by Ofsted, we th\nink academy chains should also be open to inspection \non \nthe support they provide for schools in their chain. \nIn addition, \nacademy chains, as proprietors, have too close an interest in their own schools to replace the current role of councils as champions o\nf children, young people and their families with statutory duties to promote high educational standards in their areas.\n&#xa0;4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply; and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0; \nWe are concerned that many primary schools are just too small to become stand-alone converter academies. We have called for a radical rewiring of public service\ns\n which will allow decision-making for public services to be brought together in one place. We argue that what people want more than anything else is for services to be built and integrated around the needs of children and their families, not around build\nings, institutions and wasteful bureaucracy. \nTherefore, \nwe do not believe that a fragmentation of the school sector into more than 24,000 separate public service units will promote value-for money in spending of public money, particularly if accountability\n lies with the Secretary of State \nfor Education or remote R\negional \nCommissioners\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0; \nMany primary schools rely heavily on the central services procured and provided by councils and would not have the desire\n or \ncapacity to negotiate a good deal for the taxp\nayer with other suppliers. \nOur concern is that too many primary schools lack the scale to provide efficiently the range of services that they need\n. \nOne solution is for smaller primary schools to federate \nwhich\n is likely to be a more sustainable arrangement than individual primary schools becom\ning\n academies.\n&#xa0;\n5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0; \nCouncils need the flexibility to make whatever arrangements are\n required to deliver improvement, engaging the resources of the local education community and outside support whether through a sponsored arrangement or a federation.  \nWe believe that federations, mergers and partnerships with other high-performing schools\n in an area offer an alternative to sponsored academy status, if that is the preference of governors, local parents and children.  \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n4\n&#xa0;\n See the LGA report on ‘the council role in school improvement’ (June 2013): \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/schools-and-education/-/journal_content/56/10171/4024029/ARTICLE-TEMPLATE\n \n Th\ne National Audit Of\nfice's \nreport, \nEstablishing Free Schools\n, \nhighlighted that \nexpenditure on the \nfree school\ns\n programme\n is over the \nsum orig\ninally allocated: \nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10314-001-Free-Schools-Book.pdf\n \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/campaigns/\n \n"
