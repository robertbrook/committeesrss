[[[SUMMARY]]]&#xa0;In this report I will briefly describe models of sponsorship for national electoral debates around the world, noting the pros and cons of each of the various institutional arrangements. I will also discuss the role of voters in general election debates and make recommendations for accommodating the public interest in planning and executing these events.&#xa0;

[[[BIOGRAPHICAL]]]&#xa0;I am the author of Presidential Debates: 50 Years of High-Risk TV (New York: Columbia University Press, 2008), a history of American presidential debates that will soon go into its third edition. Beyond my extensive scholarship about primary and general election debates in the USA, I also research and write about electoral debates around the world, including the 2010 debates between party leaders in the United Kingdom, the presidential debates of France and Spain, and various other candidate debates in Europe and Latin America. I am a professor in the School of Journalism at Northeastern University in Boston, a frequent media commentator, and a former television producer.&#xa0;

[[[NOTE]]]&#xa0;I am making this submission as an individual.&#xa0;

[[[INTRODUCTION]]]&#xa0;(1)              More than 50 years have passed since the original Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960, and in the decades since, an estimated 75 countries have incorporated televised debates into their national elections. Yet many of the same challenges that vexed debate planners in the era of John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon continue to vex planners of contemporary debates. Chief among them: how to balance the interests of voters with the interests of candidates in organizing and executing these high-profile, high-risk events.&#xa0;(2)              The experience of 1960 presaged the difficulty that would lie ahead, not only in the United States but around the world. That year a consortium of American television networks sponsored the four Kennedy-Nixon debates, yet it was representatives from the two campaigns who negotiated and determined such key points as format, schedule, number of events, in what manner questions would be posed, and by whom. Although the broadcasters had set up the pre-debate discussions, when it came time to hammer out details, campaign aides literally asked them to leave the room. To varying degrees this dismissive treatment of debate sponsors has persisted as the norm, with political handlers seizing the reins of an exercise whose live, unscripted nature strikes terror in the hearts of candidates and their advisors.&#xa0;(3)              It is understandable that the political pros would seek to carve out as much pre-debate influence as they can for themselves. Campaigns, especially those conducted at a national level, are risk-averse in the extreme. No matter the country, candidates and their staffs strive to control every aspect of political campaigns: photo ops, rhetoric, rallies, media relations, advertising, scheduling, and the like. By contrast, a live debate cannot be foreordained—which makes campaign advisors strive all the harder to establish safety nets. &#xa0;(4)              Where does this obsessive pursuit of control leave voters? As we look around the world for examples, we find that in too many instances the voice of the people goes unheard during the planning of debates. A central question about campaign debates ought to be: to whom do they belong? The answer, obvious though it may be, often gets overlooked. Debates belong not to the candidates who take part in them, nor to the media who stage and report them. Debates belong to the voters. &#xa0;(5)              So what is the proper mechanism for ensuring that voters’ interests are appropriately represented in pre-debate planning, not to mention the programs themselves? Let us focus on the matter of sponsorship. Debate sponsors, at least in theory, present a counterbalance to the self-interested priorities of the candidates and their staffs. This imbues sponsors with the vital responsibility of representing and advocating for the electorate.&#xa0;

[[[SPONSORSHIP OF ELECTORAL DEBATES AROUND THE WORLD]]]&#xa0;(6)              Internationally we can identify several models for debate sponsorship. These include:•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; News organizations, either individually or collectively.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Taxpayer-funded organizations.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Non-governmental organizations.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Independent commissions.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Academic institutions.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Other independent organizations.&#xa0;(7)              

[[[NEWS ORGANIZATIONS]]]: The most common type of debate sponsorship involves professional news organizations. Such was the case in the United Kingdom in 2010, in the United States in 1960, in party leader debates in Canada and Scandinavia, and in Germany’s chancellor debates. A frequent debate sponsor in Latin America has been the Spanish-language TV news network CNN en español, which partners with local broadcast entities to sponsor, produce, and televise candidate forums in the host country.&#xa0;(8)              The advantages of news media sponsorship are evident. For starters, debates are a form of television programming, and broadcast professionals know this turf better than anyone else. Media companies have a built-in incentive to connect with their audiences, not to mention an understanding of what those audiences need and want. Furthermore, news organizations are likely to enjoy a high level of institutional clout vis-à-vis political parties; this clout constitutes an important asset for any sponsor hoping to bring debates to fruition.&#xa0;(9)              But disadvantages exist as well. In their eagerness to “land” debates, media organizations may be overly acquiescent to the political professionals who seek to shape these events to their own advantage. Media outlets may view debates primarily as promotional vehicles for themselves, and only secondarily as vehicles for voter enlightenment. And television networks may see debates as an opportunity to showcase specific on-camera presenters; occasionally these individuals forget that it is the candidates, not the questioners, who are the rightful stars of the show. &#xa0;(10)              For these reasons a consortium of media outlets may be preferable to a single media sponsor. A consortium spreads responsibility among various players, enhances sponsorship clout, and reduces the possibility than any single network or personality will overwhelm the process. In Australia some leadership debates have been sponsored by the National Press Club, a journalistic association whose membership embraces both print and electronic media. This inclusion of journalists from a range of media further broadens the field of participants.&#xa0;(11)              

[[[TAXPAYER-FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS]]]: Presidential debates in Mexico are sponsored by the Instituto Federal Electoral (IFE), an autonomous agency funded by the national government and charged with overseeing various aspects of federal elections. IFE debates have not been without controversy: following a presidential debate in 2012, the agency had to issue an apology for featuring a scantily clad former Playboy model who became a social media sensation when she appeared onstage and handed out cards assigning the candidates their speaking order. IFE debates have also been criticized for their restrictive rules and lack of spontaneity.&#xa0;(12)              Debate sponsorship by taxpayer-funded governmental agencies remains an essentially Latin American phenomenon. In addition to Mexico, the autonomous Jurado Nacional de Elecciones (National Jury of Elections) mounted a 2011 presidential debate in Peru. In Costa Rica the 2014 presidential debates took place under the auspices of the Tribunal Supremo Electoral (Supreme Electoral Tribunal). Sponsorship of this type can be successful, as long as the agency in question has legitimacy in the eyes of the public, the campaigns, and the media.&#xa0;(13)              

[[[NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS]]]: In the United States the presidential debates of 1976, 1980, 1984 and the first debate of 1988 were sponsored by the League of Women Voters, a highly regarded, non-partisan civic organization with chapters throughout the country. Although the League did an admirable job navigating the tricky shoals of debate planning, the group lacked the power to stand up to demands by the campaigns. Prior to the first Reagan-Mondale debate of 1984, for instance, the two campaigns rejected 83 journalists proposed as panelists by the League of Women Voters, leading League officials to call a news conference denouncing the political handlers’ high-handedness. The lesson here is that civic organizations, however well intentioned, may simply lack the street-fighting skills required to deal with hard-bitten campaign professionals.&#xa0;(14)              In Latin America it is not unusual for presidential debates to be sponsored by business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with local media outlets. In Romania the non-governmental Institute for Public Policy sponsored presidential debates in 2009. Such arrangements may not be practical in larger countries.&#xa0;(15)              

[[[INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS]]]: In 1988 the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) began sponsoring general-election presidential debates in the United States, taking over from the beleaguered League of Women Voters. The CPD has produced every American presidential and vice presidential debate since--25 in all--with generally positive results. The original status of the CPD as a bi-partisan organization has changed; it now defines itself as non-partisan and therefore independent of party influence. &#xa0;(16)              With every election cycle, the CPD has bolstered its standing, gaining over time enough institutional clout to command respect and cooperation from the political establishment. In the past two rounds of debates, the candidates and their handlers have accepted most of the schedules, formats, and venues proposed in advance by the CPD. This favorable trend notwithstanding, the campaigns still negotiate among themselves, apart from the commission, and occasionally they demand changes that the CPD has little choice but to grant. The political pros also continue to seek alternatives to the commission as sole sponsor of American presidential debates, fearing that it has become too powerful.&#xa0;(17)              The CPD, a non-governmental agency that receives no taxpayer funds, has been criticized for being excessively beholden to the corporate interests who finance day-to-day operations and foot the bill for the quadrennial presidential and vice presidential debates. Although this criticism is not without validity, it should be noted that the CPD’s corporate affiliations have not adversely affected the debates themselves. And the commission has been transparent in disclosing the identities of its contributors.&#xa0;(18)              To its credit, the CPD has also heavily involved itself in voter education efforts, using presidential debates as a springboard for numerous election-related discussions and events across the U.S. Because American debates are usually held on college campuses, the CPD has actively involved students and faculty in the debate discussion. The CPD has also done a creditable job sharing its expertise with individuals in countries around the world in which electoral debates are being organized; the CPD’s work on this front has been of particular value in emerging democracies.&#xa0;(19)              Beyond the U.S., another example of an independent debate commission can be found in Jamaica, where the Jamaica Debates Commission (JDC) has done an excellent job laying the groundwork for party leaders’ debates in that country. The Jamaica Debates Commission, a partnership between the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce and an association of national media outlets, produced televised leadership debates in 2002, 2007, and 2011. A noteworthy byproduct of the JDC is a written manual for producing general election debates. Entitled “Facing the Electorate,” this detailed document perceptively and thoughtfully addresses the key issues surrounding the planning and execution of candidate debates.&#xa0;(20)              

[[[ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS]]]: Academic sponsorship of national electoral debates has been attempted primarily in Asia, with high-ranking university officials on occasion serving as moderators. Debates have also been staged by universities in Latin America and Europe, sometimes with a youth-oriented theme. Although these efforts are laudable, academic institutions typically lack the political gravitas to stand up to high-profile national political candidates. Furthermore, a university setting may orient debates too narrowly to younger voters, when the real focus needs to be on the wider electorate. Finally, academic institutions are not generally equipped to handle the technological challenges of delivering a live debate to a broad national audience.&#xa0;(21)              

[[[OTHER INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATIONS]]]: An interesting example in this category of sponsorship comes from Spain, where the Academia de las Ciencias y las Artes de Televisión (Academy of Television Arts and Sciences) has successfully produced the last two rounds of Spanish presidential debates in 2008 and 2011. Headed by a former journalist who moderated one of Spain’s original presidential debates in 1993, the Academia has done an especially good job of institutionalizing televised debates as a standard feature of Spanish national elections. Nonetheless, the political parties maintain an iron grip on such key debate details as format and topic areas, leaving little room for innovation or flexibility.&#xa0;

[[[INVOLVING VOTERS IN ELECTORAL DEBATES ]]]&#xa0;(22)              The popularity of electoral debates resonates worldwide. The United Kingdom’s first-ever party leaders’ debate in 2010 attracted nearly ten million viewers. In the United States presidential debates are usually the second highest-rated television programs of the year, outranked only by the powerhouse of Super Bowl football. The first Obama-Romney debate of 2012, for instance, drew an audience of more than 67 million. That same year’s face-à-face between French presidential contenders Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande attracted some 20 million viewers—nearly one third of France’s entire population. These numbers suggest that voters the world over find compelling reasons to watch debates. &#xa0;(23)              But the voting public deserves better than being relegated to spectator status, particularly in an age of participatory media. To best serve the needs of the electorate, debates must be organized and executed in a way that honors their importance to voters. This requires sponsors who acknowledge that televised debates belong first and foremost to the millions of individuals who go to the polls to elect national leaders.&#xa0;(24)              While it may not be practical to include voter representatives in pre-debate planning discussions, sponsors can find other ways of accommodating the public interest. For example:&#xa0;(25)              • 

[[[Soliciting public input]]]. In advance of negotiations, debate sponsors should seek input from interested members of the public on such points as subject matter, format, number and timing of debates. These details are too important to be entrusted solely to the politicians.&#xa0;(26)              • 

[[[Creating an advisory board made up of voters]]]. Beyond general public input, sponsors should consider a more established mechanism for citizen involvement in debates. An advisory board would formalize the relationship between debate sponsors and the voters they ostensibly serve.&#xa0;(27)              • 

[[[Taking advantage of debate scholarship]]]. Throughout the world an impressive body of research has been collected about the relationship between voters and debates. Although much of this scholarship is country-specific, many of the lessons transcend national borders. Debate planners should acquaint themselves with this research and seek appropriate guidance from international experts in the field.&#xa0;(28)              • 

[[[Keeping the public informed about behind-the-scenes negotiations]]]. At minimum voters ought to be aware of the mechanics of any pre-debate discussions. In 2010 the public release of the infamous 76 rules governing the British prime ministerial debates provoked ridicule in the press, but it did allow viewers to know the rules before the game commenced. In other countries—the U.S., for example—the agreements that emerge from pre-debate negotiations are usually kept under wraps.&#xa0;(29)              • 

[[[Choosing voter-friendly formats]]]. One of the best methods of ensuring voter involvement in debates is to include voters in the questioning. The town hall format favored in the 2010 UK debates proved to be an effective way of incorporating citizen participation in an otherwise candidate-centric exercise. The so-called YouTube format, tested in the USA and New Zealand, puts a technological twist on the town hall by allowing voters to submit questions recorded on video. Sponsors should explore other innovative formats that accentuate public participation.&#xa0;(30)              • 

[[[Developing voter education efforts in connection with debates]]]. Sponsors of electoral debates should approach the events as a starting point for political engagement, rather than an end unto themselves. Debate reporting in the press is likely to emphasize theatrical moments and candidate performances, but sponsors and their affiliates can use the opportunity to involve voters in more substantive conversations before, during, and after each telecast. The rise of social media creates a perfect opportunity to apply innovative approaches to such discussions.&#xa0;

[[[CONCLUSION]]]&#xa0;(31)              No ideal system exists for producing televised electoral debates. Inevitably the high-minded goals of voter enlightenment come up against hard political reality, making these events singularly difficult to execute. Nonetheless, history shows that debates function best when a strong, independent sponsorship model is in place.&#xa0;(32)              Debate sponsors face a daunting challenge, for they must answer to a triple constituency: the public, the press, and the political establishment. For this reason a freestanding commission may offer the most advantageous model. The U.S.’s Commission on Presidential Debates stands as a positive, time-tested example, not only because it operates independently of political parties and the media, but because it places voter education as its central objective.&#xa0;(33)              It should be noted that while the CPD acts as sponsor of American presidential debates, the production of the actual telecasts is assigned on a rotating basis to the major commercial news networks. The television networks provide personnel, equipment, and technical expertise, and the CPD provides content. In this partnership we find another potential model for sponsorship: a hybrid between an independent commission and established broadcast networks. Each side has something to offer the other; together they gain clout.&#xa0;(34)              In the final analysis no sponsor can expect to achieve instant credibility or to fully wrest control away from the candidates and their protectors. The CPD has been producing American presidential debates since 1988, and only in the past couple of election cycles has it been able to proactively set terms. Realistically, any institution designed to represent the public interest in debate planning will need time to earn the trust of voters—not to mention journalists and campaign professionals. &#xa0;(35)              In the United Kingdom, where only a single round of leadership debates has taken place, the institutionalization of debates in national elections has only just begun. The House of Lords Communications Committee is to be commended for initiating this discussion at a moment when the organization of general election debates remains very much a work in progress. As one of the last leading democracies to stage debates, the U.K. is well positioned to benefit from the experience of other countries in which debates have long been part of the landscape. The fundamental question being posed here—how to ensure that the public interest is of primary concern in setting up general debates?—is absolutely the right thing to be asking.&#xa0;&#xa0;7 January 2014&#xa0;
