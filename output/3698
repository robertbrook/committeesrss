[normal]Submission[bold] [bold]from[bold] [bold]Dr[bold] [bold]Pauline[bold] [bold]Ashbridge[bold]&#xa0;[bold]As a present
[normal] complainant
[normal], I am currently awaiting the result of a Review by the LGO's new Assessment team of their decision 
[normal]not
[normal] to pass on my Complaint (and similar complaints by others) against a council to the LGO's Investigation team.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This perspective will, I hope, be 
[normal]useful
[normal]  As the Review result is not yet known, my comments cannot be unduly influenced by an adverse decision. Secondly, the July 2012 Report summary says: "During this period of 
[normal]cha
[normal]nge it is 
[normal]essentia
[normal]l that the LGO 
[normal]kee
[normal]ps 
[normal]a
[normal] close eye on the 
[normal]eff
[normal]ects of the
[normal] 
[normal]changes on those using its services 
[normal]a
[normal]nd on its staff."  As this Enquiry is reviewing these LGO
[normal] 
[normal]changes, comments by someone currently "using its services", will be relevant,  l hope.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As the committee  does not examine details of individual cases, I shall avoid these as much as possible. I am an historian and a retired lecturer in business management and public administration. l was one of 18 or 19 individuals 
[normal](not
[normal] an 
[normal]organisation
[normal], and 
[normal]otherw
[normal]ise 
[normal]unk
[normal]n
[normal]own
[normal] to each 
[normal]oth
[normal]er) who
[normal] 
[normal]submitted similar  but separate complaints to the London Borough of Barnet about serious maladministration in the decision-making processes that 
[normal]l
[normal]ed to approval of an application to enclose 
[normal]a five
[normal]-ward multicultural area within 
[normal]an
[normal] 
[normal]Eru
[normal]v
[normal] religious boundary.
[normal] Th
[normal]e council  
[normal]rejecte
[normal]d the complaints and advised each person about the Ombudsman service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have linked my remarks below to recent and present Enquiries into the LGO
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The new Assessment Unit
[normal] structure is placing too much (almost unaccountable) power
[normal] in the hands of individuals. 
[normal]Their brief is to filter OUT (not 
[normal]filter in). 
[normal]Success is measured by the
[normal] proportion of cases re
[normal]jected at this first stage (as the LGO's statistics and commentaries show).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many cases must hav
[normal]e been unreasonably rejected. 
[normal]I myself would have given up at this ea
[normal]rly stage if it had not been fo
[normal]r a number of exceptional factors:
[normal] 
[normal]the mass of hard evidence o
[normal]f maladministration available i
[normal]n the form
[normal] of Planning Committee papers;
[normal] 
[normal]F.o.l
[normal]. access to objecti
[normal]ons submitted to the council; t
[normal]he availability on-line of a 
[normal]film of the Planning Committee meeting (fil
[normal]ming p
[normal]ermitted
[normal] by the 
[normal]council
[normal]);  the repetition of
[normal] 
[normal]unmistakable
[normal] 
[normal]maladministration in a 
[normal]neighboring
[normal] similar 
[normal]Eruv
[normal] application three weeks later.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a former journalist (newspaper reporter) as well as a retired lecturer in public administration, I was also in a position to 
[normal]un
[normal]de
[normal]rstand t
[normal]hat commen
[normal]ts by members of the public as t
[normal]hey left the council meeting- "It's a done deal
[normal]!"; "A travesty!"- were justifie
[normal]d.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Su
[normal]stained by these factors, and also by the knowledge that other (well-qualified) residents were similarly indignant at Barnet Council's maladministration, I have been able to persist d
[normal]espite the Assessment Unit's ne
[normal]gative targets. Many other compla
[normal]inants will not have been so fortunate
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The following are[bold] examples of "filtering-out" [bold]methods[bold] employed by the Assessment Unit "i[bold]nv[bold]est[bold]igator" allocated to my case. I am calling him "M" the first lett[bold]er of his surname):[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"M" insisted 
[normal]that he a
[normal]lone was dealing with my case, and this was 
[normal]emphasised
[normal] by several other staff in Coventry and at Millbank, London, to whom I spo
[normal]ke from time to time. 
[normal]"M" appeared to claim owner
[normal]ship of the case, and clearly ob
[normal]jected when (unusually) one person on the staf
[normal]f passed on to him a substantiat
[normal]ed criticism 
[normal]I made.
[normal] "M" would perhaps claim he was exercising legitimate "independent 
[normal]judgment
[normal]" -however ill-informed that might be.
[normal] I was able, probably because of
[normal]my past j
[normal]ournalistic experience, to pers
[normal]ist in contacting other people, but many complainants would hesitate to do this and would accept rejection of their viable case at a very early stage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Both of these 
[normal]standard filtering-out grounds
[normal] were combined by "M" as his reason for rejecting
[normal] what 
[normal]was potentially a major case of malad
[normal]ministration by a council, with
[normal] indisputable evidence in
[normal] the council's own published docu
[normal]ments. I 
[normal]would ask to what extent, if any, he was req
[normal]uired, as an "investigator" in the 
[normal]Assessment
[normal] Unit, t
[normal]o examine the actual evidence? 
[normal]Is 
[normal]it simply a tick-box approach: 
[normal]finding, metaphorically or actually, a box to tick, 
[normal]and t
[normal]hen moving on to the next 
[normal]case
[normal]?
[normal](See also: 
[normal]LGO’s Progress Report, 1 Oct 2013: “We have introduced a clear template for our decision statements… format clearly identifies the evidence and any other consideration that we have relied on in reaching a decision.” Does that template support over-rapid “filtering” of cases?)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I recei
[normal]ved a standard letter fr
[normal]om Dr. Jane Martin, Ombudsman, inviting me to an advisory Forum in Coventry, to include members of
[normal] 
[normal]the public who had used the service in the last six months.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Interested persons had to send "a short statement, of no more than 500 words, explaining why you
[normal] wou
[normal]ld like to be involved and details of any other rel
[normal]evant experience you have...
[normal] Decisions on
[normal] who will be appointed to the fo
[normal]rum will be based solely upon the statement".
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I did not respond 
[normal]because it seemed to me to be an
[normal] ina
[normal]ppropriate invitation.
[normal] People who were critical of the service might clearly wish to attend- but the choice of participants would be, it seems, in the hands of the 
[normal]organisation
[normal] they wished to 
[normal]criticise
[normal]. A more informative and open
[normal] met
[normal]hod might
[normal] 
[normal]be a questionnaire sent
[normal] 
[normal]after
[normal] completion of 
[normal]each
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]ase: whether rejected or supporte
[normal]d by 
[normal]the
[normal] LGO.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These goals will only be 
[normal]realisable
[normal] if the summary statements are produced with demonstrable integrity and understanding.
[normal]              
[normal]"M" produced an unbalanced "
[normal]final
[normal] decision statement", as follows:
