In 2013 fewer disadvantaged White British pupils were at a good level of development in all prime areas plus literacy and maths (25%) than their non-disadvantaged peers (35.1%).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure One&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                   \n     Source: \nLA \nRAISE Online, 2013\nKey Stage1\nLocally overall performance at the \nend of Key \nS\ntage 1 is below national\n.\n \nIn \n2012\n the percentage of \nKey S\ntage 1 \nWhite British boys eligible for \nf\nree school \nm\neals\n \n(FSM) who attained\n level 2b or above was 61\n% for reading\n,\n compared\n to 74\n% locall\ny or 76% nationally (15%\n gap)\n.\n \nThe corresponding figure for writing was \n42\n% compared\n to\n 62% locally and 64\n% nationally\n (2\n2%) gap\n. \nIn\n \nm\nathematics 67\n% of FSM White British boys attaine\nd level \n2b o\nr\n above \ncompared to the\n LA \naverage \nof 74% and the national figure of 76\n% (9% gap) as shown in Figure One.\n \nAlthough these outcomes mark a clos\ning of\n the gap on \nprevious performance, White British disadvantaged boys perform below their peers and below the ou\ntcomes for White \nBritish girls\n except in \nm\nathematics.\n \n‘Low\n \noutcomes at th\ne end of K\ney \nS\ntage\n 1 influence attainment outcomes at the end of subsequent key stages.’ \n(S.Welford\n, \nEducation Performance Summary\n, 2012\n).\nFive-year performance data \noutlining\n the percentage of pupils achieving expected progress in \nr\neading\n, \nw\nriting and \nm\nathematics shows \nW\nhite British boys pe\nrforming consistently below the LA average and below girls in \nr\neading and writing although \nnarrowing \nth\ne gap in 2013. In mathematics White British boys have shown an upwards \ntrajectory,\n narrowing the gap with LA averages and performing better than girls. \nProgress outcomes\n for the White British disadvantaged group as a whole over a five year period show cons\nistently lo\nwer performance than their non-\ndisadvantaged peers and the LA average\ns\n in \nr\neading,\n \nw\nriting and \nm\naths\n as shown in Figures Two, Three and Four. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Figure Two&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n                             \nSource : \nDatanet, Leicester 2013\nFigure Three&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                       \n \n&#xa0;\n \n                                \nSource : \nDatanet, Leicester, 2013\nFigure Four&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                           \nSource:\n \nDatanet,\n \nLeicester,\n \n2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAt Key S\ntage 2 \nthe\n performance of White British pupils\n \nis a\n concern. \nThe five year trend of the performance in \nr\neadin\ng, \nw\nriting and \nm\naths from 2009\n-13 shows a consistent gap in performance between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged\n White \nBritish pupils\n \noverall.\n \nIn 2013 the gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged\n White British pupils was 16\n% for\n reading, 17% for writing and 15% for Maths.\n \nIn 2012 \n84% \nof FSM\n \nWhite British \nboys made expected progress \nin English \ncompared to 89% \nof pupils nationally. Although this was an improvement on last year’s progress in English for FSM pupils (73%)\n,\n it still fell short of the LA percentage of 91% and the FSM White British girls’ \npercentage of\n 88% (Figure Five).\n \nEqually\n,\n White disadvantaged b\noys perform less well than the\nir peers nationally for Level 4\n+ in English and \nMaths. Therefore\n, when the White British group is considered as a whole\n,\n \nboth girls and boys perform less well than their peers nationally and boys perform less well than girls o\nverall (S.Welford\n,\n \nEducation Performance Summary\n, \n2012\n).\n Figure Five                                                                                &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                                                        \nSource: \nRAISEonline at 10 September 201\nIn 2012 there was a notable \ndifference between\n the percentage of \nWWC\n boys on FSM making expected progress in English (41%) when compared to their peers (70%) and to national (67%) and local (71%) \npercentages. White\n working class girls’ expected progress in English in 2012 (57%) equally fell short of that of their peers\n (81\n%) and \nof local and national\n percentages. In Maths, the percentages for expected progress were of even greater concern with only 37% of White British boys \neligible for\n FSM making expected progress compared to 58% of non-disadvantaged boys and 62% of pupils\n at LA level and 68% of pupils nationally. For White girls in receipt of FSM the figure was 41%.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe gap in attainme\nnt increases across the Key stages and by 19 it is significant.\n Prior attainment at Key S\ntage 4 impacts on student performance at Key stage 5.\n \nAt Key Stage 5 females attain consistently better than males and White British males are amongst the groups that \nconsistently perform\n \nless well\n. \nFor one very large group of Leicester young people – White boys – almost one half fail to attain Level Two by age 19 after\n five\n years of secondary education and, for many, a further three years in post-16 education and train\nin\ng \nThe future for these under-attaining groups is bleak\n, risking unemployment and low paid work.\n(\n \nA.Suddaby, \nThe Leices\nter 13-19 P\nartnership board,19 January 2012\n).\n&#xa0;\nStudents will not improve their attainment\n if they are not participating in the education and training system available. In August 2013 13.2% of White British students were NEET. Such pupils who already had low attainment at Key Stage 4 will fall further behind peers the longer the\ny remain NEET (A\n.Suddaby, 2012)\n.\n&#xa0;\nDifferent progression \nand repetition \nrates are exhibited by different ethnic groups\n which impact on their attainment at 19\n. \n90% of Asian females who attain level 2 at 16 progress directly to a level 3 qu\nalification whereas only approximately 50% of White males do so\n. \nInstead\n,\n a\n higher number of White males repeat level 2 qualifications post-16\n (most often by studying a vocational qualification)\n,\n \ndelaying their entry to level 3 and \n thus  reducing \nthe pote\nntial of attaining this level by the age of 19 (\nA.\nSuddaby, 2012 - \nsee Figure Six).\n \nTwo thirds \nof Asian females who attain Level One at 16 progress to Level Two.  Conversely, only about 20% (one in five) White males make this progression\n,\n with four out of f\nive remaining at Level One\n (A.Suddaby,\n \n2012)\n.  \nFigure Six&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nH\naving started behind, White British males \nfall further behind their peers over the course of their three years between 16 and 19.  The outcome is that almost a half of the young people \nin \n2010 \nfailed\n to attain even a Level Two after up to 14 years in t\nhe education system (A.Suddaby\n, 2012\n).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere are a number of factors that impact on pupils’ attainment.\n Non-attendance at school either by choic\ne or because of exclusions will impact \non learning and subsequently on attainment. Excl\nusi\nons data for the White g\nroup of which \nWhite British is a large subset shows that generally this group is more likely to be excluded from school than other \nethnicities. \n2012 to\n 2013 data shows \nthat, of\n the population of pupils excluded from school, b\noys\n \nare more likely to be excluded whatever the \nethnicity and\n White female FSM have higher numbers of exclusions when compared to all other ethnicities’ cumulative \ndat\na.\n              \nIt is no coincidence that the lowest performing schools in Leicester are in \nthe west of Leicester.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Responses from local schools suggest\n programmes to raise aspirations, improve self-esteem as well as academic intervention\n.  \nApproaches used include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
