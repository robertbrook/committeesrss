[normal]Homeless Link
[normal] (HL)
[normal] is the national umbrella organisation for frontline homelessness charities in England. Currently we have more than 500 member organisations
[normal]. As the collaborative hub for information and debate on homelessness, we seek to improve services for homeless peo
[normal]ple and to advocate for policy change. Through this work, we aim to end homelessness in England
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are delighted to respond to this consultation
[normal] which poses critical questions for the future funding and sustainability of support costs in housing
[normal]. Most of
[normal] our response will cover areas specific to single homelessness although at points we address wider issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PART A – Introduction to the Current Funding of Support in Homelessness Provision [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1) Homelessness hostels and supported housing projects are curr
[normal]ently funded by two main sources. The first is Housing Benefit (HB) which pays for both core rents and housing management costs where clients are not working or are on a low income. Because of the extra running costs of this type of provision, the level of
[normal] HB is not usually capped by Local Housing Allowance (LHA) Rates. However, the amount of HB councils will pay and the subsidy they can receive back from central government will vary depending on the status of the provider of the accommodation. 
[normal]2) The Gove
[normal]rnment’s current plan is to phase-out HB by the end of 2017. At which point the costs currently met by HB will have had to transfer to Universal Credit (UC) unless an alternative funding approach has been developed by then. Ministers have stated publicly t
[normal]hat their intention is to move to a “localised solution” by then
[normal]. Our thoughts on this overall approach are outlined in 
[normal]P
[normal]ar
[normal]t C
[normal] of this submission
[normal].
[normal]3) Prior to
[normal] around
[normal] 2003, Housing Benefit was also used to fund support in homelessness projects. However, at that point the Supporting People (SP) programme was introduced to pay for “housing-related support” and HB was limited to the areas identified in paragraph 1. SP was
[normal] paid through a “ring-fenced grant” to councils based on levels of local need
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]4) The 
[normal]activities that were included
[normal] under the heading “housing related support” and therefore eligible for funding under SP was varied
[normal]:
[normal] - life and social skills
[normal];
[normal] managing debt
[normal]s
[normal];
[normal] budgeting
[normal];
[normal] applying for benefits
[normal];
[normal] resettlement support
[normal];
[normal] understanding bills
[normal];
[normal] developin
[normal]g
[normal] support networks
[normal];
[normal] activities promoting training, education and employment within the community
[normal];
[normal] and helping individuals deal with other agencies 
[normal]including
[normal] health and
[normal] advice services. 
[normal]5) In 2009 the “ring-fence” was removed from the SP budget. 
[normal]With
[normal] local authorities 
[normal]facing
[normal] year-on-year cuts in Formula Grant
[normal],
[normal] many have 
[normal]made disproportionate cuts to their SP budgets with homelessness services facing reduction
[normal]s
[normal] to funding as
[normal] high as 81%
[normal] and even 100%
[normal]. 
[normal]This has already led to the loss of vital support in many areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6) Despite the Government stating in 2010 they were committed to ensuring 
[normal]‘
[normal]expenditure is focused on protecting the quality of the key frontline se
[normal]rvices…that provide support to the worst off in society
[normal],
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]the reality for homelessness services has 
[normal]been the opposite. In 2012-13 alone 47% of frontline homelessness agencies saw reductions in SP funding, the latest in a number of years of swing
[normal]e
[normal]ing cuts
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7) The impact of these cumulative resource reductions is clearly being felt on the frontline
[normal], with services focused on employment, substance misuse and resettlement all been reduced. Nearly half of homelessness services are doing less work with complex needs clients, who are amongst the most vulnerable and marginalised citizens
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8) 
[normal]At the same
[normal] time
[normal] key indicators show homelessness increasing. 
[normal]2013
[normal] National Street Count 
[normal]Figures
[normal] show an increase of 31% compared to 2011
[normal]. The number of homeless people in B&amp;B has gone-up by 50% in two years
[normal]. Homelessness 
[normal]acceptances
[normal] 
[normal]by 
[normal]councils have reached their highest numbers 
[normal]for five years
[normal] 
[normal]. O
[normal]ver half of applicants 
[normal]to councils 
[normal]do 
[normal]not meet
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]s
[normal]tatutory homelessness thresholds for accommodation. This leaves many individuals entirely reliant upon the services provided by our members
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]      
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PART B - Recent Benefit Changes and Their Impact[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Whil
[normal]st
[normal] we outline the impact of individual changes, we urge the Committee to also consider the cumulative impact of
[normal] all of
[normal] these on individuals’ lives.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Benefit [bold]Sanctions[bold]9) Our recent research
[normal] showed the devastating impact the Government
[normal]’
[normal]s new sanction regime introduced in October 2012 is having on vulnerable people. 85% of homelessness organisations reported an increase in 
[normal]the number of
[normal] 
[normal]Job Seekers’ Allowance (
[normal]JSA
[normal])
[normal] clients 
[normal]sanctioned, 
[normal]and 65% an increase in in 
[normal]Employment Support Allowance (
[normal]ESA
[normal])
[normal] clients sanctioned.
[normal]11) Homeless people live in
[normal] daily
[normal] poverty. Our research has shown that the withdrawal of benefits, for even one month, can lead individuals into rent arrears, food poverty and
[normal] crime. Although 
[normal]we
[normal] understand 
[normal]the 
[normal]DWP is trying to encourage behaviour change we cannot believe the
[normal]ir
[normal] intention is to disproportionately punish vulnerable people in this way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Extension of the Shared Accommodation Rate [bold](SAR) [bold]to 25-34 year olds [bold]12) 
[normal]According to our members, the extension of the Shared Accommodation Rate is having a very negative effect on the ability of young homeless people to access accommodation.
[normal]13) Research we undertook in London found that only 5.5%
[normal] of 
[normal]properties
[normal] were afforda
[normal]ble 
[normal]under the
[normal] SAR and most of these would be 
[normal]un
[normal]available to people on benefits. Other private intelligence we received has found this is also a problem in 
[normal]many other parts of the country.
[normal]   
[normal]14) Sharing accommodation may particularly be an unsafe option fo
[normal]r some young vulnerable people who maybe prone to exploitation or find living with older strangers difficult. 
[normal]Very few 
[normal]other parts of the benefits system 
[normal]treat
[normal] 1
[normal]8
[normal] and 34 year olds identically. 
[normal]15) Whilst there is an exemption from the SAR for 25-34 year olds who have been in a homeless hostel for 3 months, the information we have received is that it neither covers a wide enough range of vulnerable people, nor is it functioning effectively.   
[normal]Re[bold]ductions in Local Housing Allowance (LHA)[bold]1
[normal]6
[normal]) Although it is almost impossible to isolate the impact of LHA reductions from other benefit changes we believe data shows it is having an impact. 
[normal]R
[normal]ecent statutory figures show that the number of people approach
[normal]ing their 
[normal]council
[normal] as a result of homelessness due to the end of shorthold tenancies now accounts for 27% of all acceptances.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]1
[normal]7
[normal]) 27% is the highest ever recorded figure and is an increase of nearly a third from 2012 and over two-thirds from 2011. We believe the most likely explanation for this 
[normal]huge rise
[normal] is landlords no longer wishing to let properties to people on benefits as they
[normal] can
[normal] expect
[normal] rent at higher levels 
[normal]from
[normal] non-claimants.
[normal]The Abolition of Community Care Grants[bold] (CCGs)[bold] and Crisis Loans [bold]1
[normal]8
[normal]) The localisation of these two elements of the Social Fund has created a patchwork of assistance across England. Some 
[normal]councils
[normal] have not introduced any replacement programme and 
[normal]many which have
[normal] 
[normal]require
[normal] a residency qualification. 
[normal]I
[normal]ndividuals who are transitory may not have a provable connection with any area.
[normal]19
[normal]) Ministers have stated that individuals on benefits will have 
[normal]to
[normal] “live
[normal] in housing they could afford
[normal]“
[normal] even if this involves relocating. 
[normal]CCGs
[normal] and Crisis Loans 
[normal]a
[normal]re a crucial tool for helping individuals to move to cheaper properties. Unfortunately
[normal] our
[normal] members 
[normal]report 
[normal]that individuals wanting to move to areas with lower rents 
[normal]of
[normal]ten 
[normal]fail the local connection test for assistance. 
[normal]2
[normal]0
[normal]) This change threatens Government’s cross-departmental “No Second Night Out”
[normal] (NSNO)
[normal] initiative which is premised on new rough sleepers, where appropriate, being placed into affordable parts of the Private Rented Sector
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Impact of the Benefit Cap and the Abolition of the Spare Room Subsidy/Bedroom Tax[bold]2
[normal]1
[normal]) Until the question of exem
[normal]pt accommodation is resolved (see paragraph 26), it is unclear to what extent these policies will impact upon single homeless people living in hostels or supported housing. 
[normal]2
[normal]2
[normal]) The Benefit Cap could affect vulnerable individuals living in high-support hou
[normal]sing projects where HB rates are above the norm because of levels of housing management required. 
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal]) Our members 
[normal]inform
[normal] us that 
[normal]i
[normal]ncrease
[normal]d
[normal] demand for smaller properties created by the Bedroom Tax is making it harder to resettle people from hostels. In a few areas single homeless people living in two-bedroomed “hard-to-let” social housing are being hit by the Bedroom Tax and face arrears. Iro
[normal]nically
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]any move will be in
[normal]to 
[normal]t
[normal]he more 
[normal]expensive private rented sector as there are no 
[normal]local 
[normal]one-bedroomed social sector flats available. 
[normal]Universal Credit[bold] (UC)[bold] and Exempt Accommodation[bold]2
[normal]4
[normal])
[normal] HL
[normal] welcome
[normal]s
[normal] the Government’s commitment to simplify 
[normal]the benefits 
[normal]system a
[normal]nd address punitive withdrawal rates. However, the actual structure of UC presents numerous problems for services working with vulnerable and/or transitory individuals. Our concerns cannot be detailed here because of space 
[normal]but 
[normal]were documented in 
[normal]our previous submission to the Social Security Advisory Committee
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2
[normal]5
[normal]) We welcome Ministers 
[normal]previous 
[normal]commit
[normal]ment
[normal] before the Committee to protect homelessness services from the unintended consequences of UC
[normal].
[normal]  The mechanism chosen to do this in this was an
[normal] “opt-out” to Universal Credit Housing Costs for “Exempt Accommodation”.  Unfortunately, exempt accommodation is a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]old 
[normal]legal status not offer
[normal]ing
[normal] the intended protection 
[normal]to
[normal] approximately 
[normal]half 
[normal]of homelessness services. In April 2013 Lord Freud 
[normal]publicly
[normal] comm
[normal]itt
[normal]ed
[normal] to resolv
[normal]ing this problem
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal]6
[normal]) 
[normal]We
[normal] ha
[normal]ve
[normal] worked with DWP officials and other key stakeholders in trying to find a “cost neutral” answer. At the current time, a resolution appears likely which will protect most services and we appreciate the 
[normal]opportunity 
[normal]to have been involved in this process. 
[normal]2
[normal]7
[normal]) However, we do need to highlight the huge levels of
[normal] ongoing
[normal] concern this issue 
[normal]created 
[normal]amongst frontline agencies and local authorities alike. 
[normal]Impact of All HB Changes on Accessing Private Rented Sec[bold]tor[bold] (PRS)[bold] Accommodation[bold]2
[normal]8
[normal]) Homelessness organisations have spent many years fostering relationships with private landlords and creating services which prepare clients to live in private sector housing. 
[normal]M
[normal]any of the current changes
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] undermining that work.  
[normal]29
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]As LHA reduces
[normal],
[normal] the areas available for homeless people to live reduce and they are in competition with other individuals seeking PRS accommodation.
[normal] It seems the impact of changes 
[normal]will be
[normal] to force people to move from expensive
[normal] rental areas to cheaper parts of the country
[normal]. If this trend continues
[normal] there is likely to be further
[normal] population movements 
[normal]of benefit claimants into
[normal] areas of 
[normal]already 
[normal]high unemployment
[normal] and deprivation
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal]0
[normal]) We are concerned that tenants leaving exempt accomm
[normal]odation, who tend to have support needs, will not be attractive to private sector landlords who may already be 
[normal]put off rent arrears
[normal] risk
[normal]s
[normal]. Despite huge amounts of support in the Direct Payment Demonstration Projects, 
[normal]arrears
[normal] levels have risen
[normal].
[normal] We note that all tenants in Northern Ireland will b
[normal]e able
[normal] to have UC Housing Costs paid directly to the landlord
[normal].
[normal] We recommend that people leaving supported accommodation elsewhere should also have this option.
[normal]Discretionary Housing Payment[bold] (DHP)[bold]3
[normal]1
[normal]) Min
[normal]isters’ general response to concerns around the cuts in HB 
[normal]involves
[normal] 
[normal]highlight
[normal]ing
[normal] DHP
[normal] increases
[normal]. However, these cover
[normal] only
[normal] a fraction of the savings, and tend to be 
[normal]aimed by councils at people who can realistically change their housing situation or who would be statutorily homeless if they lost their accommodation.      
[normal]Housing Costs [bold]for[bold] Nightshelters &amp; Emergency Winter Prov[bold]ision[bold]3
[normal]2
[normal]) “Severe Weather Emergency Protocol” (SWEP) provision is basic life-saving shelter made available to individual
[normal]s
[normal] who are rough sleeping when the temperature 
[normal]reaches
[normal] dangerous levels
[normal].
[normal] Our research 
[normal]fo
[normal]und that around 
[normal]30%
[normal] of this provision receives HB. 
[normal]3
[normal]3
[normal]) However, 
[normal]following
[normal] a recent tribunal judgment in Anglesey it may be that much of th
[normal]is
[normal] SWEP accommodation is no longer eligible for HB. This could potentially leave thousands of homeless people at risk of death on the streets in freezing temperatures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Part C- The Future of Funding Of Support in Homelessness Provision[bold]3
[normal]4
[normal]) 
[normal]Homelessness and 
[normal]housing-related support services deliver cost savings to public service budgets and better outcomes for vulnerable people. The more services can support people to move away from homelessness and towards independent living, the more they can reduce their ex
[normal]pensive use of public services, and so be more cost efficient
[normal].
[normal] Without the support from homelessness services, more people would end up sleeping rough and 
[normal]using costly services
[normal].
[normal] It is critical that a longer term strategy is developed which recognises the
[normal] investment needed to achieve these longer term savings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]5
[normal]) 
[normal]As outlined 
[normal]in 
[normal]Part A, the Government’s short-term intention is to try and keep housing costs for homelessness projects outside of UC whilst a “localised solution” is developed. We envisage this
[normal] meaning that funding of housing management costs in homelessness services will no longer be administered through DWP, instead being devolved to councils or 
[normal]an
[normal]other body.  
[normal]3
[normal]6
[normal]) This would align Housing Management costs with the funding of support which is already the responsibility of council. It could also draw a line under a twenty-year debate as to 
[normal]how 
[normal]support
[normal]ed 
[normal]housing should be primarily funded. However, despite this obvio
[normal]us appeal of this approach to Government, 
[normal]we
[normal] ha
[normal]ve
[normal] a number of concerns and lessons from history 
[normal]we
[normal] would like to draw the Committee’s attention to.
[normal]3
[normal]7
[normal]) Our most obvious fear is that any localised funding will suffer the same fate as Supporting People. In t
[normal]he current local government economic environment, any unring-fenced budget is at risk of being diverted to other priorities. Whilst the rationale of localism is that councils know best about need in their area, we worry that in some areas “politically unpo
[normal]pular” groups will not be helped as we have already witnessed in recent local funding decisions. 
[normal]38
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]It
[normal] is essential that any
[normal] 
[normal]localised solution either needs to come with a ring
[normal]-
[normal]fence or some form of statutory protection for homeless people.
[normal] T
[normal]he introduct
[normal]ion of Local Welfare Assistance has shown how homeless people with their lack of
[normal] sustained, provable
[normal] connection to any single area particularly suffer under purely localised approaches.
[normal]39
[normal]) We also hope that any changes to the funding of homelessness services does not allow the progress made in quality of provision over the last 25 years to be undermined. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and its predecessors have i
[normal]nvested hundreds of millions of pounds in turning homelessness buildings from 
[normal]dehumanising 
[normal]institutions 
[normal]in
[normal]to places of change. 
[normal]4
[normal]0
[normal]) Furthermore, a partnership of central and local government with homelessness agencies has led to quantum leaps in creating s
[normal]ervices which emphasise helping people out of homelessness by progressing them back into the community and supporting them develop work, training and employment skills. The failure of the Work Programme has shown how challenging it can be to engage with vu
[normal]lnerable clients
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] Homelessness services can continue do it, but not without investment.
[normal]4
[normal]1
[normal]) Homeless Link believes the development of future funding needs to emphasise client choice which helps foster a spirit of personal responsibility. We have seen tha
[normal]t “Personalisation” approaches have successfully engaged with 
[normal]some of the
[normal] most entrenched rough sleepers
[normal].
[normal] It is essential that a variety of residential and community services are funded which support individuals to reach their maximum
[normal] 
[normal]independence
[normal] level
[normal]. 
[normal]4
[normal]2
[normal]) We believe decisions around the funding decisions need not be made in silo by the DWP but must also reflect the vital role that homelessness services make across a number of Government departments. Recent history is full of examples of homelessness ag
[normal]encies supporting clients who would otherwise have needed statutory help, including those who had previously lived in psychiatric wards and resettlement units. 
[normal]4
[normal]3
[normal]) The cost to other departments such as Department of Health, Home Office and DCLG of increas
[normal]ed numbers of unsupported vulnerable people if homelessness services were not supporting them, would be huge. 
[normal]4
[normal]4
[normal]) 
[normal]As such th
[normal]ere is an opportunity for cross governmental investment which recognises far more effectively the wide type of support provided. H
[normal]owever this needs careful consideration so that the costs are not eroded to a degree where quality and outcomes for vulnerable people are no longer achievable. Such a system also needs to have built in flexibility to allow support to be provided in a way t
[normal]hat can adapt as new ideas and innovations – such as 
[normal]P
[normal]ersonalisation.
