defaultHomeless Link
default (HL)
default is the national umbrella organisation for frontline homelessness charities in England. Currently we have more than 500 member organisations
default. As the collaborative hub for information and debate on homelessness, we seek to improve services for homeless peo
defaultple and to advocate for policy change. Through this work, we aim to end homelessness in England
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are delighted to respond to this consultation
default which poses critical questions for the future funding and sustainability of support costs in housing
default. Most of
default our response will cover areas specific to single homelessness although at points we address wider issues.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPART A – Introduction to the Current Funding of Support in Homelessness Provision default&#xa0;default1) Homelessness hostels and supported housing projects are curr
defaultently funded by two main sources. The first is Housing Benefit (HB) which pays for both core rents and housing management costs where clients are not working or are on a low income. Because of the extra running costs of this type of provision, the level of
default HB is not usually capped by Local Housing Allowance (LHA) Rates. However, the amount of HB councils will pay and the subsidy they can receive back from central government will vary depending on the status of the provider of the accommodation. 
default2) The Gove
defaultrnment’s current plan is to phase-out HB by the end of 2017. At which point the costs currently met by HB will have had to transfer to Universal Credit (UC) unless an alternative funding approach has been developed by then. Ministers have stated publicly t
defaulthat their intention is to move to a “localised solution” by then
default. Our thoughts on this overall approach are outlined in 
defaultP
defaultar
defaultt C
default of this submission
default.
default3) Prior to
default around
default 2003, Housing Benefit was also used to fund support in homelessness projects. However, at that point the Supporting People (SP) programme was introduced to pay for “housing-related support” and HB was limited to the areas identified in paragraph 1. SP was
default paid through a “ring-fenced grant” to councils based on levels of local need
default.
default 
default4) The 
defaultactivities that were included
default under the heading “housing related support” and therefore eligible for funding under SP was varied
default:
default - life and social skills
default;
default managing debt
defaults
default;
default budgeting
default;
default applying for benefits
default;
default resettlement support
default;
default understanding bills
default;
default developin
defaultg
default support networks
default;
default activities promoting training, education and employment within the community
default;
default and helping individuals deal with other agencies 
defaultincluding
default health and
default advice services. 
default5) In 2009 the “ring-fence” was removed from the SP budget. 
defaultWith
default local authorities 
defaultfacing
default year-on-year cuts in Formula Grant
default,
default many have 
defaultmade disproportionate cuts to their SP budgets with homelessness services facing reduction
defaults
default to funding as
default high as 81%
default and even 100%
default. 
defaultThis has already led to the loss of vital support in many areas.
default&#xa0;
default6) Despite the Government stating in 2010 they were committed to ensuring 
default‘
defaultexpenditure is focused on protecting the quality of the key frontline se
defaultrvices…that provide support to the worst off in society
default,
default”
default 
defaultthe reality for homelessness services has 
defaultbeen the opposite. In 2012-13 alone 47% of frontline homelessness agencies saw reductions in SP funding, the latest in a number of years of swing
defaulte
defaulting cuts
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default7) The impact of these cumulative resource reductions is clearly being felt on the frontline
default, with services focused on employment, substance misuse and resettlement all been reduced. Nearly half of homelessness services are doing less work with complex needs clients, who are amongst the most vulnerable and marginalised citizens
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8) 
defaultAt the same
default time
default key indicators show homelessness increasing. 
default2013
default National Street Count 
defaultFigures
default show an increase of 31% compared to 2011
default. The number of homeless people in B&amp;B has gone-up by 50% in two years
default. Homelessness 
defaultacceptances
default 
defaultby 
defaultcouncils have reached their highest numbers 
defaultfor five years
default 
default. O
defaultver half of applicants 
defaultto councils 
defaultdo 
defaultnot meet
default the
default 
defaults
defaulttatutory homelessness thresholds for accommodation. This leaves many individuals entirely reliant upon the services provided by our members
default.
default 
default      
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPART B - Recent Benefit Changes and Their Impactdefault&#xa0;
defaultWhil
defaultst
default we outline the impact of individual changes, we urge the Committee to also consider the cumulative impact of
default all of
default these on individuals’ lives.
default&#xa0;defaultBenefit defaultSanctionsdefault9) Our recent research
default showed the devastating impact the Government
default’
defaults new sanction regime introduced in October 2012 is having on vulnerable people. 85% of homelessness organisations reported an increase in 
defaultthe number of
default 
defaultJob Seekers’ Allowance (
defaultJSA
default)
default clients 
defaultsanctioned, 
defaultand 65% an increase in in 
defaultEmployment Support Allowance (
defaultESA
default)
default clients sanctioned.
default11) Homeless people live in
default daily
default poverty. Our research has shown that the withdrawal of benefits, for even one month, can lead individuals into rent arrears, food poverty and
default crime. Although 
defaultwe
default understand 
defaultthe 
defaultDWP is trying to encourage behaviour change we cannot believe the
defaultir
default intention is to disproportionately punish vulnerable people in this way.
default&#xa0;
defaultExtension of the Shared Accommodation Rate default(SAR) defaultto 25-34 year olds default12) 
defaultAccording to our members, the extension of the Shared Accommodation Rate is having a very negative effect on the ability of young homeless people to access accommodation.
default13) Research we undertook in London found that only 5.5%
default of 
defaultproperties
default were afforda
defaultble 
defaultunder the
default SAR and most of these would be 
defaultun
defaultavailable to people on benefits. Other private intelligence we received has found this is also a problem in 
defaultmany other parts of the country.
default   
default14) Sharing accommodation may particularly be an unsafe option fo
defaultr some young vulnerable people who maybe prone to exploitation or find living with older strangers difficult. 
defaultVery few 
defaultother parts of the benefits system 
defaulttreat
default 1
default8
default and 34 year olds identically. 
default15) Whilst there is an exemption from the SAR for 25-34 year olds who have been in a homeless hostel for 3 months, the information we have received is that it neither covers a wide enough range of vulnerable people, nor is it functioning effectively.   
defaultRedefaultductions in Local Housing Allowance (LHA)default1
default6
default) Although it is almost impossible to isolate the impact of LHA reductions from other benefit changes we believe data shows it is having an impact. 
defaultR
defaultecent statutory figures show that the number of people approach
defaulting their 
defaultcouncil
default as a result of homelessness due to the end of shorthold tenancies now accounts for 27% of all acceptances.
default&#xa0;
default 
default1
default7
default) 27% is the highest ever recorded figure and is an increase of nearly a third from 2012 and over two-thirds from 2011. We believe the most likely explanation for this 
defaulthuge rise
default is landlords no longer wishing to let properties to people on benefits as they
default can
default expect
default rent at higher levels 
defaultfrom
default non-claimants.
defaultThe Abolition of Community Care Grantsdefault (CCGs)default and Crisis Loans default1
default8
default) The localisation of these two elements of the Social Fund has created a patchwork of assistance across England. Some 
defaultcouncils
default have not introduced any replacement programme and 
defaultmany which have
default 
defaultrequire
default a residency qualification. 
defaultI
defaultndividuals who are transitory may not have a provable connection with any area.
default19
default) Ministers have stated that individuals on benefits will have 
defaultto
default “live
default in housing they could afford
default“
default even if this involves relocating. 
defaultCCGs
default and Crisis Loans 
defaulta
defaultre a crucial tool for helping individuals to move to cheaper properties. Unfortunately
default our
default members 
defaultreport 
defaultthat individuals wanting to move to areas with lower rents 
defaultof
defaultten 
defaultfail the local connection test for assistance. 
default2
default0
default) This change threatens Government’s cross-departmental “No Second Night Out”
default (NSNO)
default initiative which is premised on new rough sleepers, where appropriate, being placed into affordable parts of the Private Rented Sector
default. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe Impact of the Benefit Cap and the Abolition of the Spare Room Subsidy/Bedroom Taxdefault2
default1
default) Until the question of exem
defaultpt accommodation is resolved (see paragraph 26), it is unclear to what extent these policies will impact upon single homeless people living in hostels or supported housing. 
default2
default2
default) The Benefit Cap could affect vulnerable individuals living in high-support hou
defaultsing projects where HB rates are above the norm because of levels of housing management required. 
default2
default3
default) Our members 
defaultinform
default us that 
defaulti
defaultncrease
defaultd
default demand for smaller properties created by the Bedroom Tax is making it harder to resettle people from hostels. In a few areas single homeless people living in two-bedroomed “hard-to-let” social housing are being hit by the Bedroom Tax and face arrears. Iro
defaultnically
default,
default 
defaultany move will be in
defaultto 
defaultt
defaulthe more 
defaultexpensive private rented sector as there are no 
defaultlocal 
defaultone-bedroomed social sector flats available. 
defaultUniversal Creditdefault (UC)default and Exempt Accommodationdefault2
default4
default)
default HL
default welcome
defaults
default the Government’s commitment to simplify 
defaultthe benefits 
defaultsystem a
defaultnd address punitive withdrawal rates. However, the actual structure of UC presents numerous problems for services working with vulnerable and/or transitory individuals. Our concerns cannot be detailed here because of space 
defaultbut 
defaultwere documented in 
defaultour previous submission to the Social Security Advisory Committee
default.
default 
default2
default5
default) We welcome Ministers 
defaultprevious 
defaultcommit
defaultment
default before the Committee to protect homelessness services from the unintended consequences of UC
default.
default  The mechanism chosen to do this in this was an
default “opt-out” to Universal Credit Housing Costs for “Exempt Accommodation”.  Unfortunately, exempt accommodation is a
defaultn
default 
defaultold 
defaultlegal status not offer
defaulting

default approximately 
defaulthalf 
defaultof homelessness services. In April 2013 Lord Freud 
defaultpublicly

defaulted
default to resolv
defaulting this problem
default.
default2
default6
default) 
defaultWe
default ha
defaultve
default worked with DWP officials and other key stakeholders in trying to find a “cost neutral” answer. At the current time, a resolution appears likely which will protect most services and we appreciate the 
defaultopportunity 
defaultto have been involved in this process. 
default2
default7
default) However, we do need to highlight the huge levels of
default ongoing
default concern this issue 
defaultcreated 
defaultamongst frontline agencies and local authorities alike. 
defaultImpact of All HB Changes on Accessing Private Rented Secdefaulttordefault (PRS)default Accommodationdefault2
default8
default) Homelessness organisations have spent many years fostering relationships with private landlords and creating services which prepare clients to live in private sector housing. 
defaultM
defaultany of the current changes
default 
defaultare
default undermining that work.  
default29
default)
default 
defaultAs LHA reduces
default,
default the areas available for homeless people to live reduce and they are in competition with other individuals seeking PRS accommodation.
default It seems the impact of changes 
defaultwill be
default to force people to move from expensive
default rental areas to cheaper parts of the country
default. If this trend continues
default there is likely to be further
default population movements 
defaultof benefit claimants into
default areas of 
defaultalready 
defaulthigh unemployment
default and deprivation
default.
default3
default0
default) We are concerned that tenants leaving exempt accomm
defaultodation, who tend to have support needs, will not be attractive to private sector landlords who may already be 
defaultput off rent arrears
default risk
defaults
default. Despite huge amounts of support in the Direct Payment Demonstration Projects, 
defaultarrears
default levels have risen
default.
default We note that all tenants in Northern Ireland will b
defaulte able
default to have UC Housing Costs paid directly to the landlord
default.
default We recommend that people leaving supported accommodation elsewhere should also have this option.

default2
default) “Severe Weather Emergency Protocol” (SWEP) provision is basic life-saving shelter made available to individual
defaults
default who are rough sleeping when the temperature 
defaultreaches

default.
default Our research 
defaultfo
defaultund that around 
default30%

default3
default3
default) However, 
defaultfollowing
default a recent tribunal judgment in Anglesey it may be that much of th
defaultis
default SWEP accommodation is no longer eligible for HB. This could potentially leave thousands of homeless people at risk of death on the streets in freezing temperatures.
default&#xa0;
defaultPart C- The Future of Funding Of Support in Homelessness Provisiondefault3
default4
default) 
defaultHomelessness and 
defaulthousing-related support services deliver cost savings to public service budgets and better outcomes for vulnerable people. The more services can support people to move away from homelessness and towards independent living, the more they can reduce their ex
defaultpensive use of public services, and so be more cost efficient
default.
default Without the support from homelessness services, more people would end up sleeping rough and 
defaultusing costly services
default.
default It is critical that a longer term strategy is developed which recognises the
default investment needed to achieve these longer term savings.
default&#xa0;
default3
default5
default) 
defaultAs outlined 
defaultin 
defaultPart A, the Government’s short-term intention is to try and keep housing costs for homelessness projects outside of UC whilst a “localised solution” is developed. We envisage this
default meaning that funding of housing management costs in homelessness services will no longer be administered through DWP, instead being devolved to councils or 
defaultan
defaultother body.  
default3
default6
default) This would align Housing Management costs with the funding of support which is already the responsibility of council. It could also draw a line under a twenty-year debate as to 
defaulthow 
defaultsupport
defaulted 
defaulthousing should be primarily funded. However, despite this obvio
defaultus appeal of this approach to Government, 
defaultwe
default ha
defaultve
default a number of concerns and lessons from history 
defaultwe
default would like to draw the Committee’s attention to.
default3
default7
default) Our most obvious fear is that any localised funding will suffer the same fate as Supporting People. In t
defaulthe current local government economic environment, any unring-fenced budget is at risk of being diverted to other priorities. Whilst the rationale of localism is that councils know best about need in their area, we worry that in some areas “politically unpo
defaultpular” groups will not be helped as we have already witnessed in recent local funding decisions. 
default38
default)
default 
defaultIt
default is essential that any
default 
defaultlocalised solution either needs to come with a ring
default-
defaultfence or some form of statutory protection for homeless people.
default T
defaulthe introduct
defaultion of Local Welfare Assistance has shown how homeless people with their lack of
default sustained, provable
default connection to any single area particularly suffer under purely localised approaches.
default39
default) We also hope that any changes to the funding of homelessness services does not allow the progress made in quality of provision over the last 25 years to be undermined. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and its predecessors have i
defaultnvested hundreds of millions of pounds in turning homelessness buildings from 
defaultdehumanising 
defaultinstitutions 
defaultin
defaultto places of change. 
default4
default0
default) Furthermore, a partnership of central and local government with homelessness agencies has led to quantum leaps in creating s
defaultervices which emphasise helping people out of homelessness by progressing them back into the community and supporting them develop work, training and employment skills. The failure of the Work Programme has shown how challenging it can be to engage with vu
defaultlnerable clients
default.
default 
default Homelessness services can continue do it, but not without investment.
default4
default1
default) Homeless Link believes the development of future funding needs to emphasise client choice which helps foster a spirit of personal responsibility. We have seen tha
defaultt “Personalisation” approaches have successfully engaged with 
defaultsome of the
default most entrenched rough sleepers
default.
default It is essential that a variety of residential and community services are funded which support individuals to reach their maximum
default 
defaultindependence
default level
default. 
default4
default2
default) We believe decisions around the funding decisions need not be made in silo by the DWP but must also reflect the vital role that homelessness services make across a number of Government departments. Recent history is full of examples of homelessness ag
defaultencies supporting clients who would otherwise have needed statutory help, including those who had previously lived in psychiatric wards and resettlement units. 
default4
default3
default) The cost to other departments such as Department of Health, Home Office and DCLG of increas
defaulted numbers of unsupported vulnerable people if homelessness services were not supporting them, would be huge. 
default4
default4
default) 
defaultAs such th
defaultere is an opportunity for cross governmental investment which recognises far more effectively the wide type of support provided. H
defaultowever this needs careful consideration so that the costs are not eroded to a degree where quality and outcomes for vulnerable people are no longer achievable. Such a system also needs to have built in flexibility to allow support to be provided in a way t
defaulthat can adapt as new ideas and innovations – such as 
defaultP
defaultersonalisation.
