"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Anne McIntosh MP, Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThank you for seeking my views on \nhow greater certainty about the date of the next general election is likely to affect the work of Parliament, and in particular of Select Committees, in the final year before that election.\n&#xa0;\nThe first, perhaps obvious, point is that fixing the date of the General Election enables Committees better to plan their programmes during the final year of the Parliament.  In previous Parliaments, we would by now, approaching the four-year mark, face up to 18 months of speculation on the likely date of the election, which would inevitably affect any Committee considering a \nlonger\n-term or detailed inquiry.  Instead, we can, with some certainty, predict the time available to complete inq\nuiries between now and May 2015 and plan accordingly.\n&#xa0;\nSecondly, this may allow Committees the time\n late next year or early in 2015\n to reflect on what they have achieved over the course of a five-year Parliament, perhaps setting out in a final report an account of work done, recommendations adopted and pointers for a successor Committee in the subsequent Parliament.  It has, of course, always been open to Committees to produce such ‘legacy’ reports towards the end of a Parliament; it has, of course, also been the case that uncertainty over the date of the end of the Parliament has made such reports hard to plan, \nand \nit is likely that some\n intended such reports\n have fallen by the wayside as time has run unexpectedly short and other, more urgent priorities have overtaken them.\n&#xa0;\nThirdly, from a purely practical point of view, knowledge for individual Members of when their re-election will (or will not!) fall may enable them to concentrate on Committee work rather than needing, early, to plan election activity.\n&#xa0;\nIt is difficult immediately to see any clear negative impacts resulting from the fixing of the election date.  That said, I must enter two caveats, both of which I am sure your Committee has already noted: first, we have not yet experienced the final 12 to 18 months of a Fixed-Term Parliament, making it, perhaps, a little early to judge the actual rather than the theoretical impact of the change; and, secondly, this Parliament, and its Select Committees, have trodden previously uncharted ground\n, given the presence of the first Coalition Government in recent memory and the introduction of both elected Chairs and Members of Committees, which also makes comparison with previous Parliaments not quite like-for-like.\n&#xa0;\nI wish you well with your inquiry, which will help to inform Chairs and Members of Committees in the 2015 Parliament, and I look forward to reading the results.\n&#xa0;\n19 December 2013\n2\n&#xa0;\n"
