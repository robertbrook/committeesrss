[[[ (PCD 03)]]]&#xa0;“Given the commitment made by the Foreign Secretary in March 2011, how can progress be made on enshrining in law the necessity of consulting Parliament on military action?”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[(A) ]]]

[[[Iraq ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“notes the opinion of the Attorney General that, Iraq having failed to comply and Iraq being at the time of Resolution 1441 and continuing to be in material breach, the authority to use force under Resolution 678 has revived and so continues today”.This implied that the Attorney General had offered such an opinion, and had done so without caveat. The publication of the full legal advice in April 2005 confirmed that the document offered to the house two years earlier as an ‘unequivocal’ statement that the war would be legal was in fact nothing of the sort. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[(B) ]]]

[[[Syria ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable”. When I first saw the document I noted that it purported to set out “the UK Government’s position”, that it was unsigned, and that it made no reference to any advice or opinion or ‘view’ of the Attorney-General. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
