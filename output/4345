defaultWitness: 
defaultProfessor defaultFawazdefault defaultGergesdefault, Professor of International Law and Chair in Contemporary Middle East Studies, 
defaultLondon
default 
defaultSchool
default of Economics, gave evidence.
default              
defaultQ1 Chair:default May I welcome members of the public to this session of the Foreign Affairs Committee? We are having a one-off evidence session on developments in 
defaultSyria
default. I am pleased to welcome our first witness—apologies if I get the pronunciation wrong—Professor 
defaultFawaz
default 
defaultGerges
default, who is professor of international law and chair in contemporary 
defaultMiddle East
default studies at the London School of Economics. Professor, welcome. It is very good of you to find time to come and see us.
default              
defaultTurning immediately to the military situation in 
defaultSyria
default, would you say that one side or the other has the upper hand militarily?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I would argue that neither side has the capacity or the capability to deliver a decisive blow, even though I would also argue that, at this particular moment, the Syrian regime has a bit of an edge over the opposition. But while the regime is making some major tactical advances—in particular in 
defaultHoms
default, 
defaultDamascus
default, 
defaultQalamoun
default and even 
defaultAleppo
default, which surprised many of us—I do not 
defaultthink
default it can win decisively against the opposition.
default              
defaultIf we focus on the military situation in terms of the balance of power, what is most alarming to me as an observer of 
defaultSyria
default is the marginalisation of the main oppositional force in 
defaultSyria
default. Even though the balance of power has not shifted dramatically in the last two years or so, the democratic opposition, represented by the Syrian National Coalition, has not been able to make major inroads inside 
defaultSyria
default, and, most importantly, the Free Syrian Army has become more of a skeleton in the last year or so. As you know, it has lost most of its assets—the brigades that were fighting under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army. Unfortunately for 
defaultSyria
default and the Syrian people, it has become more of a banker, providing resources and arms supplies to the various factions, but it is no longer a major fighting force inside 
defaultSyria
default.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ2 Chair:default There is a proliferation of opposition groups at the moment, some armed and some unarmed. Why are they not coalescing to form a solid opposition?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default First, as you know, the opposition has been fragmented from the outset, for a variety of reasons. The opposition has been baptised by blood and fire in the last three and a half years. 
defaultSyria
default’s is one of the most repressive regimes in the 
defaultMiddle East
default, and a civil society open space hardly existed. There is a great deal of bickering among the various oppositional factions. Regional powers have also played a highly negative role in supporting certain factions and in pouring fuel on the raging fire among various oppositional factions.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ3 Chair:default We are coming to regional powers in a minute, but just on the groups that are there on the ground, there is no obvious coalescence at all. Is that because of political objectives or because they have different backers?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default In the last few weeks, we have seen the emergence of the so-called 
defaultJabhat
default al-
defaultIsl
defaulta
defaultmiyyah
default, the Islamic Front, and this is one of the first major attempts on the part of the armed opposition inside 
defaultSyria
default to coalesce. The Islamic Front is made up mainly of relatively moderate 
defaultSalafi
default groups that are not affiliated with al-Qaeda-like groups, like al-
defaultNusra
default and the Islamic State in 
defaultIraq
default and al-Sham. It is the first attempt on the part of the armed opposition
default 
defaultto coalesce. The so-called Islamic Front is an umbrella under which many armed factions have coalesced. The jury is still out on whether the Islamic Front will be able not only to coalesce in terms of an organisational structure, but become an effective fighting machine inside 
defaultSyria
default.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ4 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default Coming on to the regional powers, could you give us an assessment of the extent to which the Governments of Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are assisting the anti-Assad forces in Syria?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default My take on the Syrian conflict, and I could be wrong, is that, looking at the big picture, the internal Syrian element is one of the least important now, even though this started as a political uprising—a revolution—against the Assad regime. The conflict has mutated—in fact, what we are witnessing in Syria is a fierce geo-strategic struggle between, on the one hand Saudi Arabia and its allies, and on the other hand Iran. This fierce geo-strategic struggle has major sectarian connotations. So, unfortunately for the Syrian people, 
defaultSyria
default in many ways has become more of a battlefield for regional powers. You have 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default, 
defaultQatar
default, 
defaultTurkey
default and to a lesser extent the 
defaultUnited Arab Emirates
default and 
defaultKuwait
default. On the other hand you have 
defaultIran
default and 
defaultIraq
default. 
defaultIraq
default is the most fascinating element in this equation, because, I would argue, that 
defaultIraq
default is a very important player in providing critical assets and support for the Assad regime, not to mention Hezbollah.
default              
defaultThese are really the big five powers and my take on it is that without an agreement among the regional powers, in particular between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the various Syrian groups, including the Syrian regime, would not be able to reach an agreement. That is why, at the end of the day, hardly anything would take place in Geneva II unless there is a kind of implicit agreement between 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default and 
defaultIran
default.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ5 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default The question was, though, about the extent to which those Governments are assisting. I will come on to 
defaultIran
default later, but are you saying that the Turks, Qataris and Saudis, through their Governments, are heavily supporting the anti-Assad forces?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I take it for granted that 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default is now the spearhead, supporting the so-called Islamic Front. My understanding is that the Islamic Front is basically a Saudi-supported armed coalition and 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default—in particular the Saudi intelligence services—are in charge of the Syrian portfolio now. 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default has taken over from 
defaultQatar
default in the last eight months or so. So even though initially Qatar and Turkey were the major supporters of both the political and the armed opposition, Saudi Arabia is now the spearhead and it is trying to find a kind of alternative to the al-
defaultNusra
default Front and the Islamic State in Iraq, because they are terrified that the 
defaultjihadi
default 
defaultSalafi
default groups are gaining the upper hand in some areas inside Syria.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ6 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default How much non-governmental support do you think is coming from 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default, 
defaultQatar
default and 
defaultTurkey
default as well?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default You put your finger on the pulse of the really critical question why 
defaultjihadi
default 
defaultSalafi
default elements have gained the upper hand. We not only have to talk about governmental support for the various armed factions, we know a great deal of resources—private resources—are flowing from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey, Lebanon and other places to some of the extremist elements that have really gained momentum. Based on everything I know in terms of open sources, I do not believe that Turkey, Qatar or Saudi Arabia are funding the extremist factions inside Syria; but we know, based on multiple sources, that private individuals and businessmen are providing the assets that have enabled the 
defaultjihadi
default 
defaultSalafi
default elements to really gain the upper hand in some parts of Syria.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ7 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default What sort of strength of forces are the Iranians providing, and how much co-ordination do you think there is with Hezbollah coming from 
defaultLebanon
default?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I would argue that without 
defaultIran
default’s logistical, political and financial support, the Assad regime would not have survived as long as it has. Again, we miss the big picture by looking at how many Revolutionary Guards are inside 
defaultSyria
default; this is not about numbers. What is really most surprising about the Syrian Army is that it has not only remained an intact fighting force in the last two or three years, but it has become a deadlier fighting force in the last two and a half years. The question is why the Syrian Army has survived as long as it 
defaulthas and why it has adjusted and adapted to urban warfare. It is because of the retraining and restructuring that the Syrian Army has undergone by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Based on everything that we know, there has been a restructuring of the Syrian Army. If you look at the last three years or so, the army now has more capacity to go on the offensive; its fighting capabilities have increased a great deal and improved a great deal. I would argue this is in a considerable sense due to the restructuring that it has undergone by the Revolutionary Guards.
default              
defaultSecondly, when Hassan 
defaultNasrallah
default, the leader of Hezbollah, said that he made a strategic decision to intervene in 
defaultSyria
default, I had no doubt in my mind that military conditions on the ground inside 
defaultSyria
default were going to change. The question is not whether Hezbollah has sent 4,000 or 10,000 fighters. These are very skilled, determined and ideologically committed fighters. If you look at the battles in 
defaultHoms
default, in 
defaultDamascus
default and in other parts, you see that, basically, Hezbollah as a spearhead, as a vanguard force, has been able to allow the Syrian regime to achieve a certain breakthrough in the field. So yes, 
defaultIran
default and Hezbollah have made a critical difference on the battlefields inside 
defaultSyria
default in the last year or so.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ8default 
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default One of the greatest concerns for people in this country is 
defaultUK
default citizens going over to 
defaultSyria
default to take part in the conflict, who potentially become radicalised and then perhaps return to the 
defaultUK
default. What do you think drives them to do this? What response should the authorities here have to this problem?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default You are asking a big question and we have to speculate a great deal. Whenever we talk about foreign fighters, we look to the 
defaultAfghanistan
default theatre, the Afghanistan-Pakistan experience. We measure everything in terms of what happened in 
defaultAfghanistan
default in the 1980s and how the Afghan war radicalised and militarised foreign fighters, some of whom returned home to 
defaultBritain
default or 
defaultSpain
default or other countries. We are talking about small numbers. The numbers that we have seen are, give or take—no-one knows the number—about 1,000 fighters from Western countries.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ9 Andrew defaultRosindelldefault:default In 
defaultSyria
default?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default In 
defaultSyria
default.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ10default 
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default The police say that around 200 British citizens have travelled to 
defaultSyria
default for this purpose.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I said out of the 7,000 or 8,000 foreign fighters that we think exist in 
defaultSyria
default, there are about 1,000 fighters from Europe and the 
defaultUnited States
default, two hundred of which probably are British.
default              
defaultMy take on it is that most of the fighters who have gone to 
defaultSyria
default to fight were inspired and motivated by the massacres that have been taking place inside 
defaultSyria
default. I do not think they were following Osama bin Laden’s or 
defaultAyman
default al-
defaultZawahiri’s
default call to go to 
defaultSyria
default. They were basically inspired by the massacre of the children and the mutilations—the crimes committed by the 
defaultAssad regime—in the same way that many fighters were motivated by the call to help their Afghani counterparts, co-religionists, in 
defaultAfghanistan
default.
default              
defaultThe problem is that you never know what is going to happen on a battlefield in terms of militarisation and radicalisation. My take on it is that, in the same way that many of us feared that the thousands of fighters in 
defaultIraq
default would come back to haunt European and Western societies and that did not materialise, my hope is that this will not really materialise in the case of 
defaultSyria
default either. I do not think it will, but do not take my word for it. If I were a person responsible for security in 
defaultBritain
default and 
defaultFrance
default, I would worry a great deal about what 200 or even 100 fighters returning home would do.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ11 Sir Menzies Campbell: defaultI a
defaultm going to ask you to speculate again, Professor, but I am quite certain that the speculation will be thoroughly informed. What do you think of the various explanations that have been offered for the use of chemical weapons on 21 August? What prompted that? Some people have suggested it was the act of a rogue commander in the middle echelon of command, others that there was a more sinister purpose. What is your take on that?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I did a piece in the morning in 
defaultThe
default 
defaultGuardian
default, 
defaultin which I said I was surprised that the regime used chemical weapons at that particular moment, because it was gaining the upper hand. The opposition were very encircled and besieged, and also the UN team arrived. It was mind-boggling. I think the Americans say, and I take their word for it in this particular sense, that a commander wanted to clear the area, because there was a major offensive in 
defaultGhouta
default.
default 
defaultGhouta
default is an eastern suburb of 
defaultDamascus
default. The idea behind it is that operational commanders on the ground wanted to cleanse the area. According to American intelligence—you know all this stuff—they heard certain conversations in which a politician or official reprimanded one of the commanders for using chemical weapons on such a large scale. They were hoping that such use would not be detected by the international community. Again, I am citing American intelligence that officials at the highest levels knew of the chemical weapons. As you know, that was not the first time.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ12 Sir Menzies Campbell:default But it was on a wholesale basis?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default Yes, because, what you need to understand is that 
defaultGhouta
default suburb is one of the most important theatres for the Assad regime. This is the gateway not only to the international airport, but to 
defaultDamascus
default. The battle for 
defaultDamascus
default is life and death for the Assad regime. This is not a tactical battle. Some elements of the regime have made it very clear that they would bring down the temple on the heads of everyone if 
defaultDamascus
default appeared to fall. This sounded a very rational explanation on the part of the commander; “This is the battle; am I going to use a limited quantity of imported chemical weapons to make the breakthrough in the 
defaultGhouta
default suburb?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ13 Sir Menzies Campbell:default How far, if indeed to any extent, did that prompt Assad to accept the proposals for disarmament of chemical weapons, and how would you assess the role of Russia in that process?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default You know more than I do on this. Whatever 
defaultRussia
default wants, 
defaultRussia
default will most likely get. It is as simple as that. I talked about 
defaultIran
default; 
defaultRussia
default is more important than 
defaultIran
default in providing military hardware, diplomatic support and recognition for the Assad regime. The Russians made it very clear: there is no wiggle room here. The Foreign Minister and the President—Russians at the highest levels—wanted Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and Assad has decided to do that.
default              
defaultThe big question I would ask myself if I were Assad is: would I give up all my chemical weapons? No, I would not, because I would think, “This is a prolonged war,” and I would try to maintain a certain amount. You are talking about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons—who knows whether it is 1,100 tonnes of chemical weapons? Yes, on the whole, 
defaultSyria
default most likely would be disarmed of most of its chemical weapons. I myself would not give up all the chemical weapons, if I were sitting in 
defaultDamascus
default today.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ14 Sir Menzies Campbell:default That is an interesting piece of evidence, because the Committee recently heard from another source the belief that Assad might have kept up to 25%.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I am speculating. I am saying that is a theoretical point of view.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ15 Sir Menzies Campbell:default Let me put it this way: if that information were correct, would you be surprised by it?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default Yes, I would be surprised by 25% because, first, they would realise that the American and European powers probably would know this. They also would realise that 
defaultRussia
default would be very upset about its credibility, and 
defaultRussia
default also wants to exercise influence. The fact is that the Russians are saying, “We will deliver 
defaultSyria
default. Would you deliver the opposition?”. This is very important. Again, I am speculating, but I would not say 25%. I would say 5% or 10%.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ16 Sir Menzies Campbell:default But you would not be surprised by a percentage?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default Not at all.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ17 Sir Menzies Campbell:default Let us move on to something else that also involves the Russians, although perhaps not in the direct way you have described. Who do you think needs to participate in Geneva II for it to be credible? A related issue that I am sure you will understand is that the British Government have so far declined to accept the view that 
defaultIran
default should participate. First, who do you think should participate? Secondly, are the British Government right to hold 
defaultto their position that unless 
defaultIran
default signs up to 
defaultGeneva
default I, it is not entitled to sit at the table for Geneva II?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I think 
defaultLakhdar
default 
defaultBrahimi
default 
defaultis correct to insist that all the powers that exercise considerable influence in 
defaultSyria
default should participate in Geneva II. If our reading is correct and 
defaultIran
default is a pivotal player in maintaining the 
defaultAssad
default regime, then 
defaultIran
default would probably play a critical part in making Geneva II a success. My take is that everyone would say that 
defaultIran
default is not only a pivotal player, but maintains and has sustained the Assad regime.
default              
defaultDespite reservations about Iranian conduct in other theatres, I think there is a new leadership within 
defaultIran
default. President 
defaultHassan 
defaultRouhani
default and his Foreign Minister, 
defaultMohammad 
defaultJavad
default 
defaultZarif
default, have made it very clear that 
defaultIran
default would like to play a positive role. My take on it is that if we are genuine and serious about making Geneva II a success, you cannot go round the questions of 
defaultIran
default and 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default. It is not only 
defaultBritain
default saying this; the 
defaultUnited States
default and 
defaultFrance
default say that 
defaultIran
default should accept 
defaultGeneva
default. As you all know, one of the major obstacles to 
defaultIran
default’s participation in Geneva II is 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default, which has put a veto on this.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ18default defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default It is not just the success of the conference that matters, but the success of any outcome determined by the conference.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default Absolutely.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ19 Sir Menzies Campbell:default In that sense, do you think that there is any merit in the notion that if 
defaultIran
default is allowed to participate, it would be bound into the process and have an interest in a successful outcome?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I think the Iranians are not ideologically wedded to 
defaultAssad
default himself, in the same way that the Russians are not really wedded to Assad. This is a marriage of convenience—John Kerry’s words, not mine. Would the Iranians bargain? Absolutely. They invented modern diplomacy; it was not invented in 
defaultWestphalia
default. It came from 
defaultb
defaultazaari
default 
defaultdiplomacy. The Iranians would bargain. We need to understand that this is a fierce regional struggle. It is not only about what 
defaultBritain
default, 
defaultFrance
default and the 
defaultUnited States
default want. You are talking about a fierce regional geo-strategic struggle taking place between 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default and 
defaultIran
default. Without an agreement among the regional powers, I very much doubt whether Geneva II would even take place, let alone have any kind of fruitful result.
default              
defaultYou cannot dance around the question of 
defaultIran
default if we are serious about producing a positive outcome. 
defaultIran
default is pivotal in the same way that 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default is pivotal. In the same way that 
defaultIran
default exercises considerable influence over the Assad regime, 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default also now exercises considerable influence over the opposition. 
defaultAhmad 
defaultJarba
default, the President of the Syrian national coalition, would not go to 
defaultGeneva
default unless 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default gave him the go-ahead. That is how bad it is. This tells you that the internal variable in the Syrian conflict is now one of the least important variables. The regional variable has now exceeded the internal variable in importance.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ20 Mike Gapes:default Can I ask you about the failure of the international community to act two and a half years ago? Has that made the situation in 
defaultSyria
default much worse? Linked to that, what would have been the effects of a decision to have military strikes against the Assad regime, which were under consideration at the end of August?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default To give you my take, once British, American and French fighter jets drop bombs on 
defaultSyria
default, the whole calculus of the conflict changes. Again, we all know history, and the history of the region. That is my reading of the situation. It would have played into the hands of the Assad regime: “This is again another colonial war—another 
defaultIraq
default. The West is intervening.” It would have turned Assad into an Arab hero. In fact, many of the people who basically are sceptical about Assad would say, “Look, the West is back at it again.”
default              defaultQ21 Mike Gapes:default Would that have been the same if there had been a decision two and half years ago to impose a no-fly zone at that point, before the radicalisation of rebels?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default You are asking a very counter-factual question. It would not have been the same, I agree with you. There are two questions I want to address, although I know our time is limited. First, there was a major strategic blunder on the part of the western powers, particularly when the American President said that Assad must go; Assad’s days were numbered and he must go. Yet that particular strategic statement was not backed by any kind.
default              
defaultOf course, the British followed by repeating the same; and the French and what have you. I do not think that President Barack Obama had given any strategic or major calculation. In fact, we know now that 
defaultUS
default intelligence services had a different assessment of Assad’s days; that his ship was not sinking, contrary to what the American President said. In that particular sense, there was a calculation; a combination of economic warfare, psychological warfare, regional pressure with 
defaultTurkey
default, 
defaultQatar
default and 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default supporting the opposition. All those elements would have basically brought about a tipping point that Assad would be forced to.
default              
defaultThe big question is why the West gets it wrong. There are a variety of reasons. First, we underestimated Assad’s ability to fight to the bitter end. We underestimated the social base of support that Assad had—whether it is 30%. In particular, we underestimated the capacity of the Syrian Army to fight and remain an intact force. We underestimated the capacity of regional allies to support Assad. The most important thing we underestimated was the pivotal support that 
defaultRussia
default provided, too. All those basic factors have allowed Assad to survive.
default              
defaultI do not think there was any major strategic calculation on the part of 
defaultBritain
default. To me, the biggest, very alarming and sad development is what has happened to the opposition; what has happened to the Syrian National Coalition—we come back to the start of my talk—and what has happened to the Free Syrian Army.

default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ23 Mike Gapes:default Professor 
defaultGerges
default, you referred to the Syrian opposition. May I ask you about the interesting developments among the Kurdish opposition in 
defaultSyria
default? I recently went to the 
defaultDomiz
default refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan. There are 75,000 Syrian Kurd refugees in the camp, and there are, I am told, a total of some 200,000 or 250,000 Kurdish refugees in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. My instinct is that those people will not be going back for a considerable time, because they are well looked after and many of the men are able to work and are supported by the Kurdish regional Government. It is clear from the conversations I had there that many of the Kurds in Iraq are anti-Assad, yet the main fighting group among the Kurdish-Syrian population, the PYD, seem now to be working in league with Assad against some of the al-Qaeda-linked elements. What are the long-term implications of that and the fact that the Kurdish region of 
defaultSyria
default now seems effectively to be under the control of the PYD?
default              defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default Yes, as you said, there are major divisions among the Syrian Kurds. The PYD does not speak for all the Kurdish political elements. Yes, the PYD is implicitly working indirectly with the Assad regime and is seizing the opportunity because it realises that this is a historic moment to have autonomy, as opposed to a state within a state. The PYD has been successful in clearing most of the Kurdish areas of the al-Qaeda and al-
defaultNusra
default 
defaultf
defaultront
defaults. The PYD has had some major battles with the Free Syrian Army, too.
default              
defaultThe long-term implications are extremely alarming because, as you will know, the areas in which the Kurdish communities exist are not really pure Kurdish. You have Arabs and Christians, which tells you that, ultimately, there will be ethnic cleansing, particularly if the PYD decides to pursue the strategy of having an autonomous Kurdish area. I do not think the Syrian opposition, whether you are talking about the 
defaultSalafi
default elements or the Free Syrian Army, would allow the Kurdish areas to establish an autonomous zone within 
defaultSyria
default itself. That is not to mention the question of 
defaultTurkey
default. 
defaultTurkey
default, as you know, is very much opposed to any kind of autonomous Kurdish area on its border.
default              
defaultSo there are major implications, but that tells you a great deal about how the Syrian conflict has mutated over the past almost three years. It started as a political uprising and mutated into an armed internal struggle. Now you are talking about multiple conflicts collapsing into one. Various communities, particularly the Kurds, are trying to seize this moment to establish an autonomous zone inside 
defaultSyria
default.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ24 Mike Gapes:default You mentioned the attitude of the Turkish Government. Does the autonomous area controlled by the PYD assist or undermine the rapprochement between the Turkish Government and the PKK within 
defaultTurkey
default?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default I do not think it has any major implications, because, obviously, the 
defaultErdogan
default Government has made a strategic decision for rapprochement with its own Kurdish 
defaultcommunity and with 
defaultKurdistan
default. What we have seen in the past few weeks has been historic in many ways.
default              
defaultI think the 
defaultErdogan
default Government has also recognised the long-term security implications of what is happening inside 
defaultSyria
default. If you really observe clearly, the Turkish Government are moving more and more towards believing in a political solution. They are no longer the spearhead of all-out war against Assad. They realise that their security is deeply and directly affected, and not just by the Kurdish element—remember that al-Qaeda elements are basically on the Turkish-Syrian border—and that affects the short and long-term security interests of Turkey.

defaultQ25 Sandra Osborne:default Who is supplying arms and by which routes are they going? To what extent is each of 
defaultSyria
default’s neighbours facilitating or permitting supply of arms to 
defaultSyria
default, to either the opposition or the Government?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default 
defaultTurkey
default has always been the major outlet for arms and 
defaultmatériel
default for the opposition. After the militarisation of the Syrian uprising, 
defaultTurkey
default made a strategic decision to open its front, including free for all. When the western powers argue, “Why would you allow certain extremist elements to use you?” 
defaultTurkey
default says, “Look, we have open borders. We have made a decision to support the opposition. And how do we tell?” Any person can go to 
defaultTurkey
default—you do not need a visa now, so you have the 1,000 European or western individuals who mainly use 
defaultTurkey
default as the major outlet. I do not think that 
defaultTurkey
default has consciously either supported or allowed jihadist elements to enter 
defaultSyria
default, but 
defaultTurkey
default has had an open policy, even though in the last few months the Turkish intelligence services have become much more conscious and are targeting some of the extremist elements who are entering 
defaultTurkey
default.
default              
defaultThe new development in the Saudi policy—I am talking about open sources again; I do not have any intelligence—is that Jordan has become a major second front for certain Free Syrian Army assets trained in Jordan by American, British and other forces These are very specific groups. They are using 
defaultDaraa
default in particular as the major front to target the soft belly of the Assad regime. Saudi intelligence services in particular are in charge of the 
defaultDaraa
default front. 
defaultJordan
default is very important, but it is a more targeted and focused front, trying to achieve an operational breakthrough by attacking 
defaultDaraa
default, because from 
defaultDaraa
default you go to 
defaultDamascus
default, the 
defaultQalamoun
default and so on.
default              
defaultSo far the Assad regime is terrified about this particular front. In fact, once the major battles in 
defaultQalamoun
default, which is on the Lebanese-Syrian front, are over, which will most likely be in the next few weeks because the Syrian Government are investing considerable resources, you will see this as the new front. Assad will fight to show the Saudis that they cannot make a breakthrough in 
defaultDaraa
default, because that is a very important front. So we have 
defaultTurkey
default and 
defaultJordan
default and initially 
defaultLebanon
default. The Assad regime and Hezbollah have tightened the Lebanese-Syrian borders area, so few resources are flowing from 
defaultLebanon
default to 
defaultSyria
default. 
defaultJordan
default and 
defaultTurkey
default are the major fronts by which the opposition is gaining arms.
default              
defaultThe Syrian Government is being provided with major strategic assets by 
defaultRussia
default—we know that. There is also 
defaultIran
default, and the biggest story in this conflict is how 
defaultIraq
default has emerged as a critical player. The Tehran-Baghdad-Damascus road is really the lifeline of the Assad regime for a variety of reasons. Remember, the Assad Government requires tremendous resources in terms 
defaultof ammunition, weapons, petroleum, food and what have you. That is not just in terms of Iranians; you also have fighters. We do not know the number of fighters, but they are flowing from 
defaultIraq
default into 
defaultSyria
default as well to help some of the regime elements, particularly in 
defaultDamascus
default.
default              
defaultChair:default We are running very tight on time, Professor 
defaultGerges
default, so I would be grateful if you could keep your answers brief. Thank you.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ26 Sandra Osborne:default What evidence is there that instability in 
defaultSyria
default is generating significant new support for extremism and internal opposition in neighbouring countries?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default That is a very important question. 
defaultLebanon
default is in the eye of the storm. The reverberations of the Syrian crisis are being felt on Arab streets. 
defaultLebanon
default really is teetering on the brink of collapse. Certain areas of 
defaultLebanon
default are also split along sectarian lines. Certain extremist elements have established a major base in 
defaultLebanon
default—they had been there before the Syrian crisis, but the crisis has aggravated the situation in 
defaultLebanon
default. The 
defaultSalafi
default 
defaultjihadi
default current has a stronger footing in 
defaultLebanon
default.
default              
defaultIn 
defaultIraq
default, it is a two-way street. Remember what is happening in 
defaultIraq
default: on average, 1,000 Iraqis are being killed each month. It was al-Qaeda in 
defaultIraq
default that established the 
defaultal-
defaultNusra
default Front
default in 
defaultSyria
default. Now, the various elements in 
defaultSyria
default are also playing a major role in intensifying the insurgency in 
defaultIraq
default itself, so you have a two-way street between 
defaultIraq
default and 
defaultSyria
default. 
defaultJordan
default is terrified. It is terrified of the political instability, particularly because of the flow of 
defaultSalafi
default 
defaultjihadi
default elements in 
defaultSyria
default. We estimate that there are between 1,000 and 2,000 
defaultSalafi
default 
defaultjihadi
default Jordanians fighting in 
defaultSyria
default; a few hundred have been killed.
default              
defaultTo come back to 
defaultTurkey
default, it is also concerned about the short and long-term security implications of the Syrian conflict. When the Americans and the British say, “We are concerned about the 
defaultspillover
default effects of the Syrian conflicts into the neighbourhood,” this is a Syrian concern. Go to 
defaultLebanon
default, go to 
defaultTripoli
default, go to the 
defaultBekaa
default 
defaultValley
default, go to 
defaultBaghdad
default—you hear the same story. The biggest story now is what you do with more than 10,000 extremist fighters who are fighting inside 
defaultSyria
default, some of whom might return to 
defaultIraq
default, 
defaultLebanon
default and neighbouring countries to battle existing authorities there.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ27 Sandra Osborne:default So if there was a civil war in 
defaultLebanon
default, for example, what could the 
defaultUK
default and the western powers do try to prevent that or to assist?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default 
defaultLebanon
default has its own problems, as you know. There are multiple challenges. The basic divide is between the al-Hariri camp and the Hezbollah camp; you also have a sectarian divide—that particular divide has taken on sectarian connotations. The Syrian conflict has also exacerbated the Lebanese conflict. The most important point to impress on Lebanese of all political persuasions is the need to establish a Government. You know that there is no functioning Government in 
defaultLebanon
default, and the presidential election most likely will not take place, so ultimately you have a deadlock. It would take a spark—a major black swan—in 
defaultLebanon
default for the country basically to implode. It is a major situation. When we talk about 
defaultSyria
default, we not just talking about security inside 
defaultSyria
default; we are talking about geostrategic security. The neighbourhood is as affected as 
defaultSyria
default itself.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ28 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default Can we view what is going on in 
defaultSyria
default in terms of a Sunni-
defaultShi’a
default conflict? Obviously the borders were drawn up many years ago, mainly as a result of colonialism, and they probably bear very little resemblance to genuine communities. Will 
defaultSyria
default still exist after this?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultGergesdefault:default The Syrian conflict did not start as a sectarian conflict. The sectarian divide in 
defaultSyria
default is a product of the war itself. It is a recent development. I think that we miss the big picture by saying that it is a sectarian divide. What has now happened is that the geostrategic rivalry between 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default and 
defaultIran
default has taken on sectarian connotations. You have sectarian mobilisation. You have major material and ideological resources invested in trying to mobilise both camps. The reality is that the sectarian divide masks geostrategic interests. The geostrategic struggle is what matters—that is the independent variable. The sectarian divide is basically used as an asset by the geostrategic powers in order to mobilise their own communities.
default              
defaultSo what does Hezbollah say? “We intervened not only to save the Assad regime, but to save the shrine of 
defaultZainab
default, one of the most sacred 
defaultShi’a
default shrines in 
defaultSyria
default.” Many 
defaultShi’a
default Iraqis are coming to 
defaultSyria
default and mobilising on the fact that the 
defaultShi’a
default community and shrines are being threatened. What does 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default and its allies say? “The 
defaultShi’as
default are coming. The 
defaultShi’as
default are infiltrating the heartland of the Sunni Arab world.” But the reality, as we know, is that this is a geostrategic struggle. At the end of the day, I deeply believe—I could be wrong—that the Syrian people will be able to overcome this sectarian divide if a regional agreement is found between, in particular, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

defaultChair:default Professor 
defaultGerges
default, I am sorry you were interrupted so much, but thank you for your time.
default&#xa0;
defaultExamination of WitnessdefaultWitness:
default 
defaultShashank Joshi
default, Research Fellow, 
defaultRoyal United Services Institute
default,
default gave evidence
default.
default              
defaultChair:default Our second witness today needs no introduction as far as this Committee is concerned. Shashank Joshi, research fellow at RUSI, thank you for coming. It is good to see you again.
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Good afternoon.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ29 Chair:default Is there any reason why the opposition is not coalescing together into a coherent opposition? It seems to be fragmented. What is your assessment of this?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default I do not see why its natural tendency should be to coalesce in the first place. First, there are ideological differences involved. You have the 
defaultjihadis
default at one end of the spectrum; you have what Professor 
defaultGerges
default called moderate 
defaultSalafis
default, although some may disagree that they are moderate, groups that have coalesced into the Islamic Front, which is itself a 
defaultcoalition of three previous umbrella groups plus others; and then you have the FSA with its Supreme Military Council, which itself has some brigades and battalions that have overlapping membership with the Islamic Front. There is no natural reason why these ideologically differently inclined groups should coalesce in the first place.
default              
defaultOn top of that, you have geographic differences—these groups are active in different places. So even within the Islamic Front, some of these groups have turf to defend; they can extract rent and they can smuggle in particular areas. And you have external sources of support. You have Saudi Arabia supporting not only the Islamic Front, as Professor 
defaultGerges
default rightly identified, but specific groups within that, so they have an incentive to maintain that support and avoid sharing the spoils of those outside resources with others.
default              
defaultIn a way, I am not sure why they should coalesce. Their objectives are different. Their threshold for what constitutes victory is different. We have already seen six out of seven groups in this Islamic Front, which is one of the most significant bodies in 
defaultSyria
default now, say that any attendance at the Geneva II talks by the moderate opposition would be considered completely unacceptable and would invite retaliation, so they have different objectives as well. Does that go some way to addressing that point?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ30 Chair:default Yes, that is a good answer. We have received reports that the Islamic Front has overrun General 
defaultIdris’s
default camp. Have you heard anything about that?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default General 
defaultIdris
default himself is formally based in 
defaultTurkey
default.
default              
defaultChair:default I thought it was just on the Syrian side.
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default I have not seen that report.
default              defaultChair:default There is a report: Islamic Front fighters take over Free Syrian Army bases near Turkish border.
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default It is entirely possible. General 
defaultIdris
default has ostensibly welcomed the Islamic Front, but he has little choice. He has haemorrhaged fighters and brigades to this.
default              
defaultWhat is interesting is that there is a gentle tug of war now. Those who were supporting the Islamic Front say. “This is our only hope for pulling fighters away from the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham.” Some have said that they can work tactically with 
defaultJabhat
default al-
defaultNusra
default and pull it away from 
defaultISIS
default, because those two al-Qaeda groups themselves have their own differences. I think the Free Syrian Army’s calculation was that if they were fated to have this front and lose members to it, at least it would weaken the 
defaultjihadis
default themselves. Ultimately—this is a bit of speculation—it will consume them.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ31 Rory Stewart:default Professor 
defaultGerges
default emphasised strongly that we had underestimated the strength of Assad. He said that the British and American Governments had called on Assad to step down and he specified that we had underestimated the support in the Syrian population 
defaultfor Assad, the capacity of the Syrian Army, the importance of 
defaultIran
default and the role of 
defaultRussia
default. Why did we make this mistake?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default First, comparisons may have been made with 
defaultLibya
default, which was fresh in the memory at the time of the early stages of the 
defaultSyria
default conflict. One of the major differences is that 
defaultLibya
default’s army peeled away, or fractured in half, very early on. The entire eastern half basically melted away, whereas 
defaultSyria
default’s armed forces and particularly its special forces—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ32 Rory Stewart:default Sorry, because we are so short of time, I am specifically asking how did the Foreign Office and the State Department get it wrong? There will be many answers, but what within the institutional structures, procedures and consultation mechanisms led them not to spot the things you point out in relation to 
defaultLibya
default?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default I don’t know. If I had to point to one thing, it would be underestimating the degree to which the opposition would fragment.
default              defaultRory Stewart:default So in your view and in your experience of the foreign policy system—consultations, the relationship between think-tanks and Government, the way in which policy is made—what is leading us to come to the wrong conclusions? We can all list what they got wrong, but how did they get it wrong?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default In the Syrian case, one important factor may have been lack of access to information on what is happening on the ground. It was not easy to access what was going on. The embassies were evacuated early on, because these were very dangerous and opaque areas to operate in, so most of the information we were getting early on was from the Turkish side—people in southern 
defaultTurkey
default, including, in terms of intelligence, the CIA, which was operating in southern 
defaultTurkey
default, speaking to members of the FSA. Perhaps they did not have access to the granular detail of what was going on further inside 
defaultSyria
default. I am speculating.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ33 Rory Stewart:default So what reforms could we introduce to ensure that in future, with situations as important as this, we are able to get a more reliable assessment?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default If the problem is a lack of presence, one of the solutions is to remain inside the country as long as possible, but is that a reform? I am not sure. There were concrete security reasons why the 
defaultUK
default, the 
defaultUS
default and others could not stay in 
defaultDamascus
default. You can argue that there should have been more pressure on countries like 
defaultTurkey
default early on in the conflict to provide more information and monitor the opposition on their soil, but it is difficult to say what might have occurred.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ34 Rory Stewart:default Essentially, what you are describing is a situation in which the confirmation bias was that Assad was weak. So presumably what was required were voices from inside 
defaultSyria
default who were able to put the other side of the story. There needed to be a way for you, or foreign ministries, or journalists, to question the information they received. They were, as you say, essentially receiving information from the Free Syrian Army, which had an interest in saying 
defaultthat the Assad regime was weak and was going to collapse in an instant. It is not simply about keeping diplomatic staff on the ground, it is about finding ways for systems such as the Foreign Office and State Department to listen to the other side of the story and question their conventional wisdom.
default              defaultShashank Joshi:default Yes, I agree, but it is also a question of military analysis: simply understanding how much strength the military had, which is not just about listening to the other side. It wasn’t just to do with social support. There were plenty of people saying, “Assad has the support of his people,” and in many cases saying so on fairly spurious grounds. People were saying that 50% of the population supported Assad. Part of the issue was that we just got the military analysis wrong and that was pure lack of information. I am not sure that it was just about structures, it was about the information available to us as well.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ35 Rory Stewart:default So do you think that the fundamental problem was not, as Professor 
defaultGerges
default said, that we underestimated the credibility of Assad, the support in the population and the support from Iran and Russia, which are political issues; you put 90% of the emphasis on the capacity of the Syrian Army?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Well, no. Professor 
defaultGerges
default is right to point to 
defaultIran
default as well in sheer financial support, military support and Hezbollah’s involvement. We also underestimated that. The reason may have simply been misunderstanding their stakes in the conflict.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ36 Rory Stewart:default What is your assessment of President Obama’s handling of the Syrian crisis?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default I think his ambivalence early on was very damaging. He sent a lot of people into southern 
defaultTurkey
default promising rebels things he would never deliver on, and the sense of embitterment had a very negative impact on how the rebellion proceeded. But after that point, once he made the decision he was not going to support the rebels, he has not handled it terribly badly. I think his decision to show flexibility and to adopt the disarmament plan with 
defaultRussia
default was, by and large, a sensible one. Otherwise, I think he was correct not to get pulled into the conflict very early on, purely on the whims of Gulf allies; I do not think that was necessarily the wrong decision.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ37 Rory Stewart:default What do you think will be the implications of Obama’s policy for the 
defaultUS
default’s long-term presence in the 
defaultMiddle East
default? What has it meant for American credibility? What will it mean for the next 10 years of US relations in the 
defaultMiddle East
default?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default It is only one part of his 
defaultMiddle East
default policy. It will probably mean there is a long-term jihadist threat emanating from the Syrian area across all the 
defaultUS
default allies in the region, particularly 
defaultJordan
default, southern 
defaultTurkey
default and 
defaultIraq
default, but that is only a narrow part of his 
defaultMiddle East
default policy. He has had very strong successes in 
defaultIran
default; I do not think his position with the Gulf monarchies is as dire as is made out; and he has at least restarted the Israel-Palestine talks. All those things will sit alongside the failure of the 
defaultUS
default to resolve the conflict in 
defaultSyria
default.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ38 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default How do you think neighbouring countries—
defaultTurkey
default, 
defaultQatar
default, 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default and, of course, 
defaultIran
default—are influencing the dynamics of what is happening inside 
defaultSyria
default? If you could pull out your crystal ball, how might that play out in the medium to long term?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Taking the neighbouring countries in turn, 
defaultIsrael
default’s role is pretty minimal. It is engaging in sporadic strikes against Syrian targets where it sees a transfer of advanced weaponry, but otherwise, by and large, it supports the stalemate, which it sees as weakening multiple foes.
default              
defaultJordan
default was initially ambivalent, but once it had 
defaultUS
default forces stationed on its soil, it was eager to see much more done to minimise the growth of jihadist factions. It even suggested the use of American drone strikes from its territory.
default              
defaultWe talked about finance coming from the Gulf for some of the extremist actors. I think 
defaultTurkey
default is still allowing some of that to occur in its border areas, because it ultimately sees groups such as the Islamic Front as a useful buffer against not just ISIS, but Kurds. Although it is more open to Geneva II than it was a year ago, when it was pleading for all-out military intervention, I think it still sees support for groups like the Islamic Front as its primary means of influence in 
defaultSyria
default.
default              
defaultIraq
default, I think, is preoccupied by its own escalating levels of violence. It still allows Iranian 
defaultoverflights
default of arms into 
defaultSyria
default. It is still allowing many 
defaultShi’a
default volunteers from Iraqi groups to fight inside 
defaultSyria
default. It still sees a victory by the opposition as tantamount to a victory by fundamentalist Sunni forces that would catalyse much greater violence and political upheaval in 
defaultIraq
default, but I think it is not an active player in the same way that 
defaultTurkey
default and 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default are.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ39 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default On the question of 
defaultjihadis
default, a lot of people are travelling to 
defaultSyria
default, and they are getting all sorts of experience and training. As we saw when we did our inquiry into North and 
defaultWest Africa
default, the downfall of the Libyan regime saw a lot of 
defaultjihadis
default move south. We saw what happened in 
defaultMali
default, where many of the people involved came from 
defaultLibya
default. Do you see similar movements of people happening when the situation in 
defaultSyria
default stabilises to some degree? Do you see people moving out and looking to destabilise other parts of the region?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Yes, and I think this is where I would differ slightly from Professor 
defaultGerges
default, who said the numbers of European Muslim fighters and foreign fighters is fairly small. This is the largest European Muslim foreign fighting contingent in modern history, and the numbers are obviously much bigger if you include regional people travelling there. We talk a lot about the risk to the UK, and that is obviously there, but the bigger risk in my view is groups like ISIS and 
defaultJabhat
default al-
defaultNusra
default becoming entrenched in north and north-east Syria, and using that as a platform for attacks against regional targets—targets in southern Turkey or targets in places like Amman, where I think there is a much more permissive environment for these groups to operate. 
defaultIraq
default obviously has such a high degree of violence—it doesn’t need 
defaultSyria
default to be a springboard for violence. It has its own platforms within. Again, one of the reasons why Hezbollah is so keen to fight in the 
defaultQalamoun
default mountain area—to sever these links and fight where it is fighting now—is not just to aid the Syrian regime. It is not just at the orders of 
defaultIran
default. 
defaultIt is also to prevent Sunni fundamentalist groups re-entering Lebanon and attacking its own strongholds, as we have seen over the past eight or nine months. In other words, even Hezbollah itself sees this problem as affecting its own areas in 
defaultBeirut
default.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ40 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default Do you think there is anything that the West—meaning the United States or Britain and France—could have or should have done earlier that might have made the outcome in Syria less harmful and more manageable in terms of finding a solution that can lead to a Geneva II that satisfies most of the players in the area?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default It is possible that a more concerted effort to secure a diplomatic solution very early on, before the opposition had become so fragmented, before the extremists within the opposition ranks had become so powerful as they are now and before the moderate opposition had become so enfeebled,
default 
defaultmight have had more chances of success. I am not sure that that would have yielded much because at that time, 
defaultRussia
default’s position was completely unyielding as well. It is possible that we could have done much more to restrict the inflow of funds to extremists from non-official sources early in the conflict, particularly from 
defaultTurkey
default. That is something I think that could have been done much earlier on as well.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ41 Mike Gapes:default Can I take up this point about extremist connections? We heard earlier about the Iraqi 
defaultMaliki
default Government giving political support to the Assad regime and perhaps other support as well. On the other hand, we have jihadist groups coming out of 
defaultIraq
default originally, going into 
defaultSyria
default, and now we have Syrian 
defaultjihadis
default coming back into 
defaultIraq
default, including the terrorist attack on the Kurdish region in September, which I understand has links to this conflict. Is there therefore going to have to be an internal political settlement in 
defaultIraq
default before we can stabilise the situation in 
defaultSyria
default?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default No, I am not sure that is the case. It wouldn’t hurt of course. Both of the branches of al-Qaeda in 
defaultSyria
default are sort of offshoots of al-Qaeda’s branch in 
defaultIraq
default—both 
defaultISIS
default and 
defaultJabhat
default al-
defaultNusra
default. By and large, I don’t think they require sanctuary or support in 
defaultIraq
default to sustain themselves in 
defaultSyria
default. Of course, it is the case that a more inclusive political settlement in Syria, one in which Iraqi Sunni communities did not feel victimised by the 
defaultMaliki
default Government, would be beneficial to dampening support for extremists in Iraq, and that would have a knock-on effect in Syria. But I am not sure: this is sufficiently internal to 
defaultSyria
default that it doesn’t really require a wholesale political settlement in 
defaultIraq
default.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ42 Chair:default Moving to the chemical weapons situation, do you think that the disarmament process is weakening Assad and not making any difference at all?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default I think it isn’t making any difference. I think it temporarily strengthened him insofar as there was stronger 
defaultUS
default interest in continuity of government. That is, those units protecting chemical weapons, particularly specialised units of the Syrian armed forces—the 
defaultUS
default had far less interest and was inclined to see them preserved and stay in one piece. That obviously constitutes a sort of safety net for Assad. I think a lot of the criticism directed at the CW deal—the disarmament plan—was criticising the 
defaultUS
default for precluding actions 
defaultthat it was never going to take anyway. That is, for preventing it from engaging in a wholesale intervention. I mean, as we heard from Secretary of State John Kerry, it was going to be an “unbelievably small” strike. It was not going to be a regime-threatening strike. It would have targeted some elite military units and would have had a concrete impact on Assad’s effectiveness, but after that point, now that the disarmament effort is under way, I do not see why it would particularly strengthen Assad. Once the process continues, there will be less and less need for co-operation with the Assad regime anyway and he will be almost back to where he started.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ43 Chair:default The whole chemical weapons situation, in effect, led to the announcement that Geneva II would take place on 22 January. You mentioned 
defaultRussia
default in answer to a question from Mr 
defaultHendrick
default. Do you think we need 
defaultIran
default at the table?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default It depends on the point of Geneva II. If the point is to reach a comprehensive political settlement that can secure peace, you need all combatants and their supporters, which absolutely includes 
defaultIran
default. But my question would be: who in 
defaultIran
default? 
defaultIran
default is not necessarily a perfectly monolithic state. The nuclear deal was successful because the Supreme Leader empowered his President and his Foreign Minister to deal on the specific issue of the nuclear programme. On 
defaultSyria
default, there are other parts of the Iranian state that have more levers on policy, notably the Iranian 
defaultRevolutionary Guard
default. They are not going to be sitting at the table at Geneva II; it will be the Foreign Ministry. Those on the Iranian side who are able to make concessions and deal will not be attending the Geneva II process. Personally, I do not see that anything productive will come out of Geneva II next month.
default              
defaultChair:default How depressing.
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Look at the opposition. How can it? Six of the 
defaultIslamic Front
default’s seven groups are saying that anyone who attends from the FSA will be treated as a collaborator with Assad. You have the coalition itself saying that it will attend only under stringent conditions, including humanitarian corridors. If you want the 
defaultIslamic Front
default at the table, I just do not see the Assad regime negotiating with them. I just cannot see what comes out of this. If the purpose is much more modest—if it is only to secure tactical-level humanitarian access—I see absolutely no harm in having people around a table to discuss that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ44 Chair:default As I understand it, Geneva II is just aimed at tactical positioning.
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default 
defaultGeneva
default I had principles of political transition, so the ultimate aim is still a political transition away from the Assad regime.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ45 Mike Gapes:default May I ask you about the debate on arming the opposition? The European Union, at British and French insistence, ended its arms embargo, but it has not subsequently supplied lethal equipment to the opposition. What would have been the effect of doing so? What are the implications of the current position for the standing of the 
defaultUK
default and the other EU countries with regard to the attitude of the opposition?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default It depends on the level of vetting that would have been applied. President Obama signed a secret finding for the CIA to provide arms in April, but almost nothing happened for several months. The subsequent flow was an absolute trickle because the procedures for who could get the arms were so stringent. The trade-off is, the more stringent your vetting, the smaller your flow of arms. The Obama Administration’s nominee to run special operations at the Defence Department was asked about that in a congressional hearing. He was asked, “Would the 
defaultUS
default programme to train rebels at the present level make a strategic difference?” He said, “No, it wouldn’t.”
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ46 Mike Gapes:default What about the EU?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Well, the EU would not have done so on any greater scale than the 
defaultUS
default, so there is absolutely no way that it would have made more of a difference than US supplies.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ47 Mike Gapes:default What about the attitude and the perception among the opposition?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Which opposition?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ48 Mike Gapes:default Presumably we were not going to be arming the 
defaultal-
defaultNusra
default Front
default, but arguing for supposedly secular or moderate opposition. What is their attitude to the fact that they thought they were going to be given great assistance, particularly by the 
defaultUS
default but also by European countries, but now they are not?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default There was obviously a sense of embitterment, and I am sure that did persuade some proportion of the moderate opposition to move in the direction of groups such as the Islamic Front when they felt that there was going to be no serious outside support 
defaultform
default those who had suggested that there might be. However, I think they would also have been sorely disappointed by the scale at which the support would actually have occurred. Would it actually have brought sufficient good will to stave off the developments that we are now seeing? I am not so sure about that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ49 Mike Gapes:default What about the abortive decision on the air strikes, which we touched on earlier? How has that been perceived by the opposition, as well as by the Assad regime? Assad is obviously relieved because he is able to have at least another year in power while the chemical deal is concluded, but how do the opposition perceive what happened?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default They were furious and understandably so. They expected huge tactical opportunities opening up, particularly around 
defaultDamascus
default. The way in which the reversal occurred was seen as particularly galling, and I think that they saw this deal as having essentially legitimised Assad’s grip on power. I would not agree with all those assessments, but it would be silly to deny that they were absolutely furious.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ50 Mike Gapes:default Does that make it likely that any opposition-led Syria—if there is such a thing—would be more radical and hostile to western interests than would otherwise have been the case?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default Possibly, but I would also say, look at Libya, where there was extensive NATO air support for rebels and many of those rebels, who were the beneficiaries of that support, are still perfectly happy to have alliances of expedience with al-Qaeda-aligned militias in the east of Libya. So, on the whole, I think it does buy good will, and we did engender some bitterness. Would it have had a huge change in attitude of the opposition beyond what would otherwise have been the case? I am not persuaded.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ51 Mike Gapes:default Do you agree with Professor 
defaultGerges
default that a military strike would have been a disaster?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default No, I don’t agree at all. I think it could have had a powerful deterrent effect. I also think that the diplomatic solution that was reached was a sensible one.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ52 Sandra Osborne:default Can I ask you about the situation in 
defaultLebanon
default and the prospect of a civil war there? How likely do you think that is and what can the 
defaultUK
default and others do to shore up the situation?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default It is very hard, because 
defaultLebanon
default almost asymptotically approaches civil war every year. It is particularly fragile at the moment because of this neutral sense of vulnerability. Hezbollah feels its own strongholds have been continuously attacked since May and that the rise of a Syrian opposition within 
defaultSyria
default poses dangers to it that it hasn’t seen in a long while. I think the Syrian opposition within 
defaultLebanon
default sees opportunities here as well. On the whole, everyone understands Hezbollah remains the single most powerful military actor within 
defaultLebanon
default and that a breakdown of the status quo would not necessarily mean Hezbollah falling from power, but only a messy war in which Hezbollah would once again emerge on top.
default              
defaultI am not sure that Hezbollah’s opponents really want to pull down the entire system just yet. I also think its grip on power is fairly strong. We have seen a series of pretty impressive attacks, notably the attack on the Iranian embassy in 
defaultBeirut
default, which was almost unprecedented in that sense, but it is not really threatening Hezbollah’s grip on power, in my opinion.
default              
defaultOverall, Hezbollah’s political standing within 
defaultLebanon
default has plummeted. Its cross-sectarian appeal has plummeted—it is seen more and more as a sectarian actor than it ever was, particularly compared with how it was in 2006, when it was seen to resist Israeli aggression by many segments of Lebanese society. So it is severely weakened, but I am not sure that I would predict a civil war within the next year or so in 
defaultLebanon
default.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ53 Sandra Osborne:default What about the situation with refugees from 
defaultSyria
default? 
defaultLebanon
default, in particular, but other neighbouring countries already support quite high numbers of refugees, including the Palestinians. What is going to happen with that in the longer term? How sustainable is that for the foreseeable future?
default              
defaultShashank Joshi:default It poses a lot of risks, particularly radicalisation within those camps. If they come to be seen as sources of support for Sunni extremists by Hezbollah, you could see some pretty messy conflicts emerge. Hezbollah is already very concerned about hitting back at what it sees as Sunni areas of support in parts of 
defaultLebanon
default. They could easily become more militarised. They could easily become sources of extremism, radicalisation and militancy. From a purely humanitarian point of view, the more the fighting escalates around places like 
defaultDamascus
default, the greater these flows will become. The Lebanese state is not in a position to provide adequate care for these groups over the longer term. We have known that for a while and the same is true in 
defaultJordan
default as well. So that is not a new development as such.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default Thank you very much for coming along. As ever, your evidence is to the point. We really appreciate it and hope we can call on your services again.

default              
defaultQ54 Chair:default For our third and final session of the day, I welcome 
defaultShiraz Maher, Senior Fellow, International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, King
default’
defaults College London
default, and Dr Rim 
defaultTurkmani
default, Director of 
defaultMadani
default.
default              
defaultDr 
defaultTurkmani
default, I looked up what 
defaultMadani
default is, and it seems you are very much focused on a peaceful solution in 
defaultSyria
default. Do you feel that is rather pushing water uphill at the moment?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I do not see anything but a peaceful solution to this crisis. There is no violent way or military strategy that can end this crisis. Certainly, speaking as somebody who does not believe that violence is the right way to settle any conflict, we do still insist on peaceful solutions.
default              
defaultQ55 Chair:default Mr Maher, you are an expert on radicalisation. Do you feel that there is any prospect that the various warring groups can 
defaultgel
default together as a co-ordinated opposition?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default I think I would largely agree with the answer given by Shashank in that respect. There is no real reason or incentive for them to coalesce into one broad opposition. The problem we have now as well is that, of course, at some stage there will need to be a political solution and a negotiated settlement to end this crisis. The problem now is very complicated because of the presence al-Qaeda-aligned fighters from 
defaultJabhat
default al-
defaultNusra
default and 
defaultISIS
default, a
defaultd-
defaultDawla
default al-
defaultIsl
defaulta
defaultmiyya
default. Even if we were able to cajole some of the groups in the Islamic Front to come to the table to negotiate—I think we will be able to, with the passage of time, though not at this stage—we still face a huge, quite insurmountable, problem about how we resolve the problem of the jihadists now.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ56 Rory Stewartdefault:default Dr 
defaultTurkmani
default, when the UK Parliament voted on whether to intervene in 
defaultSyria
default, what do you think would have been the consequence if they had intervened in the way proposed?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default This is a very complex conflict. It is difficult to make any prediction, but the strategy that was proposed suggested that it did not aim to end the regime. I think what would have happened is a weaker regime. Nobody still would be able to finish it, and the regime itself would not be able to settle the crisis. I certainly think it would have seen direct interference from supporters of the regime, such as 
defaultIran
default, that would have been even stronger than the current involvement. I think everybody underestimated the desire of 
defaultRussia
default, 
defaultIran
default and 
defaultChina
default to support the regime. Any direct military attack on the Syrian regime would have been seen as a direct attack on 
defaultRussia
default and 
defaultIran
default. I do not think the recent breakthrough on the diplomatic front between 
defaultIran
default and the 
defaultUS
default would have been achieved had there been a military strike against the Syrian regime.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ57 Rory Stewart:default What do you think, as a Syrian who is an opponent of 
defaultBashar
default al-Assad? What is your sense of how elements of the Syrian population would have perceived a western intervention and military strike of that sort?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default People were very divided. At the moment when intervention was proposed, people had already lost hope. Most Syrians were living under very severe conditions, suffering from cold weather and hunger. So many would have said, “Yes, anything that brings a solution.” At the same time, many people said, “No, we don’t want western intervention.” I think that people would have been more interested in seeing the result of this. Probably, if the strike had ended the regime, they would have said, “That is great,” but most of the people I spoke to failed to see an end to the regime through military strikes—certainly not at that level—when the strike was mentioned.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ58 Rory Stewart:default The Professor stated that the West underestimated Assad’s strength and support, and underestimated the Syrian army. What in your experience leads the British Government to make such mistakes in their assessment?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I think the 
defaultUK
default misread the situation from the start. Its research on 
defaultSyria
default was already very weak. If you look at think-tanks and universities in the 
defaultUK
default, you can see that very little analysis and research is done on 
defaultSyria
default. The same applies to the experts at the Foreign Office, even those who speak Arabic and focus on 
defaultSyria
default. To compensate for that, the 
defaultUK
default should have focused on its embassy staff in 
defaultSyria
default early on in the crisis. They should have been kept on the ground to listen to people. The 
defaultUK
default should listen to the Syrians and not to people sitting 
defaultoutside the country. It should not have followed the American strategy and should have listened to Syrians.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultUK
default quickly cut all diplomatic ties and withdrew all ambassadors and embassy staff. We wanted them to be ambassadors for the people, not for the regime. We did not want the ambassador to go and talk to the regime; we wanted him to read the situation and to talk to the Syrian people to see what they wanted. Very early on, economic sanctions were applied just to respond to the pressure from the public, who were saying that something must be done. Although we argued a lot for them, there was the view from inside 
defaultSyria
default that sanctions never change a regime, and that the people, not the regime, would pay the price. Sanctions legitimise the illegal economy and de-legitimise the official economy, and that is what happened. That is one reason why we have a war economy right now. Nobody listened to the views. These are old views that we have written and that have appeared in statements and letters from people inside 
defaultSyria
default. Nobody has listened. We argued that the 
defaultUK
default should not increase international polarisation by joining a bloc against a bloc. We said that it is becoming an international conflict, and we need an international consensus to resolve it.
default              
defaultJoining the Friends of Syria will not help Syrians. Just thinking “We need to oppose the regime” is sticking to the strategy that we have to do whatever it takes to bash the regime, which is not helping Syrians. We have to help the Syrians. I think the 
defaultUK
default failed to listen to voices from inside the country and very quickly followed the 
defaultUS
default strategy, which was already not very clear.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ59 Rory Stewart:default So it is a failure of the embassy. Your perception, as a British Syrian, is that the embassy was not getting out and talking to people on the ground
default 
defaultenough.
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I think that when the embassy staff were in 
defaultSyria
default, they were talking to people, but they were quickly asked to leave 
defaultDamascus
default. When they were back in the 
defaultUK
default, they were quickly swapped with people who had not been in 
defaultSyria
default. Simon 
defaultCollis
default,
default 
defaultthe ambassador in 
defaultDamascus
default, was sent somewhere else. Frances Guy was appointed and she has done great work, but after she established good relations with the Syrian opposition, she was swapped with somebody else who had not been to 
defaultSyria
default and who did not know the situation inside. Even the staff of the 
defaultSyria
default desk are changed all the time. The people who worked at the embassy, who knew the people and who had a much better reading of the situation inside Syria, were moved to completely different departments.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ60 Rory Stewart:default Finally, what is your sense, 
defaultShiraz
default, of how the British Government have failed to listen to voices and to get their assessment right? What mechanisms led the British Government to underestimate the resilience of the Syrian regime, for example?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default Three points spring to mind. We fundamentally failed to understand fully the unique composition of Syrian society, and how the various tensions and otherwise would play out, as accentuated by the crisis. There was a sense that we had seen this before. We saw it with 
defaultEgypt
default and 
defaultLibya
default, where the Governments put on pro-Government demonstrations in an attempt to bolster support and to demonstrate the legitimacy of their own regimes. Of course, they crumbled away very quickly in both cases. Early on in 
defaultSyria
default, when the Government put on their own displays of power, we were perhaps more dismissive.
default              
defaultThere is certainly residual support for Assad. It is by no means a majority, but there is certainly a degree of support that he enjoys that is untypical of the kind of support that the other fallen regimes in 
defaultEgypt
default or 
defaultLibya
default had. There was a sense that we had seen this before, and that there would be a terminal ebbing of support for the Government as time went on. Of course, divisions have hardened, so the rebel side has hardened into a protracted position and the supporters of the regime have become quite entrenched in their position.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ61 Rory Stewart:default So how did the British Government get it wrong? What can they do to reform their systems to make sure they do not make the same mistakes again in other conflicts?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default I would echo what Shashank said in his testimony, and what Dr 
defaultTurkmani
default said: there needs to be data collection on the ground by embassy staff. I do not think it is just about embassy staff, though. The Foreign Office, like other Departments, is getting better at reaching out beyond the echo chamber of 
defaultWestminster
default and talking not just to academics, but think-tanks, journalists, NGOs and groups that have a perspective on the ground, to get a better sense of what other stakeholders are experiencing and sensing.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ62 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default You both seem very critical of the Foreign Office’s knowledge of things, or the viewpoint that it took. Would you go so far as to say that when President Obama said that Assad would go, and that was almost immediately echoed here in London by our Prime Minister, the UK was just echoing the Americans, or was that based on objective analysis by the Foreign Office?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I think part of it was echoing the Americans; the other part was misreading the situation and the lack of brave political leadership in the 
defaultUK
default. The 
defaultUK
default had a great opportunity to lead politically in the Syrian crisis and to present a new vision, sticking to one strategy and to what it said, but it failed that opportunity. Very quickly, it fell into a polarising attitude, giving strong statements that did not necessarily help the Syrian people.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ63 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default Do you think this Government were seeing things through the prism of, for example, 
defaultLibya
default and uprisings elsewhere, rather than seeing the genuine complexity in 
defaultSyria
default, which we can see now?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I think in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, some people expected that the Syrian regime would fall the same way the other Arab regimes fell, but they did not really understand the nature of the Syrian regime—how strongly the regime, the state, the intelligence services and the army are almost one thing. You cannot just overthrow this regime by making its President step down. There was so much focus on the President—more than he deserved—and the regime was far more complex than the person of the President. We can see this today: the regime is still committing huge atrocities, not just because of that one person, but because of what the Syrian regime is.
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default I do not wish to come across as critical of the Foreign Office. I actually think that the Foreign Office and other Government agencies that have been tasked with dealing with the various eruptions of the Arab Spring have been dealing with quite a unique and unforeseeable series of events—a series of events that are not just localised, but often intertwined with a far greater series of regional issues. I think everyone is probably working as hard as they possibly can to make sense of these things and to contextualise them as best they can. Of course, there was a sense—I think you are right, in so far as our reading of 
defaultSyria
default was characterised by events in 
defaultNorth Africa
default—that the Government would eventually fall and that there would be a terminal decline. That has obviously proved not to be the case.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ64 Mark defaultHendrickdefault:default Can I go on to the issue of 
defaultjihadis
default? Dr 
defaultTurkmani
default, you talk about not being able to solve anything through the use of military force. Some extremists—affiliates of al-Qaeda—do not really consider 
defaultShi’a
default to be genuine Muslims; they see a natural conflict there, and they see them as the enemy. If there is such a strong religious and ideological difference, how can it be resolved in any other way than by the method they are trying to use at the moment, which is conflict? Can I also ask you about the sense that this will come back home to wherever the 
defaultjihadis
default come from? This will go back to the country they came from. They will have been hardened and trained, and to them, what they are doing seems totally justifiable, through their own understanding—or misunderstanding—of their doctrine. How are we going to resolve these issues? How do we get round that?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I think this applies not only to the 
defaultjihadis
default who are fighting the regime, but to the extremists who are fighting on the side of the regime, such as people from 
defaultHezbollah
default, 
defaultIran
default or 
defaultIraq
default. The issue here is that, yes, the new authority may be obliged to fight in other ways those who refuse to join any peaceful solution, but the peaceful solution has to be offered first, and it has never been an option. On the contrary, the option of escalating the violence created the ground that gave rise to all the jihadists. There was no jihadist group in 
defaultSyria
default that began straight away in an area of 
defaultSyria
default where there was no fighting. 
defaultJihadism
default does not arise from a safe area. First violence spreads into the area, with the regime attacking the people and people responding. Then it gets far more complex, and becomes a pointless conflict with support from outside for both sides. That creates a perfect environment for 
defaultjihadism
default. You have a failed state, you have violence and you have people who are desperate. This makes it very easy for people to be recruited.
default              
defaultI am a Syrian, I know Syrian people and I grew up in 
defaultSyria
default. I want to emphasise that the people who make up the body of these groups are not as you describe. They are merely Syrians who found no other options and no other way to go. They were very desperate. Yes, the leadership of the jihadist groups is extreme and will continue to fight any coming authority, regardless of who wins this conflict, but we have a chance of taking these human resources from them if we offer peace. If we look at young Syrians who are joining the jihadists because there is no other way, I think we have a huge opportunity to weaken this extreme mentality.
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default You mentioned the sectarian element and disregard for the 
defaultShi’a
default community. I want to add to that in two ways. First, I largely echo what 
defaultDr 
defaultTurkmani
default said about what is happening on the ground in Syrian society. Prior to the uprising, it was not an extremist society. It was not a society where there was a great flourishing of these 
defaulttakfiri
default 
defaultideas, for want of a better phrase. Clearly, that is flourishing right now in the current context.
default              
defaultMy second point is that I diverge a little from others in thinking that it is getting increasingly difficult to de-radicalise people. People are being brutalised by conflict and being radicalised by what they have seen. You have to bear in mind the organisations’ memberships. 
defaultJabhat
default al-
defaultNusra
default has more of a Syrian character, whereas ISIS, a
defaultd-
defaultDawla
default al-
defaultIsl
defaulta
defaultmiyya
default, or the 
defaultIslamic State
default is more composed of a foreign fighter contingent, and of foreigners per se who came with that organisation. They are not fighting 24 hours a day. They might spend two days of the week fighting, and they spend the rest of their time in religious indoctrination classes. A large part of the classes involves really absorbing and imbibing the 
defaultal-Qaeda
default narrative and its world view.
default              
defaultOur centre has been in touch with a number of Britons who are in 
defaultSyria
default right now, fighting with jihadist organisations. It is quite telling: we can see from our interactions with them that they have adopted wholesale that ideology and that world view. They must have been radicalised to an extent before leaving the West, because that would have motivated their departure. However, if they were not already highly radicalised before they left the West, we can say with a degree of confidence that even those who do return to the West will bring with them the very devastating world view that we have seen proliferate over the last decade or so.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ65 Mike Gapes:default May I put to you a scenario that you might say is fanciful? If the international community and particularly the 
defaultUnited States
default had decided to bring in a no-fly zone in April or May 2011, before the radicalisation, and had not betrayed the secular people who were calling for democratic change, might the circumstances now be completely different? I suggest that because there was no stomach here or in 
defaultWashington
default for any form of involvement, and because of weariness about 
defaultAfghanistan
default, 
defaultIraq
default and wherever, interventionism was not fashionable. It therefore did not happen, and we now reap the consequences of that.
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default My perception is that you are correct. That was very much my view in 2011 and even up until the start of 2012. Once the siege of Baba 
defaultAmr
default in Homs started, where Marie Colvin was killed, I think that was the real tipping point, when Syrian people themselves really started to realise that there was no alternative but to pick up arms and to form military resistance against the regime.
default              
defaultInto that vacuum, of course, the people that were best placed to capitalise on that chaos were the jihadists. It was their narrative that could offer salvation, their narrative that offered confidence; and of course they had an ability to pick up arms and resources, and to reactivate informal networks, around the Gulf in particular, of funding and foreign fighters and so on, that they had utilised against western coalition forces in 
defaultIraq
default. So they had the expertise, the know-how and the ability to exploit the growing chaos within 
defaultSyria
default.
default              
defaultI think if you look at what a lot of the Syrian opposition was saying at the time, it was calling for a degree of intervention, but that does not mean putting boots on the ground. I think, particularly in public discourse, there was a real lack of understanding: people imagined an 
defaultIraq
default type of scenario, where we literally had tanks and soldiers rolling through into the capital. If we had imposed some sort of no-fly zone, and worked with the rebels on the ground, we could have, in the way we did in 
defaultLibya
default, established a transitional authority on the ground. One of the big problems we have in 
defaultSyria
default right now is that there is no one who can claim to represent the opposition and is on the ground and holds legitimacy. We have heard lots about the Syrian Islamic Front right now saying that the Syrian National Council does not represent them, that 
defaultthey will not be represented at Geneva, and that is because they are not on the ground; they are not within Syria, and we have had no ability to set up a transitional authority inside the country.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ66 Mike Gapes:default Dr 
defaultTurkmani
default, do you agree with that view?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default No, I don’t.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ67 Mike Gapes:default Why not?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I completely disagree. In the period that you refer to, people were being killed mainly in non-violent demonstrations and in the basement of the intelligence offices, in detention centres. I do not see how a no-fly zone can protect those people.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ68 Mike Gapes:default What could have protected them?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default Maybe not to put the killer in the corner. I think the main killer was the Syrian regime. The Syrian regime is the Syrian 
defaultMukhabarat
default intelligence, the leadership of the army and the presidency, and these have been pushed further and further into the corner. They were pushed into a corner where they felt an existential threat—
default[
defaultLaughter.
default]
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ69 Mike Gapes:default I do not understand what you mean by “put in the corner”. If a regime is carrying out brutal violence against peaceful protesters, how can the peaceful protesters prevent that brutal violence, except, presumably, by no longer protesting? Is that—
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default You did not ask me what the protesters should do. You asked what the external forces should have done. What I am saying is: who had the power in that country? It was the regime. I am talking about the period you referred to: the first four months. It was the regime that was the strongest party; it was the regime that was killing, right? So when this regime was confronted with any level of violence, even just one bullet, it would respond 100 times more violently. So surely by confronting it with violence, we were just calling for more and more violence from the regime.
default              
defaultThere are so many examples. I will just give you one that I know of. The area of al-
defaultWaer
default, the suburb of 
defaultHoms
default where my sister and family live, was a safe area, where most of the people of 
defaultHoms
default resorted to. It was safe; it was highly populated. The regime did not interfere with this area—not because of its good will, but, for whatever reason, it did not interfere with it. Once fighting groups took a decision to enter this area—and there was a firm decision; it was not self-defence—the regime decided to send missiles and to apply a blockade. Somebody died in the cold weather in that rich area. So, yes, violence got the worst out of the regime. We knew that it is in control of the country, and this is how it is going to respond, and kill its own people. There is nothing funny about this.
default              
defaultMike Gapes:default I am not finding it funny.
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I am not talking to you, sir.
default              
defaultChair:default Before you go any further, Mike, can I just say to members of the audience here that we listen to witnesses with respect in this Committee, and if you are unable to do so, then I am going to ask you to leave the Committee.
default&#xa0;

defaultQ70 Mike Gapes:default Can I ask about the attitude of the opposition now to intervention? It is a similar question to what I asked earlier.
default 
defaultClearly, the decision was taken in August not to have military action. There was also, in effect, a decision not to provide lethal weaponry to the opposition, even though the European Union had lifted its arms embargo. What is your take on the opposition’s attitude to the international community, given the failure from 2011 and where we are now? Has that played a major role in radicalisation?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default It is very problematic to talk about a monolithic opposition in this regard. If we start at the jihadist end of the spectrum, there is no desire to see any form of western or European interaction or involvement in the Syrian conflict. They want to do it themselves and they believe they have the ability to do this, so there is no desire or will to see any form of co-operation.
default              
defaultAs you move towards the more conservative 
defaultSalafi
default organisations that form part of the new Islamic Front, with groups such as 
defaultLiwa
default al-
defaultTawhid
default and so on, they have their own channels and ability to get weapons, arms, munitions and so on. They are doing that largely through gulf and private networks as well as semi-formal ones. Again, as we talk to them, the perception seems to be very much, “We know what we are doing and we know who we are dealing with. We are happy to continue.”
default              
defaultI think there is a sense that, essentially, people have given up on the West. It is very interesting to watch the migration of the chants and slogans of the Syrian revolution over the last three years as that is a good barometer of what people have been seeing. Now, there is very much a sense of, “This is not your revolution any more, Obama. This is for us, and we will take it in this direction—whether you like it or not.” That is the point: the West has lost any ability to have any say any more in what the future trajectory of 
defaultSyria
default or its revolution is.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ71 Mike Gapes:default So the choice now is between a 
defaultBa’athist
default regime backed by 
defaultRussia
default, 
defaultIran
default and Hezbollah and a radicalised Islamist movement that rejects democratic, western, secular values?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default Unfortunately, my reading of the situation is that the great loss and betrayal of the Syrian revolution is that it has fallen to one of two scenarios—essentially, you are faced with the chip pan and the fire. It did not have to be that way, but unfortunately it has degenerated into such a state now that that is what we are faced with. You have to bear in mind that the strongest fighting forces right now are, if not the al-Qaeda elements, the conservative Islamists on the ground. The FSA has largely become a redundant fighting force on the ground. So who is left, ultimately, to take the military campaign forward?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ72 Mike Gapes:default Do you agree with that perception, Dr 
defaultTurkmani
default?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default No, it is not either the regime or a radicalised opposition. I think this is how the regime wanted us to see things. It created the image of an evil opponent so that we would say, “It is this or the regime,” so that the answer would be the regime. The answer has to be power sharing, but power sharing means no more regime. If 
defaultGeneva
default I or Geneva II is implemented, the result will be a new coalition and new authority. The regime will be part of that, but the whole thing will not be the regime.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ73 Mike Gapes:default Why should anyone in the Assad regime or the 
defaultAlawite
default community agree to those terms at this moment?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default Because it is the only safe exit. The regime itself in two and a half years failed to deliver. It failed to win politically and it failed to win militarily—it failed on every front and it cannot carry on like this 
defaultany more
default. The regime failed its own loyalists and it did not even deliver what it promised its own state supporters, such as 
defaultRussia
default and 
defaultIran
default. It failed to lead and it failed to manage the conflict, so it cannot carry on like this. The only safe exit now is through the only channel open to the regime: to share power in the Government of Syria. I am not saying that it will accept that necessarily. There does not seem to be enough international will for that to happen. The regime is now behaving as a Russian agent, not as a regime for its own people. So if the international balance does not change, I do not see a real political change happening out of this.
default              
defaultHowever, I would like to emphasise that here we are all talking about the military groups and the regime, and nobody is talking about the Syrian people, especially those who started the uprising and the Syrian civil society. The new emerging power in 
defaultSyria
default is the Syrian civil society. It is still in its infancy and still cannot be compared to the international mature civil society, but there are numerous Syrian civil groups that are very active on the ground and able to deliver on the ground. It is in their best interest for the killing to stop, to have a ceasefire and for the crisis to be over, whereas it is not necessarily in the best interest of warlords to end the crisis. If there are to be peace talks, I would rather have at the table those who have an interest in ending the crisis, not just parties that are gaining from the continuation of the conflict. That is why I would argue that there should be much stronger involvement of the new player on the ground: Syrian civil society.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ74 Sandra Osborne:default What is your take on the refugee situation and the people who have been displaced within 
defaultSyria
default? How can a civil society develop in such circumstances, within such a violent situation, in a way that could bring about peace?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default What was the first part of the question? I am sorry, I did not hear it.
default              
defaultSandra Osborne:default It was about the refugees and people who have been displaced within 
defaultSyria
default. How does that square with the development of a civil society that could bring about peace in such violent circumstances? I do not really understand how that is practical.
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default Even within the refugee community itself—there are now millions outside 
defaultSyria
default—there are numerous civil society groups serving that community. I just came back from 
defaultGaziantep
default in 
defaultTurkey
default, where there are half a million Syrians and numerous civil society groups responding to the needs of the Syrian society, or helping the Syrian society inside the country. There are still so many Syrians inside the country, and we have to ask: who is running the society? Is it the political groups? No. Is it the military groups? No. It is the silent player in the background: the newly emerging civil society. It is delivering services, offering protection, delivering food, assisting the wounded and doing media work. The more I engage with it, the more I look for them and am impressed with their ability to be active in an environment so very hostile to any civil action.
default              
defaultI want to go back to the point about where the 
defaultUK
default got it wrong, and to the point about civil society. It is a public movement, and public movements take time to develop leadership. When the UK decided to recognise the opposition in exile as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people, it actually removed the opportunity for the real leadership—the grass roots leadership—to emerge from within civil society circles to lead the movement and become its real voice, expressing the real needs of Syrian society and calling for a solution. Instead, the 
defaultUK
default recognised people who live most of the time in 
defaultFrance
default or in the 
defaultUK
default. The people inside 
defaultSyria
default were saying, “Those people do not represent us.”
default              
defaultI would say that the leadership model was applied was wrong. The leadership should have come from the bottom up, not from the top down. I think there was interference with the Syrian public movement to impose a particular leadership on them and to recognise a particular player as the sole legitimate representative. Who is any non-Syrian party to decide who is the legitimate representative? The Syrian regime is not legitimate; how can anyone else decide who the legitimate party is?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ75 Sandra Osborne:default Do you agree with the previous witness that there is potential for radicalisation among refugees both within 
defaultSyria
default and in other countries, such as 
defaultLebanon
default? What are your views on that?
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default On radicalisation?
default              defaultSandra Osborne:default Yes, on extremism—the potential to become involved and radicalised because of being in these camps and having the experience of a refugee. I think you will have heard the previous witness suggest that.
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default Most of the people in the camps are women and children and the elderly, so it is difficult to radicalise them. However, there is now a new emerging group that is really dangerous: children at 12 or 13 years old are being routed in the same direction as happened to those in the Palestinian camps, where the PLO got more human resources. They are now being called to join this violent conflict. This is certainly very dangerous but again who is in the camps? It is certainly not the fighters, not the young people who have been brutalised.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ76 Sandra Osborne:default Do you have any comments?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default People have been brutalised on such a large scale and, of course, people in the camps are not immune to that. They are suffering in a unique and particular way that exposes them and makes them vulnerable to radicalisation. We are seeing younger people than before being radicalised—the example of the Palestinian connection is a good one. Certainly, again, with a lot of the jihadists we interact with and talk to and whose media output we monitor, you are seeing individuals as young as 13 and 14 serving within their ranks—not to a significant extent but it is happening. Again, if this conflict is protracted and continues over many years you would expect to see those numbers grow over time.
default              
defaultI want to come back to one of the points about the civil society. It is difficult to see quite what shape and manner this civil society movement we are hearing about is taking. Ultimately, if they are the ones delivering the infrastructure now away from the state—delivering food into certain areas and so on—you have to ask who is opening up the supply lines to ensure those food supplies can get in. You are seeing a starvation campaign take place right now on the outskirts of 
defaultDamascus
default. Who was it who went down to those parts to try to reopen supply routes in? It was the jihadist fighters, unfortunately. So even these civil society organisations are having to cut deals and do business with the jihadists.
default              
defaultUltimately, no matter who goes to the talking table now in order to cut a deal and to make a political union that can resolve the conflict and bring it to an end, I don’t see how that is possible unless the jihadists, who are increasingly dominating the fighting, agree to it. They, of course, as we have seen over many, many years are not ones to negotiate and are not ones to enter into any kind of political settlement. You are right, Dr 
defaultTurkmani
default, to say this is precisely what Assad wanted. Assad, looking at this conflict back in 2011, was looking at what happened to Gaddafi and so on, thinking “How do I prevent the West coming in? I have to create this counterweight.” So the West is faced with this bipolar disparity, Assad on the one hand and the jihadists on the other. It has been a masterstroke by the 
defaultBa’athist
default regime in what it has produced.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ77 Chair:default A final question: is there anything that could be done to persuade President Assad to allow food and medicine through to the communities under siege? Do you think he would agree to it
default 
defaultunder any circumstances?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default I have seen no evidence of that at any stage of this conflict.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ78 Chair:default Is he using the lack of food and medicine as a tool of repression?
default              
defaultShiraz Maher:default It is a tool of repression. As 
defaultProfessor 
defaultGerges
default pointed out, 
defaultDamascus
default is obviously the jewel in the crown. They are making it very clear that the fight for 
defaultDamascus
default will be an existential zero sum game. In that context, they are willing to show already the extent to which they will go to defend the capital.
default              
defaultDr defaultTurkmanidefault:default I have been involved in some negotiations to allow humanitarian aid into some of the areas under siege. The regime did not collaborate in most of these cases.
default              
defaultIt always helps if there is a mediator and a monitor, and we don’t have those two elements
default 
defaultfor any negotiations to succeed. The international community withdrew the very limited numbers of political teams and monitors who were present in 
defaultSyria
default at some point. Without them, people will have to go to the jihadists or the Red Crescent or whoever is a player right now on the Syrian land.
default              
defaultI think the focus has to go back on to the humanitarian situation. It is unimaginable that in the 21
defaultst
default century we have people dying of hunger and of the cold weather in a rich country like 
defaultSyria
default. It is unbelievable. It is a shame on all of us. Any player who is a party to this conflict is responsible for this. We have to shift back the focus on to the humanitarian crisis and to pressure whoever, whether it is the regime or any other player, to allow humanitarian access for those people.
default              
defaultIt does not always work, but the pressure has to carry on. Everybody has to be made responsible. There must be further engagement; we need more people in 
defaultSyria
default. We need Mr 
defaultBrahimi’s
default team to be larger—in 
defaultSyria
default, for example, there are few people. What can they do? There is no international presence and the regime can do whatever it wants. It can get away with anything. There are hardly any journalists, diplomats or monitors. Without those, it is certainly going to be very difficult for any deal to succeed and to carry on.
default              
defaultA ceasefire is desperately needed. This is a complex crisis and we cannot see a simple solution, but certainly a ceasefire can be applied in certain areas of 
defaultSyria
default. I sent at least one very important ceasefire plan to the representative of the UK Government to the Syrian opposition. I told them that the regime agreed to the plan, and Mr Annan agreed to it. I did not even get an answer by e-mail that they had seen the plan. When I asked about it again, it was completely ignored, and that was more than a year ago when it was possible to have a ceasefire.
default              
defaultI really want to stress that we have to put peace as the A and B option—not just A; not just say we want peace, and option B is to lift the ban on arming on other fronts. If we believe in peace, we have to be committed to peace. We have to do whatever it takes to achieve peace. The 
defaultUK
default has claimed it is all for peaceful transition, but in reality we have not seen a strategy that is strong enough to support this claim.
default              
defaultChair:default You have to recognise there are limits to what a single country can do from several thousand miles away. Anyway, thank you very much for giving us your opinions, both of you. It is very much appreciated.
