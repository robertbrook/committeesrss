[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0; In August 2013, Kirklees Council was invited to provide evidence to the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee relating to its experience of the public’s understanding of climate change. &#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Kirklees Council is a metropolitan borough of West Yorkshire, England. It has a population of approximately 423,000, making Kirklees one of the larger local authority districts in England and Wales (ranking eleventh out of 348 districts). Kirklees has approximately 175,000 households, 116,000 (67%) of which are owner occupied. Around 39% of the energy used in Kirklees is for domestic purposes.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Kirklees Council has long been committed to tackling climate change, particularly by reducing domestic carbon emissions. Over the last 10 years the Council has attracted circa £38m of external funding which has provided subsidies for energy improvements to homes. The Council has also contributed c £18 million capital match funding to deliver energy improvements. &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; Kirklees was the first Local Authority to develop and deliver the award winning 

[[[Warm Zone]]] scheme (2007–2010), which was open to all residents and where over 51,000 households received free loft and cavity wall insulation.&#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Post Warm Zone projects have included:  &#xa0;

[[[Kirklees BIG Energy Upgrade]]]

[[[ (2010-2012)]]]Kirklees worked with local authorities and registered social landlords (RSLs) across Yorkshire to tackle whole house, whole community energy efficiency upgrades on hard to treat homes.  This project was supported financially by the European Union. It attracted £7million investment from the European Regional Development Fund as part of Europe’s support for the region’s economic development through the Yorkshire and Humber ERDF Programme 2007-13. £1million was secured for Kirklees, and 250 properties had external solid wall insulation installed. Some properties also received several other measures to deliver a whole house, whole community approach to energy efficiency which improved the health and wellbeing of the local residents.&#xa0;

[[[1.5.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[RE-Charge]]]

[[[ (2008-2011)]]]The £2.7m 3 year Council investment programme helped 281 private households across Kirklees, install 296 renewable energy generating technologies.  It attracted £260K of external funding and prepared households to benefit from the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and/or Feed-in Tariff (FIT), pre-empting the Green Deal.

[[[Hillhouse Greening the Gap]]]

[[[ (2010)]]]Kirklees Council was successful in securing £500,000 from DECC’s Low Carbon Communities Challenge Fund (LCCC). 53 private sector houses and 4 community centres in the Hillhouse area of Huddersfield had solar PV installed for free, plus other energy saving measures to improve the energy efficiency of the properties. Income generated from the Feed in Tariff is being invested in the community. To date this income amounts to £58k.&#xa0;

[[[fficiency in Kirklees Council homes]]]

[[[ (ongoing)]]]Kirklees Council owns ~23,000 domestic properties which are managed by Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing.  The council and KNH have made significant investment in energy efficiency measures through ‘Decent Homes’ budgets and targeted energy budgets. Measures include gas boiler replacements, loft insulation top ups, external wall insulation, ground source heat pumps, solar thermal hot water, solar photo voltaic and a biomass boiler. This investment has dramatically improved the energy efficiency of our homes, increased the average SAP rating to 72.4, reduced our carbon emissions by 23% since 2005, helped tackle fuel poverty and created local jobs and a skilled supply chain.  &#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0; Each project has required a separate communications plan and approach to marketing. The reference to climate change has varied across each project.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0; In the Council’s experience, the level of understanding of climate change and the science behind it is generally good among our residents.  In 2010 we conducted a Greener Living Survey which found that 95% of survey respondents believed that the world’s climate is changing, and 74% said that their everyday actions contributed to climate change. 86% of respondents also agreed that climate change would have an impact on Kirklees in the next 50 years, and i) saving money, ii) convenience/services making it easy, and iii) health benefits were the survey respondents' top three motivations to live a greener lifestyle.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Utilising these survey results, we are keen to lead the way as a Council by showing our residents that we are investing in measures to tackle climate change but that will also help individuals financially and in terms of health benefits. &#xa0;

[[[Context / Rationale]]]&#xa0;3.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We know that the policies, strategies and services that we develop and deliver as a Council have an impact upon the environment and that we have an opportunity to shape a more sustainable future to improve people’s lives. The climate is changing, so we must adapt and be prepared for the challenges ahead. The Government’s Stern Review in 2006 concluded that the benefits of strong, early action on climate change far outweigh the costs of not acting.&#xa0;3.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK has committed to challenging greenhouse gas reduction targets via the 2008 Climate Change Act. As a Local Authority we have a part to play in helping the UK achieve these challenging targets in our role as community leader, service provider, estate manager and role model.&#xa0;3.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In June 2010 we made a commitment to protect the environment and reduce CO2 as part of the Kirklees Partnership Charter and our Vision commits us to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of Kirklees.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2010, the Council approved its

[[[Integrated Investment Strategy (IIS). ]]]This strategy is a framework for investment which sets out the priorities for how the Council will allocate its resources and attract external investment to improve the lives of all Kirklees residents. One of the strategic aims is

[[[ ]]]for a district better prepared to manage the effects of climate change –

[[[ ]]]setting out a clear 40% carbon emissions reduction target by 2020 for both the Council and the District, from a 2005 baseline.&#xa0;3.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  The 2011 Leeds City Region Mini-Stern Review, focussed on the economics of decarbonising the local economy.  A separate appendix was prepared on the Kirklees economy, which identified that: 3.1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In response to this,

[[[rly signatory to Climate Local. ]]]Climate Local is a new initiative led by the Local Government Association LGA) to drive, inspire and support council action on climate change. It succeeds the Nottingham Declaration on Climate Change (of which Kirklees Council was also a signatory) by offering a framework that enables councils to reflect local priorities and opportunities for action. Climate Local focuses on councils’ efforts both to reduce carbon emissions and to improve their resilience to the anticipated changes in the climate.3.1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In December 2012 the Council approved a set of ‘Climate Local Commitments’ for Kirklees to stimulate a green economy and create jobs, help tackle climate change and provide affordable warmth for our residents, building on achievements to date. There are six key headline commitments as outlined below:Creating local jobs in the green sector and ensuring we have the appropriate skills for a low carbon economyContinue to aim to provide affordable warmth and tackle fuel poverty. This will help improve the health and wellbeing of Kirklees residentsLeading by example through the efficient use of energy and water in our buildings, street lighting and fuel use by fleet vehiclesIncreasing greener transport and transport connectivity in Kirklees, thus reducing transport related carbon emissions. Developing future plans to reduce waste and maximise diversion from landfill.Delivering a setting for investment, maximising biodiversity and reducing costs.&#xa0;

[[[Working with businesses – the Kirklees Business Environment Voucher scheme]]]

[[[ (£250k)]]]This scheme provides a 50% grant for Kirklees businesses for projects that will help reduce energy, waste and water costs. This project helps Kirklees businesses save money, stimulates the local economy by supporting local suppliers and installers to implement the measures, and reduces district carbon emissions.

[[[Working with the public - ]]]

[[[Completion of Kirklees Energy Saver Scheme and Kirklees Energy Saver 2]]]

[[[ (£400k)]]]The Council secured £576K from the Government (Department of Energy and Climate Change) as part of a Green Deal pilot initiative to deliver a scheme called Kirklees Energy Saver. The scheme was launched in January 2013 to home owners and offered free energy assessments and interest free loans or grants via utility - Energy Company Obligation (ECO) - funding. The loans and grants are to install energy saving measures such as boilers, wall insulation, glazing and loft insulation. The scheme focused on 10 target areas which were already ‘warmed up’ due to the programme of work previously carried out on Council housing in the areas.  The scheme will help over 300 home owners install energy saving measures in their homes via a grant or a loan.The Kirklees Energy Saver 2 (KES2) project will build on the success of the Kirklees Energy Saver scheme (KES1) which has been over-subscribed. It will also offer specific support to the most vulnerable residents in Kirklees. There will be an offer of a home visit to provide advice and support and funding for heating repairs and other energy saving measures, with referrals to partner organisations.  &#xa0;

[[[Work ]]]

[[[to reduce carbon emissions across the]]]

[[[ Council ]]]

[[[(£350k)]]]This programme will deliver a range of energy/carbon reduction projects to reduce the Council’s energy costs and carbon emissions, and help us meet our 40% carbon reduction target by 2020. These include continued investment in LED traffic lights, upgrading car park lighting and energy efficiency measures within council buildings.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0; In Kirklees, the last decade has seen a number of changes in the way the authority addresses climate change issues and communicates with the public. Initially, resources were focussed on 

[[[raising awareness of]]] 

[[[climate change]]] through the Council’s ‘Green Ambition’ environmental programme, and explaining the scientific argument to engage people in the broader consequence of rising temperatures and what they could do at an individual level. This was in line with national media and communicating the findings from key research such as the Stern Report. &#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0; As time progressed, and council priorities evolved, messages which were originally about ‘tackling climate change’ became focussed on 

[[[reducing carbon emissions]]]. Generally speaking, the message that climate change is real and happening is to an extent understood and accepted, and the focus moved to reducing the key cause of climate change – carbon emissions. This mirrored local authority data collection requirements such as those set out in Local Area Agreements and National Indicators (185 and 186). &#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Most recently, during the economic downturn, communication with the public on matters concerning climate change has centred on 

[[[finance]]]

[[[, fuel poverty]]]

[[[,]]]

[[[ related health issues, ]]]

[[[and job creation]]]. For example, using less energy in the home has been promoted as a means of mitigating the impact of income reduction from other areas such as the Welfare Reform. With dramatic reductions in council resources to support this agenda (both in staffing levels and available investment funding), projects are progressed where inward investment is generated reducing pressure on council capital and ensuring best value for money is achieved.   &#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0; The Council’s current projects aimed at the public are the Kirklees Energy Saver Scheme and a recent collective energy switch. Both schemes are aimed at supporting the residents of Kirklees to 

[[[reduce their home energy bills]]] and meet the Council’s key objectives of 

[[[reducing fuel poverty and providing affordable warmth]]]. They have both been communicated effectively via the following routes:&#xa0;4.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Learning from projects has demonstrated that people have been motivated to participate in schemes for a variety of reasons. Financial benefits alone are in many cases unlikely to drive behaviour change; we have seen that the impact of tackling areas street by street is incredibly powerful in stimulating uptake via word of mouth and seeing neighbours take up an offer. Additionally, taking a scheme door to door increases uptake due to the trust in the Council brand and reassurance that contractors have been through a robust selection process.&#xa0;4.6&#xa0;&#xa0; A recent development while delivering work via the Kirklees Energy Saver Scheme has been a sudden drop in ECO funding by the energy supplier for external wall insulation. This has led to difficult communication with affected Kirklees residents, and demonstrates the challenge Councils face in maintaining trust while being vulnerable to external market influences.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Kirklees has evidenced its extensive track record of delivering home energy efficiency projects across the district. The success of each project has involved key partners – with functions ranging from the provision of funding, to installation of physical measures. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Going forward, the council is a committed partner in the Leeds City Region and associated ‘City Deal’ and recognises that this is an effective way to engage and co-operate with our partner authorities and private sector for the benefit of residents.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Some key examples of current projects where other Local Authorities and/or Government bodies have been engaged are outlined below. &#xa0;

[[[5.3.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Collective Energy Switch ]]]Between February and May 2013, Community Energy Direct (CED - a Community Benefit Industrial &amp; Provident Society) conducted a collective energy tariff switch as a Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC)-funded partnership project. Project partners were Kirklees, along with Bradford, Leeds, Wakefield and York local authorities, Rochdale Borough Housing, Fresh Horizons and Wakefield District Housing.&#xa0;

[[[5.3.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Kirklees Energy Saver]]]Via a joint bid with Leeds City Council, Kirklees successfully secured £718k from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to deliver a green deal pilot programme across Kirklees. This will help secure a further circa £425K Energy Company funding (ECO) into Kirklees. The total funding for the pilot is £1.393M which includes Council capital of £150k. A managing agent and contractor have been procured to deliver this project, with close links to an energy supplier.&#xa0;

[[[5.3.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Leeds City Region Green Deal ]]]Kirklees Council is part of the Leeds City Region collaborative approach to procure a Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation funding and delivery partner. Working alongside the ten other Local Authorities in the region, Kirklees is providing valuable input to the scheme which aims to be available for all residents in the city region from April 2014. &#xa0;

[[[5.3.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Climate Local Network]]]As a Climate Local signatory, Kirklees is represented at all Climate Local events organised by the Local Government Association and often shares best practice with other Local Authorities. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;6.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Kirklees is one local authority that has built up trust with its residents through their work on climate change, and gained a national reputation and acknowledgement of its good work. We should be supported to continue this communication with the public.&#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities have a lot of learning to share regarding how best to engage with the public on climate change and the local and practical problems and successes of delivery.&#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0; The financial and health impacts of climate change are among the key motivators for the public to change their behaviour and live a greener lifestyle.&#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0; Collaborative working and larger scale projects with other Local Authorities have attractive economies of scale, especially in the current climate of diminishing resources.&#xa0;6.5&#xa0;&#xa0; In contrast, local authority work on the climate change agenda is at risk in view of the current (and ongoing) budgetary constraints, and the unreliable and unstable utility ECO funding situation.&#xa0;6.6&#xa0;&#xa0; Behaviour change activities are extremely resource intensive – where possible, local authorities should be enabled to continue improving home energy efficiency with physical measures to reduce domestic carbon emissions.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK Climate Change Act 2008&#xa0;sets legally binding carbon emission reduction targets for 2020 (reduction of&#xa0;34%&#xa0;in greenhouse gas emissions) and for&#xa0;2050 (reduction of&#xa0;at least 80%&#xa0;in greenhouse gas emissions) from 1990 levels, and introduced five-yearly carbon budgets to help ensure those targets are met.  In June 2011 the Government set in law its fourth Carbon Budget to reduce emissions 50% under 1990 levels by 2025.
