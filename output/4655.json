"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mr J Vaughan (ESG 37)&#xa0;\nI read the transcript of your meeting. I work as a financial analyst for an oil company in Aberdeen. My company has significant investments in the \nEagleford\n and \nBakken\n unconventional plays in the US. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 5 (how much energy one \nfrack\n pad could produce compared to one large wind turbine) was, I thought, a very good question. The weather isn't great this weekend so I spent some time thinking about it. \n&#xa0;\nAs you might guess there\n&#xa0;\nare many variables,\n&#xa0;\nranges and\n&#xa0;\ninterpretations to work with. You could pick holes in all the numbers I have used, but to answer the question\n&#xa0;\nyou have to make some assumptions. I estimate\n&#xa0;\nthat \nbetween 76 and 171 turbines are required for one&#xa0;pad. This is shown at cell D20 and D21 of Sheet 1 attached.\n&#xa0;\n My calculations compare the energy output from a gas well compared to a turbine over the lifetime of production.\n&#xa0;\nLooking at the spreadsheet boxes:\n1. This calculates the\n&#xa0;\nenergy generated by a wind turbine over its life span - \n115GWh. The \nEnercon\n E70 is a typical turbine deployed\n&#xa0;\nwhere I live in \nStonehaven\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. The comparable energy from a shale gas well is \n1,096GWh using the \nmid point\n of \nprof\n Davies quote of production.\n&#xa0;\nHere we\n&#xa0;\nhave to convert volumes of gas to energy.\n3. The volumes quoted by \nprof\n Davies are likely historic. The shale oil/gas industry is evolving rapidly, with constantly\n&#xa0;\nincreasing efficiency and increase in production. Here I use the estimated future recovery by EQT, a significant player in the Marcellus.\n4.In this box I calculate the number of turbines per well\n&#xa0;\nand pad. Prof Davies said in answer to Q4 that 5.9 \nbcf\n was a very small number. To give that context I calculated the number of houses heated for a year using his mid point for a well is 66 thousand. A more realistic number might be 149 thousand. Included is the number of houses lit per turbine.\n&#xa0;\nOn sheet 2 of the spreadsheet I cut extracts from various websites that I visited. All the information I used is either from your transcript or websites I looked up.\n&#xa0;\nIn question 17 Mr Doughty mentions £70 billion. The \nBowland\n shale was also discussed.\n&#xa0;\n The British Geological Association give a range for the resources at \nBowland\n (the amount in the ground)\n&#xa0;\nwith a stab at\n&#xa0;\nmid point\n of 1,329tcf.\n&#xa0;\nA 10% recovery factor is 133tcf. Current wholesale prices at NBP in the UK are ~68pence/therm. That is £7 per\n&#xa0;\nmcf\n. That\n&#xa0;\nequates to \n£926bn. The mix of hydrocarbons\n&#xa0;\nfrom wells varies widely. The Marcellus is mostly gas. The \nEagleford\n players are aiming for the liquids window. The \nBowlands\n will be a mix of gas, NGLs and crude.\n&#xa0;\nFor comparison if the hydrocarbons were all crude, 133tcf equates\n&#xa0;\nto 22bn oil at 6,000 conversion. At\n&#xa0;\n$100 oil that is worth $2.22 trillion, say \n£1.5tn.&#xa0;\nFinally can I point out that some of the responses to your questions were a bit naff. The reference to \nGaslands\n wasn't clever. We\n&#xa0;\nknow it was a con. A few other observations:\n&#xa0;\n- Q9, an onshore drilling derrick is\n&#xa0;\nusually between 150ft and 200 ft. \"tens of metres\" is misleading. \n&#xa0;\n- Q9, \"\neventually\"is\n misleading, drilling activities on a well pad take less than a year.\n&#xa0;\n- Q9, \"for 10 years\" is not representative of the production life of an onshore well. It is typically much longer than that.\n&#xa0;\n- Q31, answer \"significant number of occasions to \nrefracture\n some of the wells\" is misleading.\n&#xa0;\nIf a well is prolific they\n&#xa0;\nmight \nfrack\n it again a few times. \"Significant number\" is not\n&#xa0;\nthe norm.\n&#xa0;\n- Q34, subsidy for shale gas is just plain wrong.\n&#xa0;\nThe tax breaks\n&#xa0;\nmean\n&#xa0;\nthat, instead of charging tax at ~62% like the rest of the oil industry, it will be more like 30%, as you say in Q35.\n&#xa0;\n- Q35, wind turbines \"virtually do not need a subsidy now\" is misleading.\n&#xa0;\n They actually do receive significant subsidies, every day.\n&#xa0;\n- Q39, the answer by \nprof\n Anderson is not very enlightening.\n&#xa0;\n\"I suppose you could \nuntie\n us from the European gas network\" is an entirely meaningless comment.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\nAnnex1\nCapacity\nMWh\n2.3\nexample \nEnercon\n E70 used widely\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYears\n&#xa0;\n20\nEstimated average lifetime.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnual Equivalent full load\nhours\n2500\nCapacity factor of 28.5%.
