[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for the opportunity to present written responses to your call for evidence on Women in Sport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My submission is based on dynamics I have experienced and observed as an athlete, living in several different countries and as a member of numerous clubs. At school I was among the last to be picked for any team; as an adult in control of my own participation I became a national champion in my sport. I strongly believe that many of the factors preventing participation in sport are to do with basic skills development, misguided beliefs that people’s sporting ability can be judged at a young age resulting in people opting out of sport too early, and a lack of perseverance around developing fitness, strength and athleticism. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe that the most influential people in a woman’s sporting life are her family, peers and coaches; I do not believe that elite female athletes encourage participation, although they may inspire young athletes who are stepping on to an elite path. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As well as removing barriers to women’s participation in sport, I suggest we focus on surrounding young women with people showing them what it looks like to set out on a wet morning to run in the cold half-light, demonstrating what it looks like to make a regular commitment to sport, and making such a commitment the norm in a woman’s life, rather than an exception.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My specific comments on issues that I have seen make a difference in my athletic life, and in others’ lives, follow. Please note that my submission pertains almost exclusively to sports participation, rather than elite sports.
[normal]These comments relate to the way sports are taught in schools and to young athletes. However, I wish to emphasise throughout that I do not think that it is only young people who should be the focus of sports policy. Throughout their lives 
[normal]women find themselves in different situations and with more or less time to commit to sports, and 47 is
[normal] as good an age to take up sports as seven is. 
[normal]The ability to participate confidently in a variety of sports depends on three basic skills: athleticism, aerobic capacity and strength. Women are capable of learning and improving on all of these dimensions, at any age. However, women are rarely helped to develop 
[normal]these basic competencies, which limits
[normal] their sense of security and enjoyment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To support women’s participation in sports, they need access to opportunities to learn these basic skills. From that foundation they can confidently move on to learning skills specific to different sports, and can move easily between different sports over their lifetime. 
[normal]Participation in team sports requires time, a regular commitment and money, which often become more prohibitive as adult obligations increase. Venues that expose women to sports, such as schools and community centres, could do more to expose women to individual sports such as running, swimming and cycling that allow for flexible training schedules.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Focusing on team sports, especially ball games, at schools tends to support girls who are already confident in their sporting ability. Girls who haven’t developed basic competencies may 
[normal]simply find a place to hide within the team and avoid learning.  Furthermore, team sports do not develop aerobic capacity, although they require it; an essential element in youth sports is to teach girls how to train, including building aerobic capacity, preventing injuries, nutrition and strength conditioning. Simply playing the game is not sufficient for the development of a lifelong athlete.
[normal]Norms about women, sport and puberty have shifted so far, parents may not have the right information to help their daughters manage sports and puberty. Sports science and tampons are two major disruptions to traditional practices, which parents who do not participate in sports might not be equipped to advise their daughters about. Menstruation and breast health are two areas where teachers, coaches and community health practitioners could contribute. 
[normal]To confidently participate in sports women need: 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]information about how menstruation affects their ability to train, preferably from a teacher, coach or health professional who is also an athlete
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]information about sanitary products, when and how to use them
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a clean, discreet place for storing, using and disposing of pads and tampons during sports 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]encouragement to continue training as much as their menstrual cycle allows, neither under- or over-exerting themselves
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]education about the female athlete triad (Energy Deficit/Disordered Eating, Menstrual Disturbances/Amenorrhea, Bone Loss/Osteoporosis)
[normal]For many teenagers, especially those who have large breasts, having information about breast health and sports can remove a major impediment to participation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sports bras are essential, expensive, pieces of sports clothing, and for many women participation in sports without such a bra is impossible. This should be addressed, early, openly and directly in schools and clubs. All girls, regardless of breast size, would benefit from access to affordable sports bras, fitted by a qualified specialist, along with information about breast health. For some girls this may make the difference between participating confidently in sports, and not participating at all. 
[normal]In many sports coaching is the most important factor in participation, well ahead of facilities, expenses, or type of sport. Good facilities will not compensate for bad coaching. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Generally, 
[normal]sports coaching suffers
[normal] from a lack of professionalism, expertise and interpersonal skills.  Clubs often depend on volunteer coaches and tolerate poor coaching because they believe there are no alternatives, refusing to act even when poor coaching leads to athletes abandoning the club. Clubs ultimately lose paying members because they refuse to discipline misbehaving volunteers, leaving athletes facing unpleasant choices about tolerating unpleasant behaviour or leaving the sport all together. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This could be remedied by creating and enforcing codes of conduct for coaches, whether voluntary or paid, and increasing access to nationally certified coaching qualifications that include general coaching as well as sports specific skills. Peak national organisations could offer a confidential reporting service that gives athletes an avenue for seeking advice about problem coaching in their club, and would help to hold clubs to account for the actions of their coaches. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Access to coaching can make a big difference to adult
[normal] women taking up or returning to sports. Clubs often focus resources on junior athletes, neglecting their older, motivated membership, which is perplexing given that older members are often in a much better position to contribute to the club financially, to offer useful skills, and to help maintain the club’s human and financial capital. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clubs, coaches and athletes would all benefit if every member had access to good coaching, rather than treating all younger athletes as potential future professionals and older athletes as too old to be worth spending time on.  
[normal]In general sports participation does not require expensive or complex facilities, however, facilities can send a strong message about expectations. For example, clubs that were founded as all male clubs and converted a store room into a female change room in the 1970s, buy new equipment for the men’s team and hand down old kit to the women’s team, and have ‘Pimps and Prostitutes’ themed social events, are probably not encouraging women’s participation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Women’s participation can be invited and supported by investing equally in facilities, equipment and coaching support for both genders, without ignoring the special needs of each. For example, if women come to a sport with a lower base level of strength and fitness, then they may need more access to a weights gym, or more attention from a strength and conditioning coach, than the men do. Aiming for equality across a club shouldn’t come at the expense of attention to gender-specific needs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On the topic of clubs, the close association of sports and alcohol is a problem for sports, as it is for society in general. Perhaps sports could lead the way in demonstrating responsible consumption of alcohol, or perhaps it is the other way around. I do not propose a close examination of this topic here, as I believe that sports alone cannot achieve this change. However, I do believe that regular consumption of alchohol in general, and binge drinking in particular, contribute to an unhealthy and unsafe environment for women in sports clubs and at sporting events. 
[normal]The idea that hosting the Olympics will somehow increase sports participation is a curious one. The Olympics may increase interest in watching sports, but it’s not clear by which mechanism this might lead to more participation. Particularly when elite athletes are presented as ‘stars’ and ‘superhuman’, women are probably not going to identify with female Olympians or be encouraged by their example to take up sport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To illustrate the elite v participation dichotomy, perhaps it is helpful to ask how many people cook Nigella Lawson or Jamie Oliver’s recipes in their home, and how many cook from books by Heston Blumenthal. Watching masters of their art at work is engaging and interesting, but it does not encourage people to try it for themselves – and it’s not designed to either. Conversely, individuals who demonstrate how to make something simple, accessible and capable of fitting into a daily 
[normal]routine,
[normal] are those that encourage others to do it too – both in sports and in cooking. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similarly, consider how many football fans watching multiple games a week, are actually playing football themselves on a regular basis. This is not to say that elite sports do not merit attention, but only to point out that promoting and facilitating elite sport has little if any impact on participation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Presenting elite athletes as role models may make it appear that the only people who can identify as athletic or sporting are full time athletes. For an average woman contemplating participation in sports, a colleague or neighbour is probably a more effective role model than a full time athlete with multiple corporate endorsements.  Efforts to increase participation should focus on local initiatives that enable women to see women like them participating in sports, at every stage of their life. 
[normal]As the topic of how female athletes are presented in media and marketing will no doubt be addressed in other submissions, I will confine my comments to just one issue, which is sports clothing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Throughout the UK, every sports store I have entered has devoted most of its floor space to men’s sports equipment and clothing. Without sales data it is impossible to say whether this is due to low demand, or to a perception issue. Either way, it certainly sends a strong signal about women’s demand for sports clothing, and makes me wonder where women trying to play sports buy their clothes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Secondly, while men’s clothing is usually cut to emphasise their strength, women’s clothing appears to be cut to emphasise their breasts. In summer I like to train in a UPF protective long sleeve shirt; one such shirt I purchased had a scoop neckline, which is a bewildering design choice in an item that is meant to protect skin from the sun. There are also singlets that reveal cleavage, requiring care in the choice of accompanying bra, cap sleeve t shirts – compared to the men’s options which reach almost to the elbow, stalls at sporting events that sell t shirts for men but only sleeveless shirts for women, and so on. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While this may reflect consumer demand, I believe it also reveals a bias about how people think about women’s motivations for playing sport. Sport is so often presented to women as something to do in order to look good, whereas for men there is more attention to its social and physical aspects, and this message is broadcast strongly in the clothing offered for sale to female athletes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, a comment about the commercialisation of mass participation sports.
[normal] A symbiosis has emerged between fundraising and running events, which serves neither cause well. 
[normal]This article
[normal] says much of what I would say on this topic, and I would only add that 
[normal]Parkrun
[normal], by contrast, is an ideal model of a low overhead, pro-participation, accessible, efficient (ie. takes 30 minutes in the morning) and highly enjoyable community sports event. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion, I propose that to increase participation of women in sports, policy should focus on teaching basic skills as a foundation for sports participation; exposing women to individual sports; offering education and resources for menstrual and breast health; shifting spending to coaching development rather than facilities; and fostering an environment where women regularly see other women participating in sports, by celebrating accessible role models.
