"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLumos\n is an international NGO\n working to end the institutionalisation of children\n around the world\n. We work to transform education, health and social care systems for children and their families and help children move from institutions to family-based care.\n  We are a founding member of the \nUNICEF \nGlobal Partnership for Children with Di\nsabilities in Development.\n&#xa0;\n \nwww.wearelumos.org\nThis response is intended to highlight the impact of the systematic institutionalisation of children with disabilities around the world\n.  It \nillustr\nate\ns\n the need for \nDFID\n \nand other donors to adopt a\nn\n \napproach \nwhich is consistent both with \nthe UK’s \ninternational human rights \ncommitments\n and \nwith \ninternational good practice in the provision of and transition to community and family based care for childr\nen with disabilities.  \n This \nI\nnquiry is a timely opportunity to ensure that the current process to replace the Millennium Development Goals puts in place specific mechanisms for the protection of societies’ most vulnerable children\n:\n those with disabilities\n and living in institutional care. \nWhilst much of the evidence and research we refer to comes from the European Region, the \nissues raised are\n common to children everywhere.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nAn estimated 8 million children worldwide live in some form of institutionalised residential care\n.  Research from across the world has \ndemonstrate\nd\n the \nsignificant \nharm caused \nto children \nby \nsuch \ninstitutionalisation.\n \n  T\nhe harmful effects include: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAny post-2015 framework should include mechanisms to promote and e\nnsure that the\n above approaches\n are prioritised.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2\n214-109X(13)70056-1/fulltext\nhttp://ww\nw.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/err9_full.pdf\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Registered in England and Wales as a company limited by guarantee, number  5611912\n and as a charity, number 1112575.\n“Deinstitutionalisation – A Human Rights Priority for Children with Disabilities”.
