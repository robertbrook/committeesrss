"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Christopher Shaw (CLC009)&#xa0;\nThis submission addresses the questions of how public understanding of climate change can be improved and the role of the media in this processes. I provide evidence in support of my claim that the news media have failed to communicate \nthe \nuncertainties in our knowledge of future climate change impacts. I outline why this failure matters to public understanding of climate change. I offer a suggestion for how to overcome the problems identified through a cost-effective online \nconsultative \nprocess which allows citizens to share their ideas on how to respond to climate change in light of these uncertainties.\nI am a Visiting Fellow for Science, Technology and Policy Research, University of Sussex. I completed my doctorate as a mature student in 2011 and since that time have been researching various elements of low carbon innovation, public engagement and participatory research.\nThe public cannot properly evaluate climate risks without information about the uncertainties surrounding projections of future climate change impacts. In my forthcoming paper \nChoosing a dangerous limit for climate change: public representations of the decision making process \nI have shown that\n:\nIt is well established that simply communicating more science to the public will not change attitudes. A participatory process which allows the public to engage on their own terms \nwith the debate about how much warming, and thus climate risk, is acceptable is an essential element of any attempt to build strong and positive engagement with climate policy and climate science.\nI am currently applying to funding councils for support for a research project which will address this need through a repurposing of the Department of Energy And Climate Change’s \n2050 Pathways Calculator\n. Whilst the calculator currently limits participants \nto choosing different technical routes to a pre-determined end, my version will allow users to investigate how that end was arrived at. The calculator will offer users the opportunity to marry lifestyle choices with potential warming levels and associated impacts. These outcomes from the lifestyle choices made will be presented in a manner that shows in an accessible way the uncertainty ranges associated with those outcomes.\nThe goal is not to arrive at an agreement of a new dangerous limit but to allow the public to better understand the uncertainties, compromises and conflicts involved in trying to define how much warming is too much. The intended goal from this process is to:\n ii   \nShow to users that full certainty will \nprobably never be achieved, and the necessi\nty of acting with \nprecaution under conditions of uncertainty\n.\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.12.012\n"
