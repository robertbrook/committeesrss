defaultThe overriding objective in Highways Departments during the last 50 years has 
defaultbeen provision for motor traffic. The primary criterion for road schemes 
defaultwas then and 
defaultis still the maximisation of road

defaultHowever, not only is this intimidating for pedestrians
default, 
defaultbut 
defaultthe 
defaultwidth of road

default.
default This is a

defaultDesigning m

defaultIn addition, 
defaultthere 
defaultwas 
defaultonly one of 
defaultthe engineers in the County’s consu
defaultltants who might have the skill
default to design this layout
default, and 
defaultthere was no way of ensuring that

default  Joined up DepartmentsdefaultIt seems axiomatic that the Departments concerned in 
defaultC
defaultentral Government 
defaultwould have to 
defaultbe persuaded to work together on a major programme 
defaultsuch as this
default:
defaultThe previous Minister for Cycling, Norman Baker, indicated that he was holding discussions with the Dept. of Hea
defaultlth
default and others
default, but whether there have been agreements on ways of working and lines of communication is not 
defaultyet clear. 
defaultWithout these agreements 
defaultjoined-up working
default 
defaultwould 
defaultseem
default most unlikely.
defaultIn Local Government, the most obvious join-up would be with Public 
defaultHealth
default, as Bristol appears to be doing.
default[

default 
defaultProbably most Local Authority 
defaultPublic Health

defaultService
defaults
default recognise the 
defaultcontribution that everyday walking and cycling make to people’s activity levels
default. 
defaultBut a
default look at Public Health Strategy documents on the web does not give confidence that many have yet made agreements on ways of working and lines of communication
default with Highways
default, as mentioned above.
default Without these, 
defaultjoined up working with
default,
default and 
defaultcontributions 
defaultfrom
default Public Health 
defaultseem
default unlikely to be forthcoming.
defaultv)
default 
default Constant checkingdefaultChecking
default is like a cyclist 
defaultgoing over
default the various ‘systems’ on their bike, e.g. brakes – brake blocks not worn down? blocks not 
defaultloose
default? correctly positioned? cable
defaults
default oiled and no broken st
defaultrands? levers correctly adjusted?  
defaultR
defaultesponsible
default cyclists do this constantly.
defaultEvery link in the 
defaultprogramme 
defaultchain would need to be monitored, from strategic planning through identifying &amp; prioritising schemes with local communities, consulting stakeholders
default,
default especially Public Health, identifying funding &amp; negotiating Section 106 contributions from developers, to informing people of what has been achieved.
defaultEvaluation of the effectiveness of different parts of the whole programme – infrastructure, training, inf
defaultormation on routes
default, provision of cycle parking 
defaultetc
default – are 
defaulthelpful
default 
defaultfor
default the dissemination of good practice. 
defaultBut e
defaultvaluation is challenging
default,
default because no si
defaultngle part of the programme on its own will much increase 
defaultcycling
default 
defaultsafety or 
defaultnumbers
default. L
defaultots of training &amp; e

defaultjoin a 
default 
defaultmulti-lane roundabout
default with 
defaultmany drivers changing lanes at speed.
default2. A Champion in each localitydefaultWithout a Champion embedde
defaultd in the Highway Authority, the co-ordination of all the different requirements 
defaultneeded to deliver the National Strategy
default 
defaultlocally is unlikely to work well.
defaultPlanning &amp; design of infrastructure needs input from the District Councils and Public Health; 
defaultdifferen
defaultt departments will need to put in place agreements to work together, set up clear lines of communication and inform all concerned of the new arrangements; good relations with county/city-wide media will have to be fostered
default; workshops &amp; information 
defaultroadshows to inform 
defaulteveryone
default of the benefits to health, the economy, household budgets, wellbeing.
defaultThis might translate for the Champion to:-
defaultAnd then when the above is beginning to bed down, 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaultcycling 
defaultcampaigns or forums could be asked to monitor the delivery of new schemes and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, so that congratulations
default &amp; thanks
default 
defaultto all concerned 
defaultcan be given
default,
default 
defaultas well as
default support to improve ways of working where needed.
default 
defaultAnd, of co
defaulturse, more constant checking that no link in the chain has broken.

defaultengagement of senior policy makers and dedicated funding, resulting in rapid
