[normal]Written evidence from
[normal] Transition Town Totnes Cycling Group
[normal] (CYS0136)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am aged 70, have cycled for independence as a child, and for transport, exercise &amp; fun ever since. Recently retired and involved with 
[normal]Transition To
[normal]w
[normal]n Totnes
[normal] since 
[normal]the 
[normal]start
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]what is
[normal] now 
[normal]a 
[normal]world-wide 
[normal]movement, I started the Cycling Group for fun
[normal],
[normal] and to work on Sustainable Transport for access to the surrounding villages and within the town.

[normal]A walking/cycling programme for local transport[bold]i
[normal]) 
[normal]Delivered nationally &amp; implemented locally[bold]We are all pedestrians, except for children in push-chairs and the infirm or
[normal] 
[normal]disabled in mobility scooters.
[normal] 
[normal]All of us
[normal] need exactly the same 
[normal]facilities
[normal] i.e.
[normal] safe, convenient, direct, 
[normal]healthier, 
[normal]pleasant and well maintained.
[normal] 
[normal]So the case for
[normal] 
[normal]walking 
[normal]is the one which 
[normal]should
[normal] get 
[normal]public 
[normal]support, 
[normal]if it is promoted 
[normal]in all mass media
[normal],
[normal] nationally &amp; locally
[normal].
[normal] (
[normal]S
[normal]ee

[normal]below
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]2.[bold] 
[normal]A[bold] 
[normal]Champion[bold], &amp; 
[normal]3. A publicity campaign[bold])
[normal]Because 
[normal]in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]we have allowed 
[normal]our
[normal] number of cycling trips to fall to 2% or less of all trips, support nationally for building cycling infrastructure 
[normal]is not likely to be very large
[normal]. 
[normal]But p
[normal]edestrians are at the top of 
[normal]the transport hierarchy
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in official documents
[normal] at least
[normal], and we are all pedestrians at some time,
[normal] 
[normal]so pedestrian infrastructure 
[normal]could
[normal] be the 
[normal]pilot 
[normal]on 
[normal]a
[normal] tandem 
[normal]with
[normal] cycling
[normal] provision behind
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The programme must be 
[normal]driven[bold] nationally 
[normal]because it would require 
[normal]central 
[normal]funding
[normal] from the 
[normal]DfT
[normal], and joint working with other departments such as Health.
[normal] (See
[normal] DNCS 
[normal]Section
[normal].5, and
[normal] below: 
[normal]Joined up Departments[bold])
[normal]But a walking/cycling programme would 
[normal]have to 
[normal]be 
[normal]delivered[bold] locally, because each Highway Authority has responsibility for and best knowledge of its own area.
[normal] Local 
[normal]A
[normal]uthorit
[normal]ies
[normal] 
[normal]were
[normal] the main means of delivery for the National Cycling Strategy
[normal] 1996 
[normal](See DNCS above Section 4, and especially 7 Weaknesses). It would b
[normal]e important to address these weaknesses in a new strategy, bear
[normal]ing in mind also this 
[normal]evid
[normal]e
[normal]nce
[normal] (The implementation of walking &amp;
[normal] cycling policies in British Local Authorities p.15 and Conclusions p.20) of the lack of funding 
[normal]and high level commitment hampering effective delivery.
[normal]L
[normal]ocal delivery 
[normal]can be done
[normal] successful
[normal]ly (See 
[normal][
[normal]2
[normal]]
[normal] 199
[normal]8
[normal] Teenage Pregnancy Strategy
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]The rate of under-18 conceptions in England 
[normal]fell
[normal] by 13 per cent 
[normal]from the 1998 base line to 2008, and continues to 
[normal]fall
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]ii)  
[normal]Ring-fenced[bold]If the funds are not ring-fenced, they are likely to be 
[normal]raided
[normal] for ‘emergency’ requi
[normal]rements and 
[normal]then
[normal] not replaced.
[normal]i
[normal]ii
[normal])  
[normal]Training[bold]We 
[normal]seem
[normal] to 
[normal]have 
[normal]lost 
[normal]in the last 
[normal]5
[normal]0 years some of our willingness to walk, and m
[normal]ost
[normal] of our cycling culture too
[normal], except in cities like Cambridge
[normal].
[normal]T[bold]raining [bold]in ridin[bold]g[bold] 
[normal]is 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]needed
[normal]. 
[normal]Bikeability
[normal] is doing well here, but should be more structured, fuller, for all children, and continue into secondary school.
[normal]But
[normal] not 
[normal]just
[normal] for children
[normal].
[normal]Adults, especially those with children of school age, should be 
[normal]strongly 
[normal]encour
[normal]-
[normal]aged to take up free training for riding on the road, arranged for times they find 
[normal]convenient. They will then be able to encourage their children
[normal]’s 
[normal]rid
[normal]ing
[normal], especially
[normal] 
[normal]to school
[normal],
[normal] rather than forbidding it as ‘too dangerous’, which often happens now.
[normal] Basic maintenance &amp; repair could with advantage form part of this training.
[normal]Equally 
[normal]important 
[normal]is 
[normal]training for traffic engineers[bold].
[normal][
[normal]3
[normal]]
[normal] p.38
[normal]The overriding objective in Highways Departments during the last 50 years has 
[normal]been provision for motor traffic. The primary criterion for road schemes 
[normal]was then and 
[normal]is still the maximisation of road
[normal] &amp; junction capacity for motors.
[normal]For example, minor road 
[normal]T-
[normal]junction
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]have 
[normal]often
[normal] 
[normal]had 
[normal]the entrance and exit corners 
[normal]widened out
[normal], i.e. the radius of the curve increased
[normal]. This gives
[normal] drivers vision further into or out of the junction. 
[normal]Fine for drivers
[normal],
[normal] for t
[normal]h
[normal]at
[normal] allows
[normal] the corner 
[normal]to
[normal] be taken at higher speed
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, not only is this intimidating for pedestrians
[normal], 
[normal]but 
[normal]the 
[normal]width of road 
[normal]they have
[normal] 
[normal]to cross is increased, often doubled
[normal].
[normal] This is a
[normal] major worry for the elderly and mothers with young children.
[normal]Designing m
[normal]ajor junctions for pedestrian and cyclist safety and convenience 
[normal]seems
[normal] not 
[normal]yet
[normal] 
[normal]to be well developed
[normal] in some Highway
[normal] Authorities.
[normal] 
[normal]Neither do 
[normal]DfT
[normal] rules
[normal] 
[normal]yet 
[normal]a
[normal]llow some of the designs that 
[normal]are well tried &amp; tested
[normal] on the continent
[normal].
[normal]Hence
[normal] the
[normal] need for
[normal] trials at the Transport 
[normal]Re
[normal]search Laboratory last summer of  low-level cyclists traffic lights and Dutch layout roundabouts.
[normal]I
[normal]n November 
[normal]I was 
[normal]asked 
[normal]to County Hall 
[normal]by our senior 
[normal]T
[normal]raffic 
[normal]E
[normal]ngineer
[normal] to
[normal] discuss a 
[normal]drawing for a 
[normal]Dutch layout roundabout 
[normal]that 
[normal]I had prepared 
[normal]as a proposal 
[normal]for a major junction 
[normal]in the town. 
[normal]O
[normal]ur engineer admitt
[normal]ed
[normal] that he personally had 
[normal]not designed a roundabout before, exc
[normal]ept for a small unimportant one. It would have to be done by consultants.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]there 
[normal]was 
[normal]only one of 
[normal]the engineers in the County’s consu
[normal]ltants who might have the skill
[normal] to design this layout
[normal], and 
[normal]there was no way of ensuring that 
[normal]this engineer
[normal] w
[normal]ould be
[normal] entrusted with the job if it was put out to the consultants.
[normal] (See DNCS Annex A, Section 5
[normal]. Research and D
[normal]evelopment. There seems to be little mention of professional development  in this review.)
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]v)
[normal]  Joined up Departments[bold]It seems axiomatic that the Departments concerned in 
[normal]C
[normal]entral Government 
[normal]would have to 
[normal]be persuaded to work together on a major programme 
[normal]such as this
[normal]:
[normal]The previous Minister for Cycling, Norman Baker, indicated that he was holding discussions with the Dept. of Hea
[normal]lth
[normal] and others
[normal], but whether there have been agreements on ways of working and lines of communication is not 
[normal]yet clear. 
[normal]Without these agreements 
[normal]joined-up working
[normal] 
[normal]would 
[normal]seem
[normal] most unlikely.
[normal]In Local Government, the most obvious join-up would be with Public 
[normal]Health
[normal], as Bristol appears to be doing.
[normal][
[normal]4
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal][
[normal]5
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]Probably most Local Authority 
[normal]Public Health
[normal] 
[normal]Service
[normal]s
[normal] recognise the 
[normal]contribution that everyday walking and cycling make to people’s activity levels
[normal]. 
[normal]But a
[normal] look at Public Health Strategy documents on the web does not give confidence that many have yet made agreements on ways of working and lines of communication
[normal] with Highways
[normal], as mentioned above.
[normal] Without these, 
[normal]joined up working with
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]contributions 
[normal]from
[normal] Public Health 
[normal]seem
[normal] unlikely to be forthcoming.
[normal]v)
[normal] 
[normal] Constant checking[bold]Checking
[normal] is like a cyclist 
[normal]going over
[normal] the various ‘systems’ on their bike, e.g. brakes – brake blocks not worn down? blocks not 
[normal]loose
[normal]? correctly positioned? cable
[normal]s
[normal] oiled and no broken st
[normal]rands? levers correctly adjusted?  
[normal]R
[normal]esponsible
[normal] cyclists do this constantly.
[normal]Every link in the 
[normal]programme 
[normal]chain would need to be monitored, from strategic planning through identifying &amp; prioritising schemes with local communities, consulting stakeholders
[normal],
[normal] especially Public Health, identifying funding &amp; negotiating Section 106 contributions from developers, to informing people of what has been achieved.
[normal]Evaluation of the effectiveness of different parts of the whole programme – infrastructure, training, inf
[normal]ormation on routes
[normal], provision of cycle parking 
[normal]etc
[normal] – are 
[normal]helpful
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] the dissemination of good practice. 
[normal]But e
[normal]valuation is challenging
[normal],
[normal] because no si
[normal]ngle part of the programme on its own will much increase 
[normal]cycling
[normal] 
[normal]safety or 
[normal]numbers
[normal]. L
[normal]ots of training &amp; e
[normal]ncouragement without good infra
[normal]structure w
[normal]ill
[normal] not persuade 
[normal]the general population
[normal] to be on 
[normal]a bike
[normal] next to large lorries or to 
[normal]join a 
[normal] 
[normal]multi-lane roundabout
[normal] with 
[normal]many drivers changing lanes at speed.
[normal]2. A Champion in each locality[bold]Without a Champion embedde
[normal]d in the Highway Authority, the co-ordination of all the different requirements 
[normal]needed to deliver the National Strategy
[normal] 
[normal]locally is unlikely to work well.
[normal]Planning &amp; design of infrastructure needs input from the District Councils and Public Health; 
[normal]differen
[normal]t departments will need to put in place agreements to work together, set up clear lines of communication and inform all concerned of the new arrangements; good relations with county/city-wide media will have to be fostered
[normal]; workshops &amp; information 
[normal]roadshows to inform 
[normal]everyone
[normal] of the benefits to health, the economy, household budgets, wellbeing.
[normal]This might translate for the Champion to:-
[normal]And then when the above is beginning to bed down, 
[normal]l
[normal]ocal 
[normal]cycling 
[normal]campaigns or forums could be asked to monitor the delivery of new schemes and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, so that congratulations
[normal] &amp; thanks
[normal] 
[normal]to all concerned 
[normal]can be given
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as well as
[normal] support to improve ways of working where needed.
[normal] 
[normal]And, of co
[normal]urse, more constant checking that no link in the chain has broken.
[normal]3. A centrally commissioned [bold]&amp;[bold] funded publicity campaign[bold]It seems 
[normal]we took in the 
[normal]late 
[normal]’
[normal]6
[normal]0s what has proved to be a wrong turning
[normal] – 
[normal]we promoted the car, and the motor vehicle in general, as 
[normal]‘the way to go’.
[normal] 
[normal]The car
[normal] became 
[normal]the 
[normal]normal
[normal] way of getting about
[normal],
[normal] and cycling 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]now 
[normal]seen as
[normal] ‘
[normal]odd
[normal]’

[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]“The key message that comes from this research is that at present in 
[normal]Britain
[normal] using the car for short trips in urban areas is convenient, habitual and normal. It is what people expect to do, what most people expect others to do and what many other people who have yet to benefit from car ownership aspire to do. Alternatives to the c
[normal]ar – especially cycling and walking – are perceived to take too much effort, need planning and equipment that causes hassle, and may be risky and uncomfortable.
[normal] They also run the risk of being perceived by others as eccentric or odd.[bold] These are all powerful
[normal] reasons for not walking and
[normal] 
[normal]cycling and for using the car for most short trips in urban areas.”

[normal]The benefits of good walking[bold] &amp; cycling facilities [bold]have never before
[normal], to my knowledge,
[normal] been explained via the national media to the general population in a

[normal]Implementation of the Strategy
[normal]“
[normal]In the first four years, the Strategy has been implemented with energy and 
[normal]enthusiasm in an atmosphere of cooperation and consensus among those 
[normal]involved. Teenage pr
[normal]egnancy has been taken seriously enough to secure 
[normal]engagement of senior policy makers and dedicated funding, resulting in rapid
[normal]and efficient action. Joint working has been achieved even in areas where it
[normal]has not previously been evident. The local teenage 
[normal]pregnancy coordinator
[normal]has been the lynchpin of implementation; their status in the community, their
[normal]professional experience and the support they have received have been key
[normal]to the success of their role.
