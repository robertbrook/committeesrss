"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Will McDowall (LCI0006)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary:-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a case for increasing the overall level of funding for low carbon energy R&amp;\nD, which is lower as a percentage of GDP than that of many key competitors. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is ambiguity about how government selects priority technology areas. The LCICG core technology areas leave important omissions. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLCICG fills a gap for co-ordination of fundi\nng for low carbon R&amp;D. It does not fill a larger gap for co-ordination of low-carbon R&amp;D funding with policies that support deployment of low-carbon technologies. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA strong, stable and long-term carbon price would provide an efficient long-term signal across the economy for investment in low-carbon innovation\n, leading to the achievement of carbon targets at lea\nst cost\n. However, this economically efficient outcome is in practice not achievable, because a) the long-term credibility of such a carbon price is very difficult—if not impossible—to achieve, since current parliaments cannot bind the hands of future legis\nlators\n, legally binding targets notwithstanding\n; b) an international carbon price would be required to embed this price signal throughout all products and services, and c) there are many market and system failures within innovation systems that \nprevent eff\nicient\n responses to price signals, and which may block low-carbon innovation even where it is economically rational. \nEffective innovation policy must engage with that complex reality. \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe government\n’\ns active approach to innovation policy\n, set out in the \nBIS \nInnovation and Research Strategy for Growth \nis therefore very \nwelcome\n, as it recognises the complexity of innovation and innovation policy\n. The recent development of industrial strategies in particular represents a \nsensible \npragmatic break from years o\nf polarised debate between ‘laissez faire’ and ‘picking winners’; it recognises that government is an inevitable player within the innovation system, and that intelligent strategic engagement and support is the best approach. \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, there are a number \nof shortcomings to the \ngovernment’s \napproach\n to low carbon innovation\n. \nIn particular, o\nverall public funding for energy \nRD&amp;D \nremains low compared to many competitors. There is a case for increasing the overall level of funding support. In particular, there\n is a case for providing more long-term forms of finance\n. \nThe UK \nlow-carbon sector \ndoes relatively well at attracting venture capital, second only to the US among major economies in terms of clean energy VC per unit GDP\n (according to data from Bloomberg Ne\nw Energy Finance)\n; but there is a dearth of longer-term supporting finance for em\nerging low-carbon technologies.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is also a problem with strategic co-ordination. \nThe failure to join up \nlow carbon R&amp;D \npolicy and deployment policy with sufficient credi\nbility is undermining the UK’s ability to \nattract investment in manufacturing \nand R&amp;D \ncapacity for key technologies, such as offshore wind. \nThe continued uncertainty over mid-term carbon targets (particularly in the power sector) and renewable energy commi\ntments will raise costs of ultimately meeting targets, and will reduce the chance of the UK benefitting from the associated manufacturing and export opportunities. \nPart of the problem is the political challenge of achieving alignment on key issues around d\necarbonisation policy. But a second part of the problem is the lack of a strategic co-ordination mechanism for low-carbon innovation. LCICG, while a welcome development, has not been designed for an overall strategic co-ordination mission, nor has it been \nresourced to meet such a mission. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a lack of clarity about how government has chosen its priority areas\n, and in particular how LCICG has chosen \ntarget technology areas\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParticularly striking is the absence of both aviation and automotive technologies \nfrom the LCICG list of target technologies \n(with the exception of hydrogen, for which a TINA is yet to be \nreleased). Aviation and automotive sectors both receive innovation support from government, and have well-developed industrial strategies. Recent evidence presented to UCL’s Green Economy Policy Commission\n (to be published in early 2014)\n also suggests that\n the UK has a weaker performance in low-carbon innovation in these two sectors (as measured by patents), than other major economies. Furthermore, the Committee on Climate Change\n highlighted both aviation and electric vehicle technologies as priority techn\nology areas. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMoreover\n, low-carbon innovation should not only address energy technologies. A\n broader low-carbon perspective might include agricultural technologies and techniques, and land-u\nse management, for example. \nSimilarly, it might move beyond techn\nologies to support low-carbon \nbusiness models. \nKey carbon-intensive sectors may be better ways of structuring government strategy around low carbon innovation needs\n and opportunities. \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe TINA process has been valuable in highlighting the innovation pote\nntial of a small number of key technologies\n and technology areas\n.\n It is to be hoped that the process can expand its view of technology areas of relevance, including those that are less well represented in systems modelling tools (either because they are le\nss mature, or because there is disagreement about technology cost estimates). Potentially important options excluded from the current set of TINAS include some that are technically achievable, but which would raise significant governance challenges (e.g. H\n2\n in gas networks), and those that are longer term and more speculative (tethered high-altitude wind turbines; direct photocatalysis; various energy harvesting technologies). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLCICG has been an important development in enabling government to co-ordinate \nR&amp;D spending on low-carbon technologies\n. However, \nLCICG \ndoes not meet t\nhe need for strategic co-ordination of low-carbon innovation policy identified by the CCC and others. LCICG’s remit is narrow, focused on improving the co-ordination of \npublic spending\n on \ntechnologies\n. \nThis had been missing, and LCICG has been useful in ov\nercoming that lack. \nHowever, this focus on spending on technologies is only one part of innovation policy, which requires management and co-ordination not only of government-funded R&amp;D programmes, but also of the demand-side and enabling activities.  \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA g\nrouping that could co-ordinate and strategically develop low-carbon innovation policy might be expected to also have representation from\n, for example,\n the Government Procurement Service (given evidence that well-designed public procurement policies can sti\nmulate ‘mission-driven’ innovation) and from the Green Investment Bank. Similarly\n, it seems unfortunate that the LCICG does not explicitly aim to co-ordinate R&amp;D funding with efforts to remove market or regulatory barriers to low-carbon technologies, or ef\nforts to stimulate markets for low-carbon technologies, such as the various subsidy schemes\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLCICG is not particularly well-resourced, and it faces\n challenges in achieving buy-in from across member organisations\n. Both of these factors\n are key limitations \non its ability to have a significant \npositive \ninfluence\n, even within its current narrow remit\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn short, LCICG has been a positive addition to reduce the lack of co-ordination across low carbon R&amp;D funding agencies. However, there remains \na l\nack of \na \ncle\nar champion for low-carbon innovation. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUltimately, the value for money of funding low-carbon technology R&amp;D will depend on how well the government is able foster an innovation system that effectively develops \nand deploys\n low carbon technologies. Focusin\ng only on the achievement of technology development from a technology-push perspective will \ngenerate limited results \nif the efforts are not aligned with \ncredible\n long-term energy and carbon policy. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere does not appear to be significant effort from LCICG to link to, or co-ordinate with, the European level, which is a major source of funding for low-carbon R&amp;D. \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Building a low-carbon economy – the UK’s innovation challenge.
