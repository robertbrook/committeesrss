[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[learndirect ]]]is the largest provider of skills, training and employment services in the UK and has supported more than 4 million individual customers and over 75,000 employers.&#xa0;In 2000 we challenged the norm and took a bold step to deliver learning online. 

[[[learndirect]]] became established as the foremost UK provider of Adult Basic Skills delivering learning to thousands of people each year through a network of hundreds of centres. Ten years later we challenged it again by opening a state-of-the-art, unique support centre in Leicester, which has already worked with more than 10,000 learners. In 2012, 

[[[learndirect]]] merged with JHP Group to become the UK’s largest integrated provider of employability and skills.&#xa0;We are the largest provider of Apprenticeships in England, a Prime Provider for the Work Programme and a subcontractor to seven other Primes, and hold major funding contracts with the Skills Funding Agency, Education Funding Agency, the Department for Work and Pensions, Skills Development Scotland, and the Welsh Government; as well as commercial contracts with clients including the Ministry of Defence and The Co-operative Group. Our employer clients include thousands of SMEs and large national organisations.  &#xa0;

[[[learndirect]]] operates across England, Wales and Scotland using flexible delivery models via four main channels: online, work-based, local centres and network partners. By utilising our geographical scale, technological strengths and service portfolio, we provide holistic, end-to-end employment and skills solutions for individuals and employers alike, benefiting local communities and economies. &#xa0;“We have helped more than 4 million individuals get the skills they need for work and more than 75,000 businesses improve the skills of their workforce.” &#xa0;We are Ofsted grade 2 and our consistently high standards of delivery result in above-average achievement rates which exceed targets.&#xa0;

[[[learndirect]]] is grateful for the opportunity to respond to this call for ideas and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss our response in more detail.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Call for evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Defining geographical areas]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The views and evidence provided below is based on 

[[[learndirect’s]]] experience as a national training and employment services provider delivering on a local level to meet the needs of employers, individuals and communities.  Through our contracts with a range of funding bodies at national and local level, we have successfully integrated employment and skills provision, improving the experience and outcomes for our customers.&#xa0;The current local landscape for employment, skills and welfare services is too complex, with a plethora of agencies and organisations involved in the planning and delivery of services, often with conflicting priorities.  &#xa0;The different sub-regional geographical boundaries which are in existence can also be confusing for all parties involved in the delivery of services.  There is often overlap across the boundaries listed below which would benefit from being more aligned with a consistent approach to the commissioning of skills, employment and welfare services, for example: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;A simplified structure, with a reduced number of different geographic boundaries is needed.  Contract areas for commissioning purposes should be aligned to existing local boundaries such as Local Authorities or Local Enterprise Partnerships, whether individual or clustered, as appropriate to factors such as population density etc.  This would encourage shared objectives and understanding of respective priorities.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ national approach]]]&#xa0;

[[[learndirect ]]]supports localisation which is essential if we are to meet the needs of local economies and local employers.  However, a purely local approach can create barriers for large, national employers and service providers which span regional and sub-regional boundaries.  In 

[[[l]]]

[[[earndirect’s ]]]experience as a national training and welfare services provider, large national organisations prefer to have a single point of contact.&#xa0;We recognise the importance of local programmes but only where they add value to the national programmes and where provision builds on best practice and lessons learnt, thus focusing valuable resources and funds on activity that will deliver their intended objectives. We would expect local commissioners to have adequate expertise, knowledge and capacity to professionally conduct procurement exercises, and would argue for national support/partnerships in this regard.  &#xa0;Any local commissioning process must be fairly executed.  The commissioning body must be impartial, for example in Scotland a co-commissioning process has been put in place where Employability Fund applications are scored nationally by Skills Development Scotland and then scored by the Community Planning Partnership.  However some members of this partnership are also provides, eg the Local Authority and Colleges, therefore the scoring process is not truly impartial. &#xa0;Based on 

[[[learndirect’s]]] experience working at local level to meet local priorities, we are concerned about the varying capacity and expertise within some LEPs and other local agencies/partnerships to manage the commissioning processing and supply chain management, particularly as the commissioning of public services is resource intensive.  All parties involved in the commissioning process would need to ensure they have appropriately skilled, professional staff.&#xa0;Finally, consideration should be given to ensuring appropriate parity of access to essential services of a high quality to avoid creating an unfair ‘postcode’ lottery as seen in the health service.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;For the skills and employment sector, we support central commissioning of national programmes but with local input within a commissioning strategy of contestability to deliver value for money, outcomes and, also most importantly, quality of service for individuals, employers and communities.  Every locality has a common set of core needs, eg access to skills and training, careers services and welfare support, but what differs from locality to locality is, for example: the level of training required, eg basic employability skills, vocational skills, or higher level skills; training which will meet the priority sectors of the area etc – and these should be determined locally. &#xa0;&#xa0;
