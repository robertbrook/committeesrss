[[[Written evidence submitted by Lee Taylor [FBB0004]]]]&#xa0;My view on the future of the BBC is quite simple. The license fee is no longer supportable. Now that the last analogue transmitter has been switched off the days of taxing people to watch broadcast television are numbered. The license fee should be used to provide every license purchaser with a set top box containing a decryption system similar to that employed by Sky. Sky users already have the necessary hardware. The BBC tv signals could then after a year be encrypted and at future renewals anyone who wanted to continue watching the BBC would purchase an updated subscription. This would put and end to the current BBC's money with menaces tactics and the BBC would be compelled to live within its means. The license fee aka television tax is a disgraceful anachronism that has outlived its time.October 2013&#xa0;
