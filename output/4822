defaultWhilst the Police Committee sets a target to reduce crime, this does not stipulate a numerical or percentage reduction. In addition, the Committee is working with the 
defaultCity of London Police
default to consider how new cri
defaultme outcomes can support policing priorities next year. Currently, no specific targets have been set on detection rates.
default  This approach reduces the potential impact on our police recording crime practices.  
defaultImpact on Police Crime Recording PracticesdefaultThe 
defaultimpact
default of using performance targets 
defaulton current police crime practices is minimal – as there are adequate checks 
defaultand
default balances in place to ensure that police crime recording practices are robust.  Assurances are provided by the checks (set out below). In add
defaultition, a
defaultny in-year adjustments to the crime 
defaultperformance 
defaultstatistics are challenged by the Corporation and the Police Committee Members – particularly with regard to satisfaction statistics, the violent crime 
defaultand
default acquisitive crime statistics. 
default The Force’s AC
defaultPO team also routinely seek assurance through the commissioning of independent audits.  
defaultThe Force has embarked on a cultural change programme
default – 
default“City Futures” – which aims to make the City of London Police 
default“a worldwide centre of excellence for our policin
defaultg services”. 
default Part of the programme of change is a focus on improving service delivery through the setting of robust 
defaultservice 
defaultoutcomes – that will 
defaultimprove service performance. The new arrangements will include a further strengthening of the Force’s police r
defaultecording practices to ensure that they are robust
default and 
defaulttransparent
default. 
defaultHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? defaultAs a Police 
defaultA
defaultuthority, there are a n
defaultumber of ways where we are assured about the reliability of our crime statistics.
default 
defaultThe following checks 
default(provide the Police Authority with a level of assurance that the crime statistics are reliable)

defaultThe report 
defaultconcluded that: 
default‘There is clear evidence that ethical crime and incident data is of utmost importance within the City of London. ‘
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default ‘
defaultT
defaulthe City of London police maintains an impressively h
defaultigh standard of capturing reports of crime, thus ensuring such crimes are correctly classified. The force Crime and Incident Registrar remains a strong and powerful advocate for ethical decision making.’ 
defaultThe Independent Auditors also commented favourably 
defaulton the 
defaultForce’s

defaultwhich ensured that 
defaultthe quality of incident and crime recording remained an area of strategic focus.
defaultHMIC Review of Crime defaultanddefault Incident ReportsdefaultThe HMIC conduct
defaults
default a regular review of Crime and Incident reports to ensure the correct and ethical reporting of both, and that incidents are correctly classified as crimes when necessary. The last COLP report was published in January 2012, and 
defaultstated
default:
default“Crimes in the City o
defaultf London are generally recorded accurately and in accordance with National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS).” 
default“
defaultThe City of London Police efficiently recorded and classified reports of crimes”. 
defaultThe report concluded
default 
default“
defaultsenior officers in the force were clear
defaultly committed to maintaining high standards of crime recording, and this was well supported by police committee. The force conducts comprehensive crime and incident audit programmes, the results of which are presented at regular crime performance meetings. 
defaultThis means the force can have confidence in the crime figures it produces
default.”
defaultPolice Routine ChecksdefaultThe Force regularly reviews 
defaultits
default 
defaultcrime recording standards to supplement the HMIC inspection work. In addition, the
default Force’s
default integrity dashboard reported to 
defaultthe
default Police Committee includes a
