[normal] 
[normal]Court of 
[normal]Common Council 
[normal]is
[normal] the Police Authority for the City of London Police and this function 
[normal]is delegated to and 
[normal]exercised by the Police Committee which 
[normal]provides independent scrutiny and chall
[normal]enge of the Force
[normal]. 
[normal](
[normal]Please note[bold]: The 
[normal]City o
[normal]f London Corporation does not have a Police &amp; Crime Commissioner)
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Police Committee in consultation with the City of London Police sets the Force’s priorities and measures annually. Workshops are held between
[normal] November &amp; January each year and 
[normal]in the February - t
[normal]he draft Policing Plan 
[normal]for the following year 
[normal]is agreed by the Police 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Our Policing Plan priorities for 2013-14 are Counter-Terrorism, Economic Crime, Public Order, Crime Reduction, Road Safety and Antisocial Behaviour. The priorities are underpinned by a small number of performance measures or targets. Delivery of these targ
[normal]ets 
[normal]is
[normal] monitored and scrutinised by the Force’s Performance Management Group 
[normal](which is attended by Police Authority 
[normal]staff
[normal], the Head of the Community Safety Team
[normal] and 
[normal]the Corporation’s Performance Management Team
[normal]) and 
[normal]by 
[normal]the Chairman of the
[normal] Performance &amp; Res
[normal]ources Management 
[normal](Police) 
[normal]Sub-Committee
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst the Police Committee sets a target to reduce crime, this does not stipulate a numerical or percentage reduction. In addition, the Committee is working with the 
[normal]City of London Police
[normal] to consider how new cri
[normal]me outcomes can support policing priorities next year. Currently, no specific targets have been set on detection rates.
[normal]  This approach reduces the potential impact on our police recording crime practices.  
[normal]Impact on Police Crime Recording Practices[bold]The 
[normal]impact
[normal] of using performance targets 
[normal]on current police crime practices is minimal – as there are adequate checks 
[normal]and
[normal] balances in place to ensure that police crime recording practices are robust.  Assurances are provided by the checks (set out below). In add
[normal]ition, a
[normal]ny in-year adjustments to the crime 
[normal]performance 
[normal]statistics are challenged by the Corporation and the Police Committee Members – particularly with regard to satisfaction statistics, the violent crime 
[normal]and
[normal] acquisitive crime statistics. 
[normal] The Force’s AC
[normal]PO team also routinely seek assurance through the commissioning of independent audits.  
[normal]The Force has embarked on a cultural change programme
[normal] – 
[normal]“City Futures” – which aims to make the City of London Police 
[normal]“a worldwide centre of excellence for our policin
[normal]g services”. 
[normal] Part of the programme of change is a focus on improving service delivery through the setting of robust 
[normal]service 
[normal]outcomes – that will 
[normal]improve service performance. The new arrangements will include a further strengthening of the Force’s police r
[normal]ecording practices to ensure that they are robust
[normal] and 
[normal]transparent
[normal]. 
[normal]How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? [bold]As a Police 
[normal]A
[normal]uthority, there are a n
[normal]umber of ways where we are assured about the reliability of our crime statistics.
[normal] 
[normal]The following checks 
[normal](provide the Police Authority with a level of assurance that the crime statistics are reliable)
[normal]:
[normal]Independent Audit[bold] commissioned by the Force[bold]The Force commissioned an independent audit of 
[normal]its 
[normal]crime data in June 2013
[normal]. This was
[normal] carried out by a team who had previously worked for HMIC on 
[normal]D
[normal]ata 
[normal]Q
[normal]uality inspections.  The outcome of this 
[normal]review
[normal] was 
[normal]received
[normal] 
[normal]by our 
[normal]Performance and Resource Management S
[normal]ub-committee
[normal] (P &amp; RM Sub-committee) 
[normal]in September 2013 
[normal]The report 
[normal]concluded that: 
[normal]‘There is clear evidence that ethical crime and incident data is of utmost importance within the City of London. ‘
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] ‘
[normal]T
[normal]he City of London police maintains an impressively h
[normal]igh standard of capturing reports of crime, thus ensuring such crimes are correctly classified. The force Crime and Incident Registrar remains a strong and powerful advocate for ethical decision making.’ 
[normal]The Independent Auditors also commented favourably 
[normal]on the 
[normal]Force’s 
[normal]governance
[normal] arrangements -
[normal] 
[normal]which ensured that 
[normal]the quality of incident and crime recording remained an area of strategic focus.
[normal]HMIC Review of Crime [bold]and[bold] Incident Reports[bold]The HMIC conduct
[normal]s
[normal] a regular review of Crime and Incident reports to ensure the correct and ethical reporting of both, and that incidents are correctly classified as crimes when necessary. The last COLP report was published in January 2012, and 
[normal]stated
[normal]:
[normal]“Crimes in the City o
[normal]f London are generally recorded accurately and in accordance with National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS).” 
[normal]“
[normal]The City of London Police efficiently recorded and classified reports of crimes”. 
[normal]The report concluded
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]senior officers in the force were clear
[normal]ly committed to maintaining high standards of crime recording, and this was well supported by police committee. The force conducts comprehensive crime and incident audit programmes, the results of which are presented at regular crime performance meetings. 
[normal]This means the force can have confidence in the crime figures it produces
[normal].”
[normal]Police Routine Checks[bold]The Force regularly reviews 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]crime recording standards to supplement the HMIC inspection work. In addition, the
[normal] Force’s
[normal] integrity dashboard reported to 
[normal]the
[normal] Police Committee includes a
[normal]n
[normal] update on the monthly dip sampling of crime reports
[normal]. This 
[normal]ensure
[normal]s
[normal] standards are maintained.
[normal]Future [bold]City [bold]Corporation of London [bold]Internal Audit[bold] Checks[bold] [bold]The Corporation is currently considering introducing a further independent check of Crime Statistics through the Corporation’s Internal Audit Service.  The plan is to build it into their annual Police audit programme.
