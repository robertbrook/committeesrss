defaultThe impact of the scope changes to legal aid for prison law are devastating when placed in the wider
default context of the issues faced by those in justice system.  The prison population remains too high, with a large proportion of people with high needs and/or serving
default indeterminate sentences trapped
default in the system.  The population is set to rise as professional
defaults with the experience to managing prisoners are squeezed out of the system
default.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe complaints system is inadequate as a substitution for legal representation.
default It is lengthy, under-resourced, bureaucratic and only used by adult male prisoners who have years of experience. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is not a statutory post and lacks the powers to enforce his decisions.

default              
defaultFounded in 1866, the Howard League
default for Penal Reform
default is the oldest penal reform
default charity in the 
defaultworld
default. The Howard L
defaulteague has 7,000 members, including prisoners and their families, lawyers, 
defaultcriminal justice professionals and academics. The Howard League has consultative status with both the United Nations and the Council of Europe. It is an independent charity and accepts no grant funding from the UK government.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
default              
defaultThe Howard League campaigns for less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prison. We achieve these objectives through conducting and commissioning research and investigations aimed at revealing underlying problems and discovering new solutions
default to issues of public concern. The Howard League’s objectives and principles underlie and inform the charity’s parliamentary work, research, legal and participation work as well as its projects.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
default              
defaultSince 2002 the Howard League has provided the only leg
defaultal service dedicated to representing children in custody. We also provide a dedicated legal service for young adults in prison (under 21) and, where appropriate, comment on the particular considerations that are required to ensure that this age group is de
defaultalt with fairly and appropriately.
default  
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultWe have therefore drawn upon our lawyers’ experience in practice as well as our expertise in this policy area when submitting this written evidence
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultThe Howard League is a member of the Association of Prison 
defaultLawyers and 
defaultJustRights
default. We
default endorse their evidence. Consequently, this submission deals with issues within our particular field of expertise and experience.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.1
default              
defaultThere are currently
default 84,197 people in prison, 80,323 men and 3,874 women. 10,786 of these prisoners are foreign nationals in detention. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1.2 
default              
defaultAccording to the government’s Updated Impact Assessment for the Offender Rehabilitation Bill,
default 
defaultif passed, around 13,000 offenders wi
defaultll be recalled or committed to custody, at a
defaultn additional
default cost of £16
default 
defaultmillion per year.
default  Further, prisons are required to cut up to 16% of their budgets next year.  This will mean losing more experienced staff.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.3 
default              
defaultIt is estimated that 36 per cent of p
defaultrisoners have a disability and approximately 25 per cent have a learning disability. In a recent Ministry of Justice study 49 per cent of female prisoners and 23 per cent of male prisoners were assessed as struggling with anxiety and depression. Levels of 
defaultself-harm are high amongst the prison population with 23,134 incidents taking place in the 12 months ending September 2012. Almost 50 per cent of women in prison have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1.4
default              
defaultThe prison population is ageing. 
defaultPrisoners over 60 are now the fastest growing group in prison. Many older people in prison have a physical health status 
defaultequivalent to a person
default 10 years
default their senior
default in the community, with a large number suffering from serious and terminal illnesses.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default5
default              
defaultA large proportion of those in prison have experienced social and economic disadvantage. Almost 50 per cent of the prison population 
defaultreport having no qualifications and approximately a quarter 
defaultof prisoners 
defaultneed help with basic literacy. 
defaultA
defaultround half of al
defaultl prisoners have histories of debt and 15 per cent report being homeless prior to custody.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.6
default              
defaultThere are around 12,000 men, and a small number of women, serving 
defaultindeterminate sentences
default. The average sentence length has increased so that 
default prisoners
default 
defaulton a l
defaultife sentence 
defaulttypically spend 15 to 20 years behind bars.  The number of lifers has doubled since the introduction of the now defunct indeterminate sentence for public protection in 2003. Each 
defaultindeterminate sentenced 
defaultprisoner costs the taxpayer around 
default£600,000 – £800,000 for their term inside.
default&#xa0;default3.1
default.7
default              
defaultThe indeterminate sentence is focused on public safety, reducing the risk the prisoner poses and making sure that the person is safely released at the right time to a sustainable community plan on 
defaultlicence
default. 
defaultAccording to a recent report
default by HMI Probation and HMI Prisons, 
default95% to 98% are resettled safely. The inspection report indicated that “assumptions were often made that life sentence prisoners knew all about ‘the system’ which led to an underestimation of t
defaulthe amount 
defaultof advice and help they needed”.  It also found that “
defaultsentence planning was weak and probation staff struggled to design meaningful objectives for those who appeared to have done all required work in custody.”
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default.9
default              
defaultAs the proposed cuts to legal
default aid are brought in
default and wider cuts to criminal justice bite
default, systems will inevitably become more stretched and mistakes will be made. 
defaultPrisons on limited budgets are providing less training for existing staff and newly recruited staff are not required to ha
defaultve any formal educational qualifications.  This means that prison staff are less able to provide information or advice about the complex legislative framework that governs individual sentences. 
defaultIt is therefor
defaulte even more important that
default prisoners can get ind
defaultependent and expert advice to 
defaultprogress through their sentence appropriately towards safe release. Criminal legal aid for prison law currently plays a vital role in getting 
defaultthe journey to release
default right.  It is often vital to ensure that prisoners ge
defaultt on the
default right courses
default, progress when appropriate to an open prison so they can properly prepare for safe community living and secure appropriate release packages.  All of this work is currently done by lawyers for fixed fees 
defaultf
defaultor around £220.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.10
default              
defaultThe inevitabl
defaulte consequence 
defaultof ending access to independent and skilled legal representatives 
defaultwill be that prisoners will spend longer in closed conditio
defaultns and longer in open prisons
default at immense public expense
default. 
defaultIf, as a result of the lack of legal advice and challenge, t
defaulthe 12,000 prisoners on life sentences and IPPs spend an extra year in jail – and only one year is a conservative estimate – this will cost £480 million. This sum dwarfs the £4 million the Ministry of Justice
default hopes to save by
default the ending of legal aid to pris
defaultoners.
default  Public confidence could 
defaulthardly be more affected than by ending a relatively cheap and effective means to secure rehabilitation for prisoners where is not happening as a matter of course.  One shocking consequence of the changes is that prisoners wh
defaulto have made sufficient progress to be awarded a review of their suitability to move to open conditions prior to actual release
default will be deprived of legal aid for representation.  Most will be forced to represent themselves at their parole hearing and will 
defaulthave no choice but to 
defaultquestion 
defaultpersonally 
defaultprofessional witnesses as to their assessment of their risk to obtain a fair hearing. 
defaultPrisoners would therefore need to be provided with all the documentation that has hitherto been given to their lawyers, includin
defaultg details about victims.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe Justice Secretary has said that prisoners, including children, don’t need lawyers because they can complain. 
defaultMany of the serious issues that Howard League lawyers deal with every day, such as making sure children have a safe place to go to when they leave jail are not suitable for backwards looking complaints systems. A complaints system can only rectify mistakes
default once they have been made, often incurring many months delay. Lawyers representing prisoners with 
defaultsentence planning
default and resettlement help to prevent mistakes.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultEven with help from lawyers, the complaints system has been inadequate to protect 
defaultprisoners 
defaultfrom abuse behind closed doors
default.
default The Howard League has represented children and young adults who have been subjected to unlawful punishments, physical restraints resulting in broken limbs, and moves to mental health facilities. Without legal action these wo
defaultuld not have been remedied and the abuse would have continued.
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default3
default              
defaultSince July 2010, the legal aid rules have restricted lawyers from claiming for legal aid for issues that could be resolved through the complaints system.  As a consequence, 
defaultthe 
defaultHoward Le
defaultague
default 
defaultlegal team has considerable experience of conducting complaints on behalf of young people who cannot navigate the system themselves
default.
default 
defaultBecause this work is not covered by legal aid, the charity has had to provide it on a pro bono basis, supported from limited charitable funding. 
defaultOur experience of this work highlights the numerous problems with the complaints system as a form of redress wh
defaulten compared to the benefits of legal representation:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultThe availability of judicial review for prisoners in the future is unclear pending the further consultation on judicial review and the i
defaultmpact of the residence test on this group: it cannot be said to act as a safety net.  Our lawyers resolve cases simply and efficiently every day.  Although many of these cases could technically turn into judicial review cases, it is in everyone’s interests
default to fix the problem as quickly as possible.
default  
default5.2
default              
defaultOn the rare occasion that
default judicial review
defaults
default become necessary,
default it is vitally important that prisoners are not barred from bringing them due to technical hurdles
default. 
defaultThe response by APL sets out the technical 
defaultdifficulties that will be posed by the new residence test and the way in which judicial review work is structured. We are deeply concerned that the Justice Secretary relies on the availability of legal aid for judicial review as an excuse for withdrawing c
defaultriminal legal aid for prisoners’ legal problems while at the same time proposing to drastically curtail the availability of legal aid for judicial review.
default5.3
default              
defaultThe proposed changes to judicial review include not only restrictions on legal aid which will mea
defaultn that lawyers may simply not be able to burden the financial risk of bringing claims on behalf of individuals but also restricting the right of interest groups to bring claims in the public interest.  Although we appreciate that the new proposals to restr
defaultict standing are not within the Committee’s ambit, we are concerned that the combination means that organisations like us will no longer be able to assist individuals or raise points of principle.  Our case work over the years has done both, with great ben
defaultefits to children in prison.  For instance, a case brought on behalf of 14 year old K
default paved the way for all children to have a right to an oral hearing before the parole board whereas the Children Act case
default brought in the Howard League’s own name secured 
defaultchild protection rights for all children in the secure estate.

defaultChanges to legal aid for prison law and judicial review defaultwill be defaultdisastrous for the safety and rights of children and young people in prison.default default6.1
default              
defaultThe Howard League legal team has represented hu
defaultndreds of children in prisons and privately run secure training centres to help them to progress 
defaultmore safely
default through their incarceration and to make sure the arrangements for their resettlement are safe and supportive. Legal aid to pay for this work 
defaultwill b
defaulte
default essentially abolished.
default  The only criminal legal aid for prison law will relate to parole hearings where release is possible or disciplinary hearings where a magistrate may impose 
defaultadditional days.  
defaultYet, t
defaulthese cases affect a small proportion of children.  
defaultThis is because all other aspects of the criminal justice system are based on the principle that children should be treated differently fro
defaultm adults. 
defaultHence, most children are detained under Detention and Training Orders.  Although there is no power to 
defaultimpose additional days on children serving such sentences, poor behaviour that might have led to a disciplinary hearing by a judge in the case of an adult, can equally lead to penalties such as the imposition of an electronic tag on release or not getting 
defaultearly release at all.  Yet children will have no access to a lawyer to deal with these issues unless the high threshold for judicial review is met.
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNot only will this mean that children will not get
default onto
default the courses they need to address their offending or 
defaultthe local authority support to reintegrate safely into the community, but it also means that our lawyers won’t find out about any serious abuse going on inside the prison. Access to an expert lawyer, who is on their side, who helps the children to get thei
defaultr entitlements and help to settle back home is one of the key ways we can all find out about what is going on inside jails.
default6.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe relationship of trust built up between Howard League lawyers and children in custody has shown them that the law can be a force 
defaultfor good, one of the essential components of respect for the law and responsible citizenship.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe announcement that legal aid will no longer be available for prisoners means children in custody will be hidden from view, unable to get redress for abuse. Th
defaulte history of closed and secretive institutions that hold children is one of abuse and violence. Prisons and STCs are bad enough as intermittent inspections have shown,
default 
defaultbut without legal representation and challenge, they will get worse.
default 
defaultOn the day that the
default secretary of state announced that children in custody will no longer have access to the law, an inspection repor
defaultt on 
defaultCookham
default Wood prison revealed
default that half of the boys 
defaultheld there 
defaulthad experienced violent restraint, a fifth 
defaulthad been
default 
defaultheld in solitary confinement, 
defaultthe young people
default commonly spend 14 hours a 
defaultday locked in cells and the fact
default that safety was not assured, even after the suicide of a 15 year old last year.
default 
default6.5
default              
defaultThe availability of advocates in prisons is not sufficient reaso
defaultn to dispense with legal advice and representation.  The advocates provide a vital service, but it is different from a legal service.  The advocates were required because of the immense level of need faced by children in prison. The contracts for such serv
defaultices (which are not new) require that the advocates resolve things at the lowest level: they are not to 
defaultprovide legal advice
default, nor indeed would they be capabl
defaulte
default of so doing as they have no legal training or expertise.
default6.6
default              
defaultThe nuts and bolts of the work the H
defaultoward League’s team undertakes under fixed fees for children concerns serious and important issues – all of which will no longer be available.  This includes:
default&#xa0;
defaultResettlementdefault 
defaultwork for children in prison: defaultThis is work preparing the ground for release on 
defaultlicence
default or under supervision, ensuring that an appropriate accommodation and 
defaulta 
defaultsupport package is in place for release. This is vital for a smooth transition back into the local community. Release may be del
defaultayed because this work will no longer be continued and this will increase the overall costs of detaining a child.  Around 70 per cent of children reoffend.  It is well known that inadequate accommodation and support are linked to reoffending.  Getting the 
defaultright package of support for children on release from custody is critical to the success of the Ministry of Justice’s rehabilitation revolution. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPre-tariff reviewsdefault: These are very rare for children and young people.  The system is that those who make goo
defaultd progress are entitled to be considered for an early review to see if they can progress to open conditions where they will be able to prepare for release and return to education and work.  Most young people will require legal help in securing such a revie
defaultw. That will no longer be available.  Those who are granted such a review without legal assistance will not have any legal representation at their hearing.   These 
defaultchildren
default 
defaultand young people 
defaultwill be expected to represent themselves, question witnesses and 
defaultp
defaultrepare the case.  It is absurd to think that a young person could have a fair hearing in such circumstances.  Yet there is 
defaultno provision
default for any flexibility to fund such cases.
