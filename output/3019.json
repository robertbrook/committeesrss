"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Buglife&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government is assessing the viability of a biodiversity offsetting scheme\n in England\n. Any scheme \ntaken forward must consider species. The current habitat\n focussed\n metric \nis unlikely to address the individual needs of species when re-creating habitat. T\nhis \nwill \nlead to losses of biodiversity rather than be\ning\n a step towards fixing the problem.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany sp\necies require specific and particular \nhabitat\n conditions\n,\n \noften at a very fine scale\n. \nThese \nare influenced by \naspect, geographical location, soil biology\n, past uses of the site\n etc. \nThe current metric does not take this into account and as a result newly c\nreated habitats are unlikely to\n \nreflect the original fine scale conditions \nnecessary for \ncertain species.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are gaps in knowledge \nabout the biology of some \nspecies\n and this \nwill affect the suc\ncess of offsetting\n \nschemes. A\ns we don’t know what they nee\nd to complete a full life cycle\n it is very difficult to successfully replace what has been lost\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe don’t have \na\n consistently detailed species and habitat data to use as a \nquantifiable \ndata \nset as \nstarting point for offsetting\n schemes\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResources are needed to address \nknowledge \ngaps in \nspecies biology \nand develop a robust \nset of baseline data to work from.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuglife is the only organisation in Europe devoted to the con\nservation of all invertebrates - \neverything from bees to \nbeetles, worms to woodlice and jumping spiders to jellyfish. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are more than 40,000 invertebrate species in the UK, and many of these are under threat\n from extinction\n. Invertebrates are vitally important to a healthy planet – humans and other life fo\nrms could not survive without them. The food we eat, the fish we catch, the birds we see, the flowers we smell and the hum of life we hear, simply would not exist without bugs. Invertebrates underpin life on earth and without them the world’s ecosystems wo\nuld collapse. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuglife is submitting \nthis evidence \nto ensure that species, specifically invertebrates, are\n considered \nwhen \nassessing the practicalities of an offsetting scheme and \nlooking at \nwhether or not \na biodiversity offsetting scheme should go ahead. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHabitats where rare and endangered invertebrates can be found are constantly under threat from development. Mitigation and/or compensation for th\nese\n habitat loss\nes is \noften inadequate\n \nand invertebrate surveys are \nfrequently \nnot carried out\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn example \nthat is \nsobering to look at is the loss of \nwildlife-rich \nbrownfield land in the Thames Gateway. Buglife has calculated that in the Thames Gateway and surrounding area \nover 50% of \nhigh va\nlue \nsites have been lost or damaged since 2007. \nWhilst not always the first thought for \nnature conservation brownfield land can be home to as many rare invertebrates as \nancient woodland\n,\n so this loss\n \nis\n not good news for biodiversity.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany species take refuge at brownfield sites where \ncycles of disturbance and abandonment\n,\n combi\nned with low nutrient soils\n give ris\ne to a wide variety of habitats. \nMany invertebrates have complex life-cycles, needing different things at different stages, s\no they often require two or more habitats close to each other\n. Brownfield land can be perfect for this and as a result some \nsites can have as many rare invertebrate species as ancient woodland, and many act as important ‘reservoirs’ of wildlife. \n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor offsetting to be successful there needs to be a few ground rules. \nWhilst \nthere are many factors contributing to how successful offsetting will be in England \nthere are \ntwo issues that Buglife considers \nparamount. Firstly \nit must\n always be a last resort\n, ensuring \nthe mitigation hierarchy of ‘avoid, mitigate and compensate’ is followed. \nOffsetting \ncannot become a ‘green card’ for development. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecondly, offsetting should be applied to all species – this includes Species of Princip\nal Importance for Conservation in England (\nNatural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act \n[Section 41]) and those included on Red Data Lists, Nationally Scarce lists (where available) and Regionally Scarce lists\n (endangered and threatened species)\n. F\nocussing on only on legally protected species will not realise the targets set out in Biodiversity 2020.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn offsetting metric has been developed by Defra to calculate the area of habitat that needs to be created to offset a loss. This\n currently does not address impact from a species perspective. \nMany species require specific and particular habitat conditions\n,\n often at a very fine scale. These can be created though aspect, geographical location, soil biology, past uses of the site etc. \nFor some species, such as invertebrates, a formula based simply on habitats will not automatically \nassess \nthe original habitat’s complexity or structure \nand translate it \ninto the new area of habitat. \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example, an area of lowland meadow is to be lost to development and the quantity of habitat recreation required is calculated. However it could be the bare and open ground, varied topography or damp areas within this habitat that provide key resources \nfor priority invertebrate species. There is no way to ensure recognition of this within the current metric and the new habitat may not provide all lifecycle requirements for that species. As a result populations will decline and it may become extinct in th\nat locality. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocation of the offset is crucial and needs to be strongly reflected in the metric. It must be close to the original loss as possible so that it is able to benefit the species using the area of land to be lost. Non-mobi\nle species may not be able to colonise sites over a certain distance and\n the specific climatic conditions\n \non \na site can be vital to ecological va\nlue.  For example brownfield sites in the Thames Gateway are specific to their geographical location, climate a\nnd aspect. As a result these sites have a completely different species assemblage to brownfield sites in an area such as Teeside.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also important to start identifying possible receptor sites as early in the process as possible\n. This will help\n to ensu\nre \nthat \noffset sites are within established ecological networks and not isolated, \nand that there is thorough assessment of the quality of a receptor site. It would be unacceptable to have new habitats created on areas that are already of high ecological value \nbut \nof a \ndifferent \ntype\n. This would lead to additional biodiversity losses – a\nn issue that does not appear to have been covered in the metric. \n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is imperative there is an investment in underlying data, this needs to extend to mapping of both habitats and species of principal importance\n and ensur\ne\n that \nLocal Wildlife Sites schedules are up to date\n.\n \nWithout\n information on what species and habitats there is and where they are located across an region or area, \nit is impossible to quantify biodiversity loss and gains\n, \nplan how develo\npment will affect biodive\nrsity and understand development impacts across England.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis need has been highlighted by the Somerset offsetting scheme where a species focussed metric has been developed\n independently of Defra\n. This scheme is showing some positive results, a key reaso\nn for success is the level of habitat and species data that is held by the county. This has guided the need for and location of offset schemes. Unfortunately not all counties or biological record centres have access to such thorough datasets to work from a\nnd many local authorities do not even have an ecologist, let alone enough resources to compile these data.\n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe biology of a species will affect how easily offsetting can be applied and whilst we know of species where suitable habitat can be created relati\nvely quickly and easily, e.g. certain bees, butterflies and dragonflies, there are significant omissions in our knowledge. The gaps for some species are so large it would make it impossible to successfully recreate the \nspecific requirements \nas they are unk\nnown. For example, the \nFour banded weevil wasp (\nCerceris quadricincta\n) and Five banded weevil wasp (\nCerceris quinquefasciata\n) \nare \nSpecies of Principal Importance \nwhere suitable habitat exists but \nit is \nunoccupied, for unknown reasons. The Streaked bombardi\ner beetle (\nBrachinus sclopeta\n)\n \nhas such complex lifecycle\n,\n as it is necessary to create the right conditions for the beetle\n+\n and its host \nspecies,\n it is very difficult to recreate a habitat for them with any certainty of success.  \n&#xa0;\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\nurther work is needed to ensure that any offsetting scheme taken forward delivers biodiversity gains for species – and not just for European Protected Species but the lesser known species that underpin biodiversity. This is the only way to achieve no net l\noss of biodiversity.\n&#xa0;\n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are gaps in knowledge about species\n’ biology\n that will affect how successful an offsetting scheme\n will be\n. A robust baseline data set must be gathered \nto be used \nas \na quantifiable starting point.  \n&#xa0;\n8.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA realistic assessment of resources must be taken. Currently local authorities are poorly placed to engage with schemes due to a \nlack of \nlocal authority \necologists. \n&#xa0;\n16 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
