She has a history of abuse and is traumatised by the events.  The prison service has never conducted a psychological assessment on her.  Through legal advice she has been able to have a detailed psychological assessment prepared that properly identifies her areas of risk and need and a future treatment pathway. This could no longer be carried out. \n&#xa0;\nShe will not be entitled to legal aid to assist her in making an application to have her minimum term reviewed at the half way point.\n&#xa0;\nShe will not be entitled to \nlegal \nrepresentation\n before the Parole Board\n to assess her suitability to move to open conditions before her tariff expires.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOther Scope reductions\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase Study BBB\n was a foreign national who gave birth to a baby with disabilities while on remand.  She spoke no English. After her sentence she was informed that the baby would be removed as they did not know if she would be allowed to remain with her baby when she was eventually returned to Spain.  After taking legal advice it was possible to establish that the Spanish authorities would accept her home to serve her sentence and would allow her to remain with her baby.  The decision was reversed.  This case could no longer be funded under the prison law contact.  Aside from the human costs of an unnecessary separation\n of mother and child\n, the cost to the public purse would have been enormous\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase Study CCC\n had a category A review where he has b\ne\nen informed that he will remain category A due to security concerns that will not be disclosed to him.  Investigations with the CPS have established that an allegation was made that he had been involved in placing a \n‘\ncontract\n’\n on a prisoner\n,\n but that they now considered this evidence to be unsubstantiated and unreliable.  Without legal advice, the prisoner would never know the nature of the allegations against him, less still that th\ne\ny are \nunreliable\n.\n All the internal complaints system can produce is a reply that the decision was based on material that will not be disclosed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCosts Issues&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n25 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n Minimum term review applications are matters that relate to the setting of the tariff for prisoners sentence to life/indeterminate sentences\n Para 3.20 – emphasis as in original\n Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, s 28(7)\n Criminal Justice Act 2003, s 239(2)\n \nhttp://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/parole-board/icm-manual.pdf\n \n \nEg: Irwin J in \nR (Hill) v SSHD\n \n[2007] EWHC 2164 (Admin)\n:\n “it seems clear that release from closed conditions with no period in open prison is very rare.”\n (para 6)\n \nhttp://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/inspectorate-reports/hmiprobation/anthonyricereport-rps.pdf\n  \n A solicitor, barrister, medical practitioner or someone of standing approved by the Board\n \nIn \nWilliams v Secretary of State for the Home Department\n [\n2002] EWCA Civ 498 the Court of Appeal were informed that the only 3 category A lifers to ever have been released and th\ne\nse all took place under the Good Friday agreement. \n Although it is important to recall that when asked about costs by the Select Committee, the Minister stated that the decision in relation to prisons was ideological not costs driven.\n \nhttp://www.ppo.gov.uk/docs/ppo-annual-report-2012-13.pdf\n \nIbid, p 13\n 18% of all complaints and 24% if immigration detention complaints – page 17\n \nhttp://www.ppo.gov.uk/docs/annual-report-2002-20031.pdf\n p 7\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmjust/91/130703.htm\n questions 198-210\n"
