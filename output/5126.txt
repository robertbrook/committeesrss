&#xa0;Written evidence from Jonathan Isaby, TaxPayers Alliance [TOB02]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“I have decided not to make any changes to excise on tobacco in this Budget because I believe the high price is now giving rise to massive cigarette smuggling. My responsibility as Minister for Finance is to protect the tax base.” &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“The increased complexity of the market for tobacco products means that earlier studies of the UK duty-paid segment of the market… struggle to predict the impact of price changes on demand. Normally, price increases would lead to reduced consumption. However, more recently the effects of higher prices have become more uncertain as consumers may switch their consumption to other sources or lower quality cigarettes.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“[unanswered] questions about the consequences for smuggling… what results might ensue if the tax reached what the public believes is an unacceptable level.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“Contraband cigarettes are perceived to be a near-perfect substitute for lawfully purchased cigarettes. As such, contraband tobacco use neutralises the deterrent effect of higher taxes”.&#xa0;&#xa0;“This dynamic was recognised by government officials in the mid-1990s, and tobacco excise taxes were reduced in order to weaken incentives to purchase, manufacture, distribute, and smuggle contraband tobacco. But the federal government began to raise tobacco taxes again in the early 2000s. Predictably, the higher taxes stimulated trade in contraband tobacco, resulting in a flourishing black market that now constitutes an estimated 27 per cent share of the overall tobacco market”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“It would be easy to say dealing with this situation is one that just requires increased law enforcement, monitoring and intelligence operations, and that there is no connection between a potential increase in smuggling and the government's plans for plain packaging of cigarettes. But this is not the case. First, plain packaging will be easier to counterfeit than branded packs. Once you've forged one packet with the name of the product on it, you've forged them all. Secondly, if it is easier to fake the packet, then it will be encouragement for organised crime groups to produce more and more fake tobacco to contain within them. If there is a natural barrier put on the numbers of cigarettes you can fake, because of the multiple numbers of brands in the marketplace that need to be counterfeited, then there is no limit put upon smugglers and organised crime groups if the carton – and content – are [sic] the same.”&#xa0;“I am not a cigarette smoker, but surely one potential problem with plain packaging is not whether experts and officials can check a code to see whether the product is illegal but whether the public who buy the packs can spot it easily.”“It would be disastrous if the government, by introducing plain-packaging legislation, removes the simplest mechanism for the ordinary consumer to tell whether their cigarettes are counterfeit or not.”“The presence of pictorial health warnings has not to date discouraged counterfeiting, and health warnings are easier to counterfeit than specific brands and features.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Relevant recent pieces of TaxPayers’ Alliance research from which this submission is drawn include:Tax Gap: How cracking down on illicit trade could fund a 1p cut in the basic rate of Income tax, April 2012http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/taxgaps.pdfThe Single Income Tax, Final report of the 2020 Tax Commission, specifically Section 7.1.1.
