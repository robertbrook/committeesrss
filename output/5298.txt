[[[Is cycling safe?]]]&#xa0;It is neither as dangerous as non-cyclists perceive it to be nor as safe as it should be in a civilised society such as ours.  It could be made much safer per mile cycled and the number of cyclists could be greatly increased for comparatively little compared with the amount spent on roads and the expenditure by the NHS on illness related to obesity.&#xa0;Cycling in traffic feels particularly unsafe because however careful cyclists are, their safety is largely in the hands of drivers.  A cyclist who is dressed in bright clothing, wears a helmet. who has good lighting and who rides carefully and correctly may still be wiped out be a motorist. If they are, they are largely unprotected and will be seriously hurt or killed.  Conversely, a careful driver who makes no mistake is unlikely to be involved in a serious accident and if they are, their car will provide a lot of protection for them. So cyclists are vulnerable and at the mercy of others to a much greater extent than motorists.&#xa0;

[[[II. What could be done to improve safety?]]]&#xa0;A. Segregation(see below)&#xa0;B. Take steps to reduce the danger caused to cyclists by vehicles

[[[&#xa0;]]]1. The Highway Code&#xa0;Improve the content and the emphasis of the highway code.The Highway Code devotes only three paragraphs (211 – 213) to the care motorists should pay to cyclists,(including them with motorcyclists, which is potentially misleading and                    dangerous) and giving the impression that they are rather an afterthought rather than users with equal rights of access. The Code needs amendment to inculcate an understanding of cycling in the motorist, particularly of the difficulties and dangers involved in cycling, and how cycling differs from motoring. &#xa0;The Code should state that motorists should allow cyclists a minimum width of 1.5m when overtaking.&#xa0;2. Speed limits&#xa0;A 20mph limit should be the norm in urban areas where segregated cycle facilities are lacking&#xa0;Speed limits should be enforced preferably by traffic calming measures which are cycle-friendly or by speed cameras.&#xa0;3. Driving test&#xa0;The test should require the driver to demonstrate knowledge of defensive driving techniques to minimise the chance of hitting a cyclist.&#xa0;Knowledge about the position a cyclist should take on the road should be part of the test.  Drivers should be aware that cyclists should not be hugging the kerb.&#xa0;4. Definition of dangerous driving&#xa0;Define "dangerous driving" realistically so that a driver who causes the death or serious injury of another by the way they have driven will in all cases be charged with dangerous driving.&#xa0;5. Penalty for killing a cyclist (or pedestrian)&#xa0;Make drivers more careful in the vicinity of cyclists (and pedestrians!) by making the loss of the driving licence mandatory in all cases where a driver is found responsible for the death of a cyclist or pedestrian. Prison is not an appropriate punishment; a period of being forbidden to drive is a more effective encouragement to people to drive carefully, particularly in the case of HGV drivers who are responsible for a disproportionate number of cyclist deaths.&#xa0;6. HGV's&#xa0;Fit all HGV's with devices to warn the driver of the presence of a cyclistBan HGV's from city and town centres during the day unless segregated facilities for cyclists have been provided.&#xa0;7.Legalise cycling on footways beside fast roads&#xa0;Legalize cycling on footpaths beside fast roads.  Ideally, it should be legalised where the speed limit is more than 30mph with power for Councils to apply for exemptions where necessary i.e. to ban cyclists from footpaths where pedestrian use would make cycling inappropriate.  A start could perhaps be made by legalisation where the limit is above 40mph.  Clearly, cyclists must ride safely with due  consideration for other path users. &#xa0;8. Cycle lanes: priority, width, usually free of parked vehicles.&#xa0;Vehicles should cede priority to cycle lanes across junctions and roundabouts.  This would play a part in making motorists more aware of cyclists. The change would, however, need wide publicity.  The lanes should be clearly marked.&#xa0;All on-road cycle lanes should have a minimum width of 1.5m.  Narrow lanes are likely to increase danger to cyclists by causing them to ride in the gutter and encourage cars to squeeze past where there is insufficient room.&#xa0;In all but exceptional circumstances, no parking should be allowed in cycle lanes.&#xa0;9. Signs to remind drivers of minimum overtaking width.&#xa0;As in France, the space which should be allowed cyclists by overtaking vehicles should be emphasised by reminders on road signs.&#xa0;&#xa0;C. Create a climate in which the public will accept restrictions on vehicles and the space allotted to them to enable safer cycling.&#xa0;1. Publicise damage to health and environment by vehicles.&#xa0;Publicise facts about the true environmental and health costs of current vehicle use  in terms of air quality, noise pollution and climate change.  In particular, the public should be aware of the estimated 5000 premature deaths in the UK caused by vehicle emissions (see  Public Health Impacts of Combustion Emissions in the United KingdomSteve H. L. Yim and Steven R. H. Barrett

Combat myths and publicise data about causes of accidents to cyclists&#xa0;Make the public in general and the police in particular aware of the facts concerning  accidents involving adult cyclists. The fact that on the analysis commissioned by the Department of Transport, the police had found drivers were solely to blame in about 60 - 75% of cases and cyclists solely to blame in about 17-25% of cases should be widely known. At present, this analysis is largely ignored and as a result the debate about what action is needed to deal with the problem of increased cycling casualties is ill-informed.  (see Collisions involving pedal cyclists on Britain's roads: establishing the causes 16/03/2011 Ref PPR445 ISBN 9781846089374 ISSN 0968-4093 - "Collisions"). &#xa0;Combat the myths that failure to wear bright clothing and failure to stop at traffic lights cause most cycle casualties by publicising the fact that this was a cause in 4%-5% of accidents involving cyclists (see Collisions above).&#xa0;3. Encourage better behaviour by cyclists.&#xa0;At the same time encourage cycle organisations to take the lead in trying reduce the  type of behaviour by cyclists which leads to antipathy to cyclists, particularly in large cities.  The obvious flash point is the failure to stop at traffic lights.&#xa0;4. Publicise health benefits of cycling.&#xa0;Publicise the benefits of cycling in keeping people fit and combating obesity, for example publish the typical calories burned in a week/month/year and the weight which might typically be lost by regularly cycling 2 miles a day. &#xa0;D. Provide information to enable cyclists to find safe routes.&#xa0;1. Local maps.&#xa0;Detailed maps for cyclists are needed showing clearly which routes provide segregated facilities, which are along quiet roads, roads with traffic calming measures and so on so that cyclists can find a route which is as safe as possible.  The maps should be available on-line.   &#xa0;2. The National Cycle Network created by Sustrans.&#xa0;Parts of the network include busy sections where cyclists are in danger.  These sections should be clearly shown as interim routes and should not enjoy full National Cycle Network status.  Again, this will enable cyclists to make informed choices about their routes.&#xa0;3. Provide local signage to facilitate safe route-finding.&#xa0;E. Cycle training.&#xa0;1. Adults.&#xa0;Bikeability 3 courses for adults should be widely publicised and available.  Organisations such as CTC and Sustrans have a part to play.  We are volunteers for Sustrans and as part of our volunteer duties, check routes along busy roads which are not safe for cyclists. Our requests for Sustrans to provide us with Bikeability 3 training have been met with the response that they do not provide such training and have no plans to do so.&#xa0;2. Children&#xa0;We understand that cycle training for children is already widely provided, but we have no special knowledge about this.  Clearly it is needed and should be extended with particular emphasis on the danger points for child cyclists e.g cycling off the pavement onto the road without looking (see "Collisions" above).&#xa0;

[[[III. Segregation]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Segregate cycle lanes, particularly in urban areas. Dedicated cycle lanes protect cyclists and encourage cycling. They would contribute to a reduction in car usage, carbon dioxide emissions, noise pollution and light pollution, as well as increasing public safety by reducing accidents and reducing the incidence of deaths caused by vehicle emissions and  pollution. &#xa0;Safer routes to schools would encourage and protect children, as has been proved in The Netherlands (see the result of the Dutch campaign called "Stop de Kindermoord"  which reduced child pedestrian and cycle deaths from 450 in 1971 to 14 in 2010). It would also contribute to improved health and fitness.&#xa0;When a new  housing development is planned,  a condition should be a contribution to the construction of a cycling infrastructure, not merely on the housing development itself but also in the adjoining areas, to offset the inevitable increase in motorised transport.  &#xa0;Existing cycling lanes and routes should be connected to each other to avoid dangerous stretches and contribute to integration.  &#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
