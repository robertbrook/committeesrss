defaultPrincipal Purposedefaultsdefault of Proposalsdefaultt
defaulto
default 
defaultidentify the
default value developed within the BBC’s life and to help it to continue
defaultto
default establish a structure which will help the population identify (more than hitherto and
defaultcurrently
default) with the merits of Public Service Broadcasting
defaultto
default furnish some detailed suggestions which 
defaultwill strengthen the first two items above
default&#xa0;
defaultPreamble – 2013 for 2016
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have a BRITISH B
defaultroadcasting Corporation 
defaultfor which we are asked to plan a future at a time when we do not know what the future meaning of British will be, in 2016.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the Scottish Refe
defaultrendum opts for continued Union this simplifies the task of saying what British should carry on to mean. It should reflect on the contributions made by Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England to the life and achievements of the United Kingdom.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf th
defaulte Scottish Referendum opts for movement away from the Union, the proposals below still hold that the history of the UK has been of a great net value to all the current population, and should continue to resound in the culture and progress of the devolving 
defaultentities for the present and foreseeable future
default. There will be a Monarchy in common, most likely a common currency, certainly a language in common (albeit with differences to conserve and celebrate) and there will continue to be a huge Scottish presence a
defaultnd influence in the rest of the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultP1default  I
default propose therefore that the British Broadcasting Corporation should continue to be named, thus – even if the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation (likely based in Glasgow) continues under that name. The SBC would cont
defaultinue to make and share a great deal of the programming made on both sides of the border.
default&#xa0;
defaultP2  Theredefault should be a Public Service Broadcasting TrustdefaultThis would have two Divisions –
default a defaultCordefault(defaultporation
default) Division and a Com(defaultmercial
default) Division*defaultThe PSBT would look to 
defaultthe public, its audience and encourage 
defaultReithian
default ideals of
defaultBroadcasting.
default  
defaultThis ‘outward facing’ stance would serve to:
defaulthelp
default the population to realize that the whole effort is in “their” 
defaultie
default OUR interest;
defaultreduce
default the number of people now before the courts as 
defaultl
defaulticence
default payment defaulters;
defaultThe PSBT 
defaultCorDiv
default would attend to matters at the BBC.
defaultThe PSBT 
defaultComDiv
default would attend to all content made and offered on all other “platforms”.
defaultThe PSBT should be financed by a first slice off the 
defaultLicence
default Revenue – thus
defaultthe
default regulation
default of BOTH BBC AND COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING would be
defaultpaid
default for directly by the public and rendered answerable to the public.
defaultThe PSBT should have 
defaulta strong and published Audience Research functiondefault – measuring
defaultSatisfaction, and assessing allegations of harms and
default other negative functions
default*this would replace 
defaultOfcom’s
default activities in the regulation of broadcasting; necessary
defaultlegislation
default would have to be enacted.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSBT (especially 
defaultCorDiv
default) would 
defaultdraw back from dramatizing the ‘emotionaldefaultpdefaultenumbradefault’ defaultof sportsdefault – footbal
defaultlers post goal antics, spraying of (mock?) “
defaultchampagne
default”
defaultover
default winning
default defaultteams – such 
defaultbehaviour
default simply not being broadcast. Managers and sports
defaultpeople
default would presently learn to reserve their energies for sport, and not apparently
defaultcontribute
default to “lad culture” acti
defaultvities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSBT would 
defaultcontinue to assess fairnessdefault in the coverage of politics, with special
defaultassessment
default drawn from small sectors of the public identified by test as being already well
defaultinformed
default on matters in focus.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSBT would undertake and publish the
default results of 
defaultrigorous assessment of newdefaultventuresdefault such as the introduction of broadcasting from court proceedings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSBT would encourage a return to the use of 
default“educated English” in dictiondefault and in
defaultdeploymentdefault of syntaxdefault.  For announcers of news 
defaultparticularly  but
default also in documentary
defaultpresentation  this
default would entail current best practice including speakers with “
defaultPerthshire
default”
defaultScottish and “educated Welsh and Northern Ireland” delivery.
default  It would discourage
default“
defaultestuarisation
default” (see footnote for observed ex
defaultamples)
default. There should be an internal
defaultconsultantdefault on pronunciation of foreign wordsdefault (preferably as foreign speakers say them –
defaultthus
default “
defaultarf
default-
defaultgharn
default-is-tarn” rather than 
defaultaff
default-
defaultgann
default-is-
defaulttann
default, and hybrid variants incorporating
defaultsome
default long and some short vowels).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSBT should encourage the 
defaultreduction of “gristle”default (as in ‘connective tissue’ in the body)
defaultmanifest
default in continuity and cross channel announcements on BBC and risked at the possible
defaultcost
default in audience sizes on commercial channels; it should also discourage t
defaulthe foible of
defaultshowing
default newsrooms behind the newsreader – the news is NOT about who collects and
defaultpresents
default it – but about the world outside.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSBT should discourage the practice of assuming that 100% of the audience has access
defaultto
default the internet and will use 
defaultit. The ONS estimates that several million households do not have
defaultinternet
default access and several million individuals do not have or use telephone access to the
defaultinternet
default. Thus broadcast invitations to audience members to respond should not, as now,
defaultpoint
default to i
defaultnternet access but should point out to people that they can write or telephone
defaultand
default in the latter case that there will be a human being there to answer calls. This is to
defaultmakedefault response access more fairly available to alldefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSBT should 
defaultassess (and publishdefault) responses from people with handicapsdefault of hearing
defaultand
default of vision as to the quality of attempts to help them – thus speech on radio (and in TV
defaultdrama
default and documentary) should not be overly encumbered by “atmospheric” music which
defaultin
default reality provides camouflage,
default and the subtitling services, while often helpful, equally
defaultoften
default are very poor and frustrating. Subtitles in white on a white background are almost
defaultuseless
default and white text should be shown on a dark background rectangle.
default&#xa0;
defaultP3   PunishmentsdefaultBoth Divisions of the PSBT should have the power to FINE broadcasters for 
defaulttransgressions
defaultof
default the regulations.  For the BBC to forfeit 
defaultlicence
default revenue would be dysfunctional unless
defaultbehaviour
default was improved – to encourage this it should be considered to cut 
defaultsalaries of heads
defaultof
default departments taken to task.  The money collected would go to the World Service arm.
default&#xa0;
defaultP4   World ServicedefaultIt was not a good idea to have the World Service financed by the Foreign Office
default and nor is
defaultit
default a good idea to have it paid for by 
defaultlic
defaultence
default payers many thousands of whom are not able to
defaultafford
default it for domestic broadcasting.  The occasion of a new charter and 
defaultlicence
default review should
defaultbe
default used to arrange to have the 
defaultWorld Service paid for from the DFID budgetdefault defaultfor the most
defaultpart
default, bolstered by ‘as-
defaultand-when’ additions from fines for contravention of regulations.
default&#xa0;
defaultP5    Volumes of AdvertisingdefaultComDiv
default should retrieve the responsibility for advertising control, relinquished so 
defaultswiftly by
defaultOfcom
default when it was established – and 
defaultComDiv
default should consider whether 
defaultthe amount of
defaultadvertising
default broadcast for its own services by the BBC should fall within reasonable limits
defaultset
default by what research shows the viewers consider tolerable.

defaultIt has been estimated that there are (in 2011) approximately three quarters of a million of people born in Scotland who live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, 
defaultwhich
default represents 15 per cent of the population living in Scotland; a smaller though similar
default number of people born in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, live in Scotland. 
default 
defaultIt is sometimes said that the era of BROADCASTING has ended and with it, the supremacy of the BBC. Neither of these notions is true. Very recent audience measurements by BA
defaultRB show that some sort of television or download facility is switched on in a household for over 25 hours a week and the BBC’s two main channels gather over a quarter of “viewing” time.
