[normal]Written evidence submitted by Mallory [bold]Wober[bold] [FBB0046][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Message to [bold]the  House[bold] of Commons Select Committee Considering the Future for the BBC[bold]From
[normal]Joseph Mallory 
[normal]Wober
[normal]  PhD
[normal]Retired; previously Deputy Head of (Audience) Research
[normal],  Independent
[normal] Television Commission
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principal Purpose[bold]s[bold] of Proposals[bold]t
[normal]o
[normal] 
[normal]identify the
[normal] value developed within the BBC’s life and to help it to continue
[normal]to
[normal] establish a structure which will help the population identify (more than hitherto and
[normal]currently
[normal]) with the merits of Public Service Broadcasting
[normal]to
[normal] furnish some detailed suggestions which 
[normal]will strengthen the first two items above
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Preamble – 2013 for 2016
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have a BRITISH B
[normal]roadcasting Corporation 
[normal]for which we are asked to plan a future at a time when we do not know what the future meaning of British will be, in 2016.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the Scottish Refe
[normal]rendum opts for continued Union this simplifies the task of saying what British should carry on to mean. It should reflect on the contributions made by Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England to the life and achievements of the United Kingdom.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If th
[normal]e Scottish Referendum opts for movement away from the Union, the proposals below still hold that the history of the UK has been of a great net value to all the current population, and should continue to resound in the culture and progress of the devolving 
[normal]entities for the present and foreseeable future
[normal]. There will be a Monarchy in common, most likely a common currency, certainly a language in common (albeit with differences to conserve and celebrate) and there will continue to be a huge Scottish presence a
[normal]nd influence in the rest of the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P1[bold]  I
[normal] propose therefore that the British Broadcasting Corporation should continue to be named, thus – even if the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation (likely based in Glasgow) continues under that name. The SBC would cont
[normal]inue to make and share a great deal of the programming made on both sides of the border.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P2  There[bold] should be a Public Service Broadcasting Trust[bold]This would have two Divisions –
[normal] a [bold]Cor[bold]([bold]poration
[normal]) Division and a Com([bold]mercial
[normal]) Division*[bold]The PSBT would look to 
[normal]the public, its audience and encourage 
[normal]Reithian
[normal] ideals of
[normal]Broadcasting.
[normal]  
[normal]This ‘outward facing’ stance would serve to:
[normal]help
[normal] the population to realize that the whole effort is in “their” 
[normal]ie
[normal] OUR interest;
[normal]reduce
[normal] the number of people now before the courts as 
[normal]l
[normal]icence
[normal] payment defaulters;
[normal]The PSBT 
[normal]CorDiv
[normal] would attend to matters at the BBC.
[normal]The PSBT 
[normal]ComDiv
[normal] would attend to all content made and offered on all other “platforms”.
[normal]The PSBT should be financed by a first slice off the 
[normal]Licence
[normal] Revenue – thus
[normal]the
[normal] regulation
[normal] of BOTH BBC AND COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING would be
[normal]paid
[normal] for directly by the public and rendered answerable to the public.
[normal]The PSBT should have 
[normal]a strong and published Audience Research function[bold] – measuring
[normal]Satisfaction, and assessing allegations of harms and
[normal] other negative functions
[normal]*this would replace 
[normal]Ofcom’s
[normal] activities in the regulation of broadcasting; necessary
[normal]legislation
[normal] would have to be enacted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PSBT (especially 
[normal]CorDiv
[normal]) would 
[normal]draw back from dramatizing the ‘emotional[bold]p[bold]enumbra[bold]’ [bold]of sports[bold] – footbal
[normal]lers post goal antics, spraying of (mock?) “
[normal]champagne
[normal]”
[normal]over
[normal] winning
[normal] [bold]teams – such 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] simply not being broadcast. Managers and sports
[normal]people
[normal] would presently learn to reserve their energies for sport, and not apparently
[normal]contribute
[normal] to “lad culture” acti
[normal]vities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PSBT would 
[normal]continue to assess fairness[bold] in the coverage of politics, with special
[normal]assessment
[normal] drawn from small sectors of the public identified by test as being already well
[normal]informed
[normal] on matters in focus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PSBT would undertake and publish the
[normal] results of 
[normal]rigorous assessment of new[bold]ventures[bold] such as the introduction of broadcasting from court proceedings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PSBT would encourage a return to the use of 
[normal]“educated English” in diction[bold] and in
[normal]deployment[bold] of syntax[bold].  For announcers of news 
[normal]particularly  but
[normal] also in documentary
[normal]presentation  this
[normal] would entail current best practice including speakers with “
[normal]Perthshire
[normal]”
[normal]Scottish and “educated Welsh and Northern Ireland” delivery.
[normal]  It would discourage
[normal]“
[normal]estuarisation
[normal]” (see footnote for observed ex
[normal]amples)
[normal]. There should be an internal
[normal]consultant[bold] on pronunciation of foreign words[bold] (preferably as foreign speakers say them –
[normal]thus
[normal] “
[normal]arf
[normal]-
[normal]gharn
[normal]-is-tarn” rather than 
[normal]aff
[normal]-
[normal]gann
[normal]-is-
[normal]tann
[normal], and hybrid variants incorporating
[normal]some
[normal] long and some short vowels).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PSBT should encourage the 
[normal]reduction of “gristle”[bold] (as in ‘connective tissue’ in the body)
[normal]manifest
[normal] in continuity and cross channel announcements on BBC and risked at the possible
[normal]cost
[normal] in audience sizes on commercial channels; it should also discourage t
[normal]he foible of
[normal]showing
[normal] newsrooms behind the newsreader – the news is NOT about who collects and
[normal]presents
[normal] it – but about the world outside.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PSBT should discourage the practice of assuming that 100% of the audience has access
[normal]to
[normal] the internet and will use 
[normal]it. The ONS estimates that several million households do not have
[normal]internet
[normal] access and several million individuals do not have or use telephone access to the
[normal]internet
[normal]. Thus broadcast invitations to audience members to respond should not, as now,
[normal]point
[normal] to i
[normal]nternet access but should point out to people that they can write or telephone
[normal]and
[normal] in the latter case that there will be a human being there to answer calls. This is to
[normal]make[bold] response access more fairly available to all[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PSBT should 
[normal]assess (and publish[bold]) responses from people with handicaps[bold] of hearing
[normal]and
[normal] of vision as to the quality of attempts to help them – thus speech on radio (and in TV
[normal]drama
[normal] and documentary) should not be overly encumbered by “atmospheric” music which
[normal]in
[normal] reality provides camouflage,
[normal] and the subtitling services, while often helpful, equally
[normal]often
[normal] are very poor and frustrating. Subtitles in white on a white background are almost
[normal]useless
[normal] and white text should be shown on a dark background rectangle.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P3   Punishments[bold]Both Divisions of the PSBT should have the power to FINE broadcasters for 
[normal]transgressions
[normal]of
[normal] the regulations.  For the BBC to forfeit 
[normal]licence
[normal] revenue would be dysfunctional unless
[normal]behaviour
[normal] was improved – to encourage this it should be considered to cut 
[normal]salaries of heads
[normal]of
[normal] departments taken to task.  The money collected would go to the World Service arm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P4   World Service[bold]It was not a good idea to have the World Service financed by the Foreign Office
[normal] and nor is
[normal]it
[normal] a good idea to have it paid for by 
[normal]lic
[normal]ence
[normal] payers many thousands of whom are not able to
[normal]afford
[normal] it for domestic broadcasting.  The occasion of a new charter and 
[normal]licence
[normal] review should
[normal]be
[normal] used to arrange to have the 
[normal]World Service paid for from the DFID budget[bold] [bold]for the most
[normal]part
[normal], bolstered by ‘as-
[normal]and-when’ additions from fines for contravention of regulations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P5    Volumes of Advertising[bold]ComDiv
[normal] should retrieve the responsibility for advertising control, relinquished so 
[normal]swiftly by
[normal]Ofcom
[normal] when it was established – and 
[normal]ComDiv
[normal] should consider whether 
[normal]the amount of
[normal]advertising
[normal] broadcast for its own services by the BBC should fall within reasonable limits
[normal]set
[normal] by what research shows the viewers consider tolerable.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal] 
[normal]It has been estimated that there are (in 2011) approximately three quarters of a million of people born in Scotland who live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, 
[normal]which
[normal] represents 15 per cent of the population living in Scotland; a smaller though similar
[normal] number of people born in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, live in Scotland. 
[normal] 
[normal]It is sometimes said that the era of BROADCASTING has ended and with it, the supremacy of the BBC. Neither of these notions is true. Very recent audience measurements by BA
[normal]RB show that some sort of television or download facility is switched on in a household for over 25 hours a week and the BBC’s two main channels gather over a quarter of “viewing” time.

[normal]: 
[normal]A misogynist culture has recently been 
[normal]reported in British Universities and
[normal],,
[normal] while this is not a direct outcome of ‘the culture of the airwaves’ it 
[normal]should 
[normal]be 
[normal]established
[normal] that the broadcasting world, in its quest for “youth audiences” is NO
[normal]T abetting an
[normal]y such hostilities. See:

[normal]a
[normal] BBC news report said that there was a “statement 
[normal]TO[bold] the (house o
[normal]f Commons)” when it should have written that there was a statement 
[normal]AT[bold] the Commons – reporters should know what a preposition is, and use each one precisely; misuse can mea
[normal]n significant misrepresentation.  S
