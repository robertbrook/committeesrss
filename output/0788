default1.1.
default 
defaultMyalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) is a fluctuating 
defaultlong-term condition 
defaultthat 
defaultaffects around 250,000 men, women and children in the UK.
default 
defaultIt causes symptoms affecting many body systems, more commonly the nervous and immune systems. 
defaultAround 25% of patients are severely affected, and may be confined to bed or unable to leave the house without the use of a wheelchair. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default. Action for M.E. is the UK’s largest charity for people affected by M.E.
default 
defaultWe provide information and support, campaign for better services and more effective treatments

defaultA respondent

default Buckinghamshire said: “Some of my GPs are often biased by the diagnosis of M.E. when I try and discuss another issue or want to seek further advice or tests. It can also take some time to discuss a condition properly in light of other conditions I have, which can be difficult in a 10 minute slot.”
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default. Action for M.E. supports the view that 
defaulta holistic approach, encouraging patients to discuss more than one symptom and condition, in each appointment, would be helpful. We appreciate that GPs must operate within strict time constraints, so it would be helpful if patients with M.E. and other long-term conditions could be encouraged to book double appointments.

default&#xa0;
default3.14
default.
default A majority of people with M.E. (86% - see paragraph 3.6) told us they have been offered no social care services in the last year. Given the disabling physical symptoms of M.E., and the fact that 25% of patient
defaults are severely affected (house-

default 
defaultLiving with a long-term condition such as M.E. is no easy task. Some people with M.E. find themselves facing a mental health issue, such as depression or anxiety, as a result. 
defaultWe asked respondents to tell us about their
default experience of this, and 
default217
default did so.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default Many respondents spoke of the anxiety, depression and isolation that comes from living with a long-term, fluctuating condition that is still little understood. Some felt that their GP understood this reaction, while others are wary of discussing mental health issues alongside their M.E.

default&#xa0;
default4.7
default.
default 
defaultM.E. is a neurological condition, not a mental health problem. While it is encouraging to see that 43.6% (see paragraph 4.4.) reported that their mental health issue was considered separately from their M.E. by their healthcare professional, just over a third did not, while more than a fifth said they weren’t sure, indicating a lack of clarity in communication

default Some examples of effective patient contribution to better outcomes include:
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default.
default A respondent in Kent said: “The fluctuations and limitations of my illness (dysphonia/sensory sensitivity) make consultations either difficult to attend or very long (always double appointments). So about a year ago my GP provided me with his surgery email address so that I can provide him with updates and relevant research material prior to consultati
defaulton to inform my on-going care. 
defaultAs a result his knowledge of my illness and support for me has increased and my consultations with him are more constructive.”
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default.
default 
defaultListening to patients 
defaultas individuals
default, as well as through national bodies such as Healthwatch England, is
default key to better patient outcomes.
default Action for M.E. is encouraged to see that more than a third of patients have had this experience – but they are still in the minority. 
defaultA fundamental shift in attitude is required.
