[normal]1. [bold]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal] 
[normal]Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) is a fluctuating 
[normal]long-term condition 
[normal]that 
[normal]affects around 250,000 men, women and children in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]It causes symptoms affecting many body systems, more commonly the nervous and immune systems. 
[normal]Around 25% of patients are severely affected, and may be confined to bed or unable to leave the house without the use of a wheelchair. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]. Action for M.E. is the UK’s largest charity for people affected by M.E.
[normal] 
[normal]We provide information and support, campaign for better services and more effective treatments
[normal], 
[normal]and drive and invest in research.

[normal]. Our
[normal] submission 
[normal]focuses on four terms of reference from the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into the management of long-term conditions.
[normal]inquiry into the Management of long-term conditions inquiry into the Management of long-term conditions
[normal] It is 
[normal]based on responses to a 14-question survey for people with M.E. in England, devised by Action for M.E. and publicised via our Online M.E. Centre
[normal] and social media sites
[normal] from 4 to 30 April 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]. 
[normal]The survey was answered by 
[normal]252 
[normal]people with M.E. 
[normal]This was a good response given the short time frame. Results of the survey reflect what we expected and 
[normal]are 
[normal]broadly representativ

[normal]who
[normal] 
[normal]the charity is in daily contact.

[normal]2.4. 
[normal]A respondent 
[normal]in
[normal] Buckinghamshire said: “Some of my GPs are often biased by the diagnosis of M.E. when I try and discuss another issue or want to seek further advice or tests. It can also take some time to discuss a condition properly in light of other conditions I have, which can be difficult in a 10 minute slot.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]. Action for M.E. supports the view that 
[normal]a holistic approach, encouraging patients to discuss more than one symptom and condition, in each appointment, would be helpful. We appreciate that GPs must operate within strict time constraints, so it would be helpful if patients with M.E. and other long-term conditions could be encouraged to book double appointments.

[normal]. Action for M.E. was pleased to

[normal]However, 
[normal]the

[normal] found that M.E./CFS was the condition that GPs find most challenging to refer for specialist attention, and has been so for the last ten years.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]. 
[normal]We believe 
[normal]awareness and understanding for

[normal] “Bristol has a wonderful M.E. centre at Frenchay Hospital where there is multi-disciplinary care from medics, OTs, physio

[normal]s, psychologists etc. My GP (both now and where I lived before) acknowledged both that I am an expert patient when it comes to this and the superiority of the knowledge of the M.E. team, and so will go along with what they suggest.”

[normal] A respondent in Ipswich told us: 
[normal]“I have been advised by my social worker that they cannot and will not get involved with any care relating to my children and therefore any care provided for me is for me and me alone. This is particularly 
[normal]unhelpful, e
[normal]specially as I am no closer to getting a care package in place for me after making first contact with social services more than six months ago.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.14
[normal].
[normal] A majority of people with M.E. (86% - see paragraph 3.6) told us they have been offered no social care services in the last year. Given the disabling physical symptoms of M.E., and the fact that 25% of patient
[normal]s are severely affected (house- 
[normal]or bed-bound), 
[normal]we believe it is important to have a 
[normal]national approach to improving quality and developing 
[normal]social care
[normal], with specific guidance for specialist conditions such as M.E.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] [bold]This section refers to t[bold]he interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditions[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal] 
[normal]Living with a long-term condition such as M.E. is no easy task. Some people with M.E. find themselves facing a mental health issue, such as depression or anxiety, as a result. 
[normal]We asked respondents to tell us about their
[normal] experience of this, and 
[normal]217
[normal] did so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal] Many respondents spoke of the anxiety, depression and isolation that comes from living with a long-term, fluctuating condition that is still little understood. Some felt that their GP understood this reaction, while others are wary of discussing mental health issues alongside their M.E.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal] A
[normal] respondent in Greater Manchester said: “I fear saying anything because my GP and healthcare professionals have so many times tried to attribute any symptoms I have down entirely to me being depressed.

[normal].
[normal] A respondent in West Sussex said: “Sometimes I have felt that healthcare professionals consider my health issues and physical symptoms to be caused by depression or anxiety, which I find extremely frustrating as I feel my anxiety and depression are brought on by the M.E. and not the other way around.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]M.E. is a neurological condition, not a mental health problem. While it is encouraging to see that 43.6% (see paragraph 4.4.) reported that their mental health issue was considered separately from their M.E. by their healthcare professional, just over a third did not, while more than a fifth said they weren’t sure, indicating a lack of clarity in communication 
[normal]from
[normal] their healthcare professional.

[normal]must be

[normal] One respondent in Greater Manchester said: “Since moving to my current address five months ago I have found it very frustrating that my care support plan has not been adhered to. I have received mostly help with domestic tasks and no personal care. It has not addressed my individual needs and has also been too expensive for me to afford, meaning that I have had to cancel care and am now making a formal complaint.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal] 
[normal]We asked respondents if they thought that their healthcare professional valued their ideas when it
[normal] came to working out treatment. 
[normal]Of the

[normal] 
[normal]We asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and 
[normal]120 
[normal]did so.
[normal] Some examples of effective patient contribution to better outcomes include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal].
[normal] A respondent in Kent said: “The fluctuations and limitations of my illness (dysphonia/sensory sensitivity) make consultations either difficult to attend or very long (always double appointments). So about a year ago my GP provided me with his surgery email address so that I can provide him with updates and relevant research material prior to consultati
[normal]on to inform my on-going care. 
[normal]As a result his knowledge of my illness and support for me has increased and my consultations with him are more constructive.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Listening to patients 
[normal]as individuals
[normal], as well as through national bodies such as Healthwatch England, is
[normal] key to better patient outcomes.
[normal] Action for M.E. is encouraged to see that more than a third of patients have had this experience – but they are still in the minority. 
[normal]A fundamental shift in attitude is required.
