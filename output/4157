defaultny years. The BBC licences many of our members’ works, the royalties from which represent 3% of the copyright licensing royalties we paid to artists in 2012. In addition, many of our members have benefited from commissions from the BBC.

defaultThe BBC has played
default a major role in fostering the UK’s creative industries, the success of which is envied around the world. The UK produces high quality, innovative content much of it supported by the BBC. In addition, it provides a valuable route to secondary markets which
default have been a source of licensing income for artists.

defaultThe continuation of the Licence Fee is essential if the BBC is to thrive and continue to invest in the production of high quality content which in turn represents investment in the UK’s creators, not th
defaulte least of which are visual artists.
