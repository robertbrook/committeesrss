defaultNotes for the Parliamentary Inquiry into Cycle Safety
default&#xa0;
defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
default- Cycling is being treated too much as if it 
defaultwere
default some kind of a slightly dangerous job (i.e. with HSS 
defaultrsponsibility
default) and not, as it should be, a pleasant means for anyone who can ride a bike to get around. 
default&#xa0;
default- The failure to have cycling as safe as contin
defaultental Europe is largely down to poor treatment of road junctions and poor training of road users in the UK.
default&#xa0;
default- Human nature means you can only go so far with training and law enforcement, and a country like the UK this can have only incremental success. Be
defaulttter road design is required for a step change, as similarly developed nations have realised.
default&#xa0;
default- Highway authorities should take at least as much responsibility as motorists and cyclists for the safety of cyclists but they cannot do this properly under cur
defaultrent 
defaultDfT
default rules.
default&#xa0;
default- Apply actual continental best practice, not some watered down version of it, but ensure that it is applied with 
defaultconsistency and continuity. It is partly the plethora of interventions that exists at present that leads to confusion that le
defaultads to mistakes and incidents. 
default&#xa0;
default- Set up a system where the "little people" i.e. actual end-user cyclists, can record infrastructure problems. Don't just rely on the "sage" advice of a few self-appointed experts. Given the track record, there ARE no UK ex
defaultperts on cycle safety.
default&#xa0;
default------------------------------------
defaultIntroduction
default&#xa0;
defaultIn any discussion on safety we need to define the rights and duties of participants. Is it a right for a cyclist to be safe? I would say yes. Is it their sole duty to ensure that th
defaultey are 
defaultsafe.
default I would say no, though they should have some. Do the drivers of HGVs or car's have sole duty to ensure cyclists are safe - well, according to the 
defaulthighway code
default they do have some duty, but again sole duty? No. You can argue the relative proporti
defaultons as much as you like, and indeed it seems a lot of breath has 
defaultbeen
default wasted in doing so, but it's not actually a binary thing. The highway authorities and government have some duty in this respect. My thesis is that, given human nature
default,  it
default is they who ha
defaultve been failing both cyclists and drivers (and pedestrians, but that's another debate), more than the latter have been failing each other. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn one recent case of a cyclist's death the narrative verdict of the judge made reference to cyclist being lulled i
defaultnto a false sense of security by blue paint on Cycle Superhighway 2. This is exemplifies the problem. Unlike engineers, judges see much more of the variety of human behaviour and realise that there are a whole spectrum of behaviours by road users. You can'
defaultt make everyone perfect, and in a developed nation like the UK you can't expect anything but the smallest improvements by focussing on that aspect. It is the way the road is structured in both space and time 
defaultthat makes the difference. This was appreciated 
defaultdecades ago in the safest countries for cycling. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA great deal of good is done from bottom up by campaigners; more establishment organizations such as the CTC and 
defaultSustrans
default; and some local authority cabinets to ensure the highway authorities show some duty
default of care (if not statutory duty) to cyclists, but this is all bottom up intervention, and very patchy. There seems to be precious little coordinated top down steer (at least since the greatly lamented demise of Cycling England). The 
defaultDfT
default appear to have even
default refused the help of people like Chris Boardman who many thought would make a 
defaultgood  cycling
default champion. Be that as it may, and being a cynical old boot, I would have said that this was politically unsound since Boardman is very popular, and we all know he co
defaultuld easily have been sidelined in such a post if things got awkward.  As it is the 
defaultDfT
default are not looking good at the moment, in many people's eyes even less so than the Mayor of London and 
defaultTfL
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnyway, in the light of the above here are my comments on the p
defaultoints you raise.  
default&#xa0;
default1 - Whether cycling is safe, particularly in towns and cities
default&#xa0;
defaultHow safe do you need it to be?  I have seen it stated that the important thing on the roads is to maintain traffic flow and in some cases given as a reason why traffic signa
defaultl phasing or road design (i.e. protected paths) cannot be installed to benefit cyclists.  The public would appreciate definitions of what the government considers "safe". How many deaths and serious injuries will they tolerate? Then the public would have s
defaultome idea of whether they should cycle or not.  So far the government seem to be tolerating quite a lot (about 20000 reported deaths and any sort of injury in 2012, which is by my rough estimate about 1 in every 100 cyclists. 
defaultSo half the cyclists on the roa
defaultds could expect some kind of injury once in their lives.)
default  In fact, I would say even the Netherlands is not safe enough, and they have the world's best cycle safety record. The key thing is that they themselves do not think so either, and continuously moni
defaulttor cyclist problems and seek to improve safety. I see no evidence that the UK does this. Indeed the favoured modus operandi in the UK seems to be put something in, let it deteriorate to the point that the law suits start rolling in or public outrage becom
defaultes too vociferous. 
defaultand
default then do something again. 
defaultPotholes.
default  So for me the UK is not safe to cycle in. The main problem is that cyclists are too easily caught by inattention and appallingly aggressive driving from too large a proportion of motorists. But thi
defaults is human 
defaultnature  -
default Dutch motorists are no different (indeed they can be more aggressive outside their own roads)   - and I don't see how this can be changed by "soft" measures, like training and law enforcement . You have to look mainly at road design. T
defaulthis is what the Dutch realised 40+ years ago.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut why "particularly in towns and cities"?
default The facts are that it is more dangerous to cycle on rural roads. But this again is beside the point. There needs to be a national steer for consistency and continuit
defaulty of treatment across all roads regardless of location. Leaving it wholly up to individual LA's, has led to infrastructure that is so patchy and so unpleasant to use that it invites misuse, if only through frustration at the mess.
default&#xa0;
defaultFootnote: Andrew 
defaultGiligan
default frequently says that the campaigners' focus on deaths and injuries puts people off cycling. I think people have made up their own minds not to cycle based on the unpleasantness of the conditions, not the threat of injury, and very few are cognisant of wha
defaultt happens outside the campaigning micro-universe. He and others should be focussing on the unadorned principle that the deaths and injuries are simply unacceptable. 
default&#xa0;
default2 - What central and local Government could do to improve cycling 
defaultsafety.
default Ideas could inc
defaultlude better training and advice for drivers and cyclists, better enforcement of the law applying to drivers and cyclists, and better vehicle and road infrastructure.
default&#xa0;
defaultDo as I recommend above, and improve the regulations of what "engineering"" interventions
default can be made: proper cyclists traffic lights; no 
defaultunseparated
default lanes leading into junctions, remove unneeded traffic islands - use zebra and light controlled crossings instead. It's all been done before, in Europe. Use their expertise, Go on their study cour
defaultses. Train highway engineers in those practices. Reinstate Cycling England with some continental contributors. The government has said it is planning to use French expertise for nuclear power stations, so why not use the acknowledged European experts for c
defaultycling?
default&#xa0;
defaultTraining, advice, and law enforcement will only get you so far. I think the main areas of improvement should be training at school made available for all, and a mandatory module in 
defaultin
default the driving test. Sure, other areas could be improved, but wher
defaulte is the evidence that such "soft" interventions have a significant permanent effect?  My position is that it would not be enough to save many extra lives. But don't listen to me, or your own esteemed opinions - get some data, maybe the Europeans have some
default. Civil law presumed liability s a good idea, though; after all, a moving car is intrinsically dangerous. 
defaultDoing any more, however, risks removing people's freedoms to an unacceptable degree.
default People make mistakes, ignore advice and yes, some knowingly break
default the law. You can't stop it.  Go and learn what the Europeans do to mitigate this. 
defaultIn two words, road design.
default In addition, cyclists are not cycling as a profession. It's easy to pick up, can be fun, and should be accessible to all including youngsters, the
default infirm and the elderly without slight mistakes ending in death.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso many of the proposed soft interventions for cyclists (hi-
defaultvis
default springs to mind) seem like an attempt to professionalise them, when ordinary motorists and pedestrians are not treated the s
defaultame way. This is not the correct route since it excludes the young, infirm and the retired; and is fundamentally inequitable.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd UK cyclists themselves know what the problems are so ask them i.e. set up a system where issues can be reported, considered
default and acted upon. If this had been done before (
defaultTfL
default for example were repeatedly warned about Bow roundabout designs
default)  there
default wouldn't have been the tragic deaths we are getting now.
default&#xa0;
default3 - Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from o
defaultther road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis question is framed in entirely the wrong way (as are the others really). It is extremely disappointing that the same old poorly conceived paradigm 
defaultkeeps being 
defaultperpetuated decade after decade in the UK when every other country that has embarked on improving conditions for cyclists takes a different approach. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn outline it's not rocket science:
default&#xa0;
defaultYou try not to make road users with vastly different 
defaultmo
defaultmenta
default cross each other's path at the same 
defaulttime  -
default they can go side by side or in single file  to a certain extent.   Treating the crossing points correctly is the key and that is where the UK has always failed, and judging by recent developments and the wa
defaulty the briefing note to us is framed, is going to continue to fail. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the most obvious danger points - where traffic flows are dense, 
defaultfast ;
default at accident black spots; and at major junctions - yes, you segregate. Initially, this does not actually involve 
defaultmany roads, just the largest, busiest ones. Unless you accept this and do it, over and above what seems at present to be the sine qua non of maximising motor traffic throughput, the deaths and injuries will continue.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn quieter urban roads you have ubiqui
defaulttous 20 mph, on rural roads the speed limit depends on road width as well as sight-lines.  Give cyclists lanes if the road is wide, otherwise narrow the road to an extent that cars cannot overtake if a cyclist is there, without the cyclist allowing it.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt
default a more advanced stage, if you have the room for a protected bike lane, put it in.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith this, and a splash of presumed liability, most of the problems will evaporate, and you'll get more people cycling. 
defaultwith
default all the benefits that brings.
default&#xa0;
defaultHere's a typical
default UK solution for cyclists approaching a roundabout (
defaultGooge
default 
defaultStreetview
default reference) Use your mouse to rotate it a bit if necessary.

defaultFootnote: Roger Geffen often says that you 
defaultcant
default simply copy Dutch infrastructure and expect it to work. Why not? Has it been tried?  I'm not sure it has, particularly the 
defaultpriortisation
default of pedestrians and cyclists at junctions. This sounds like a
defaultn unsupported assertion to me. Why not German, Danish or French as above? If there had been full Dutch-style intervention at Bow roundabout, I would assert that none of the deaths would have occurred. 
default------------
defaultOn HGV prohibition - 
defaultthe real reason you 
defaultban HGVs at peak times is to make life pleasanter for everyone else. The 
defaultpedestrianised
default area of Kingston upon Thames is a good example. 
defaultOn the risk to cyclists issue 
default-  there
default is one cycling HGV driver who regularly posts on cycling forums and he says visib
defaultility is not really an issue (unless like one recent high profile case the driver's eyesight is defective), attention is. What is disgraceful in the London deaths is that these trucks are being driven by people who must be seeing hundreds of cyclists a day
default and should be used to their behaviour, yet they are still are either not paying enough attention or trying to bully their way through. They are the 
defaultprofessionals,
default cyclists (and pedestrians and ordinary motorists) are the amateurs. The haulage associations
default and police should be sorting this out. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI think if you asked an HGV driver (and possibly most motorists), would they like cyclists to be kept away from them (by segregation and traffic light phasing), they would be in favour. But go ahead - ask them this
default question. The FTA recently decried any suggestion of a ban, but failed to come up with any alternatives.
