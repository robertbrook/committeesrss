defaultSUMMARYdefault&#xa0;defaultIn this response:
default w
defaulte 
defaultconsider the evidence that has been provided by the Government. We 
defaultinvite the Committee to ask the Government for such evidence as it holds on the likely effect of the proposals
default, 
defaultthe data that has been collected from legal aid funding applications
default, the dat
defaulta on 
defaultjudicial reviews that settle pre and post permission
default, the outcomes of judicial reviews and the e
defaultxtent to which the Government conc
defaultedes allegedly unmeritorious cases and in what circumstances
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe set out how the Immigration Bill foregrounds and 
defaultincreases reliance on judicial review and on human rights
default and the limitations of this approach, taken alone and in conjunction with the cuts to legal aid. 
defaultHuman rights set important limits to the powers of the State, but cannot bear the full weight of the 
defaultconstitutional settlement. 
defaultWe highlight the implications of attacks on judges and lawyers for the 
defaultrule of law.  
defaultNo Government 
defaultdepartment gains greater protection from challenge under the proposals to “transform” legal aid than the former UK Border Agency
default a
defaultnd these 
defaultproposals would further insulate the former Agency from challenge.  We discuss the Bill, ranging more widely than the appeals provisions over other areas where the only challenge will be by judicial review. We draw attention to drafting
default that c
defaultould
default preclude the bringing of human rights appeals out of country and ask the Committee to enquire 
defaultwhen 
defaultthe Bill will be amended.
default  
defaultWe ask the Committee to clarify whether eligibility for legal aid will lapse when a person leaves the UK
default because they are remove,
default as proposed in the Bill, 
defaultbefore their appe
defaultal has finally been determined.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe go on to discuss standing and third party interventions providing examples from the field of immigration including the Joint Committee’s own work on what became the 
defaultHSMP Forum
default 
defaultcase. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe consider costs of judicial review being “at risk” in cases funded by legal aid and invite the 
defaultC
defaultommittee to revisit 
defaultLord Justice Jackson’s proposals that qualified one-way costs shifting be introduced in judicial review cases and that 
defaultnon-governm
defaultental organisations bringing challenges in the public interest be eligible for 
defaultq
defaultualified one-way costs shifting.  We discuss the former UK Border Agency’s conduct as a litigant and how this affects costs.  We touch on wasted costs.  We address protective c
defaultosts orders and suggest that the Committee a
defaultsk for information about the costs incurred by claimants and defendants in Aarhus 
defaultCovention
default cases
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe review the question of procedural as opposed to substantive defects in decisions with reference to asylum ca
defaultses and invite the Committee 
default to
default ask the Government to explain what is proposed to be included within ‘procedural defects’.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe examine the question of the public sector equality duty.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally we address proposals for leapfrogging, with reference to the 
defaultSpecial Immigration Appeals Commission and the Committee’s work on it.

defaultINTRODUCTIONdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe Evidence Basedefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, there is little or no consideration of the fact that significant numbers of judicial review claims settle pre-and post-permission, 
defaultsuggesting that far from being unmeritorious, or deliberate “delaying” tactics, the claims were properly and responsibly brought and conducted, and that the parties managed to achieve a 
defaultresolution of the claim without using further court time and resources
default. Comprehensive statistics, identifying this class of case discretely, should be collated and provided.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default…wants to be sure that there are not also cases where the respondent concedes simply because they are unwilling to face the delays and costs that prolonged legal 
defaultbattle can involve.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultWe are aware that there has still been no systematic re
defaultview by the Government of the exercise by the Upper Tribunal of its judicial review jurisdiction generally, and there is therefore no evidence before Parliament of how the Upper Tribunal is performing that significant judicial role. We urge the Government 
defaultto consider amending the Bill to insert additional safeguards ensuring that immigration and nationality cases in which human rights 
defaultsuch as life, liberty or freedom from torture are at stake continue to be decided by high court judges.

defaultHE.18 Substantial force had been used in one case to take a pregnant woman resisting removal to depa
defaultrtures. The woman was not moved using approved techniques. She was placed in a wheelchair to assist her to the departures area.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen she resisted, it was tipped-up with staff holding her feet. At one point she slipped down from the chair and the risk of i
defaultnjury to the unborn child was
default 
defaultsignificant. There is no safe way to use force against a pregnant woman, and to initiate it for the purpose of removal is to take an unacceptable risk.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Border Agency would prefer that pregnant women, vulnerable adults and under 18s who 
defaultform part of family groups in Cedars left the UK voluntarily and compliantly. It would not be 
defaultpractical to consider a blanket 
defaultban on the use of physical intervention on pregnant women and under 18s as this might encourage non-compliance and render the Agency unable to maintain effective immigration controls.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are concerned that the policy position set out in that response [
defaultthe government’s response, described above
default] directly contradicts the assurances which have bee
defaultn given to the Court and the parties in this action, which is now reflected in policy guidance published on the UK Border Agency’s website, and upon which the Claimants have been invited by the Home Secretary to withdraw their claim for judicial review

defaultsuspensive
default appeals was "capable of leading to unfairness and injustice". The Council highlighted some of the "considerable practical pr
defaultoblems" that may result: 
default&#xa0;
default"The requirement to conduct appeals from abroad will make it more difficult for adjudicators to assess the evidence of appellants. It will also make it more difficult for appellants to have face-to-face discussions with their advisers and to present their 
defaultcases satisfactorily. Costs will inevitably be greater. And there could be serious problems with regard to the status and safety of tribunal users in the countries 
defaultform
default which they are appealing."[70] 
default[…]
default79. Mr Justice Richards has also described non-
defaultsusp
defaultensive
default (out-of-country) appeals as "plainly a very serious disadvantage as compared with an in-country appeal."[71] As many asylum appeals turn on questions of credibility, it is particularly disadvantageous for the applicant to be absent from the oral hea
defaultring. …

default"As of 17 April 2003, provisional IAA figures show that 56 out-of-country appeals had been lodged with the IAA. 42 of those have so far been dismissed and one withdrawn. None ha

default&#xa0;

defaultThe question is whether the Secretary of State was entitled to conclude that "there is in general [in Jamaica] no serious risk of persecution of person

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter listening to the evidence of the Special Advocates, we found it hard not to reach for well-w
defaultorn descriptions of it as 'Kafkaesque' or like the Star Chamber. The Special Advocates agreed when it was put to them that, in the light of the concerns they had raised, 'the public should be left in absolutely no doubt that what is happening…has absolutel
defaulty nothing to do with the traditions of adversarial justice as we have come to understand them in the British legal system.' Indeed, we were left with the very strong feeling that this is a process which is not just offensive to the basic principles of adve
defaultrsarial justice in which lawyers are steeped, but it is very much against the basic notions of fair play as the lay public would understand them
default.
default&#xa0;
default“It is one of the Special Advocates’ most important functions to ensure that as many as possible of the documents relied upon by the Home Secretary are disclosed to the appellant, whether in whole or in part or in gist form.”
default&#xa0;
default“We do not consider that the existence of one case in which the detainee’s appeal was allowed demonstrates, as a general proposi
defaulttion, that the use of Special Advocates makes it “possible... to ensure that those detained can achieve justice”. Nor should it be thought that, by continuing in our positions as Special Advocates, we are impliedly warranting the fairness of the SIAC appea
defaultl process. We continue to discharge our functions as Special Advocates because we believe that there are occasions on which we can advance the interests of the appellants by doing so. Whether we can “ensure that those detained achieve justice” is another m
defaultatter. The contribution which Special Advocates can make is, in our view, limited by a number of factors – some inherent to the role and others features of the current procedural regime.”
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the special advocate thinks there is an error of law in the closed judgment, he gets permission to say, to pass the message out to the other team to say ’ I t
defaulthink that you should be appealing, I can’t tell you why’. … So there is a sort of open appeal. ‘We think there is something wrong but we don’t know what it is.’ And then the court goes into closed session, so it is antithetical to every [institute] of due 
defaultprocess and open justice.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt might have been benign at the outset to use a specially cleared advocate…to be able to have access to closed material – it has been acknowledged by Strasbourg that there are legitimate security concerns. However, what
default is in place now is not what was envisaged then. At least then, in article 3 [of the European Convention on Human Rights] cases concerning a national security issue against the individual, if argument was about risk on return then that would be able to be 
defaultplayed out in open court with an advocate quite properly representing their client. Since then much has changed. The reality now is that the Government’s changes are taking the real argument into a closed arena. There is no basis for or justification whats
defaultoever for arguing about risk on return on the basis of diplomatic assurances made in closed session.

default&#xa0;default20. In an article 8 case ... the ultimate question for the appellate immigration authority is whether the refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where the life of the family cannot reasonab
defaultly be expected to be 
defaultenjoyed elsewhere, taking full account of all considerations weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental right protected by ar
defaultticle 8. If the answer to this question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the authority must so decide. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe search for a hard-edged or bright-line rule to be 
defaultapplied to the generality of cases is incompatible with the difficult evaluative exercise which article 8 requires.

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultSTANDING AND THIRD PARTY INTERVENTIONSdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic law is not at base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs – that is to say misuses of public power; and the courts have always been alive to 
defaultthe fact that a person or organisation with no particular stake in the issues or outcome may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the court to an apparent misuse of public power. If an arguable case o
defaultf such misuse can be made out on an application for leave, the court’s only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive.
default&#xa0;
default…it would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group
default…
default or even a single public-spirited tax payer, were prevented by outdated technical rules of locus 
defaultstandi
default from bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the rule of law and to get the unlawful conduct stopped.

default...I can think of at least two cases in which interveners who had made written submissions in fact turned up at the hearing. In one case they filed helpful additional written 
defaultsubmissions as a result of listening to the debate: this was the Coram Children’s Legal Centre in H(H) v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa [2012] UKSC 25, [2013] 1 AC 338 (the case about the interests of children whose parents face extraditi
defaulton). In another they made brief additional oral submissions: this was only last week in

default“[T]he proposal would deny payment in a case with real merit but that just failed to get permission. … The proposal carries the danger 
defaultthat it will act as a barrier to access to justice as lawyers and other advice providers will err on the side of caution where the appeal is ambitious but not one with little or no merit – perhaps only bringing cases with a predicted 70/30 or more prospect
default of success, when the proposal intends to remove funding only where the case fails at 51/49 or less.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default…defaultespecially in t
defaulthe early stages, the defendant is likely to have more information to enable it to assess the merits of a claim. Indeed, most of us have had experience of being instructed to defend government decisions despite advising that the prospects of doing so are co
defaultnsiderably below 50%. Sometimes we will have been proven wrong. No one has ever suggested that, in such cases, government bodies should be barred from defending a claim for judicial review. To take such an approach would quickly make the work of government
default impossible. Government lawyers do not undertake their work on the basis that they will only be paid if they have accurately predicted the outcome of the litigation. To require this of those acting on legal aid is, in effect, to severely cut their rates.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince the majority of successful claims are conceded pre-permission, to use permission as the test for whether payment is made may well reduce real rates even further. We are also concerned that the proposal will be 
defaultcounter-productive; there will be many m
defaultore disputes about pre-permission costs, which will require substantial public money to resolve.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe superficially attractive reason is that it will inhibit the making of long-shot or speculative claims at 
defaultpublic expense, but it is supported by no evidence, and the argument advanced in support of it – that the claimant’s lawyer ‘is in the best position to know the strength of their client’s case’ – displays a depressing degree of ignorance about how judicial
default review works. More often than not, it is the defendant authority which holds most of the relevant cards, and in many cases it holds on to them for longer than it is supposed to, either because there is too little time for proper disclosure of documents or
default because sitting tight affords the best hope that the claim will go away. The departmental calculation is that indigent claimants’ lawyers will be deterred from taking on all but
default 
defaultsure-fire claims. In proposing that other claimants can be left to their own 
defaultdevices without injustice, the paper makes no attempt to confront the consequences: a plethora of claims
default 
defaultmade by litigants
default in 
defaultperson, clogging up the courts as judges try to discern arguable points in the chaos of paper, and costing public authorities larg
defaulte sums in irrecoverable costs as they attempt to respond to such claims.
default 
default&#xa0;
default[I]t is vital for the Ministry to appreciate that any changes which are made to reduce legal aid and cut the cost of litigation are likely to have a kno
defaultck-on effect on the cost of the courts. Less legal aid means more unrepresented litigants and worse lawyers, which will lead to longer hearings and more judge-time.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe requirement that a claim can only be funded where it meets a merits test already imposes a significant discipline on clai
defaultmant lawyers which is not, at least in any formal sense, imposed on defendants to judicial review. The figures quoted at paragraphs 3.65-8 of the Consultation Paper do not suggest that legal aid is being granted in significant numbers of unmeritorious case
defaults, and that is not our experience as Treasury Counsel defending such claims. ….
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“I agree with my noble friend that no area is more complex than the whole business of the Immigration Rules and the procedures surrounding them.”
default&#xa0;
defaultOnce again, I was concerned to find that the Agency had a backlog of cases amounting to 14,000 requests from applicants to re-consider decisions to refuse them further leave to remain. This had been growing by approxi
defaultmately 700 cases a month. In addition, there were a further 2,100 cases where people were awaiting an initial decision on their application for further leave to remain. Some dated back nearly a decade. This is completely unacceptable…
default&#xa0;
default5.50 … the Agency had, as part of its reasoning, stated that the applicant could return to their country and apply for entry clearance and therefore any interference would be proporti
defaultonate. … Given the House of Lords’ judgment, which envisaged that it would be relatively rare for such a requirement to be proportionate, we were concerned to find that the Agency had felt it appropriate to adopt this approach in 20% of the relevant cases 
defaultin our sample, particularly as two of these cases involved a child.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.12 Data provided by the Agency showed 
defaultthat between April 2011 and March 2012, the majority of people whose application had been refused appealed against this decision. According to data from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service, over 50% of applicants who appealed against the refusal of 
defaulttheir application were successful…
default&#xa0;
default8.13. … The Agency needs to improve the quality of its initial decision-making, to avoid the cost of unnecessary legal challenges and to reduce the proportion of allowed appeals where its refusal
default 
defaultdecisions are challenged
default. Better initial decisions would also remove the uncertainty and associated stress placed on applicants and their families while an ultimately successful legal challenge is on-going.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default…
defaultthe consultation paper has nothing to say about public authorities which play the judicial review system at public expense. Most defendant authorities whose lawyers tell them they are in trouble wil
defaultl settle a claim; but others, given the same advice, will take a chance on opposing the grant of permission to proceed, in the hope that a judge will take their side. It would be straightforward to propose that a public body which unjustifiably resists the
default grant of permission in a viable case should pay the costs of doing so; but the consultation paper has nothing to say about this, or about penalising late disclosure, or about other ways of saving public funds.

defaultThe regulatory bodies and inspectors also felt that some sectors cut corners as they were unlikely to be challenged. While fear of Judicial Review was thought to encourage compliance (or displays of compliance) in 
defaultsome 
defaultareas, this was not thought to be the case in most sectors, as Judicial Reviews are rarely brought. It was thought this was possibly down to a lack of knowledge among citizens of the legal options available to them.
default&#xa0;
defaultLawyers had found that threat
default of litigation alone could have a powerful effect in ensuring equality issues were effectively addressed by decision makers, negating the need for legal action.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultLEAPFROGGING default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCONCLUSIONdefault&#xa0;
default4.16 …These proceedings… represent a crucial way of ensuring that state power is exercise
defaultd responsibly.
default&#xa0;
default4.97 In our view, proceedings where the litigant seeks to hold the state to account by judicial review are important, because they are the means by which citizens can seek to ensure that state power is exercised responsibly. In addition, th
defaulte issues at stake themselves in public law challenges can be of very high importance where they are used to address serious concerns about the decisions of public authorities. For example, a decision by a public authority to detain someone without sufficie
defaultnt reason would be a very important issue as the case concerns the litigant’s liberty. …
default&#xa0;
default4.98 In general, we do not consider that the class of individuals bringing these proceedings is likely to be particularly vulnerable, although they may be where the j
defaultudicial review concerns mental health or community care. However, where alternative forms of dispute resolution, such as complaints procedures or referral to an ombudsman, have not succeeded we do not consider that there are further appropriate alternative
default forms of advice or assistance to justify the withdrawal of legal aid. 
default4.99 We therefore consider that legal aid for most public law challenges is justified on the basis that they enable individual citizens to check the exercise of executive power by appe
defaultal to the judiciary, often on issues of the highest importance, and we propose that it be retained….
