[normal]Karl Lunt – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Green Lanes and their destruction by recreational vehicles (4WD and trail bikes).[bold]I wish to propose to the committee that all unsealed (ie not surfaced with tarmac) Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network (ie those surfaced with tarmac). They should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
[normal]Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs).[bold]I wish to propose that when a local authority declines to impose a TRO that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or a magistrate.
[normal]I have personally seen the severe damage and nuisance caused on numerous occasions spaced over decades by thoughtless and selfish recreational motorised traffic on green lanes. I wholeheartedly support the formal submissions made by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group, Green Lanes Protection Group, the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (of which I am a long-term member).
