[normal]W[bold]ritten evidence [bold]submitted by [bold]Camden Council[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal] 
[normal]The London Borough of Camden 
[normal]includes
[normal] 
[normal]some of the wealthiest and 
[normal]the 
[normal]most deprived neighbourhoods in London. Housing costs are extremely high and it has one of London’s largest social housing stocks with 
[normal]a third
[normal] of the population living in social rented accommodation. 
[normal]A
[normal]nother third of households
[normal] live in the private rented s
[normal]ector
[normal], the sixth highest proportion in England and Wales. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal] 
[normal]28,000 or 30% of all households in the borough claim 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit. The Council estimates that 
[normal]around 5,400
[normal] of these have been affected by 
[normal]one or more of the three 
[normal]major 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit 
[normal]changes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]According to analysis by Sheffield Hallam University, Camden is by no means the most affected borough in London (ranking 15
[normal]th
[normal] of 33 and 112
[normal]th
[normal] of 384 nationally for overall loss of benefit per working age adult). However 
[normal]high housing costs and high demand 
[normal]for social housing make the impacts more severe in Camden. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Labour-controlled council
[normal] has made preserving the social mix a priority for the Council. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal] 
[normal]An important indicator 
[normal]of success or failure
[normal] for a local authority
[normal] in dealing with the 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit changes is the 
[normal]number of
[normal] 
[normal]households who are 
[normal]statutory 
[normal]homeless or in 
[normal]temporary accommodation (TA)
[normal]. 
[normal]B
[normal]oth have remained at low 
[normal]levels
[normal] so far
[normal] contrary to London and national trends
[normal]. 
[normal]J
[normal]ust 
[normal]11
[normal] households a month
[normal] on average
[normal] 
[normal]have been 
[normal]accepted as statutorily homeless (Part VII) since May 2012 and 
[normal]TA
[normal] numbers are still on a long term downward trajectory. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal] 
[normal]Camden has 
[normal]been helped in its re
[normal]sponse to welfare 
[normal]changes
[normal] by its 
[normal]long term investment in homelessness prevention services[bold], a response to the 
[normal]long standing
[normal] housing issues in the borough. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Council has
[normal] an excellent track record in 
[normal]placing
[normal] households at risk of homele
[normal]ssness in sustainable
[normal] tenancies
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] service has supported
[normal] nearly 500 households
[normal] affected by the LHA cap
[normal]; 30% of them were helped to stay in their homes and 32% were helped to make a successful 
[normal]bid for a council property
[normal] 
[normal]in the borough 
[normal]or move to other private rented sector ac
[normal]commodation. Only 11 
[normal]of these 
[normal]households ended up making a Part VII homelessness application.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal] 
[normal]The Council
[normal] has also been proactive in supporting households affected by the 
[normal]Social Sector Size Criteria
[normal] (SSSC)
[normal] primarily by 
[normal]encourag
[normal]ing
[normal] moves to right-size acc
[normal]ommodation and to provide advice and support, including 
[normal]DHPs
[normal] where 
[normal]needed
[normal]. 
[normal]Since January 2013, housing officers have advised over 1,000 council tenants. 
[normal]Support for under-occupying households includes a scheme called “First Choice Plus” through which council voids are decorated to a higher standard than usual and reserved for under-occupiers, cash incentives, handholding and proactive help with moving, and
[normal] advice and assistance to help under-occupiers maximise their chances of achieving a move through various social tenant mobility schemes, including HousingMoves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal] 
[normal]Another success factor for the borough has been 
[normal]close collaboration between council departmen[bold]ts and with local partners[bold]. The best solution for families who may be affected by total benefit cap 
[normal](TBC) 
[normal]is finding work over 
[normal]16 hours thus exempting them from the cap. This 
[normal]requires close work with the family, Job Centre Plus and other local agencies. Ho
[normal]using officers are referring people to Job Centre Plus, advice agencies or children’s centres for employment support. 
[normal]As of 
[normal]September
[normal] 2013, 
[normal]Job Centre Plus had supported 15
[normal]0 people who would have been affected by the cap into employment.
[normal] When the Council r
[normal]ecently let new advice contracts, it completely changed the relationship 
[normal]with
[normal] local advice agencies by setting up the Camden Advice Partnership to foster a more equal and collaborative relationship. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal] 
[normal]However finding work is not viable for all affected hou
[normal]seholds. Many face multiple barriers to employment. In these cases, t
[normal]he Council has 
[normal]been making
[normal] 
[normal]flexible 
[normal]use of Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) – in one case, the family moved out of London but a DHP was used to pay for the daughter’s rail season tic
[normal]ket to allow her to remain at school in Camden and sit her exams. 
[normal]The purpose of DHPs is to buy households time to find a long-term s
[normal]olution to their housing needs
[normal]. To do this effectively, the Benefits service (which authorise the payment) and housing offi
[normal]cers (who provide advice and support) 
[normal]must work
[normal] closely together. 
[normal]In this respect, Camden has benefitted from retaining its housing stock in-house – working relationships with housing associations have been less close and anecdotal evidence from elsewhere 
[normal]suggests that boroughs with ALMOs have struggled to respond effectively to the challenges of welfare reform. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Camden Council believes that its response to 
[normal]welfare 
[normal]changes have 
[normal]once again 
[normal]demonstrated 
[normal]the effectiveness of local gov
[normal]ernment and its local 
[normal]partner
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]against a back drop of major pressures on budgets. While the government have of course provided additional funding to support councils, this is in a wider context of large scale cuts to their budgets. 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal knowledge, partnerships and relations
[normal]hip
[normal]s with residents of local authorities
[normal] have been a major factor in this effectiveness
[normal]. 
[normal]This is why 
[normal]Camden along with other local authorities 
[normal]has deep concerns about the end of its role in the administration of 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit and the ability of the DWP to d
[normal]eliver Universal Credit effectively. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal] 
[normal]As noted above, o
[normal]ne of the major impacts of the changes for local authorities is 
[normal]on homelessness and [bold]TA[bold]. If
[normal],
[normal] as a result of 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit changes, a household 
[normal]becomes homeless, the council’s statutory duties have resource implications especially if they are placed in 
[normal]TA
[normal]. 
[normal]The introduction of the 
[normal]TBC
[normal] will make it harder to procure 
[normal]TA
[normal] at 
[normal]an affordable rate
[normal] and in some cases, the council 
[normal]has leased properties for several years that will no longer be fu
[normal]lly covered by Housing Benefit for which t
[normal]he Council will need to make up the shortfall. The Council has been working with 
[normal]TA
[normal] households at risk of the cap to place them in more 
[normal]affordable
[normal] ac
[normal]commodation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal] 
[normal] As well as the impact on households currently in 
[normal]TA
[normal], there is a significant risk that 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit changes will increase demand for 
[normal]TA
[normal] over the medium term. 
[normal]T
[normal]his did 
[normal]not happen with the LHA changes, 
[normal]largely due to 
[normal]the new Localism Act pow
[normal]er
[normal], 
[normal]the inherent great
[normal]er
[normal] mobility of
[normal] private rented sector tenants and not least the council’s interventions. These interventions cost 
[normal]the council money both through additional placements in the private rented sector and the fact that some LHA households m
[normal]oved to the social rented sector thus taking that housing away from other needs groups. However 
[normal]there are reasons to think that the SSSC and TBC will result in increased homelessness and demand for 
[normal]TA
[normal]. 
[normal]Already a majority of our tenants affected by the SSSC
[normal] are in arrears and some will eventually become at risk of eviction. This will result in additional costs to the council regardless of whether they become homeless or are prevented from becoming homeless by council intervention
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal] 
[normal]The new power to discharge
[normal] their homelessness responsibilities by placing households in the private rented sector has helped local authorities in this area. In addition, the DWP have greatly increased funding for Discretionary Housing Payments – Camden received £1.6m in 2012/13. We
[normal] are using DHPs to prevent homelessness in the short term. For example, we are giving DHPs to all households affected by the TBC to 
[normal]give
[normal] them 
[normal]time to 
[normal]adjust to their reduced benefit. 
[normal]However
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]e do not know from year to year what our DHP allocation will be and our concern is that the full effects of housing benefit changes will be felt in future years when there may not be sufficient DHP funding to cope.  
[normal]We are anticipating that DHP claims will
[normal] increase significantly from now on as the combined effects of welfare changes, especially the Benefit Cap, impact on claimants alongside increasing cost of living pre
[normal]ssures from fuel and food bills
[normal]. We are doing all we can to alert households to the conse
[normal]quences of burying their heads in the sand but we cannot oblige them to take action. In addition, DHPs can only be used to top up 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit payments, they do not cover the costs of these interventions which the council has had to fund itself (see bel
[normal]ow). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal] 
[normal]Although we cannot quantify it at this stage, 
[normal]homelessness, 
[normal]TA
[normal] and prevention activities are
[normal] a clear example
[normal] of how 
[normal]reducing the welfare spend could result in increased costs for 
[normal]local authorities. This ‘cost shunting’
[normal] 
[normal]is creating
[normal] pressures on local
[normal] authority budgets not least because funding from central government continues to be reduced. It will result in further difficult 
[normal]budget 
[normal]decisions for councils and 
[normal]thus 
[normal]to ‘blame shunting’ from government to local authorities
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal] 
[normal]A further concern and pressur
[normal]e on DHPs and Council funds is the DWP’s decision not to exempt Local 
[normal]Authority-
[normal]owned 
[normal]supported accommodation[bold] from the Benefit Cap in Metropolitan and Unitary authorities. The support given to these vulnerable claimants through support
[normal]ed
[normal] accommodation is v
[normal]ital and we cannot understand 
[normal]the DWP’s rationale for
[normal] exempt
[normal]ing
[normal] such people in District Authorit
[normal]ies
[normal] but not in a London Borough such as Camden.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.
[normal] 
[normal]Welfare 
[normal]changes have 
[normal]resulted in additional 
[normal]short-term 
[normal]demands on council [bold]services[bold] for example visiting affec
[normal]ted households and working with RSLs to identify households affected by the SSSC
[normal]. 
[normal]In 2013/14 the Council expects that over £800,000 of existing resource will be diverted to work related to responding to the welfare changes, including staff in housing and b
[normal]enefit teams offering 
[normal]support and advice to residents
[normal].
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7.
[normal] 
[normal]In the longer term, the introduction of UC will mean councils will no longer be responsible for administering 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit. In theory this should be cost-neutral to the council. However in the interim period this makes it difficult for the 
[normal]C
[normal]ouncil to retain or recruit benefits officers. This 
[normal]issue is compounded by the uncertainty regarding the timetable for rolling out 
[normal]UC – it is difficult for the council to allocate resources in this context. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.
[normal] 
[normal]Breaking the link between councils and 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit has other unintended consequences. 
[normal]Housing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit is a gateway benefit for other benefits such 
[normal]as free school meals and Bl
[normal]ue Badges
[normal] which will continue to be administered by local authorities
[normal]. This 
[normal]will
[normal] 
[normal]require real-time
[normal] accurate 
[normal]information 
[normal]flows from the DWP to the local authority. We are concerned that the DWP 
[normal]has 
[normal]not given sufficient consideration to these future data nee
[normal]ds for local authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9.
[normal] 
[normal]There are impacts on other council services resulting from households moving because of welfare changes. We know that over 1,000 children resident in Camden and attending Camden schools are affected by housing benefit changes (n
[normal]ote that many children attending Camden schools live outside the borough and vice versa)
[normal]. If these children have to move schools, this not only potentially disrupts their schooling but also creates transactional costs for the school and the local authority
[normal]. We are planning to produce an estimate of how many children have moved schools as a result of the LHA changes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In theory, the 
[normal]SSSC[bold] 
[normal]could provide an additional impetus for 
[normal]council’s
[normal] tenants to downsize, thus making better use of the council’s limited housing stock, reducing overcrowding etc. This is a particular issue in Camden as we have a large stock of 1 bed properties 
[normal]and fewer larger properties. 
[normal]28% of affected tenants have regi
[normal]stered to downsize and 
[normal]46 households affected by the SSSC have moved since 1 April
[normal]. However 
[normal]evidence suggests 
[normal]many affected tenants are not prepared to move and those that are are not bidding on available smaller properties
[normal]. This could be because these sma
[normal]ller properties are unsuitable or not attractive.  
[normal]There are additional transactional costs associated with an increase in moves within the council’s housing stock, most notably in properties which have received adaptations for disabled residents. In these
[normal] cases, we are currently meeting shortfalls with DHPs but this is not sustainable in the long term. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]N
[normal]early three quarters of SSSC-affected households said they will manage the shortfall in their 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit
[normal] 
[normal]when contacted by council officers
[normal]. 
[normal]The cou
[normal]ncil is concerned that some of these households, along with those who have registered to downsize but have not 
[normal]moved
[normal], are storing up trouble for the future rather than genuinely managing 
[normal]their finances
[normal]. This concern is borne out by arrears data - the percentage of 
[normal]SSSC-affected households
[normal] in arrears has increased from 42% in April to 54% in August and is far higher than the rate for all tenants (40%). While this rate includes all households in arrears, 
[normal]no matter how small the amount
[normal] or when the debt was accrued
[normal], the average amount owed by SSSC-affected households is 
[normal]£557.42
[normal], far higher than for all tenants. 
[normal]The council faces a difficult choice if and when arrears 
[normal]reach
[normal] a critical point for these househol
[normal]ds – eviction (which may result in further costs to the council in homelessness and TA) or somehow handling the arrears (e.g. by writing them off). We are not yet at this point, but again we are concerned that 
[normal]the government is robbing Peter to pay Paul – 
[normal]saving money from the benefits budget at the expense of local authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If this is true of 
[normal]the 
[normal]SSSC, it is all the more so of 
[normal]Universal Credit[bold]. 
[normal]Over the years, a shortage of social rented properties in Camden and across London has had the effect of a 
[normal]general increase in the vulnerability of council tenants (for example, lone parents make up 10% of all households 
[normal]in the borough compared with 23% 
[normal]in council rented properties). Council tenants on 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit are unused to budgeting for their housing c
[normal]osts which is likely to result in increased arrears. We are also concerned that 
[normal]the 
[normal]digital by default 
[normal]policy 
[normal]is misguided given the vulnerability of many 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit claimants and this has been borne out by the findings of the UC pilots concerning dig
[normal]ital exclusion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The replacement of Council Tax Benefit 
[normal](CTB) 
[normal]with a localised 
[normal]Council Tax Reduction [bold](CTR)[bold] 
[normal]Scheme[bold] posed a dilemma for the Council. 
[normal]If we had adopted a scheme that offered the same level of support by 
[normal]absorb
[normal]ing
[normal] the 10% reduction in funding f
[normal]rom central government, we would have created a permanent funding pressure 
[normal]of around £2.5m a year. 
[normal]We accepted the 
[normal]one year transition
[normal]al 
[normal] grant 
[normal]which allowed us to limit the minimum amount people had to pay to 
[normal]8.5% of their council tax liability (between £
[normal]1 and £4 a week).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are 
[normal]consulting on
[normal] 
[normal]the scheme for 2014/15 
[normal]– our preferred option is
[normal] to retain
[normal] this year’s scheme but with
[normal] 
[normal]an amendment to 
[normal]increase the earnings disregard by £10 a week to improve incentives to work. 
[normal]This will add to the
[normal] ongoing 
[normal]funding pressure but we feel it is the right thing to do. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We feel the CTR is a particularly blatant example of ‘blame shunting’ to local government. We understand that all parts of government need to make savings and local government does have a strong t
[normal]rack record in this area. We have been faced with a difficult choice between increased costs and creating additional financial burdens for low income households which may end up being self-defeating if they are not able to pay. We have chosen a middle way 
[normal]but this has still resulted in a budget pressure for the council. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal] 
[normal]The changes to the 
[normal]LHA[bold] 
[normal]are
[normal] the only 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing
[normal] 
[normal]B
[normal]enefit 
[normal]change 
[normal]for which we have information about longer ter
[normal]m impacts. However the council has limited information because we only know who claims and has stopped claiming in the borough.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal] 
[normal]There is no doubt that there have been changes since the LHA changes were introduced in April 2011. Of the 1,800 households whi
[normal]ch were capped in April 2011, only 44% were still claiming LHA in Camden in June 2013. 15% had secured a council or RSL tenancy in Camden and 40% had stopped claiming LHA in Camden – they may have moved, found employment etc. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he overall stock of LHA cl
[normal]aimants has decreased by just 2%
[normal] so while s
[normal]ome 
[normal]have left the borough, 
[normal]there are more taking their place
[normal]. However the geographical distribution of LHA claimants in Camden has changed
[normal] with increases in cheaper areas and decreases in Central London
[normal]. The profi
[normal]le of LHA claimants appears to have changed as well - the trend seems to be towards smaller households with fewer children. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal] 
[normal]This evidence 
[normal]appears to support
[normal] the commonly held thesis that the impact of welfare 
[normal]changes 
[normal]in London is 
[normal]for 
[normal]people
[normal] to move
[normal] out o
[normal]f Central and Inner London to Outer London and beyond. However we cannot say 
[normal]for sure 
[normal]how much of this change in down to the LHA changes and how 
[normal]much would have happened anyway
[normal],
[normal] especially given
[normal] LHA claimants are generally more mobile than other HB claiman
[normal]ts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal] 
[normal]There are also a large number of households (44% of the original capped cohort) who are still in the borough. Anecdotal evidence from the 
[normal]households supported by the 
[normal]council’s housing department is that 
[normal]they
[normal] would rather struggle with rent and/or become overcrowded than leave the
[normal]ir
[normal] community 
[normal]and the 
[normal]networks 
[normal]they have built up. The impacts of these coping mechanisms will only be felt over the longer term. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6.
[normal] 
[normal]We are finding it increasingly difficult to place vulnerable households at risk of homelessness in the private rented sector in the borough. Before April 2011, 62% of placements in the private rented sector were in the borough - this has fallen to 35% sinc
[normal]e April 2011. Moving outside the borough 
[normal]can cause
[normal] disruption to children’s schooling, social networks etc and risks increasing a household’s vulnerability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7.
[normal] 
[normal]We are concerned about the long term impact of the LHA changes on the social mix of the borough. M
[normal]arket rents in the private rented sector are steadily increasing while LHA rates in Camden are capped or kept at a very low rate of increase. If this continues for several years, even the relatively affordable area around Kilburn High Road will become unaf
[normal]fordable for LHA claimants. 
[normal]Although o
[normal]ne of the stated aims of the LHA changes is “h
[normal]ousing 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit should not support people who are not working to live in accommodation that would be out of the reach of most people in work
[normal]”,
[normal] 
[normal]around half of current claiman
[normal]ts in Camden are in work
[normal]. Any further divergence between LHA rates and market rents will mean that workers on low incomes will find it increasingly difficult to rent in the private sector in Camden, especially as Camden’s social housing stock is under such
[normal] pressure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8.
[normal] 
[normal]The effects of the 
[normal]SSSC[bold] have 
[normal]largely 
[normal]yet to be felt. 
[normal]However as noted above, we are concerned about arrears for this group
[normal] - over half of affected households are in arrears. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.9.
[normal] 
[normal]By definition this group has few 
[normal]dependent 
[normal]children. However we are 
[normal]concerned that 
[normal]disabled people
[normal] 
[normal]may
[normal] have to leave an adapted home.
[normal] In particular, households with disabled adult children do not get an additional room 
[normal]under SSSC 
[normal]and we know of families in
[normal] this position
[normal] in Camden
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We do not yet have full data about the g
[normal]roup of people who will be affected by the 
[normal]TBC[bold]. However based on 
[normal]May 2013 DWP data
[normal], 
[normal]80% of households
[normal] that are at risk of the cap 
[normal]have children. The total number of children is 1
[normal],
[normal]647 (about 4% of all children in Camden). 63% are in households with 4 or mor
[normal]e children.
[normal] The scale of the shortfalls involved (on average £70 per week
[normal] per affected households, much higher in many cases
[normal]) mean that households are unlikely to be able to absorb them and will need to move or find work. 
[normal]Although some claimants
[normal] at risk of
[normal] being affected
[normal] have found work (see above)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the profile of many of the households involved 
[normal] – number of children, language issues (many affected families are 
[normal]from 
[normal]BME
[normal] backgrounds
[normal]) 
[normal]and poor health – means that finding work will be difficult. Some households in the private rented sector may be able to move to the social rented sector although this is 
[normal]not
[normal] guaranteed to bring 
[normal]them under the cap (40% of households are already in the soci
[normal]al rented sector). For many households, leaving the borough and probably London entirely may be the only viable option.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Council believes that the LHA 
[normal]changes
[normal] and the TBC do not reflect the very high housing costs in Inner and Central London and
