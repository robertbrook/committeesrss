default1.1.
default 
defaultThe London Borough of Camden 
defaultincludes
default 
defaultsome of the wealthiest and 
defaultthe 
defaultmost deprived neighbourhoods in London. Housing costs are extremely high and it has one of London’s largest social housing stocks with 
defaulta third
default of the population living in social rented accommodation. 
defaultA
defaultnother third of households
default live in the private rented s
defaultector
default, the sixth highest proportion in England and Wales. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default 
default28,000 or 30% of all households in the borough claim 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit. The Council estimates that 
defaultaround 5,400
default of these have been affected by 
defaultone or more of the three 
defaultmajor 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit 
defaultchanges
default.
default 
defaultAccording to analysis by Sheffield Hallam University, Camden is by no means the most affected borough in London (ranking 15
defaultth
default of 33 and 112
defaultth
default of 384 nationally for overall loss of benefit per working age adult). However 
defaulthigh housing costs and high demand 
defaultfor social housing make the impacts more severe in Camden. 
defaultThe 
defaultLabour-controlled council
default has made preserving the social mix a priority for the Council. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1.
default 
defaultAn important indicator 
defaultof success or failure
default for a local authority
default in dealing with the 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit changes is the 
defaultnumber of
default 
defaulthouseholds who are 
defaultstatutory 
defaulthomeless or in 
defaulttemporary accommodation (TA)
default. 
defaultB
defaultoth have remained at low 
defaultlevels
default so far
default contrary to London and national trends
default. 
defaultJ
defaultust 
default11
default households a month
default on average
default 
defaulthave been 
defaultaccepted as statutorily homeless (Part VII) since May 2012 and 
defaultTA
default numbers are still on a long term downward trajectory. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default 
defaultCamden has 
defaultbeen helped in its re
defaultsponse to welfare 
defaultchanges
default by its 
defaultlong term investment in homelessness prevention servicesdefault, a response to the 
defaultlong standing
default housing issues in the borough. 
defaultThe 
defaultCouncil has
default an excellent track record in 
defaultplacing
default households at risk of homele
defaultssness in sustainable
default tenancies
default. 
defaultThe
default service has supported
default nearly 500 households
default affected by the LHA cap
default; 30% of them were helped to stay in their homes and 32% were helped to make a successful 
defaultbid for a council property
default 
defaultin the borough 
defaultor move to other private rented sector ac
defaultcommodation. Only 11 
defaultof these 
defaulthouseholds ended up making a Part VII homelessness application.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default 
defaultThe Council
default has also been proactive in supporting households affected by the 
defaultSocial Sector Size Criteria
default (SSSC)
default primarily by 
defaultencourag
defaulting
default moves to right-size acc
defaultommodation and to provide advice and support, including 
defaultDHPs
default where 
defaultneeded
default. 
defaultSince January 2013, housing officers have advised over 1,000 council tenants. 
defaultSupport for under-occupying households includes a scheme called “First Choice Plus” through which council voids are decorated to a higher standard than usual and reserved for under-occupiers, cash incentives, handholding and proactive help with moving, and
default advice and assistance to help under-occupiers maximise their chances of achieving a move through various social tenant mobility schemes, including HousingMoves.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default 
defaultAnother success factor for the borough has been 
defaultclose collaboration between council departmendefaultts and with local partnersdefault. The best solution for families who may be affected by total benefit cap 
default(TBC) 
defaultis finding work over 
default16 hours thus exempting them from the cap. This 
defaultrequires close work with the family, Job Centre Plus and other local agencies. Ho
defaultusing officers are referring people to Job Centre Plus, advice agencies or children’s centres for employment support. 
defaultAs of 
defaultSeptember
default 2013, 
defaultJob Centre Plus had supported 15
default0 people who would have been affected by the cap into employment.
default When the Council r
defaultecently let new advice contracts, it completely changed the relationship 
defaultwith
default local advice agencies by setting up the Camden Advice Partnership to foster a more equal and collaborative relationship. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default 
defaultHowever finding work is not viable for all affected hou
defaultseholds. Many face multiple barriers to employment. In these cases, t
defaulthe Council has 
defaultbeen making
default 
defaultflexible 
defaultuse of Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) – in one case, the family moved out of London but a DHP was used to pay for the daughter’s rail season tic
defaultket to allow her to remain at school in Camden and sit her exams. 
defaultThe purpose of DHPs is to buy households time to find a long-term s
defaultolution to their housing needs
default. To do this effectively, the Benefits service (which authorise the payment) and housing offi
defaultcers (who provide advice and support) 
defaultmust work
default closely together. 
defaultIn this respect, Camden has benefitted from retaining its housing stock in-house – working relationships with housing associations have been less close and anecdotal evidence from elsewhere 
defaultsuggests that boroughs with ALMOs have struggled to respond effectively to the challenges of welfare reform. 
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default 
default 
defaultCamden Council believes that its response to 
defaultwelfare 
defaultchanges have 
defaultonce again 
defaultdemonstrated 
defaultthe effectiveness of local gov
defaulternment and its local 
defaultpartner
defaults
default 
defaultagainst a back drop of major pressures on budgets. While the government have of course provided additional funding to support councils, this is in a wider context of large scale cuts to their budgets. 
defaultL
defaultocal knowledge, partnerships and relations
defaulthip
defaults with residents of local authorities
default have been a major factor in this effectiveness
default. 
defaultThis is why 
defaultCamden along with other local authorities 
defaulthas deep concerns about the end of its role in the administration of 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit and the ability of the DWP to d
defaulteliver Universal Credit effectively. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1.
default 
defaultAs noted above, o
defaultne of the major impacts of the changes for local authorities is 
defaulton homelessness and defaultTAdefault. If
default,
default as a result of 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit changes, a household 
defaultbecomes homeless, the council’s statutory duties have resource implications especially if they are placed in 
defaultTA
default. 
defaultThe introduction of the 
defaultTBC
default will make it harder to procure 
defaultTA
default at 
defaultan affordable rate
default and in some cases, the council 
defaulthas leased properties for several years that will no longer be fu
defaultlly covered by Housing Benefit for which t
defaulthe Council will need to make up the shortfall. The Council has been working with 
defaultTA
default households at risk of the cap to place them in more 
defaultaffordable
default ac
defaultcommodation
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default 
default As well as the impact on households currently in 
defaultTA
default, there is a significant risk that 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit changes will increase demand for 
defaultTA
default over the medium term. 
defaultT
defaulthis did 
defaultnot happen with the LHA changes, 
defaultlargely due to 
defaultthe new Localism Act pow
defaulter
default, 
defaultthe inherent great
defaulter
default mobility of
default private rented sector tenants and not least the council’s interventions. These interventions cost 
defaultthe council money both through additional placements in the private rented sector and the fact that some LHA households m
defaultoved to the social rented sector thus taking that housing away from other needs groups. However 
defaultthere are reasons to think that the SSSC and TBC will result in increased homelessness and demand for 
defaultTA
default. 
defaultAlready a majority of our tenants affected by the SSSC
default are in arrears and some will eventually become at risk of eviction. This will result in additional costs to the council regardless of whether they become homeless or are prevented from becoming homeless by council intervention
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default 
defaultThe new power to discharge
default their homelessness responsibilities by placing households in the private rented sector has helped local authorities in this area. In addition, the DWP have greatly increased funding for Discretionary Housing Payments – Camden received £1.6m in 2012/13. We
default are using DHPs to prevent homelessness in the short term. For example, we are giving DHPs to all households affected by the TBC to 
defaultgive
default them 
defaulttime to 
defaultadjust to their reduced benefit. 
defaultHowever
default 
defaultw
defaulte do not know from year to year what our DHP allocation will be and our concern is that the full effects of housing benefit changes will be felt in future years when there may not be sufficient DHP funding to cope.  
defaultWe are anticipating that DHP claims will
default increase significantly from now on as the combined effects of welfare changes, especially the Benefit Cap, impact on claimants alongside increasing cost of living pre
defaultssures from fuel and food bills
default. We are doing all we can to alert households to the conse
defaultquences of burying their heads in the sand but we cannot oblige them to take action. In addition, DHPs can only be used to top up 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit payments, they do not cover the costs of these interventions which the council has had to fund itself (see bel
defaultow). 
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default 
defaultAlthough we cannot quantify it at this stage, 
defaulthomelessness, 
defaultTA
default and prevention activities are
default a clear example
default of how 
defaultreducing the welfare spend could result in increased costs for 
defaultlocal authorities. This ‘cost shunting’
default 
defaultis creating
default pressures on local
default authority budgets not least because funding from central government continues to be reduced. It will result in further difficult 
defaultbudget 
defaultdecisions for councils and 
defaultthus 
defaultto ‘blame shunting’ from government to local authorities
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default 
defaultA further concern and pressur
defaulte on DHPs and Council funds is the DWP’s decision not to exempt Local 
defaultAuthority-
defaultowned 
defaultsupported accommodationdefault from the Benefit Cap in Metropolitan and Unitary authorities. The support given to these vulnerable claimants through support
defaulted
default accommodation is v
defaultital and we cannot understand 
defaultthe DWP’s rationale for
default exempt
defaulting
default such people in District Authorit
defaulties
default but not in a London Borough such as Camden.  
default&#xa0;
default3.6.
default 
defaultWelfare 
defaultchanges have 
defaultresulted in additional 
defaultshort-term 
defaultdemands on council defaultservicesdefault for example visiting affec
defaultted households and working with RSLs to identify households affected by the SSSC
default. 
defaultIn 2013/14 the Council expects that over £800,000 of existing resource will be diverted to work related to responding to the welfare changes, including staff in housing and b
defaultenefit teams offering 
defaultsupport and advice to residents
default.
default default&#xa0;
default3.7.
default 
defaultIn the longer term, the introduction of UC will mean councils will no longer be responsible for administering 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit. In theory this should be cost-neutral to the council. However in the interim period this makes it difficult for the 
defaultC
defaultouncil to retain or recruit benefits officers. This 
defaultissue is compounded by the uncertainty regarding the timetable for rolling out 
defaultUC – it is difficult for the council to allocate resources in this context. 
default&#xa0;
default3.8.
default 
defaultBreaking the link between councils and 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit has other unintended consequences. 
defaultHousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit is a gateway benefit for other benefits such 
defaultas free school meals and Bl
defaultue Badges
default which will continue to be administered by local authorities
default. This 
defaultwill
default 
defaultrequire real-time
default accurate 
defaultinformation 
defaultflows from the DWP to the local authority. We are concerned that the DWP 
defaulthas 
defaultnot given sufficient consideration to these future data nee
defaultds for local authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default3.9.
default 
defaultThere are impacts on other council services resulting from households moving because of welfare changes. We know that over 1,000 children resident in Camden and attending Camden schools are affected by housing benefit changes (n
defaultote that many children attending Camden schools live outside the borough and vice versa)
default. If these children have to move schools, this not only potentially disrupts their schooling but also creates transactional costs for the school and the local authority
default. We are planning to produce an estimate of how many children have moved schools as a result of the LHA changes. 
default&#xa0;
default3.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn theory, the 
defaultSSSCdefault 
defaultcould provide an additional impetus for 
defaultcouncil’s
default tenants to downsize, thus making better use of the council’s limited housing stock, reducing overcrowding etc. This is a particular issue in Camden as we have a large stock of 1 bed properties 
defaultand fewer larger properties. 
default28% of affected tenants have regi
defaultstered to downsize and 
default46 households affected by the SSSC have moved since 1 April
default. However 
defaultevidence suggests 
defaultmany affected tenants are not prepared to move and those that are are not bidding on available smaller properties
default. This could be because these sma
defaultller properties are unsuitable or not attractive.  
defaultThere are additional transactional costs associated with an increase in moves within the council’s housing stock, most notably in properties which have received adaptations for disabled residents. In these
default cases, we are currently meeting shortfalls with DHPs but this is not sustainable in the long term. 
default&#xa0;
default3.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultN
defaultearly three quarters of SSSC-affected households said they will manage the shortfall in their 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit
default 
defaultwhen contacted by council officers
default. 
defaultThe cou
defaultncil is concerned that some of these households, along with those who have registered to downsize but have not 
defaultmoved
default, are storing up trouble for the future rather than genuinely managing 
defaulttheir finances
default. This concern is borne out by arrears data - the percentage of 
defaultSSSC-affected households
default in arrears has increased from 42% in April to 54% in August and is far higher than the rate for all tenants (40%). While this rate includes all households in arrears, 
defaultno matter how small the amount
default or when the debt was accrued
default, the average amount owed by SSSC-affected households is 
default£557.42
default, far higher than for all tenants. 
defaultThe council faces a difficult choice if and when arrears 
defaultreach
default a critical point for these househol
defaultds – eviction (which may result in further costs to the council in homelessness and TA) or somehow handling the arrears (e.g. by writing them off). We are not yet at this point, but again we are concerned that 
defaultthe government is robbing Peter to pay Paul – 
defaultsaving money from the benefits budget at the expense of local authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default3.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf this is true of 
defaultthe 
defaultSSSC, it is all the more so of 
defaultUniversal Creditdefault. 
defaultOver the years, a shortage of social rented properties in Camden and across London has had the effect of a 
defaultgeneral increase in the vulnerability of council tenants (for example, lone parents make up 10% of all households 
defaultin the borough compared with 23% 
defaultin council rented properties). Council tenants on 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit are unused to budgeting for their housing c
defaultosts which is likely to result in increased arrears. We are also concerned that 
defaultthe 
defaultdigital by default 
defaultpolicy 
defaultis misguided given the vulnerability of many 
defaultH
defaultousing 
defaultB
defaultenefit claimants and this has been borne out by the findings of the UC pilots concerning dig
defaultital exclusion.
default&#xa0;
default3.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe replacement of Council Tax Benefit 
default(CTB) 
defaultwith a localised 
defaultCouncil Tax Reduction default(CTR)default 
defaultSchemedefault posed a dilemma for the Council. 
defaultIf we had adopted a scheme that offered the same level of support by 
defaultabsorb
defaulting
default the 10% reduction in funding f
defaultrom central government, we would have created a permanent funding pressure 
defaultof around £2.5m a year. 
defaultWe accepted the 
defaultone year transition
defaultal 
default grant 
defaultwhich allowed us to limit the minimum amount people had to pay to 
default8.5% of their council tax liability (between £
default1 and £4 a week).
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are 
defaultconsulting on
default 
defaultthe scheme for 2014/15 
default– our preferred option is
default to retain
default this year’s scheme but with
default 
defaultan amendment to 
defaultincrease the earnings disregard by £10 a week to improve incentives to work. 
defaultThis will add to the
default ongoing 
defaultfunding pressure but we feel it is the right thing to do. 
default&#xa0;
default3.15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel the CTR is a particularly blatant example of ‘blame shunting’ to local government. We understand that all parts of government need to make savings and local government does have a strong t
defaultrack record in this area. We have been faced with a difficult choice between increased costs and creating additional financial burdens for low income households which may end up being self-defeating if they are not able to pay. We have chosen a middle way 
defaultbut this has still resulted in a budget pressure for the council. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.1.
default 
defaultThe changes to the 
defaultLHAdefault 
defaultare
default the only 
defaultH
defaultousing
default 
defaultB
defaultenefit 
defaultchange 
defaultfor which we have information about longer ter
defaultm impacts. However the council has limited information because we only know who claims and has stopped claiming in the borough.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default 
defaultThere is no doubt that there have been changes since the LHA changes were introduced in April 2011. Of the 1,800 households whi
defaultch were capped in April 2011, only 44% were still claiming LHA in Camden in June 2013. 15% had secured a council or RSL tenancy in Camden and 40% had stopped claiming LHA in Camden – they may have moved, found employment etc. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe overall stock of LHA cl
defaultaimants has decreased by just 2%
default so while s
defaultome 
defaulthave left the borough, 
defaultthere are more taking their place
default. However the geographical distribution of LHA claimants in Camden has changed
default with increases in cheaper areas and decreases in Central London
default. The profi
defaultle of LHA claimants appears to have changed as well - the trend seems to be towards smaller households with fewer children. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default 
defaultThis evidence 
defaultappears to support
default the commonly held thesis that the impact of welfare 
defaultchanges 
defaultin London is 
defaultfor 
defaultpeople
default to move
default out o
defaultf Central and Inner London to Outer London and beyond. However we cannot say 
defaultfor sure 
defaulthow much of this change in down to the LHA changes and how 
defaultmuch would have happened anyway
default,
default especially given
default LHA claimants are generally more mobile than other HB claiman
defaultts. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default 
defaultThere are also a large number of households (44% of the original capped cohort) who are still in the borough. Anecdotal evidence from the 
defaulthouseholds supported by the 
defaultcouncil’s housing department is that 
defaultthey
default would rather struggle with rent and/or become overcrowded than leave the
defaultir
default community 
defaultand the 
defaultnetworks 
defaultthey have built up. The impacts of these coping mechanisms will only be felt over the longer term. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default 
defaultWe are finding it increasingly difficult to place vulnerable households at risk of homelessness in the private rented sector in the borough. Before April 2011, 62% of placements in the private rented sector were in the borough - this has fallen to 35% sinc
defaulte April 2011. Moving outside the borough 
defaultcan cause
default disruption to children’s schooling, social networks etc and risks increasing a household’s vulnerability.
default&#xa0;
default4.7.
default 
defaultWe are concerned about the long term impact of the LHA changes on the social mix of the borough. M
defaultarket rents in the private rented sector are steadily increasing while LHA rates in Camden are capped or kept at a very low rate of increase. If this continues for several years, even the relatively affordable area around Kilburn High Road will become unaf
defaultfordable for LHA claimants. 
defaultAlthough o
defaultne of the stated aims of the LHA changes is “h
defaultousing 
defaultb
defaultenefit should not support people who are not working to live in accommodation that would be out of the reach of most people in work
default”,
default 
defaultaround half of current claiman
defaultts in Camden are in work
default. Any further divergence between LHA rates and market rents will mean that workers on low incomes will find it increasingly difficult to rent in the private sector in Camden, especially as Camden’s social housing stock is under such
default pressure.
default&#xa0;
default4.8.
default 
defaultThe effects of the 
defaultSSSCdefault have 
defaultlargely 
defaultyet to be felt. 
defaultHowever as noted above, we are concerned about arrears for this group
default - over half of affected households are in arrears. 
default&#xa0;
default4.9.
default 
defaultBy definition this group has few 
defaultdependent 
defaultchildren. However we are 
defaultconcerned that 
defaultdisabled people
default 
defaultmay
default have to leave an adapted home.
default In particular, households with disabled adult children do not get an additional room 
defaultunder SSSC 
defaultand we know of families in
default this position
default in Camden
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe do not yet have full data about the g
defaultroup of people who will be affected by the 
defaultTBCdefault. However based on 
defaultMay 2013 DWP data
default, 
default80% of households
default that are at risk of the cap 
defaulthave children. The total number of children is 1
default,
default647 (about 4% of all children in Camden). 63% are in households with 4 or mor
defaulte children.
default The scale of the shortfalls involved (on average £70 per week
default per affected households, much higher in many cases
default) mean that households are unlikely to be able to absorb them and will need to move or find work. 
defaultAlthough some claimants
default at risk of
default being affected
default have found work (see above)
default,
default 
defaultthe profile of many of the households involved 
default – number of children, language issues (many affected families are 
defaultfrom 
defaultBME
default backgrounds
default) 
defaultand poor health – means that finding work will be difficult. Some households in the private rented sector may be able to move to the social rented sector although this is 
defaultnot
default guaranteed to bring 
defaultthem under the cap (40% of households are already in the soci
defaultal rented sector). For many households, leaving the borough and probably London entirely may be the only viable option.
default&#xa0;
default4.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Council believes that the LHA 
defaultchanges
default and the TBC do not reflect the very high housing costs in Inner and Central London and
default 
defaultit see
defaultms unreasonable to apply the same caps to London as to the rest of the country. The TBC is based on the national average household income of £26,000 whereas average household income in Camden is 
defaultmore like £33,000
default. The effect is to make most of the borough 
defaultunaffordable to 
defaulthousing benefit claimants (at least in the private rented sector), reducing the social mix of the borough and in some cases, requiring 
defaulthouseholds
default to leave their community.
default&#xa0;

defaultthus 
defaultmay have a cumulative impact. However CTR i
