[normal]RMT – Written evidence[bold]RMT welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Parliamentary Joint Committee Call for Evidence on the Draft Deregulation Bill. 
[normal]RMT is the largest of the UK rail unions, representing over 80,000 members in every sector of the transport industry, including maritime where we organise around 6,000 seafarer ratings.
[normal]For this reason we will comment on matters relating directly to the transport industry, safety and the employment rights of our members.
[normal]Executive summary[bold]1.0 [bold]              [bold]Removal of duty to order re-hearing of marine accident investigations[bold]RMT strongly opposes the Draft Bill’s proposal at Clause 25 to abolish the duty in Section 269 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 on the Secretary of State to re-open maritime accident investigations in the event of new and important evidence. 
[normal]The duty under section 269 of the 1995 Act proposed for deletion in the Draft Bill was used in 1998 to re-open the formal investigation into the loss of the MV Derbyshire in September 1980. 
[normal]The UK flagged, owned and crewed MV Derbyshire disappeared almost without trace south of Japan after it was engulfed by Typhoon Orchid. All on board, 42 crew and two passengers (wives of crew members), lost their lives. The Derbyshire was a modern commercial vessel (built 1976), fully equipped and well-managed ore-bulk-oil (OBO) combination carrier, en route to Japan from Canada with a cargo of iron ore. At over 91,000 gross 
[normal]tonnage
[normal] she remains the largest UK ship to have ever been lost at sea. 
[normal]After nearly 20 years of campaigning by the MV Derbyshire families, the National Union of Seamen, the RMT (from 1990 when the NUS merged with the National Union of 
[normal]Railwaymen) and the International Transport Workers Federation, the original investigation into the cause of the MV Derbyshire’s loss was re-opened (and re-heard) by the then Secretary of State, John Prescott on 17
[normal]th
[normal] December 1998:
[normal]“Now the Secretary of the State for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in pursuance of the powers conferred by section 269 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 hereby orders that the whole of the case shall be reheard by Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice.”
[normal]The original investigation, reported in January 1989, was largely inconclusive and lacked any useful, rigorous insight into the causes, so much so that it was described by the Attorney General, Lord Williams of 
[normal]Mostyn
[normal] on the first day of the re-opened investigation on 5
[normal]th
[normal] April 2000 as: 
[normal]“...self-confessed speculation in large measure, an exercise in surmise, constrained by the lack of evidence.”
[normal]The UK Government consistently refused to re-open the initial investigation into the causes of the loss of the Derbyshire and it was only a union-funded search for the vessel in the 1990s, combined with the introduction of the Duty in the 1995 Act that established the necessary evidence and the legal obligation on Government to re-open the investigation. 
[normal]The subsequent investigation not only absolved the crew from any blame for the loss of the vessel but led to significant improvements in the safe operation of bulk carrier class ships, as well as vital developments in the understanding of the mechanics of destructive waves generated under typhoon conditions.
[normal]We do not regard Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Right to a Fair Trial as a sufficient justification for the proposed abolition of section 269 of the MSA 1995. The position of officers in circumstances of new and important evidence coming to light is relevant but not sufficient to justify this incredibly hazardous proposal. 
[normal]In addition, during 2012 alone the Marine Accident Investigation Branch compiled twenty two Merchant Vessel (commercial, non-fishing ships) reports, which involved seven seafarer fatalities, as well as four other incidents which resulted in injuries, including serious injuries, to seafarers or passengers. If important evidence relating to the causes of these accidents subsequently comes to light, it is essential that the investigations are re-opened, for the peace of mind of the families involved and to maximise the safety lessons that can be learned from tragic incidents at sea.
[normal]The current duty should be retained, as it is clearly of practical use, not to mention of significant public and industrial interest for the Government to be obliged to establish the actual cause of a maritime accident should new and compelling evidence subsequently come to light.

[normal]Removal of restrictions on provision of passenger rail services
[normal]The proposal to remove restrictions on PTE powers to provide rail passenger services is not actually a removal of restrictions but the grandly of additional powers to allow the letting of rolling stock to open access operators. Open access passenger train operators operate services purely on a commercial basis, i.e. not under either a franchise or a concession agreement. These operators apply to the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) for the necessary track access rights and to Network Rail for train paths in the timetable and are subject to less regulation. This means that an open access operator can cut and run from the rail passenger services they provide at a moment’s notice, without having to give employees, the regulator (ORR), the Department for Transport or Network Rail any prior notice of their intention to withdraw services.
[normal]RMT believes that this is a move towards extending open access operations, to which RMT is opposed. 
[normal]This is clearly "of practical use" and the proposal, therefore, is a policy decision under the guise of easing regulations.
[normal]RMT notes that the Office of Rail Regulation is currently consulting on any extension of open access operations and as such it is inappropriate for this proposal to be included in the Bill.
[normal]3.0 [bold]              [bold]Employment Rights[bold]3.1 
[normal]              
[normal]Removal of employment 
[normal]tribunals
[normal] power to make wider recommendations
[normal]RMT is concerned at the proposal (Clause 2) to remove the possibility for Employment Tribunals to make recommendations concerning the organisation, where discriminatory or other bad practice may be an issue and as such is a major setback in challenging rogue employers. When combined with the introduction of other reforms to Employment Tribunals, such as the introduction of fees, the effect of this proposal is profoundly negative for the protection of workers’ rights.
[normal]RMT believes that the ability of an employment tribunal to make wider recommendations, which affect other members of the workforce, is of significant “practical use” and so should not be removed.

[normal]Gangmasters
[normal] (Licensing) Act 2004: enforcement
[normal]RMT believes that this proposal (Clause 43) in allowing the Secretary of State to decide if the enforcement proceedings should be taken forward by a different authority (of the Crown) as an alternative to the 
[normal]Gangmasters
[normal] Licensing Authority enforcement officers is a deliberate weakening of the GLA at a time when it should be strengthened. This is especially true given the proliferation of zero-hours contracting, payroll companies etc... 
[normal]currently
[normal] in operation in the sectors within the remit of the GLA. On that basis RMT believes that the current legislative situation is “of practical use”, and should be strengthened not weakened.

[normal]Ambulatory references to international shipping instruments[bold]The Government’s proposal in the Draft Bill (Clause 48) to simplify the implementation of international maritime conventions into UK law through ambulatory references risks bad legislation and unintended consequences due to a lack of scrutiny by parliament and outside bodies such as trade unions. Clause 48 proposes some safeguards but we do not regard these as sufficient.
[normal]It is useful to consider in this context the process currently used to pass international conventions into UK law, with the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) serving this purpose ideally. Although lengthy, the MLC consultation process, co-ordinated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, was absolutely essential in understanding the scope and impact of the Convention on UK law and UK seafarers, as well as identifying those parts of the Convention that the Government/MCA has interpreted. If anything, consultation processes over the implementation of international maritime conventions into UK law should be longer and more detailed, not curtailed or rushed. It should also be pointed out that it was not the MLC consultation process that delayed UK ratification of this important Convention, rather political will within Government.
[normal]RMT is concerned that this method of speeding up the adoption and implementation of international maritime law into UK law has come about through consultation between the Government and an industry frustrated by regulation during an economic recession that is eating into shipping companies’ profit margins. The result is an unbalanced proposal which, at a stroke, would relegate parliament and employees to observer status as new and potentially far reaching maritime law is implemented with little explanation or consultation. 
[normal]We are opposed to this proposal and recommend that the members of the Joint Committee scrutinising this Bill look very closely at its democratic and industrial implications.
