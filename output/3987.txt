[[[ Mr Carl Bennett, MD of Tradeskills4U Ltd]]]Short Summary of submission.

[[[The electrical Workforce.]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[Introduction.]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[.1]]] I’m Carl Bennett the Managing Director of 

[[[Tradeskills4U]]]

[[[ Ltd]]]. We are the UK's largest educator of the electrical installation adult workforce and the country’s only specialist electrical IET ‘Centre of Excellence’, to put this into context, we’re actually a modest family run company employing 30 people. 

[[[1]]]

[[[.2]]] What we are is a business to business company with an enviable reputation and 98% candidate approval rating. We are an independent company; none funded organization. Chairman Clive Betts MP and other MPs have visited our facilities.

[[[1]]]

[[[.3]]] We train approximately 3000 adult candidates each year in a full range of electrical domestic, commercial and industrial skills and adult vocational qualifications, many for continuing professional development. We also train adult apprentices and Domestic electrical installers to enable them to register on the various Competent Person’s Schemes. 

[[[1.4]]] Our core candidates are 

[[[75%]]] existing electrical and other trade’s contractors and 

[[[25%]]] new entrants.  

[[[95 %]]] of our candidates are micro business owners and employers, essentially the backbone of the industry. 

[[[1]]]

[[[.5]]] Like any good business, we constantly engage with our customers/candidates. Dozens are literally under our roof every day, many of them are electrical contractors and others not fully qualified electricians but are employed within the greater electrical industry because of their ability to work within the Competent Person Schemes, they have a wide range of experience in many other trades and also have competency in electrical installation to undertake that role as their main occupation requires I.e. Heating engineers, kitchen fitters, home maintenance contractors, auto gate installers, gas engineers, the list is too numerous to be exhaustive within this space

[[[1]]]

[[[.6]]] As MD it’s my job to gather evidence, engage with and listen to opinions from every aspect of the wider industry of electrical installation to ensure we supply the right training, qualifications and skills options for employers, electricians, associated trades, companies and new entrants into the industry. 

[[[1]]]

[[[.7]]] These people and their businesses are my constituency, and they enable me to have a well rounded and perhaps unique view of the domestic electrical installation, repair, maintenance, improvement, upgrade and service industry and in fact the wider issue of the skills level of the electrical industry and should entitle me to express opinions and suggestions in contribution to your debate. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[, from an industry trainer’s perspective]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[2]]]

[[[.1]]] It is worth noting, the wider world of the electrical installation industry does not belong solely to the institutions of the Electrical Industry. The heating engineer who wires in your boiler is not in the electrical industry, the kitchen fitter, landscape gardener or home maintenance contractor is not in the electrical industry but nevertheless, everyday they, and many others like them, work quite competently and diligently with electrics. 

[[[2]]]

[[[.2]]] This large group of stakeholders, certainly in their tens of thousands, rival in numbers to any of the organizations that has spoken to you so far, rarely have their opinions listened to by those with the power to steer the industry. These people must be considered in your deliberations.

[[[2]]]

[[[.3 ]]]Perhaps because we are an independent educator of the workforce, we are able to offer observations as educators of the workforce that seem quite contrary to some of the view I have heard expressed to you so far.

[[[2]]]

[[[.4]]] In particular our view of the supply of future workers to small employers is very definitely not a positive one.&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The

[[[ IET]]] (Institution of Engineering Technology), one of the world's largest organisations for engineers and technicians who have warned that proposed reforms to government funding could lead to a reduction in UK apprenticeships. We agree with IET claims that the reforms are likely to reduce quality and deter SMEs from taking part in apprenticeship schemes and have criticised apprenticeship reforms, saying that the changes would incur higher costs that may prevent smaller businesses from taking on apprentices.&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 

[[[Edge Foundation]]], a leading independent education charity, pointed to the government's own research that suggests apprentice numbers could fall by 

[[[73%]]] when employers have to pay at least half the cost. &#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our views are also consistent with the views of Nigel Whitehead 

[[[UKCES]]] Commissioner with regard to the future of our adult workforce and the recommendations he has made in his report of 8th November 2013 to improve the vocational qualification structure of our adult workforce to better reflect small employer’s needs. Our opinion is that at the moment they do not.

[[[3]]]

[[[. ]]]

[[[Shortage of workforce supply.]]]

[[[3]]]

[[[.1]]] It may surprise you to learn that the person that comes to your door to undertake some electrical work for you in your home is almost certainly going to be a properly qualified Competent Person and a member of a Competent Person Scheme. They are probably unlikely to be a so called ‘fully qualified electrician’. (That is a contractor who has served a full time traditional apprenticeship with a full set of qualifications i.e a Level 3 NVQ plus other qualifications) This is a fact that surprises many existing electrical contractors who wrongly assume the ‘fully qualified electrician’ to be in the majority. It is certainly our experience that an increasing majority of electricians are ‘fully qualified’, many having failed to keep up with current regulations, technologies and changes in best practices.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[4]]]

[[[. ]]]

[[[Competent Persons keep the system ]]]

[[[working.]]]

[[[4]]]

[[[.1]]] It is our estimation, gained from experience of the thousands of small contractor companies with whom we engage and is compatible with many electrical education and workforce reports I have seen and other business and training leaders in our sector we have spoken with that less than 

[[[50%]]] of people who undertake electrical work in this country are what you might call ‘fully qualified electricians’, the remainder are likely to be properly trained, qualified and experienced Competent Persons with a wide range of experience in many other trades who also have competency in electrical installations to undertake that role as their main occupation requires and I have no evidence to doubt they do a proper and safe job.  

[[[4]]]

[[[.2]]] Frankly if it were not for Competent Persons undertaking electrical work by the tens of thousands, the electrical infrastructure of this country would be compromised and poorly serviced. There are not enough so called ‘fully qualified electricians’. Many more experienced in the industry than me I have heard, argue in fact there really never has been. Pre Part P we just didn’t monitor electrical work undertaken to any great degree, lots of this relatively minor and domestically defined work went unseen, compared with today, where electrical work is more visible due to Part P regulations.     

[[[4]]]

[[[.3]]] It is my information and experience of our engagement with contractors that the numbers of electricians with full qualifications are rapidly dwindling and set to reduce at alarming rates in the coming years. The JIB (Joint Industry Board), state, in their latest Labour Report 2012 of their 18,000 total membership, that only 

[[[31%]]] of their ‘experienced members’ have full qualifications. JTL (The industry’s largest NVQ trainer) with whom we work closely stated to us, in a recent apprenticeships meeting, that they expect 

[[[52%]]] of the experienced workforce to retire in the next 8-10 years. We also know that industry apprenticeships are down 

[[[20%]]] on last year. The JIB itself completed only 

[[[7]]] (

[[[seven]]]) apprentices last year, staggering, but certainly not their fault in my opinion, it’s the qualification route with which they work is to blame. 

[[[4]]]

[[[.4]]] I’m sure and hope you’re aware that just over 

[[[90 % ]]]of the electrical installation industry is made up of very small businesses, comprising typically of very small teams of contractors, large employers account for no more than 

[[[10%]]] of the industry, yet seemingly get much more than 

[[[10%]]] of the say in to how the industry is run.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[5]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[ The entry routes for employment in the electrical industry are ‘not fit for purpose’]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[5.1]]] The purpose of apprenticeships and career routes into the industry are to secure and train the future workforce for the benefit of us all. They are not working as they should and this is relevant for your committee to consider because electrical workforce that operates under Part P is set to dwindle rapidly in coming years. 

[[[5.2]]] From a training provider’s perspective, a single qualification system to enter the industry is ‘not fit for purpose’. The entry to industry qualification system needs to start at a level that is achievable for the person to which it is intended, more innovative in design, better reflecting the needs of modern society and the small employer, enabling them to manage an appropriate qualification for the role the new entrant worker or apprentice would fulfill.  

[[[5]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[3]]] Large companies and some of the traditional organization in the industry have a different view from small contractors particularly with regard to apprenticeships and the training of their employees. 

[[[5]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[4]]] I can tell you as the MD of an organization that probably trains more candidates for apprenticeships than many others you have heard from, that the Small employers 

[[[(the 90%)]]] do not and cannot support the current qualification routes open to their potential staff.  

[[[5]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[5]]] Obviously large employers are supportive they have large budgets and spare manpower plus the small contractor is competition, what better way to remove competition than to starve them of staff.

[[[5]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[6]]] The small employer/contractor tasked with the actual job of training, paying for the training as well as paying and employing and paying the majority of apprentices in the UK are not supportive. They can’t afford the time and cost, they do all they can do to keep their heads above water, never mind bear the responsibility of training up the future work force. 

[[[5]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[7]]] The purpose of entry qualifications into the industry are to attract and secure a future workforce. At the moment they don’t. The modern face of the industry has changed since those supposed past halcyon days, big employers have gone in the numbers they once were. The training of the apprentices in any decent numbers now relies on the hard pressed micro businesses that are not geared up, and are neither skilled, nor economically viable enough to support a traditional apprenticeship route to entry which is seen by many in my sector as no longer ‘fit for purpose’, the numbers speak for themselves. 

[[[5]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[8]]] The common reason for not supporting the current entry qualifications  a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A one size fits qualification as entry to the industry does not reflect the needs of the small employer, a full 3 year apprenticeship is too onerous a commitment, regretfully the current qualification reflects the needs of the few big employers. b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current Electrical NVQ is academically challenging to the average person, as a result dropout rates are alarming.    c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is not suitable for adults. Adult learners can’t afford to live on the low wages an apprentice gets paid over a protracted 3 years. He/she are likely to have dependents and commitments that don’t allow them to learn and work at the same time for a prolonged period.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Small businesses, have difficulty to support them giving cost, and the administration plus they are unlikely to have the relevant skills or time to be able to convey knowledge to a student. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[6]]]

[[[. ]]]

[[[Competent Persons qualification v Full NVQ ]]]

[[[qualification]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[6]]]

[[[.1]]] The training for full NVQ, please note, the training, i.e  the skills and knowledge that a person is taught in a college, not the workbased assessment and gathering of experience which follows training, commonly called ‘an apprenticeship’.

[[[6]]]

[[[.2]]] The typical delivery of training in centre by and FE College is one day a week for 3 years. For easy comparison if you took the same course full time, it would be of 16 weeks duration

[[[6]]]

[[[.3]]] This covers everything from installation of sockets in your home to the substation down the road, domestic, commercial and industrial. However it’s a one size fits all and is designed for a 16-19 year old with zero transferable skills from other work experience. 

[[[6]]]

[[[.4]]] The Domestic electrical element within an apprenticeship qualification is of 8 weeks duration; again assuming you did it as full time training. 

[[[6]]]

[[[.5]]] By no coincidence the new qualification ‘Level 3 certificate in Installing, Testing and Ensuring Compliance of Electrical Installations in Dwellings’ that enables a person to become a Competent person comprises of 12 weeks full time training, so well over and above that of an NVQ qualification.

[[[6]]]

[[[.6]]] The assumption that Domestic Competency training is somehow inferior to a Full NVQ is incorrect and misinformed. The training for the Domestic element is equal if not superior. Also usually because the demographic for this qualification is a 24+ years adult and they bring other relevant skills with them, their competency is likely to be higher. 

[[[7]]]

[[[. ]]]

[[[Summary]]]

[[[.]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are not enough so called ‘fully qualified electricians’ in the UK to meet current and certainly not future increasing demand.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are not enough new entrants either younger persons or adults joining the industry to cover the current and future loss of labour. c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current entry level is set too high and needs intermediate level. d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Competency schemes are all that keeps the electrical infrastructure repaired, maintained, upgraded, amended, functioning etc. Remove these and there will be significant negative impact.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The training and qualifications for competency schemes is good and improving and certainly up to the grade required for the job role. f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Electrical design of our Domestic System is inherently safe and has become more so as a result of Part P Regs. Though better monitoring and public awareness is necessary.g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since inception of Part P regulations we have been able to monitor the majority of electrical work, previously it was chaotic and invisible.h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no evidence of Cowboys being an unequal part of Competent persons schemes compared to the traditional electrician. Cowboys are surely just dishonest people no matter what their status in the industry.i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is lots of evidence and expert opinion that the current routes into the industry are not ‘fit for purpose’. Is failing our new entrants, failing our small employers, failing our requirements of a secure work force for the future. j)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many decision makers in the industry I know agree with our opinions and suggestions, but fear expressing them in fear of alienating their traditional workforce.

[[[Our suggestion of a Domestic Electrician Grade to ensure constant supply of workforce and progression entry ]]]

[[[into industry.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[8]]]

[[[.1]]] The one size fits all route into the industry is flawed, too expensive and too challenging for the person for which it is intended . We suggest there should be properly understood and accepted multi grades of electricians. Each capable of progressing to the higher level above. We suggest an additional grade of electrician to sit between the Competent person and the Full NVQ Qualified electrician as below. 

[[[8]]]

[[[.2]]] This would have the advantage of people entering the industry with a qualification based on what job they would actually be doing and then provides a manageable and cost effective stepping stone to progression for the Full qualification and by design naturally upgrades safety &amp; best practice. 

[[[8]]]

[[[.3]]] We suggest three grades of persons allowed to undertake electrical work. Each grade capable of progression.   Grades in ascending order,   

[[[C]]]. Competent Domestic Electrical Installer. For allied trades, Heating engineer etc.  (As exists but with proper industry recognition and mandatory registration)

[[[ ]]]

[[[B]]]. The Domestic Electrician. Domestic only work. (A shorter more defined competence qualification to better reflect the role, based on achievement not length)

[[[A]]]. The Approved Electrician (Comprising of Domestic, Commercial and Industrial)             

[[[8]]]

[[[.4]]] Too many people are working in electrics with no training, no qualifications, little or no knowledge. We need to use the carrot rather than the stick. The structure above would encourage people to do the right, who might otherwise not take qualifications or proper training as they see it as too onerous and expensive.       Give them an entry level that fits their job role, pocket and people’s modern busy lives. A gradual progressive career path to higher levels solving our apprenticeship supply issue and is consistent with the goals of the Whitehead report.     

[[[8]]]

[[[.6]]] We also suggest there should be a mandatory registering system for anyone that works with electrics, therefore there being an advantage in doing the right thing. 

[[[8]]]

[[[.7]]] Finally please do not to fix what isn’t broke due to mischievous self interest lobbying disguised as a safety initiative. We are using electrical systems increasingly in our lives, from reliance on computer systems to car charging to smart homes to green energy. No cooker or boiler, heating system or computer network will work without it. Electricity is becoming a greater part of our lives not less. If you restrict the numbers of people who are able to service our systems or place too many hurdles in their way, they will simply ignore them and ignore what legislation you put in place and it will cause us all difficulty and affect the efficiency and economy for us all. This much more important than a tweak of Part P,We certainly intend to continue to play our part in designing new qualifications and encouraging people to do the right thing.Submitted for your consideration. &#xa0;www.tradeskills4u.co.uk &#xa0;3 December 20131&#xa0;
