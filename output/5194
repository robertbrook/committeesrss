[normal]Written evidence submitted by CAB[bold]I[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]CABI is a non-for-profit inter-governmental, that was set up by a United Nations treaty and began in 1910. Our mission and direction are influenced by our 48 member countries of which the UK is a key member. CABI's mission is to improve people's lives worldwide by providing information and applying scientific expertise to solve problems in agriculture and the environment.
[normal]CABI has been involved in invasive species management since its very inception and now has more than 30 researchers dedicated to the subject around the world providing almost half a millennium of collective experience.  
[normal]CABI recognizes that the Government was ahead of the game when it set up the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat and the associated strategy and that this small under-resourced group has achieved a lot in its time and set the bar high for the rest of Europe. It is now time for a review of the strategy and the impending EU Regulation provides yet another opportunity to aim even higher to protect our Country from Invasive species. CABI expressed its willingness to be on the Programme Board when it was set up and remains keen to provide expert support to the strategy when needed.
[normal]The following brief notes have been drafted to address the Terms of Reference topics that were provided at the time of the launch of the Environmental Audit Committee inquiry on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species 
[normal]We welcome this opportunity to contribute to this consultation.
[normal]The principal drivers of the rising number of invasive species.[bold]These are well known and widely published and include the four Ts - trade, transport, travel and tourism contributing to the increased movement of species. Climate change is also increasing the range of species eligible to invade and their impacts and there is perhaps a small contribution of improved recording of species and wider recognition of the problem.
[normal]The adequacy of understanding and data on invasive species, and the extent of the harm they cause, to be able to devise strategies to address them.[bold]In any scientific discipline researchers will always want to know more and there are never enough data points to satisfy our wishes.  Whilst it is important to have scientific evidence using the most appropriate measurements it is often the case that the negative impacts of invasive species are obvious on first observation.  The literature is building exponentially, 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]much like the subjects of study themselves, and experience from around the world is available to help us here in the UK. The strategies to address IAS are well known and mostly tried and tested but we are not necessarily applying them to the best of our ability in Europe so far. We are not using all the tools available.  For example there have been over 1400 releases of biocontrol agents for weeds in the rest of the world and only one in the EU (the Japanese knotweed psyllid in England and Wales)
[normal]The adequacy of the draft EU Regulation and its relevance to the situation in the UK[bold]: 
[normal]No legislative instrument is perfect but in this case the Commission has done a pretty good job thanks to the extensive use of expert input along the way in the form of Expert workshops which CABI was involved in.  The draft Regulation is a potentially useful tool for IAS management in Member States and will certainly go some way to raising the profile of this under-represented threat to ecosystems and economies.  It is of course highly relevant to the UK as the crux of the matter will be the list of species of concern and how these are determined and what requirements are placed upon Member States. In addition the need for adequate allocation of resources is highly important.  Our fear is that there will be very little funding available from the Commission and the funding that is available will be channeled through the LIFE instrument which is almost impossible to consider by some of the best organisations wanting to get involved due to the match funding requirement, tiny overhead allowances and the ineligibility of civil servant salaries.
[normal]The proposed size of the list of species of concern;[bold]Putting a limit on the number of species before any real discussion has taken place is odd but understandable so as to be seen to limit the costs of the initiative.  As highlighted by the IUCN in their open call for 
[normal]science first
[normal] there are 1,500 or so IAS in Europe so applying an arbitrary cap is unscientific.  However, it is likely that even 50 species will be perceived as too costly to deal with in the current financial environment and the real agreed figure may well be lower. There is scope for individual MS to go further than the list but a crucial decision will be the balance between those species already here and causing havoc and those that are not yet widespread but are likely to do so.  
[normal]The criteria that should be used to identify the species of most[bold]&#xa0;[bold]concern, including the weightings to be given to biodiversity, human health and economic considerations and the ‘precationary principle’;[bold]One option is to focus on the CBD article 8h requirement to “prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species” as this is an obligatory commitment.  In reality biodiversity slips down the political agenda largely as a response to the drivers of the day but heavily influenced by the voting public.  Human health is therefore perceived as the primary concern and a Defra-funded consultation of general public attitudes to IAS mitigation measures revealed a very high support for eradication if human health was threatened.  There was also high support for 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]extreme measures if British native species were threatened so biodiversity does rank surprisingly high in the public’s mind.  
[normal]Economics will most often trump most other considerations because any prioritization needs to identify species for which there is a favourable cost-benefit.  However, any such analyses need to take into consideration all intervention measures.  For example it may be tempting to declare some of the worst invaders as uncontrollable and therefore ignorable.  This would be a mistake as techniques such as classical biological control offers a solution for the very worst invaders in the world and our lack of its use in Europe against weeds especially, means general ignorance of the possibility.  The UK (at least England and Wales) are leading the way in this field thanks to the authorization to release the specialist Japanese knotweed psyllid 
[normal]Aphalara itadori
[normal] in 2010 and in subsequent years.  Whilst it is too early in this long term process to see any success, it shows that it is possible to use the tool which has applications for many “out of control” species.
[normal]The precautionary principle is important and can save member states control and eradication costs if applied, banning the sale or increasing biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of a species known to have impacts elsewhere is of course the most sensible approach to take. However, the public will expect a regulation to have some impact on the here and now and the problems they face today as they have little appreciation of averted disasters.
[normal]Again, it is important to have a balance between species already in the EU causing trouble and those not yet arrived or widespread.
[normal]The balance between the different strands of the response to invasive species: detection, prevention, containment/adaptation or eradication;[bold]It is disappointing to see the question refer to containment/adaption yet the draft regulation always refers to “control or containment” and never mentions “adaptation”.  This reinforces the perception that control is impossible for species beyond possible eradication which is not true.  There is a great difference between containment and control.
[normal]The Commission summarises the proposal to the general public as implementing “
[normal]new measures to prevent new invasive alien species from entering the EU and to deal more effectively with the ones that are already established here
[normal]”. “
[normal]For banned species that are already, or become, widely spread, EU countries will need to put in place measures to keep them under control
[normal]”.  Thus the Regulation is utterly dependent on the list of banned species so if a species is not on the banned list there will be no real action required.  This is worrying and the weight is most likely to be on prevention, detection and early eradication as these would seem the only achievable targets (especially for those ignorant of the potential of biocontrol).  Again a mistake in our eyes and probably the eyes of the general public suffering from INNS impacts
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is true that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure but the task of prevention in the field of invasive species is almost impossible and like Canute trying to halt the tide.  It only takes one rogue trader, an internet order, or contaminant to start a new invasion.  It is common for Governments to ignore the most damaging invaders whilst focusing on prevention, early detection and eradication but those specie that are already having a serious impact should not end up being ignored due to dwindling budgets and being given a lower priority.
[normal]The General public will quite rightly expect some action on the species that are causing them and their environment the most damage now and there should certainly be a good balance between prevention and cure.  
[normal]The relative pros and cons of the Commission’s approach of a list of harmful species to tackle, rather than a list of safe species which would not be restricted; [bold]There is considerable debate in the invasives world over blacklists and whitelists.  The precautionary principle requires whitelists since the alternative approach can never catch all the potential invaders.  Black list systems mostly result in bans on species that have already established, and often long after it is too late to eradicate them. Most declaration processes are slow and onerous. They can be preventative by banning species before they are introduced, but this is done on an ad hoc, occasional basis rather than systematically. To properly implement a blacklist system it would be necessary to subject the many thousands of species in trade to Pest Risk Analyses which would of course be impossible (though this was attempted by Mexico using a rapid assessment tool),  
[normal]The white list approach assumes that a species is harmful unless proven otherwise and effectively bans all species.  This would sound Draconian and not implementable but the arguments for it are strong as discussed in the article “Turn the tap off before you mop up the spill” (Csuhres et al, 2006).  The most experienced country with regards to IAS is Australia who since 1997 has required risk assessment of new exotic species proposed for import into the country.  Nonetheless, as Tim Lowe
[normal] puts it in Feral Future
[normal]: 
[normal]“t
[normal]omorrow’s weeds are already here” and these are not dealt with under their legislation.  So even with these extreme measures which have prevented an estimated 1,500 potentially invasive species from entering Australia (Riddle et al 2008) Australia is far from IAS-free
[normal]If risk minimization was the goal then the white list system is the best.  One might suggest that it is only fair that if a trader wishes to introduce a potential threat to the country for the purpose of profit then it would not be too much to ask them to go some way to proving safety or identifying risk and mitigation measures as is the case for chemicals etc.  However, the reality of the situation is that the public would cry nanny state and the resistance from trade and their representatives would be significant.   
[normal]Any conflicts between the need to tackle invasive species and other environmental obligations.[bold]We face a lot of pressures on our environment and the list of competing priorities could be endless. IAS impact upon very many sectors and habitats and are similar to climate change in their cross-cutting nature.  As CABI’s research has shown (
[normal]Williams et al, 2010
[normal]), the economic costs are already very high at £1.7 billion/yr and are certainly increasing despite our collective best efforts.  Even the slightest reduction in these costs would more than pay for a significant increase in IAS management investment and effort.  With invasive species in contrast with some other competing environmental issues, leaving the status quo is not a low risk option.
[normal]What the UK’s strategy should be and where, if at all, the UK should diverge from, or go further than, the proposed EU approach. [bold]The UK strategy focuses heavily on biosecurity now, preventing those high impact species from entering the UK.  This is a sensible approach though we have to work towards reducing the impact of those species already present in the UK.  Any strategy should be guided by cost/risk: benefit analyses and these should play a bigger role in decision making.  Many activities are dependent upon a formal Pest Risk Analysis and at present this is a slow and involved process which limits the number of species that can be considered.  This is a problem that also faces organisations all over the world including EPPO which is why so few PRAs are done each year. Consideration should be given to the benefits of using a rapid risk assessment tool with the goal of processing many more species.  
[normal]We believe that the UK should continue to lead the way on Invasive Species issues in Europe and should certainly consider going further than the Regulation requires if it is not fit for the purpose of protecting our Country adequately. It would be premature to go too far into detail on a draft that may change but having a longer list of concern to the UK would be appropriate.  The UK should also feel free to implement the most useful parts of the Regulation long before it is enacted.
[normal]The problem of species that are native to one part of Europe but invasive in other parts of Europe is a tricky one and one that cries out for a regional approach.  Rhododendron is a perfect case in point as the original parent plant population is now threatened and endangered in the Iberian peninsula.  The UK should prioritise species in addition to those on an EU list.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is essential that any Regulation and resulting national legislation does not unintentionally restrict biological control efforts because such agents are non-native “beneficial pests”.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The need for specific measures for promoting sustainable domestic production of plants, vegetables and animals in the UK which minimises the risk of importing invasive non-native species.[bold]This is a tricky area because there is a risk of contravening open market laws but there is plenty of opportunity for awareness raising and action to promote locally-grown plants.  Of course the best step would be to only sell and plant native species and this has actually created a profitable market niche for suppliers in Australia and New Zealand.
[normal]The case for any change in the law regarding invasive species.[bold]We have some good laws but they seem toothless.  There have been very few if any prosecutions under Schedule 9 of the W&amp;C Act for example and bans on sale have been slow to come and very few in number. 
[normal]Invasive species do not recognize, borders, fences or land ownership and this should be the case for those needing to control species. 
[normal]The UK should be free to apply a levy to importers and sellers of potential IAS.  An annual license fee paid by the industry would reduce this risk while raising funds for research, screening imported species, education, and the eradication of past plant invasions (Barbier et al 2012).
[normal]Any lessons for England and Wales from the experience of Scotland’s invasive species legislation and controls.[bold]Scotland has been a lot more proactive in their invasive species legislation than the rest of the UK, and we should take note of this.  Scotland’s general no-release approach for species outwith its native range is always going to be more effective than the listing and eventual banning of species of concern.  There are still some problem plants that are available for sale in England and not in Scotland.
[normal]An even better approach might be to look for experience from countries like New Zealand and Australia whose laws have the same origins as ours but who have much more experience in invasive species policy.  The Australian’s recognized the inadequacy of existing legislation for dealing with biocontrol agents and ended up with the 1984 Biocontrol Act.
