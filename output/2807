default the 
defaultUK
default had experienced 20 years of relatively mild winters which
default combined with

defaulthighway authorities 
default(LHAs) 
defaultreducing their overall

default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a consequence
default of the difficulties
default, several 
defaultreviews and inquiries 
defaulthave 
defaultfollowed
default, 
defaultthe outcome of which has seen improvement

defaultto future severe winter weather events

default&#xa0;
defaultIntegrat
defaultion of transport networks and 
defaultthe provision of relevant, up-to-date 
defaultinformation 
defaultto passengers, covering all modes is vital to the continued operation of the network during severe weather events.
default  It was clear from the 2009-10 winter that passengers were often not provided with sufficient information to allow them to make sensible choices
default, this was identified in the
default reviews.    It is essential that the flow of information is integrated across tran
defaultsport modes
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe treatment of footways and cycleways is 
defaultalso 
defaultan important component of 
defaultthe 
defaultlocal 
defaultnetwork
default and needs to be recognised in winter maintenance strategies
default.  
defaultAs many LHAs already do, authorities should collaborate
default 
defaultwith and support lower-tier auth
defaultorities to help ensure
default 
defaultthat maximum practical winter support can be given in
default 
defaultareas and communities beyond the treated networks,
default 
defaultincluding
default 
defaultthe treatment of key footways and
default 
defaultpedestriani
defaults
defaulted
default areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll transport networks need to ensure that they have disruption plans in place and good communication available to all stakeholders during adverse winter weather (and at all times).  Safety of users of the transport network must be paramount.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, a
defaultnd crucially, budgets for the transport sector need to be set at a sufficient level
default and certainty
default to ensure a robust response to adverse winter weather  This should include the ability to allow providers to ‘invest to save’ through the purchase of better p
defaultlant and materials if needed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1.defaultHow resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather? default&#xa0;
default1.1default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK’s transport networks would ap
defaultpear to be 
defaultbetter prepared to respond 
defaultt
defaulto adverse 
defaultwinter weather
default, following the s
defaultevere winter of 2009
default. 
default 
defaultT
defaulthere have been a number of significant reviews and new guidance to the transport sector.  
default&#xa0;default1.2default&#xa0; 
defaultRoads default–
default 
defaultthe RAC Foundation Report (2013) 
default‘Ploughing On’
default published in May 
default2013 
defaulthighlighted that Local Highway Authorities had made good prog
defaultress in improving th
defaulteir winter resilience.  The report
default note
defaultd
default that, so far, budgets had been preserved for winter service operations.  CIHT has concerns that a continued 
defaultpressure
default on revenue funding for highway authorities could impact 
defaulton 
defaultlonger term winter 
defaultresilience
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.3default&#xa0; 
defaultMost bus routes are on local highway authorities’ winter salting/gritting or snow clearance rout
defaulte
defaults, and therefore are kept clear for bus services to continue to operate in all but the most extreme conditions.  However some services on more min
defaultor roads may be affected by adverse weather conditions, where the local authority has not cleared the route, with bus operators unable to provide services on those routes
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4default&#xa0; 
defaultRail default–
default Heavy snowfalls can have serious impacts on the rail network.  Snow clearance systems generally seem to work well in the UK, but there are some disruptions to services, especially in the more remote areas between centres of population.
default&#xa0;
default1.5default&#xa0; 
defaultAviationdefault – 
defaultAs with
default rail
default,
default heavy snowfall can have a serious impact on aviation, however the sector appears to work well.  There are the unavoidable runway closures in extreme conditions, but the main priority of the airport operator and the airlines on these occasions must b
defaulte passenger safety.
default&#xa0;defaultQ2. defaultWhat lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced in the winter of 2009-10? defaultWhat practical changes have been made to ensure the UK is now better equipped to deal with severe weather? default&#xa0;default2.1default&#xa0; 
defaultOn 12 March 2009 the then 
defaultSecretary of State (S
defaulto
defaultS) for Transport, 
defaultGeoff Hoon
default, made a statement to Parliament on the severe weather
default. The statement highlighted problems caused by the heavy snowfall and announced that the UK Roads Liaison Group (UKRLG) would review lessons that can b
defaulte learnt from the events of early February.  The UKRLG recommended what steps could be adopted by LHAs, trunk road authorities, producers of salt and other stakeholders to ensure the effective treatment of England’s road networks in order to ensure the nat
defaultion is better prepared should similar events occur in future years. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2default&#xa0; 
defaultUKRLG 
defaultreview 
default‘Lessons from the severe weather February 2009’
default 
defaultwas 
defaultpublished 
defaulton 
default4
default 
defaultAugust 2009
default and included 
defaulta package of 19 recommendations to develop and improve the highway maintenance f
defaultor future winters.
default  
default&#xa0;
default2.3default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government responded to the review in a written Ministerial statement
default and the Code of Practice for the highways sector,
default Well-maintained Highways
default,
default was updated 
defaultin tandem with the announcement.
default&#xa0;
default2.4default&#xa0; 
defaultThe winter of 2009/10 
defaultwas the coldest in the UK for 30 years and the duration of freezing temperatures and the extent of coverage of both snow and ice were highly unusual. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5default&#xa0; 
defaultWith the experience of the second severe winter and with some concern as to whether all the lessons lear
defaultned from the previous winter had been acted upon, the then S
defaulto
defaultS for Transport commissioned a further but independent review in March 2010.  A three-man Panel led by David Quarmby, Chair of the 
defaultRAC
default Foundation was formed, 
defaultits purpose to 
defaultconsider and recommend
default practical measures to improve the response of England’s transport systems to severe winter weather. 
default&#xa0;
default2.6default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Quarmby review
default ‘The Resilience of England’s Transport System in Winter’
default published in October 2010, 
defaultendorsed all the recommendations of the UKRLG rev
defaultiew and noted that progress had been made by the roads sector.  
defaultA significant concern
default was that the supply
default of salt for highways was 
defaulta major issue.  The recommendation in the Interim Report was for a strategic reserve of a quarter of a million tonnes for 201
default0/11 (this was accepted by Government). 
default&#xa0;
default2.7default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Review recommended a combination of higher stockholding levels for the beginning of the winter season (with a new resilience bench-mark of 12 days/14 runs pre-season), permanent adoption of lower salt spread ra
defaulttes and a willingness by the two main suppliers to commit to higher
default throughput rates when the market
default demands.  
defaultIf successful these measures would secure sufficient resilience to meet the needs of a severe winter.  
default&#xa0;
default2.8default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default RAC Foundation report, ‘Ploughing On
default – A review of hig
defaulthway resilience in Winter 2013’, covering both England and Wales 
defaultconcluded that good progress has been made by local highway authorities in winter service operations. 
default&#xa0;
default2.9default&#xa0; 
defaultThe report found that, without exception, local authorities are maint
defaultaining their level of spending on winter resilience despite general budget cuts. The review found evidence of cooperation between adjacent and intertwined county, district and parish councils; and that this activity was underpinned by improved consultation
default with local communities and better communications with the media and the public.
default&#xa0;
default2.10default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe report highlights where progress has been made and stated that ‘the valuable initiative and work of the National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG) should be brought under the wing of the UKRLG’.  Many local highway authorities 
defaulthave reviewed salt sp
defaultread rates. F
defaultollowing the issue of the revised guidance from the UKRLG, 
defaultthere have been 
defaultsavi
defaultngs in the volumes of salt used. LHA’s are now
default applying salt at rates that are appropriate to varying circumstances. In practice, some of the salt saved has been re
defaultdirected into salt bins or salt bags, to support community efforts.
default&#xa0;
default2.11default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn 18 September 2013
default an updated Appendix H
default 
defaultto Well-maintained Highways 
defaultwas published.  This latest revision of Appendix H has been carried out under the direction of the NWSRG on behalf 
defaultof the UKRLG and UK
default 
defaultR
defaultoads 
defaultB
defaultoard
default using information from the NWSRG Practical Guide for Winter Service (Practical Guide) and NWSRG member organisations, as well as other recent winter service research and information.  The spread rate tables in this guidance should help assist Local Highwa
defaulty Authorities to adopt the most suitable, and efficient in usage terms, salt spreading levels.  
default&#xa0;
default2.12default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs noted at the start of Appendix H:  “The guidance and recommendations contained within Appendix H relate to national Best Practice and it is recognised that
default local circumstances, including financial and other resource constraints, as well as political influences etc. can vary widely across the country. Authorities and operators will need to take all of these factors fully into account, when devising and revisi
defaultng their Winter Service policies and plans. Some of the recommendations and practices will, if adopted, also take a number of years to implement. For example, it is recognised that, in certain cases it could potentially take up to around 10 years or so for
default a major programme of change to be fully implemented.”

default2.13.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

default2.15default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRail –default Resilience plans should continue to include contingencies for disruption to services, including the provision of rail replacement bus services where appropriate.  Network rail and train operating companies generally have these plans in place, but they wil
defaultl need to continue to work with local highway/transport authorities to ensure that plans remain robust.
default&#xa0;
default2.16default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAviationdefault 
default- defaultThe UK’s aviation industry has made improvements to its ability to deal with severe winter weather. 
defaultSince 2009-10 Heathrow has invested £50 
defaultmillion in snow and ice clearance equipment and increased staff numbers available for snow clearance and Gatwick has invested a further £8million.  The Civil Aviation Act 2012 gave the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) powers for a new licensing regime, inclu
defaultding measures to ensure an airports operational resilience as a license condition (to come into force in 2014). The CAA has formalised its compliance monitoring team which is deployed at airport when there is major disruption to operations, monitoring and 
defaultensuring compliance with legislation on assisting passengers when flights are delayed or cancelled, with the powers to employ enforcement orders and penalties.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3. defaultHow well prepared are the Government, local authorities and transport providers for adversedefault winter weather? What more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?default&#xa0;
default3.1default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultoverall 
defaultmessage is that generally all sectors are better prepared than they were in the past but 
defaultthat all those involved in the delivery of a winter service
default shoul
defaultd not be comp
defaultlacent
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.2default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultRAC Foundation Report
default,
default 
defaultPloughing
default On
default,
default identifies some areas of concern and ma
defaultkes an important point that 
defaultthe travelling public should take more responsibility in terms their preparations particularly in making journeys in bad weather.
default  There 
defaultmay be a need 
defaultto place more responsibility on road users to ensure they are prepared for severe winter conditions. Many of our European neighbours have legisla
defaultted to ensure this is the case.  Public expectations can be un
defaultrealistic and the role of the media
default and now social media needs careful consideration. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3default&#xa0; 
defaultFurther research and improvements to guidance in the use of alternative treatment methods
default is required
default.
default Both Europe and North America 
defaultmake use of a suite of treatment methods and do not rely predominantly
default on the application of salt. While the UK climate tends to be mild in nature there is still much to be learnt from abroad.
default  The National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG) might benefit from this.
default&#xa0;
default3.4default&#xa0; 
defaultAs mentioned in
default point 
default1
default.2 above, CIHT has 
defaultconcerns about 
defaultreduced revenue funding
default to the sector (particularly Local Highway Authorities). This 
defaultmay 
defaultha
defaultve
default two effects:  firstly on day-to-day operations during a period of severe winter weather (and having sufficient  
defaultresources
default to address the situation)
default; secondly, a lack of funding 
defaultimpedes
default the ability to take on board some of the more significant changes required through capital investment.
default&#xa0;
default3.5default&#xa0; 
defaultCIHT would recommend that sufficient funding 
defaultcertainty 
defaultis provided to the transport sector to be able to ‘invest t
defaulto save’ to better manage winter resilience.  For instance new spreaders can optimise sal
defaultt usage (and thereby save cost), this would help authorities deliver on more significant change and improvements in the delivery of their winter service operations.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.6default&#xa0; 
defaultThe recognition that Highways incorporate footways and cycle
default 
defaultways is particularly relevant during periods of adverse weather and the recommendations of the Quarmby review are important in this regard. The needs of non-vehicular users and the clarity of adv
defaultice to householders to support the actions of local highway authorities in keeping footways clear is a continuing area for consideration. The role of funding from across government to reduce the amount of injury from slips and falls is a key area for furth
defaulter 
defaultdevelopment
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.7default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is essential that local highway authorities and bus operators work together to agree those    routes that will routinely be treated, and to clearly identify the routes or parts of routes where bus services may not operate in adverse con
defaultditions, with appropriate information being provided to customers.  This is particularly important in those areas, mainly the English metropolitan areas, where local highways and public transport are the responsibility of different authorities.
default&#xa0;
default3.8default&#xa0; 
defaultBus statio
defaultns are usually located away from 
defaultmajor 
defaultpublic highways, and therefore not necessarily on local authorities’ winter salting/gritting or snow clearance routes.  Most bus stations are owned and operated by the relevant local transport authority, and where thi
defaults is the same as the local highway authority it would be expected that winter treatment of bus stations would be part of the overall treatment strategy.  However, this may not always be the case in areas where local highways and public transport are the re
defaultsponsibility of different authorities, and in these areas it is crucial that the authorities work together on a strategy to ensure that bus stations and the relevant bus routes are properly treated in adverse winter conditions.  Some metropolitan transport
default authorities keep their own supply of road salt and salting vehicles for use in bus stations, but this 
defaultseems an unnecessary duplication of effort when the relevant highway authorities have their own equipment and materials, and could add bus stations to th
defaulteir winter treatment routes.
default&#xa0;
default3.9default&#xa0; 
defaultIn adverse winter conditions, it is often the case that local highway authorities will prioritise the treatment of roads, but give less attention, if any, to footways.  For car drivers and passengers this may cover all or almo
defaultst all of their journey, but for bus passengers clearly it will not.  All bus passengers will need to walk a certain distance at the start and finish of their bus journey, and they will be vulnerable to falls and injury if the footways aren’t appropriately
default treated.  Indeed, many passengers may not make the journey at all, if they have doubts about being able to negotiate footways at either or both ends of their bus journey.  In this respect, older and less able-bodied people are particularly vulnerable.  Th
defaultis should be picked up by local highway/transport authorities and bus operators in developing and implementing their winter resilience strategies.
default&#xa0;
default3.10default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt times of major disruption to transport operations associated with adverse winter conditions, the dissemin
defaultation of information to passengers is crucial, to allow them to decide on the options available to them for their journey, or in some cases not to travel at all.  Within their winter resilience strategy, local transport authorities must have systems and pr
defaultocedures in place to provide information to passengers, and they must of course be flexible enough to allow for ever-changing conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default3.11default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultRail – defaultPerhaps the main concerns are around electrified railways, where power supply issues can become critical in 
defaultheavy snow.  There are generally few problems with 25kV AC overhead power supply systems, but 750V DC third-rail systems, such as exist in SE England and Merseyside, can be seriously affected in heavy snow falls, causing substantial disruption to services.
default  The longer-term solution is for third-rail systems to be converted to overhead power supply, but this would be expensive, and probably difficult to justify whilst the frequency of serious winter events remains low.  However, the rail industry will need t
defaulto continue to work on ensuring that third-rail systems are as resilient as possible.
default&#xa0;
default3.12default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNetwork Rail and train operating companies are usually very good at providing information for their customers when services are disrupted, but as previously identified, t
defaulthis flow of information must be part of an integrated information strategy, covering all transport modes.  In most situations where rail services are disrupted, e.g. for rail engineering works, train operators will provide rail replacement bus services.  T
defaulthis would probably not be possible where the disruption is caused by heavy snow, potentially leaving passengers stranded with no alternative transport.
default&#xa0;
default3.13default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs for bus services, it is important that rail stations and their environs, and at least the main pedes
defaulttrian routes to/from stations, are kept clear of snow and ice.  The 2009/10 winter weather showed that many passengers were reluctant to travel on snow-cleared rail routes where their walking routes at either end of the rail journey were hazardous.  It is 
defaultcrucial that all relevant agencies work together in developing and implementing robust resilience plans that consider the whole-journey implications for the population.
default&#xa0;
defaultConcluding remarksdefaultThe recognition of winter maintenance as a fundamental part of 
defaultcustomer services across transport networks has improved since the difficulties after 2009. We believe our comments will lead to the highways and transportation sector continuing to deliver improvements in dealing with an uncertain future scenarios
default.
