"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Roger Farrow [FBB0047]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\nThis submission claims that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.0 Introduction&#xa0;\n1.1 This submission is made by Roger Farrow, retired NHS manager, \nin a personal capacity \nto express his profound dissatisfaction with the BBC and to press for:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.0 Current status of the BBC&#xa0;\n2.1 The BBC is\n, allegedly,\n the\n \nlargest broadcaster in the world\n \nin terms of staff employed\n. \n \nIt is an anachronism, grown \nto its current \ndominan\nt size\n \nthanks to\n \nnearly 70 years \nof\n generous\n income derived \nmostly \nfrom a TV\n/radio\n licen\ns\ning system enforced by the criminal law.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 The huge siz\ne of the BBC \nis\n inappropriate in the digital age\n since its function can be achieved in \ncheaper, \nmore flexible and fairer ways\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.0 Market dominance by the BBC&#xa0;\n3.1 \nIt is suggested that a\npproximately 70% of the \nUK\n population\n \nstill \nget most of their news from television and approximately 7\n0\n% of those viewers use the BBC.\n \nIf true, t\nhis market dominance is unhealthy\n and\n does not \nencourage diversity of journalistic viewpoints.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n T\nhe BBC \nalso \nh\nas a large and powerful website where \nentertainment and \ninformation are \noffered\n free. Private sector \nmedia companies\n find it difficult to establish pay to view websites in the face of this \nunfair \ncompetition.\n&#xa0;\n4.0 Accountability of the BBC&#xa0;\n4.1 \nRecent\n scandals such as the Jimmy \nSavile\n affair, \nLonely Planet sell off, \nNewsnight\n blunders, excessive \nsenior staff\n pay offs and the Digital Master Index fiasco, demonstrate the BBC to be an inward looking\n, self\n-\nserving\n \nand complacent \norganisation that is out of touch with its customers.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.2 \nThe t\nheoretical accountability\n of the BBC\n to the public \nis \nmeaningless\n \nbecaus\ne it\n leaves\n \nTV \nlicence fee payer\ns\n without \nthe option of “voting with their feet\n”\n.\n  \nThe BBC\n \nsimply\n \ntells \nindividual \ncomplain\nants\n that their concerns\n have been noted\n.\n In other words, they \nhave\n become a \nmere \nstatistic\n with \nno\n hope of \nbringing about change \nwithin the BBC\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 The only \npractical \nway that TV licence \nfee payers\n can \nhold\n the BBC \nto \naccount is to \nbe \nable\n to take their m\noney \nelsewhere \nand spend it with another \nbroadcaster\n. \nIn the 21\nst\n century, t\nhis is \na\n sanction that any \ncustomer \nof a \nbroadcasting \nservice should be able to deploy. \n&#xa0;\n4.4 Approximately 10% of all criminal charges\n in the \nUK\n \narise from\n the \nprosecution of viewers who do not wish to pay the TV licence fee.  Th\nis\n use of the criminal law is uniquely punitive in the \nmedia market\n because the TV licence fee is effectively a tax\n. \nThe BBC should move \nwithout delay \nto a\n subscription service which \ncan \nsimply \nbe\n withdrawn if a subscriber fails to keep up payments.\n&#xa0;\n5.0 Dangers of market dominance by the BBC&#xa0;5.1\n The dominant \nsize\n of the BBC stifles\n the \nUK\n media market\n and\n poses a threat to democracy\n.  T\nhe\n BBC, just like every other \nmedia organisation\n,\n is guilty of\n \nbias\n and\n \nspin\n. \nI\nt is\n therefore\n vital that \nUK\n \ncitizens have a wide choice of broadcasters and internet \nsources\n to choos\ne from.  \nThis\n enables citizens to\n detect \ninstitutional \nbias by \ncompar\ning\n and \ncross referenc\ning\n \nnot just \nthe coverage of news items\n and current affairs but also\n \nthe depiction of political \nissues\n \nembedded \nwithin \nall broadcast subjects\n e\n.\ng\n.\n comedy\n,\n drama\n and history programmes\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.0 Public service broadcasting&#xa0;\n6.1 The current scale of public service broadcasting is inappropriate in the digital age.  There is no\n longer any\n justification for funding popular entertainment programmes from a\n flat rate\n \nTV \nlicensing system enforced by the criminal law. The media market should be used to\n fund these \npopular \nprogrammes through voluntary subscriptions.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 The scope and quantity of public service broadcasting should be reviewed\n.  Fixed term contracts for public\n service\n \nbroadcasting should then be allocated by a public broadcasting authority to a\n range of\n reputable broadcaster\ns who are \nwilling to provide content that the market \nwill not fund.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 Public service broadcasting should be funded from general taxation\n at a level agreed annually by Parliament.\n&#xa0;\n7.0 Conclusion&#xa0;7\n.1 The \nubiquity of digital television\n \nand the\n \nincreasing use of the internet\n require a new paradigm of public service broadcasting.  \n&#xa0;\n7.2 \nT\nhe BBC \nshould\n be\n treated just like any other broadcaste\nr and required to obtain its income from a combination of fixed term contracts for public service broadcasting and voluntary subscriptions for \npopular \nentertainment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDece\nmber 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
