defaultThe British Dermatological Nursing is a professional membership organisation representing nurses working within dermatology.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
defaultMany dermatological conditions are long term and the impact of living with these conditions can be devastating both physically and psychologically on the patient. Whilst conditions such as psoriasis and eczema are fairly common in the population, there are many dermatological conditions that are rare and therefore require more specialised care.
default&#xa0;
defaultDermatology nurses are a key component to any service. They provide a wide range of treatments as well as running 
defaultnurse led services providing support and education to patients with common chronic dermatological condition. 
defaultIn many instances, clinical nurse specialists work autonomously providing care and management of patients with chronic dermatological conditions. 
defaultMany nurses are now non medical prescri
defaultbers enabling them to diagnose
default 
defaultand prescribe a treatment plan in conjunction with the patient.
default 
defaultThis provides a time efficient service to patients and also frees up consultants time.
default&#xa0;
defaultNurses ar
defaulte trained to care for people holistically not just treating a disease or condition. We have the 
defaultinnate 
defaultability to work with the patient to determine treatment plans that fit into the patient’s life whilst acknowledging the patient’s limitations and other constrai
defaultnts on their time. Nurses can often 
defaultoffer longer patient appointment times
default in order to undertake 
defaultpatient education and practical demonstration
default in relation to topical dermatological treatments. This education and practical support is key to improving adherence to treatment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNurses have the ability to build up a rapport with patients and often patients feel more relaxed with nurses and therefore offer a more realistic account of their condition and treatment. Good communication is a key skill for any nurse
default. We are trained to focus our care on the whole patient and can very successfully co-ordinate care and treatment that fits into the patient’s life outside of the disease.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll nurses should work within their own competence.
default 
defaultBuilding up skills and competence takes time and supervision. Dermatological care cannot be learnt solely by reading a textbook or attending a course. It also involves working with expert nurses and consultants clinically to
default develop the high levels of knowledge, skills and competency required to practice safely and 
defaultto provide quality patient outco
defaultmes
default.
default 
defaultPeer support is very important and dermatology nurses rely heavily upon our consultant colleagues to provide this support particularly in relation to complex
default or less common conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur recent workforce survey identified that dermatology nursing is primarily practised in secondary care with only pockets of dermatology nursing identified in primary care throughout England (1). The British Dermatological Nursing Group believes that local nursing services in primary care are already overwhelmed and therefore not in a position to take on the management and care of this large population of patients with long term dermatological conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultNurses in primary care provide care for a wide range of conditions and therefore do not at present have the skills and competencies in dermatological care.
default They cannot be considered experts in a range of conditions. 
defaultFurthermore, they cannot be expected to be experts in dermatology if they have never had 
defaulthigh level 
defaultexposure to the speciality.
default&#xa0;
defaultDermatology is not high on the agenda for undergraduate nurse training and many nurse
defaults
default never experience the specialty during their training. Inpatient dermatology 
defaultdepartments were the breeding 
defaultground for the many expe
defaultrt dermatology nurses of today when numerous student nurses had placements within these units.
default 
defaultWhilst we acknowledge that large inpatient departments are no longer cost effective in modern healthcare, we question how nurses will be able to gain exposure to dermatology when services are fragmented across a range of healthcare providers.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn times of dermatology service reconfiguration over the years, nurses have been instrumental in service innovations to continue to provide a quality patient centred service. Day treatment dermatology services and nursing liaison posts to bridge the gap between primary and secondary care are excellent examples of how nurses have adapted to 
defaultthis change. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur main concern is that primary care nursing services are not ready to take on the care of this large group of patients and that patient care 
defaultand experience 
defaultwill be compromised if investment is not available to develop the nursing component of a primary care based dermatology service.
default The existing primary care nursing workforce needs exposure to dermatology and the support from 
defaultemployers to do so. Community based 
defaultservice providers need to 
defaultbuild in a 
defaultrobust 
defaultnursing component into a dermatology service
default in order to sustain the service and meet quality standards and guidelines
default 
defaultfor dermatological treatment and care of patients with skin conditions
default. 
defaultPrimary care dermatology services will require audit against these frameworks. 
defaultNurses however should not be viewed as a cheaper alternative to dermatologists but a valuable resource in a multidisciplinary team.
