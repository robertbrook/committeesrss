[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Annex 1 – BT’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): Introduction section]]]&#xa0;For the Internet to operate in a manner that satisfies the majority of its users, all users need to observe some rules and behaviours governing their use of it. These requirements are usually contained or referred to in the relevant terms and conditions governing the particular Internet service as well as the law.&#xa0;To enable its customers to have a better understanding of what is and is not acceptable when using the Internet, and to help you get the best out of the Internet, BT has developed a number of Acceptable Usage Policies. These policies should help you benefit from safer surfing and minimise the risk of suffering "online abuse".&#xa0;We have also included some general advice on how to protect you and your computer to each of these policies which we encourage you to follow.&#xa0;

[[[Illegal and inappropriate activities]]]&#xa0;As an Internet user, whilst connected to the Internet via BT you must comply with the relevant laws that apply in the UK. You should also be mindful of the fact that the Internet is a global medium and is regulated by the laws of many different countries. Material which is legal in this country may be illegal in another and vice versa.&#xa0;These are some of the things that you must not do whilst connected to the Internet:You must not, by using the service, download, possess or transmit in any way, illegal material (for example indecent images of children).&#xa0;You must not send, publish, distribute, circulate or otherwise propagate any material that may be deemed to be grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene nature or menacing in character.&#xa0;You must not send, with the intention of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety a message that you know to be false, or to cause such a message to be sent or to persistently make use of our service for that purpose.&#xa0;You must not gain or attempt to gain unauthorised access to any computer systems for any purpose, including accessing the Internet.&#xa0;You must not, without authorisation intentionally impair or attempt to impair the operation of any computer, prevent or hinder access to any program or data held in any computer or to impair the operation of any such program or the reliability of any such data (this could include deleting files, changing the desktop settings introducing viruses etc.).&#xa0;You must not infringe the rights of others, including the right of privacy and copyright (an example would be sharing without permission of the copyright owner protected material such as a music or video file).&#xa0;Many of these activities could result in legal action, a fine or a term of imprisonment or both.&#xa0;If you are in any doubt as to the legality of anything, take independent legal advice before proceeding.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[BT’s obligations]]]&#xa0;BT is obliged under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to disclose information to Law Enforcement Agencies and Public Authorities that are legally entitled to obtain such information. Similarly BT must comply with court orders to disclose information. In serious instances of abuse we may also notify the police or relevant law enforcement agency. BT cannot and does not monitor content of its’ customers webspace or content of chat rooms, instant messaging, email, newsgroup or indeed of any communications and therefore BT cannot and does not guarantee that all of these are free of illegal material or other content considered unacceptable by others including the Internet community.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Changes to the Acceptable Use Policies]]]&#xa0;We may change the Acceptable Usage Policies’ from time to time and will inform you on this website when we do so. To make the most of the guidance contained in the AUPs, please keep up to date with changes and look at them on a regular basis. We hope you will find them useful and informative. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Breaches of Acceptable Use Policies]]]&#xa0;Reports of breaches of these acceptable use policies by BT customers can be sent to abuse@bt.com. &#xa0;BT may operate systems to ensure compliance with these acceptable use policies, including without limitation network scanning and testing of open servers and mail relays.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
