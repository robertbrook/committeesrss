"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubmission from Harold Roger Lovegrove&#xa0;Support for Single register of Electrical Contractors&#xa0;Submission Summary :&#xa0;Personal DetailsMy name is \nHarold \nRoger Lovegrove.  I am an\n Inc\norporated Electrical Engineer, \nFellow of the Institution of Engineering Technology.  I have \nbeen \nin the electrical installation industry all of my working life: apprentice, electrician, contracts engineer, manager, managing director.   Consultant for \n25 years  specialis\ning\n in Inspection and \nT\nesting \nE\nlectrical \nI\nnstallations\n, \ninvestigating electrical installation problems \nand p\nroviding electrical installation condition reports\n.  Also I provide \nexpert witness \nservices and \nreports.   \n&#xa0;\nReasons for supportI strongly support the need of a single electrical safety register as launched by the ECA and the ESC for electrical contractors operating in the domestic and commercial / industrial electrical installation market place for the following reasons:\n&#xa0;\nThe regi\nster will be of great \nbenefit to consumers, clients and specifiers as a single \nreference \npoint to  source a competent electrical contractor.\n&#xa0;\nI have found many installations that are sub-standard and many with dangerous conditions.\n&#xa0;\nInvariably the cause ha\ns been incompetence of the installer: poor workmanship; a lack of technical knowledge; non-compliance with Wiring Regulations, BS 7671.\n&#xa0;\nBuilding Regulations Part PPrevious governments set up Part P of the Building regulations with the intention of improv\ning the saf\nety of electrical installations in dwellings.\n  \nPart P made it a legal requirement for electrical installation work in dwellings to comply with the BS7671\n:\n Requirements for Electrical Installations\n -\n The IE\nT\n Wiring Regulations.  Most competent el\nectrical contractors understand these regulations and \nthe \nPart P \nrequirement to\n be registered with a \n‘\ncompetence \npersons\n scheme provider\n’\n.\n \nHence in the main Part P \nwas welcomed by electrical contractors.\n&#xa0;\nThe requirements of Part P were originally fairly \nr\nestrictive for non-electrical persons and DIY installers to undertake electrical installation work.  In my view Part P has been very effective. It has improved competence in the industry and made DIYer’s more aware of the dangers electricity can create in \ntheir homes.  The downside that Building \nControl \nDepartments have been unable to adequately police the system.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n 2011 revision to Part P\n has watered down the technical requirements of Part P, also \nit \nnow permits electrical installation work to be carrie\nd out by unqualified persons providing the work is checked and certified by a competent third party.  This part of the revision is not yet in operation as there are no third party competent person schemes yet in operation. Until \nthere is, \nhome safety standards \nare likely  \n to drop back to pre-2005 standards\n and the door is open again for Rogue traders and DYEers\n&#xa0;\n Competent Persons Scheme Operators.At the onset of Part P there wer\ne\n \nsix or seven s\ncheme operators. Some of which have been in \nplace for many years enabling contractors to register voluntarily.  Some schemes typically NICEIC\n are\n well known in the construction \nindustry\n also to Local Authorities and Housing Associations etc.\n&#xa0;\nBecause there are so many different \nscheme \noperators each\n having their own rules and criteria, standards and qualifying requirements are wide and varied.  Some of the operators provide training courses to their own standards and specifications\n. T\nhere is no common denominator.\n \nAlso t\nhere needs to be a common appr\noach to training \nnot only to \ncontractors \nbut the \ntrainers\n who train them.\n \n&#xa0;\nMost scheme operators are monitored by UKAS but this does not necessarily mean that there is a common standard or common procedures in place.\n&#xa0;\nCompetition between \nscheme \noperators means that standards vary.  \nI understand that s\nome operators \nmay\n only carry out a ‘desk top’ assessment of an applicant whereas others will insist on \nalways \nvisiting the contracto\nr’\ns premises, \nto \nexamin\ne\n the business\nes\n procedures\n, documentation a\nnd equipment,\n \nprior to inspecting some of the contractor’s on-site installation work.\n&#xa0;\nDiscipline is another issue.  It is not uncommon for a contractor who has been removed from a register for bad work or other serious non-conformity to become registered \nwith another scheme operator almost immediately without any reference being made to the original operator’s reasons for removal.\n&#xa0;\nI have seen a contractor advertising registration \nwith two scheme operators. When questioned I was informed that he was given \nregistration by the second operator in order to promote their scheme. \n  \n&#xa0;\nFrom the foregoing it can be seen that the present situation with a number of scheme operators having various standards is most unsatisfactory from not only a safety perspective but also for public perception of the effectiveness of the Part P legislation.  I therefore submit that it is of paramount importance for there to be a single ‘not for profit’ scheme provider monitored by UKAS rather than a number of operators working to their own agenda and possible profitability.&#xa0;\n30 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;\n"
