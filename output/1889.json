"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Kirklees Council (CLC059)&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary &#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn August 2013, Kirklees Council was invited to provide evidence t\no the Ho\nuse of Commons Science and\n Technology Select Committee relating to its experience of the public’s understanding of climate change. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKirklees Council\n is a \nmetropolitan\n borough\n of \nWest Yorkshire\n, Eng\nland. It has a population of approximately 423\n,000\n, making Kirklees one of the larger local authority districts in England and Wales (ranking eleventh out of 348 districts). Kirklees has approximately 175,000 households, 116,000 (67%) of which are owner occupied. \nAround 39% of the energy used in Kirklees \nis for domestic purposes\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKirklees Council has long been committed to tackling climate change, particularly by reducing domestic carbon emissions. \nOver the last 10 years the Council has attracted circa £38m of external funding which has provided subsidie\ns for energy improvements to homes. The Council has also contributed \nc \n£\n18 million\n \ncapital match funding to deliver energy improvements. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKirklees was the first Local Authority to develop and deliver the award winning \nWarm Zone scheme\n (2007–\n2010)\n,\n which w\nas open to all residents and\n where over 51,000 households received free loft and cavity wall insulation.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPost Warm Zone projects have included:  \n&#xa0;\n1.5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKirklees BIG Energy Upgrade (2010-2012)Kirklees\n work\ned\n with local authorities and registered social land\nlords (RSLs) across Yorkshire to tackle whole house, whole community energy efficiency upgrades on hard to treat homes.  \nThis project wa\ns supported financially by the European Union. It attracted £7million investment from the European Regional Development \nFund as part of Europe’s support for the region’s economic development through the Yorkshire and Humber ERDF Programme 2007-\n13.\n \n£1million \nwas \nsecured for Kirklees\n, \nand \n250 properties \nhad\n e\nxternal solid wall insulation i\nnstalled\n. S\nome properties also \nreceiv\ned\n \nseveral other measures to deliver a whole house\n,\n whole community approach to energy efficiency\n which\n improv\ned\n the health and wellbeing of the local residents.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRE-Charge (2008-2011)The £2.7m 3 year Council investment programme helped 281 private households \nacross \nKirklees, install 296 renewable energy generating technologies. \n \nIt attracted £260K of external funding and prepare\nd\n households to benefit from the Renewable Heat Incentive \n(\nRHI\n)\n and/or \nFeed-in Tariff (\nFIT\n)\n, pre-empting the Green Deal.   \n&#xa0;1.5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHillhouse Greening the Gap (2010)Kirklees Council was successful in securing £500,000 from DECC’s Low Carbon Communities Challenge Fund\n (LCCC)\n.\n \n53 private sector houses and 4 community cen\ntres in the Hillhouse area of Huddersfield had solar PV installed for free, plus other energy saving measures to improve the energy efficiency of the properties.\n \nIncome generated from the Feed in Tariff is being invested in the community.\n To date this inco\nme amounts to £58k.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnergy Efficiency in Kirklees Council homes (ongoing)Kirklees Council owns ~23,000 \ndomestic \nproperties which are managed by Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing.  The council and KNH have made significant investment in energy efficiency measures through ‘Decent Homes’ budgets and targeted energy budgets. Measures include gas boiler replacements, loft i\nnsulation top ups, external wall insulation, ground source heat pumps, solar thermal hot water, solar photo voltaic and \na \nbiomass boiler. \nThis investment has dramatically improved the energy efficiency of our homes, increased the average SAP rating to 72.4\n, reduced our carbon emissions by 23% since 2005, helped tackle fuel poverty and created local jobs and a skilled supply chain.  \n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEach project has required a separate communications plan and approach to marketing. The reference to climate change has varie\nd across each project.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nthe Council’s experience\n, the level of understanding of climate change and the science behind it is \ngenerally \ngood among our \nresidents. \n \nIn 2010 we conducted a Greener Living Survey which found that\n 95% of survey respondents believed that the world’s climate is ch\nanging\n, and \n74% said that their everyday actions con\ntributed to climate change. \n86% \nof respo\nndents\n also\n \nagreed that climate change would have an impact on Kirklees in the next 50 years\n, and i)\n \ns\naving money,\n ii)\n convenience/services making it easy\n,\n and \niii) \nhealth benefits were \nthe \nsurvey respondents' top three motivations to live a greener lifest\nyle\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUtilising these survey results, w\ne are keen to lead the way as a Council by showing our residents that we are investing in measures to tackle climate change but that will also help individ\nuals financially and in terms of \nhealth\n benefits\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContext / Rationale&#xa0;\n3.1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe know that the policies, strategies and services \nthat we develop and deliver\n \nas a Council \nhave an impact upon the environment and that we have an opportunity to shape a more sustainable fu\ntu\nre to improve people’s lives. \nThe climate is changing, so we must adapt and be prepared for the challenges ahead.\n The Government’s Stern Review in 2006 \nconcluded that the benefits of strong, early action on climate change far o\nutweigh the costs of not acti\nng.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has committed to challenging greenhouse gas reduction targets via the 2008 Climate Change Act\n. As a Local Authority we have a part to play in helping the UK achieve these challenging targets in our role as community leader, service provider\n, \ne\nstate manager\n and role model.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn June 2010 we made a commitment to protect the environment and reduce CO\n2\n as part of the Kirklees Partnership Charter and our Vision commits us to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of Kirklees.\n&#xa0;3.1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010, the Council approved \nits\n Integrated Investment Strategy (IIS). This strategy is a framework for investment which sets out the priorities for how the Council will allocate its resources and attract external investment to improve the lives of all Ki\nrklees residents. One of the strategic aims is\n for a district better prepared to manage the effects of climate change –\n setting out a clear 40% carbon emissions reduction target by 2020 for both the Council and the District, from a 2005 baseline.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThe 201\n1 Leeds City Region Mini-Stern Review, focussed on the economics of decarbonising the local economy.  A separate appendix was prepared on the Kirklees economy, which identified that: \n3.1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn\n response to this, \nKirklees Council became an early signatory to Climate Local. Climate Local is a new initiative led by the Local Government Association LGA) to drive, inspire and support council action on climate change. It succ\needs the Nottingham Declaration on Climate Change (\nof \nwhich Kirklees Council \nwas also a signatory\n) by offering a framework that enables councils to reflect local priorities and opportunities for action. Climate Local focuses on councils’ efforts both to re\nduce carbon emissions and to improve their resilience to the anticipated changes in the climate\n.\n3.1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn December 2012 the Council approved a set of \n‘\nClimate Local Commitments\n’\n for\n Kirklees to stimulate a green economy and create jobs, \nhelp \ntackle climate chang\ne and provide affordable warmth for our residents, building on achievements to date\n. \nThere are six key headline c\nommitments \nas outlined below:\nCreating local jobs in the green sector and ensuring we have the appropriate skill\ns for a low carbon economy\nContinue to aim to provide affordable warmth and tackle fuel poverty. This will help improve the health and wellbeing of Kirklees residents\nLeading by example through the efficient use of energy and water\n in our buildings, street lighting and fuel use by fleet vehicles\nIncreasing greener transport and transport connectivity in Kirklees, \nthus\n \nreducing \ntransport \nrelated carbon emissions.\n Developing future plans to reduce waste and maximise diversion from landfill.\nDeli\nvering a setting for investment, \nmaximising biodiversity and reducing costs.\n&#xa0;\n3.2&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2013/14 Climate Local Capital Projects 3.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorking with businesses – the Kirklees Business Environment Voucher scheme (£250k)This scheme \nprovide\ns\n a\n \n5\n0% \ngrant \nfor Kirklees b\nusiness\nes\n for pr\nojects that will help reduce \nenergy, waste and water costs. \nThis project helps Kirklees businesses save money, stimulates\n the local \neconomy \nby \nsupport\ning local suppliers and installers to implement the measures\n, and \nreduces district carbon emissions.\n \n3.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorking with the public - Completion of Kirklees Energy Saver Scheme and Kirklees Energy Saver 2 (£400k)The Council secured £576K from the Government (Department of Energy and Climate Change) \nas part of a Green Deal pil\not initiative \nto deliver a scheme called Kirklees Energy Saver.\n \nThe\n scheme was launched in January 2013 to home owners and offered free energy assessments and interest free loans or grants via utility - Energy Company Obligation (ECO) - funding. The loans \nand grants are to install energy saving measures such as boilers, wall insulation, glazing and loft insulation.\n \nThe scheme focused on 10 target areas which were already ‘warmed up’ due to the programme of work \npreviously \ncarried out on Council housing\n in t\nhe areas\n.  \nThe scheme will help over 300 home owners install energy saving measures in their homes via a grant or a loan.\nThe \nKirklees Energy Saver 2 (KES2)\n project will build on the success of the Kirklees Energy Saver scheme (KES1) which has been\n \nover-su\nbscribed.\n It \nwill also offer specific support to the most vulnerable residents in Kirklees. There will be an offer of a home visit to provide advice and support and funding for heating r\nepairs and other energy saving\n measures, with\n referrals to partner org\nanisations\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWork to reduce carbon emissions across the Council (£350k)This programme will deliver a \nrange of \nenergy/carbon reduction projects to reduce the Council’s energy costs and carbon emissions, and help us meet our 40% carbon reduction target by\n 2020. \nThese include continued investment in LED traffic lights, upgrading car park lighting and energy efficiency measures \nwithin council\n buildings.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Kirklees, the last decade has seen a number of changes in the way the authority addresses climate change issues and communicates with the public. Initially, resources were focussed on \nraising awareness of \nclimate change \nthrough the Council’s ‘Green Ambi\ntion’ environmental \nprogramme, \nand explaining the scientific argument to engage people in the broader consequence of rising temperatures and what they could do at an individual level. This was in line with national media and communicating the findings from\n key research such as the Stern Report. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs time progressed, and council priorities \nevolved\n, messages which were originally about ‘tackling climate change’ became focussed on \nreducing carbon emissions. Generally speaking, the message that climate change i\ns real and happening\n is to an extent \nunderstood and accepted, and the focus moved to reducing the key cause of climate change – carbon emissions. This mirrored local authority data collection requirements such as those set out in Local Area Agreements and \nNational Indicators (185 and 186). \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nost recently, \nduring\n the economic downturn, communication with the public on matters concerning climate change \nhas\n \ncentred on\n \nfinance, fuel poverty, related health issues, and job creation. \nFor example, using less ener\ngy in the home has been promoted as a means of mitigating the impact of income reduction from other areas such as the Welfare Reform.\n \nWith dramatic reductions in\n council resources to support this agenda\n (both in staffing levels and available investment fun\nding), p\nrojects are progressed\n where inward investment is generated\n reducing pressure on council capital and ensuring best value for money is achieved.  \n \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Council’s current \nprojects\n \naimed at \nthe public are \nthe \nKirklees Energy Saver\n Scheme\n and a recent\n collective energy switch. Both schemes are aimed at supporting the residents of Kirklees to \nreduce their home energy bills and meet the Council’s key objectives of \nreducing fuel poverty and providing affordable warmth. They have both been \ncommunicated \neffectively via the following routes:\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLearning from projects has demonstrated that people have been motivated to participate in schemes for a variety of reasons. \nFinancial benefits alone are in many cases unlikely to drive behaviour change; we have seen that the impact of tackling areas street by street is incredibly powerful in stimulating uptake via word of mouth and seeing neighbours take up an offer. Additional\nly, taking a scheme door to door increases uptake due to the trust in the Council brand and reassurance that contractors have been through a robust selection process.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA recent development while delivering work via the Kirklees Energy Saver Scheme has been\n a sudden drop in ECO funding by the energy supplier for external wall insulation. This has led to difficult communication with affected Kirklees residents, and demonstrates the challenge Councils face in maintaining trust while being vulnerable to externa\nl market influences.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKirklees has evidenced its extensive track record of delivering home energy efficiency projects across the district. The success of each project has involved key partners – with functions ranging from the provision of funding, to installation of physical m\neasures. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGoing forward, the council is a committed partner in the Leeds City Region and associated ‘City Deal’ and recognises that this is an effective way to engage and co-operate with our partner authorities and private sector\n for the benefit of reside\nnts\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome key examples of current projects where other Local Authorities and/or Government bodies have been engaged are outlined below. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCollective Energy Switch Between February and May 2013, \nCommunity Energy Direct (CED - a Community Benefit \nIndustrial &amp; Provident Society) conducted a collective energy tariff switch\n as a Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC)-funded partnership project. Project partners were Kirklees, along with Bradford, Leeds, Wakefield and York local authorities, Ro\nchdale Borough Housing, Fresh Horizons and Wakefield District Housing.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKirklees Energy SaverVia a joint bid with Leeds City Council, \nKirklees \nsuccessfully secured £718k \nfrom the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) \nto deliver a \ngreen deal \npilot\n programme across Kirklees. This will help secure a further circa £425K Energy Company funding (ECO) into Kirklees. The total funding for t\nhe pilot is £1.393M which \ninclude\ns Council capital of £150k.\n A managing agent and contractor have been procured to de\nliver this project, with close links to an energy supplier.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeeds City Region Green Deal Kirklees Council is part of the Leeds City Region collaborative approach to procure a Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation funding and delivery partner\n. Working \nalongside the ten other Local Authorities in the region, Kirklees is providing valuable input to the scheme which aims to be available for all residents in the city region from April 2014. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClimate Local NetworkAs a Climate Local signatory, Kirklees is r\nepresented at all Climate Local events organised by the Local Government Association and often shares best practice with other Local Authorities. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKirklees is one local authority that has built up trust with its residents\n \nthrough\n their work on climate change, and gained a national reputation and acknowledgement of its good work. We should be supported to continue this communication with the public.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authorities have a lot of learning to share regarding how best to \nengage with the public\n on climate change and the local and practical problems and successes of delivery\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe financial and health impacts of climate change are \namong \nthe key motivators for the public to change their behaviour \nand live a greener lifestyle\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCollaborative working and larger scale projects \nwith other Local Authorities \nhave attractive economies of scale, especially in the current climate of diminishing resources.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn contrast, local authority work on \nthe \nclimate change \nagenda \nis at risk in vie\nw of the current \n(and ongoing) \nbudget\nary\n \nconstraints\n, and the unreliable and unstable utility ECO funding situation.\n&#xa0;\n6.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBehaviour change activities are extremely resource intensive – where possible, local authorities should be enabled to continue improving h\nome energy efficiency \nwith physical measures \nto reduce domestic carbon emissions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The UK \nClimate Change Act 2008\n&#xa0;\nsets\n legally binding carbon emission reduction targets for 2020 (reduction of\n&#xa0;\n34%\n&#xa0;\nin greenhouse gas emissions) and for\n&#xa0;\n2050 (reduction of\n&#xa0;\nat least 80%\n&#xa0;\nin greenhouse gas emissions) from 1990 levels, and introduced five-\nyearly \ncarbon budgets\n to help ensure those targets are met.  In \nJune \n2011 the Government \nset in law\n its fourth Carbon Budget to reduce emissions 50% under 1990 levels by 2025.\n \nFurther information can be found at www.lowcarbonfutures.org/low-carbon-cities\n"
