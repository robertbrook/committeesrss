[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]TalkTalk[bold] [OLS0085][bold]Summary [bold]1.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the first internet company to introduce a whole home parental control solution, 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] welcomes the Committee’s Inquiry into Online Safety. We firmly believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of the internet, but that as an ISP we have a duty to provide our customers with simple and effective tools to ensure that they are able to search, download and 
[normal]utilise
[normal] the internet in as safe a way as possible, especially when it comes to parents wanting to help protect their children online. 
[normal]1.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] is currently the only ISP in the UK to offer a whole home parental controls system that protects every device connected to the home broadband. Built into the broadband network itself, 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] gives families the ability to control the types of websites they want their household to access across all devices using the connection and restrict access to content like pornography, gambling, and suicide and self-harm. 
[normal]So far over 1.2 million homes are using 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal], and of these 400,000 have chosen to activate parental controls. In March 2012, we launched so called active or unavoidable choice for all new customers signing up to broadband and in June of this year, we extended this to existing customers and began the process of asking all our existing customers to make a choice about using parental controls. 
[normal]1.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]1 in 3 customers – roughly equivalent to the number of UK homes with children in – are choosing to use filtering when presented with a choice.  Whilst much of the debate on internet safety has focused on children accessing pornography, suicide and self-harm remains the biggest category that customers are choosing to block, followed by pornography which is then followed narrowly by weapons and violence. This reflects the range of concerns that parents have when it comes to their child’s safety online and indeed many of their concerns aren’t about accessing inappropriate content, but are behavioral such as cyber bullying, 
[normal]sexting
[normal] and grooming. 
[normal]1.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When it comes to filtering, our research shows our customers like being asked to make a choice – 80% think it’s a good thing and 60% wouldn’t have activated controls if they hadn’t been prompted. We support this approach and believe that it is critical that parents make an engaged decision, appropriate to their individual family, about the use of filtering tools. We would never filter access to content that is legal (even if it is age-restricted) unless our customers asked us to. 
[normal]Parents should make the decision as part of their approach to helping keep their children safer online.
[normal]1.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a member of the IWF, 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] does take the IWF list and voluntarily block this at network level so none of our customers can access websites that they have identified to contain illegal child abuse images. In the summer, we – and other ISPS – also implemented a new form of wording on the block pages to act as a stronger deterrent. We are also big supporters of the IWF’s move to proactive detection.  
[normal]1.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no silver bullet when it comes to internet safety, and much relies on education and awareness. 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] conducts extensive marketing and communications to customers about 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] and internet safety and we have also partnered with the likes of the 
[normal]The
[normal] Parent Zone, Girl Guiding UK and the UK Safer Internet Centre on various educational initiatives. 
[normal]Along with other ISPs, we have committed to 
[normal]launch of a national, sustainable education campaign targeted at parents in the New Year.
[normal] 
[normal]1.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have long called for internet safety to be included in the Primary curriculum and we are really pleased that will be the case going forward. We think of internet safety as the road safety of our children’s generation, in that it required a range of different inventions including the Green Cross Code, air bags and mandatory seat belt wearing, and required us all to play our part. Internet safety requires the same approach where use of technical tools needs to be supported by awareness raising and education for parents and young people alike
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] shares the commonly held belief in the importance of protecting children online. The internet is an integral part of people’s lives now and has been transformational in terms of the benefits that it brings. However, as with life offline, there are unfortunately risks associated especially for children and young people and we believe we have a role to play in trying to protect them from harm.  
[normal]2.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] thinks of internet safety as the road safety of our children’s generation; it requires a range of different inventions, and the use of technical tools needs to be supported by awareness raising and education for parents and young people alike. We think technical tools have a really important role to play, but alone they will not solve the issue. We believe the most important thing a parent can do is take an active role and talk to their children about what they do online, and combine this with using controls as appropriate. 
[normal]HomeSafe[bold]2.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Back in May 2011, 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] introduced 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal], the UK’s first and still only whole home parental controls system that allows parents to protect every device connected to the home broadband and control the types of websites their family is able to visit. From our own customer research we found that parents want an easy to use system that allows them to activate their chosen filters across all devices with one click without having to do this separately on each device in the home. We also found that many parents found existing device level controls confusing and we developed 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] to fill that gap. 
[normal]2.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] has three simple features; Kids Safe, Virus Alerts and Homework Time. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The most commonly blocked categories are, in order, Suicide &amp; Self-Harm; Pornography; Violence &amp; Weapons; Dating; Drugs, Tobacco and Alcohol; Gambling; File-sharing; Gaming Websites; and Social Networking.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Asking our customers to make a choice  [bold]2.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In March 2012, 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] became the first internet service provider to introduce a genuine unavoidable choice for new customers when they signed up to 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] broadband, as per the recommendation of the Bailey Review. Customers are asked to make a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision as to whether they want to filter access to content that might be inappropriate for under 18s on their broadband connection or not. 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] then applies this to their internet connection as soon as 
[normal]its
[normal] live and no further action is required by the customer. If the customer wants this on, then Suicide and Self 
[normal]Harm
[normal]; Pornography; Weapons and Violence; Dating; Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco; and Gambling will be blocked. The settings can be easily changed at anytime through the customer’s online My Account facility. 
[normal]2.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the beginning of June of this year we extended this unavoidable choice to existing customers and began the process of asking all of our existing customers who haven’t yet engaged to make a choice about using Kids Safe filtering. We are doing this via the use of a pop-up screen when a customer who isn’t using parental controls logs into their My Account. As with new customers, they have to make a decision either way before they progress any further and access their My Account. We have already asked a million of our existing customers to decide about using Kids Safe. 
[normal]2.8.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We currently have 1.2 million customers who have activated 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] and over 400,000 customers have activated Kids Safe filtering. 1 in 3 customers are choosing to turn on Kids Safe when presented with an unavoidable choice. This is about equivalent to the number of households with children in and so we believe represents the level of uptake that one should expect, given that not all parents will want to use filtering but other customers, like grandparents or those who simply want to filter content out due to personal beliefs, might want to. 
[normal]2.9.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By the end of 2013 we will move to pre-ticking the ‘yes’ option, which we believe is a strengthening of our current position. It is incredibly important however to note that this does not constituent default blocking and all customers will still be asked to make a decision about filtering; we would not filter without them requesting it. We think it is critical that parents make an engaged, informed choice about whether or not they wish to use filtering as part of their approach to helping keep their children safer online. 
[normal]2.10.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our customers agree with this and our research shows they like being asked to make a choice. A survey of our customers found:
[normal]Closed feedback loop [bold]2.11.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are a number of safeguards in place to help ensure that children aren’t changing the settings without their parents’ knowledge.
[normal] 
[normal]Firstly, the initial set up is done during the sign up process for fixed line broadband where a customer will likely be credit checked, have to provide bank details and be arranging for a new broadband service to be installed/an existing service to be taken out. They are also entering into a 12 or 18 
[normal]month contract and our terms and conditions state our customers must be aged 18 or over. Secondly, the log in details for a customer’s My Account – where they make any subsequent changes to their 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] settings – are set up during the joining process by the account holder. At any time, from anywhere, the account holder can log in to My Account to check the status of their home’s filtering preferences. Every time a change is made to the settings an email is sent to the email address the account holder signed up with confirming the changes. Finally, every customer can also opt in for free additional notifications via SMS to their mobile. 
[normal]Over-blocking [bold]2.12.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We know that there are concerns about over-blocking of websites in relation to whole home filtering systems. Firstly we think it is really important to remember that filtering systems have been in place for years – they were just applied at the device level rather than at the network level. When it then comes to issues around inaccurate blocking, we think there are two key things; firstly obviously that the filtering technology itself is being constantly improved and refined, and secondly that there are clear reporting mechanisms which are 
[normal]actioned
[normal]. 
[normal]2.13.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In developing 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] we deliberately tried to take a more holistic approach to website 
[normal]categorisation
[normal] which looks at the website in its entirety – so for example an article on the BBC website which mentions pornography wouldn’t be blocked. Similarly, a website like Frank which offers advice for those suffering from drug addiction wouldn’t be blocked, whereas a website advising on how to make drugs would be. We think this is a more pragmatic approach. Clearly no technology is 100% perfect and so we continue to work to improve the filtering. We have clear reporting mechanisms, either directly via a large ‘report’ button on the block page itself or through a feedback form in the customer’s My Account. Website owners can also contact us via email. This enables us to address any issues of misclassification and also employ any learning to avoid other instances. The volume of this is respectively low and we aim to action reports within 5 days. 
[normal]2.14.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have also formed partnerships with a number of companies to either ‘white’ or ‘black’ list. Papyrus, the suicide prevention charity, provides us with a list of websites that promote suicide and we include those in the suicide and self-harm category. Similarly, we have an agreement with the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) to ensure that websites with content about lawful shooting interests aren’t blocked. 
[normal]              [bold]Marketing, advice and guidance [bold]2.15.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] is actively supported by comprehensive marketing and communications that aim to educate our customers about internet safety and the things they can do to help protect 
[normal]themselves
[normal] and their children online. We have a dedicated internet safety hub (talktalk.co.uk/security) that provides a wealth of guidance. This is currently being updated, including aligning with the UKCCIS guide on child internet safety – which we helped to develop. We also send regular communications about 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] and internet safety to our customers. Other marketing has included extensive television and outdoor advertising; we believe 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] is the only company to have advertised about child internet safety on television. We have also run dedicated security workshops for our customers in London and the key insights and advice from the day are then shared back to the rest of our customer base. For Safer Internet Day this year we ran an 
[normal]internet safety road show which visited 5 locations around the country and offered advice and guidance on internet safety to the public. 
[normal]2.16.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to the above, we run or are involved in a number of additional initiatives to educate and raise awareness about internet safety. We have been working with The Parent Zone to develop The 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] Family Challenge’, a three-term 
[normal]programme
[normal] of activity for schools to help them engage parents on child internet safety. Each term covers a specific theme – Digital Footprint, Digital Know How and Digital Living – and within each theme there are a range of topics covered for parents and teachers. The 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] Family Challenge is designed to get parents to engage with the issue and take action. Each theme will have a challenge associated with it to engage parents and encourage action, for example getting a certain number of parents to take the ‘
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] family challenge quiz’ with a prize for the school if they do. We have been trialing this with a number of schools and are now rolling this out to more schools across the UK. 
[normal]2.17.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] We have also partnered with Girl Guiding UK to help them redevelop their Computer badge for Brownies and as part of this will produce supporting educational materials on internet safety for both the Brownies and their volunteers as internet safety forms one of the elements of getting the Computer badge. This will be supported by a significant communications campaign about internet safety to the Brownies and their volunteers. 
[normal]2.18.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] We have also worked with The Parent Zone to develop a very simple guide to parental controls which has been sent to schools across the UK and is available for free download from their website, and also with the UK Safer Internet Centre to create and promote a video on setting up 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal]. 
[normal]2.19.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, along with the other ISPs, we have committed to 
[normal]launch of a national, sustainable education campaign targeted at parents in the New Year.
[normal] 
[normal]3.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Like other industry members, 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] takes a zero tolerance approach to illegal child abuse images online. Currently our efforts are focused on helping prevention. We are a longstanding member of the Internet Watch Foundation and pay the maximum membership fee. This summer we, along with the other ISPs, committed to a further £1m of funding for the IWF to continue its work in identifying illegal child abuse images on the internet. 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] also chaired the working group that supported the membership review of the IWF which has led to their move to proactively seeking out illegal child abuse images online in addition to following public reports.  
[normal]3.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We automatically download the block list of known websites containing illegal images from the IWF on a 
[normal]daily
[normal] basis, and apply it to our filtering system, which means that every customer is blocked from accessing those websites across the whole network. 
[normal]3.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Customers who try and access these websites are presented with a splash page informing them the content is blocked because it has been found to be illegal by the IWF. In the summer, a group comprising the IWF, CEOP and Lucy Faithful Foundation, a charity who work with offenders, agreed a new stronger set of wording that 
[normal]TalkTalk
[normal] implemented in August, along with the other three major ISPs. The wording is: 
[normal]Access has been denied by your internet access provider because this page may contain indecent images of children as identified by the Internet Watch Foundation.
[normal]Deliberate attempts to access this or related material may result in you committing a criminal offence.
[normal]The consequences of deliberately accessing such material are likely to be serious. People arrested risk losing their family and friends, access to children (including their own) and their jobs.

[normal] provide confidential and anonymous help to those with concerning or illegal internet use. They have helped thousands of people in this situation.

[normal]3.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] We also work closely with CEOP, and our Chief Executive sits alongside CEOP on the UKCCIS Board. We fully cooperate with their requests for information under RIPA and are currently in discussions about other ways in which we could support their work further. We signpost customers to their helpline via the ‘Report Abuse’ button that sits on our customer safety information centre. 
[normal]3.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We 
[normal]belive
[normal] the issue of extremist material and material intended to promote 
[normal]terroism
[normal] or acts of violence is 
[normal]predominatly
[normal] a matter for law 
[normal]enforcment
[normal] agencies and should be addressed via a joined up, multi-pronged approach to tackling extremism and 
[normal]terroism
[normal]. As an ISP we adhere to requests to remove content that has been found to be illegal under current UK legislation. This may include material found to be 
[normal]extremist
[normal] or material intended to promote 
[normal]terroism
[normal] or acts of violence. We are also in the process of 
[normal]finalising
[normal] an agreement with the Home Office to include their filtering list of known 
[normal]terroist
[normal] websites that breach Terrorism Act 2006 but that the policing Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit have been unable to get taken down, for example because they are hosted abroad. We intend to add this into our ‘weapons and violence’ category within 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal], so that our customers can choose to filter access if they want. 
[normal]4.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our own research supports that 
[normal]cyberbullying
[normal] is one of the main concerns for parents and children alike when it comes to the internet and it is clear that more needs to be done both to prevent 
[normal]cyberbullying
[normal] and support the victims. Predominantly however we believe that the issue of 
[normal]cyberbullying
[normal] is a 
[normal]behavioural
[normal] issue and therefore one that needs to be tackled through education, and then those websites owners and as 
[normal]oposed
[normal] to action we can take technically as an ISP. 
[normal]4.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] In terms of what we are able to do, 
[normal]we investigate any abusive or threatening comments, posted on sites by our customers when we are provided with the log information that supports the complaint.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In these cases where we can, we will identify the account and contact the account owner to make them aware of the complaint. We inform the customer that this action is undertaken because of a breach of our Terms and Conditions of supply. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Depending on the severity of the abuse, some cases may result in court action. In these instances, we would not contact the customer to make them aware, but we will disclose relevant data to the third party solicitor, on receipt of a fully sealed court order from a UK court. 
[normal]4.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We do provide customers with the option of blocking social media via 
[normal]HomeSafe
[normal] however we do not think that this solves or helps the issue of 
[normal]cyberbullying
[normal]. Our safety 
[normal]centre also includes a range of information about 
[normal]cyberbullying
[normal] for parents and we signpost to 
[normal]organisations
[normal] like 
[normal]BeatBullying
[normal] for further support.
