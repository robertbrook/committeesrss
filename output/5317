[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Aviva 
[normal]is supportive of 
[normal]initiatives that preserve 
[normal]li
[normal]fe or
[normal] prevent injur
[normal]y
[normal]. Aviva 
[normal]is 
[normal]also 
[normal]committed to recognising good 
[normal]standards of 
[normal]risk management and assist
[normal] our
[normal] 
[normal]p
[normal]olicyholders to achieve these goals by 
[normal]employing a 
[normal]nationwide 
[normal]team of 
[normal]Fleet 
[normal]Risk Consultants
[normal]. These individuals help customers to identify 
[normal]key 
[normal]hazards
[normal], 
[normal]then provid
[normal]e
[normal] information, guidance and practical solutions to eliminate or minimise
[normal] the associated risks.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Aviva is also currently working with the road safety charity BRAKE, to produce a specific VRU focused information leaflet designed to rais
[normal]e awareness and promote risk management best practice.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over recent years, Aviva has witnessed a significant rise in the frequency of claims involving cyclists under our Commercial 
[normal]Motor 
[normal]Fleet account, which is up 64% across 2011/12 compared with the 2008-10 average 
[normal](see graph below). 
[normal]It is also apparent in our data, that 
[normal]Large Goods
[normal] Vehicles
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]particular
[normal]ly
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]onstruction
[normal] 
[normal]v
[normal]ehicles
[normal])
[normal] are commonly involved, very often as the vehicle turns left a
[normal]t a junction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope the
[normal] following 
[normal]thoughts provide some assistance to the Transport Select Committee and 
[normal]I 
[normal]am happy to 
[normal]supply 
[normal]further 
[normal]comment
[normal] if more detail or information is required.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Q1 [bold]Is cycling safe, particularly in towns and cities?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]This is a matter of perception. 
[normal]Aviva recognises that 
[normal]a great deal of 
[normal]Government 
[normal]resource
[normal] has
[normal] 
[normal]already 
[normal]been invested
[normal] and this has undoubtedly resulted in 
[normal]the 
[normal]advancement 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]cycling 
[normal]safety
[normal]. However
[normal],
[normal] comparisons with other countries suggest there is still considerable scope for further improvement in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2 [bold]What could central and local government do to improve cycling safety?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here have been many debates and consultations on such matters and so Aviva will restrict comment to the following points, where 
[normal]it is felt 
[normal]we can add 
[normal]useful 
[normal]insight
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]In 
[normal]Aviva’s e
[normal]xperience, most 
[normal]serious 
[normal]collisions between a motorist and a cyclist involve the driver simply not seeing the cyclist before impact.
[normal] They tend to occur at junctions and roundabouts
[normal]. R
[normal]arely is the driver blatantly reckless and invariably they are mo
[normal]rtified by what has happened. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal] 
[normal]Aviva believes that 
[normal]to effectively tackle this type of 
[normal]occurrence
[normal], the issues and consequences need to be 
[normal]embedded in the public psyche
[normal] and that this
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]p
[normal]robably
[normal] best 
[normal]achieved by 
[normal]raising awareness via 
[normal]a 
[normal]‘
[normal]hard hitting
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]communication campaign
[normal]. Certainly this should utilise 
[normal]TV 
[normal]and printed 
[normal]advert
[normal]ising
[normal], but also 
[normal]other 
[normal]forms of 
[normal]social media
[normal]. The adverts should aim to have a 
[normal]similar 
[normal]gravitas 
[normal]to those previously used 
[normal]to encourage seat belt usage and to 
[normal]look twice for
[normal] oncoming 
[normal]m
[normal]otorcyclist
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst commendable, the current 
[normal]THINK
[normal]!
[normal] ‘Look Out’ 
[normal]for 
[normal]cyclists’
[normal] 
[normal]campaign 
[normal]does not seem to have 
[normal]a great deal of 
[normal]supporting video, nor has 
[normal]it 
[normal]achieved 
[normal]sufficient
[normal]ly high
[normal] profile yet.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal] A
[normal] nationwide advert would provide an opportunity to demonstrate benefits 
[normal]such as
[normal] cyclists 
[normal]w
[normal]earing a helmet / hi-viz clothing
[normal],
[normal] warn about the dangers of under-taking / use of ear phones and promote the availability of any free / low cost cycling training sch
[normal]emes (themes preferably to be agreed in advance with recognised cycling associations such as the CTC
[normal] &amp; LCC
[normal]). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal] 
[normal]Specifically in relation to collisions 
[normal]involving 
[normal]LGVs / Construction Vehicles turning left at a junction
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Aviva is supportive of the recently
[normal] produced Construction Logistics Standard, which we feel represents good practice and would encourage operators / clients to 
[normal]build 
[normal]this 
[normal]into the
[normal]ir
[normal] procurement process
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport for London
[normal]’s 
[normal]Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme
[normal] (FORS)
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]another 
[normal]excellent 
[normal]initiative
[normal], of
[normal] 
[normal]which 
[normal]Aviva 
[normal]is supportive
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]it is felt 
[normal]should be 
[normal]publicised and 
[normal]extended to other regions as quickly as possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal] 
[normal]Aviva currently
[normal] offer
[normal]s
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]fund the cost of supplying 
[normal]our Fleet LGV customers 
[normal]with warning decals (
[normal]illustrated 
[normal]below)
[normal] and Fresnel lenses
[normal]. We
[normal] consider 
[normal]this 
[normal]to be a cost effective means to raise 
[normal]both 
[normal]cyclist awareness and 
[normal]to 
[normal]improve the driver’s field of vision respectively. This initiative has received widespread 
[normal]praise
[normal] and 
[normal]Government might 
[normal]like to 
[normal]consi
[normal]der 
[normal]making the dist
[normal]inctive
[normal] 
[normal]/
[normal] intuitive
[normal] decal 
[normal]in particular
[normal], freely available to a wider audience, perhaps via
[normal] FORS
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. 
[normal]  
[normal]Aviva is of the view that all professional drivers should 
[normal]complete a Vulnerable Road User focused module as part of their mandatory Driver CPC training, preferably 
[normal]to include physically experiencing things from 
[normal]the perspective of a cyclist.
[normal]   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3 [bold]Is it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road[bold] users, for example by [bold]prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Following a 
[normal]review of 
[normal]killed and 
[normal]serious
[normal]ly
[normal] injur
[normal]ed
[normal] cyclist
[normal] 
[normal]claims 
[normal]on
[normal] our Commercial Motor account, Aviva is 
[normal]believes
[normal] that the most effective means to protect cyclists is to 
[normal]physically
[normal] separate 
[normal]them from other road 
[normal]users.
[normal] Wherever this is possible, 
[normal]such
[normal] segregation will also substantially remove the sources of antagonism that otherwise inevitably arise between the two fa
[normal]ctions.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. 
[normal]In London at least, Police data confirms that most incidents involving cyclists occur during peak commuter times. With this in mind, Aviva believes there is justification to at least explore the prospect of 
[normal]restricting access to certain road
[normal] networks for
[normal] some vehicles 
[normal]during
[normal] certain times
[normal] of the day
[normal]. The matter is of course complicated by the number of different stakeholders involved and the risk of unintended 
[normal]consequences
[normal]. Perhaps there is scope to undertake a limited trial &amp;/or introduce me
[normal]asures only for vehicles which do not meet stipulated safety standards as a means to encourage greater compliance.
