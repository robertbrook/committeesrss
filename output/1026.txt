[[[&#xa0;]]]Executive Summary:&#xa0;This contribution examines some of the issues regarding prisoners’ right to vote from a layman’s perspective. It supports the argument that the UK should comply with the Hirst ruling of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and rejects all three options contained in the draft bill. A proposal is offered that prisoners detained in open prisons should be offered a conditional right to vote, as part of a process of rehabilitation, drawing on contributions advanced in the commons debate on 10th February 2011 and the judgement of Scoppola v Italy (no. 3).&#xa0;About the submitter: &#xa0;I am a layman with an interest in democratic and constitutional reform and have been following the developments in the case of Hirst v. The United Kingdom (no.2) since 2010.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“..If you break the law, you cannot make the law”.“…we discovered absolutely no demand from prisoners for that so-called right”.“…By extending its [ECtHR] remit into areas way beyond any original conception of fundamental human rights, the Court in Strasbourg is undermining its own legitimacy and its potential effectiveness”.&#xa0;&#xa0;Legal challenges ensure that laws remain relevant, proportionate and fit for purpose for the 21st Century. &#xa0;The judgement of the European Court of Human Rights presents Parliament with a challenge but also an opportunity to engage with the issue of democratic reform in the consideration of the right to vote for prisoners.&#xa0;&#xa0;“...applies automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence               irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances”.Then an enfranchisement of all prisoners could be seen as an inversion of the position with its justification holding the same shortcomings.  Indeed it was never the Court’s intention to enfranchise all prisoners:&#xa0;“…the rights bestowed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are not absolute. There is room for implied limitations and Contracting States must be allowed a margin of appreciation in this sphere”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“…is a blunt instrument stripping of their Convention right to vote a significant number of persons and doing so in an indiscriminate manner and to a large extent regardless of the nature of their crimes, the length of their sentences and their individual circumstances”.&#xa0;Although this was not enough to sway the rest of the Court who did not find a breach of Article 3, protocol 1 in that case.&#xa0;&#xa0;“…illegal under international law founded on the UK’s treaty obligations”. &#xa0;Attorney General Dominic Grieve noted in the debate on the 10th February 2011 that:“...the judgments of the Court constitute an international obligation, so far as we subscribe to the convention and to membership of the Council of Europe”.&#xa0;And the Joint Committee on Human Rights (2006-7) stated that:“…It is also a matter for regret that the Government should seek views on retaining the current blanket ban, thereby raising expectations that this could be achieved, when in fact, this is the one option explicitly ruled out by the European Court”.&#xa0;The judgement as given in Hirst determined that a “blanket ban” was:“..a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important Convention right must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, and as being incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1”.&#xa0;&#xa0;“…it would be a great pity if a long-established State—the United Kingdom, which was there at the founding and there at the drafting—were to set an example to other States in the Council of Europe that they do not have to abide by the law”.&#xa0;Such a move would signify an uncomfortable departure from the UK’s observance of the “rule of law” which in the opinion of Lord Mackay should be respected at both a domestic and European level:&#xa0;“…if we believe in the rule of law, we are just as much bound to observe the decisions of the European Court on matters within their competence as we are to obey the decisions of our own courts in matters within their competence”.&#xa0;However it has been noted by Attorney General Dominic Grieve in the commons debate of 10th February 2011 that:&#xa0;“…It is therefore a bit of a red herring to suggest that just because something cannot be enforced, that is a justification for ignoring it. It might be a justification for enacting other legislation or taking other steps, but it would be a fairly momentous change in UK practice if we ignored something to which we had indicated by international treaty we subscribe”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“…It's about reintegrating them back into the community, breaking them back into society gently."&#xa0;The granting of the right to vote would be a significant and symbolic step towards achieving this goal.&#xa0;&#xa0;“…Such an approach would have a number of advantages. First, it would obey the European Court of Human Rights' ruling by giving the vote to the majority of prisoners at some stage in their sentence. Secondly, it would allow the vote to those convicted of relatively minor offences and sent to open prison. Thirdly, it would address the arguments of those who claim that giving the vote to prisoners would encourage them to become useful members of society-which it does. Fourthly, it would deny the vote to those convicted of the most heinous crimes until they had served most of their sentence and were about to be released back into the community, when they would get the vote anyway”&#xa0;To some extent this was advanced by Naomi Long MP earlier in the same debate:“…A preferable option, bearing in mind the rehabilitation argument, may be to limit the right of voting to prisoners serving sentences of one year or less, and to reintroduce the right to vote in the final year of a longer sentence as part of a wider programme of reintegration and rehabilitation”.&#xa0;&#xa0;“… the Court cannot underestimate the fact that under Italian law it is possible for a convicted person who has been permanently deprived of the right to vote to recover that right”. &#xa0;And that convicted persons under an early release scheme: &#xa0;“…can apply for rehabilitation and, where applicable, recover the right to vote at an earlier date. In the Court’s opinion this possibility shows that the Italian system is not excessively rigid”.&#xa0;This involves participating in a course of “re-education”:&#xa0;“…In order to facilitate reintegration into society, convicted prisoners who take part in the re-education scheme may have their sentence reduced by forty-five days for every six months served ...”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;June 2013&#xa0; HC Debate 10 Feb 2011 c493 Ibid, c494 Ibid, c494 The History of the Parliamentary Franchise, Hansard Research Paper 13/14, 1 March 2013 Case of Hirst v.
