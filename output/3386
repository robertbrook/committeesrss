defaultThe Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority
defaultThe new financial services regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), were recently given statutory growth duties through the Financial Services Act 2012, which require them to have regard to 
default‘the desirability of sustainable growth in the economy of the United Kingdom in the medium or long term’
default.
default 
defaultThey are also required to have regard to the principle of proportionality. The Government believes these duties are appropriately framed for regulators of financial services, given the nature of financial services markets and their role in the economy, while being sufficiently similar in intent to this growth duty to remove any necessity to apply it to
default their non-economic regulatory functions
default.

default&#xa0;
defaultThe Pensions Regulator
defaultIn the Budget 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Government’s intention to provide the Pensions Regulator (tPR) with a new objective to support scheme funding arrangements that are compatible with sustainable growth for the sponsoring employer. This announcement followed a call for evidence earlier this year by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on whether a new employer-focused objective is appropriate. The majority of respondents to that call for evidence favoured such a change, recognising the importance of strong, healthy employers to defined benefit pension schemes. The new objective is therefore included in the Pensions Bill, currently before Parliament. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven that there is already a growth-focused objective focusing on key tPR functions before Parliament, the Government has decided on balance not to apply the new growth duty to tPR for now. The Government considers that it is important to allow the new tPR objective to complete its passage through the Parliamentary process and to bed in before considering further the need for additional duties. Should it become apparent that the application of a growth duty to tPR’s other functions is a sensible and proportionate change the Government will include tPR within scope of the growth duty.

defaultImmigration functions (specifically the immigration-related
default&#xa0;
defaultregulatory enforcement functions of the Home Office)
defaultImmigration functions now fall within the full Home Office portfolio.
default&#xa0;
default The Home Office’s priorities are the interlinked objectives of ensuring our national security and a safe, cohesive society. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe management of the 
defaultUK
default’s border and migration system is key to supporting these objectives.
default&#xa0;
default Where possible, and balanced against the wider security interests of the 
defaultUK
default, migration initiatives and policies will support economic enrichment.
default&#xa0;
default In addition, the immigration system is subject to high volumes of litigation.
default&#xa0;
default The vast majority of judicial review applications, for example, are immigration cases (over 70% in 2011).
default&#xa0;
default We believe the risk of vexatious challenges concerning the application of the growth duty is therefore higher than in relation to other 
defaultregulatory functions and the Government has therefore decided to exclude immigration functions from the growth duty for the time being.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is precedent for this - in the Equality Act 2010 immigration functions were excluded from similar duties in order to limit exposure to legal risk. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAppendix Adefault&#xa0;
defaultInformation on defaultthe definition ofdefault a regulatory function for the purposes of clauses 58 to 61 of the Draft Deregulation Billdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultClause 61 of the Draft Deregulation Bill defines a regulatory function to which the duty to have regard to the des
defaultirability of economic growth can apply.  It states:
default&#xa0;
default“ 61 Sections 58 to 60: interpretationdefault(1) In sections 58 to 60, “regulatory function” means:
default(a) a function under or by virtue of an Act or subordinate legislation of
defaultimposing requirements, restrictions or conditions, or setting standards
defaultor giving guidance, in relation to an activity; or
default(b) a function which relates to the securing of compliance with, or the
defaultenforcement of, requirements, restrictions, conditions, standards or
defaultguidance which, under or by virtue of an Act or subordinate legislation,
defaultrelate to an activity.
default&#xa0;
default(2) 
default              
defaultIn subsection (1)(a) and (b) the references to a function include a function
defaultexercisable by or on behalf of the Crown.
default&#xa0;
default(3) In subsection (1)(a) and (b) the references to an activity include:
default(a) providing goods and services; and
default(b) employing or offering employment to a person.
default&#xa0;
default(4) 
default              
defaultIn sections 59 and 60, “Minister of the Crown” has the same meaning as in the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975.
default&#xa0;
default(5) 
default              
defaultIn this section, “subordinate legislation” has the same meaning as in the
defaultInterpretation Act 1978.
default 
default” 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis definition has been adopted to ensure 
defaultthat 
defaultthe policy objectives are achieved and 
defaultthat 
defaultthe duty to have regard to growth is 
defaultapplied 
defaultto 
defaultall 
defaultregulator
defaulty functions to which it would be appropriate. It is also consistent with the existing definition that underpins the statutory code of practice for regulators (Regulators’ Compliance Code). The definition above does not expressly exclude economic regulatory functions; however the Government is clear that this duty is designed to apply to non-economic regulatory functions, rather than economic regulatory functions.
default&#xa0;defaultEconomic rdefaultegulatory functionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultIn the 
defaultUK
default, economic regulation has typically been introduced in areas where network effects and/or economies of scale create circumstances - such as natural monopolies – which limit the prospects for effective competition. 
defaultThe aim of economic regulation is to create a system of incentives and penalties that replicate the outcomes of competition in terms of consumer prices, quality and investment and puts the protection of consumers’ interests at its heart. 
defaultTypically, economic regulators oversee infrastructure sectors such as gas and electricity (Ofgem), Water (Ofwat) and Communications (Ofcom). Economic regulation in these sectors caps the prices that dominant companies can charge in order to promote efficiency and fairness, while providing them a return on their assets and investments. 
defaultEconomic regulation has also been applied to non-infrastructure sectors where similar institutional arrangements apply, such as the future economic regulation of healthcare services (Monitor).
defaultEconomic regulation is a qualitatively different form of regulation to non-economic regulation (such as that undertaken by regulators such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Environment Agency) which do 
defaultnot defaultcorrect for the market failure of natural monopoly 
defaultor defaultpromote efficiency within a market. 
defaultHowever t
defaulthe distinction is not absolute. There are some bodies that conduct a mix of both economic and non-economic regulatory functions (for example safety), such as the Civil Aviation Authority. Government is clear that it aims to ensure that as wide a range of non-economic regulatory functions 
defaultas possible are
default captured as part of the 
defaultgr
defaultowth 
defaultd
defaultuty. It therefore is seeking to apply the 
defaultg
defaultrowth 
defaultd
defaultuty to the non-economic regulatory functions of such bodies, where the level of non-economic regulatory activity is significant.

defaultThe duty will not apply to the project licensing decisions of the Animals in Science Regulation Unit
default.  The industry concerned has specifically asked that project licensing decisions be omitted to avoid harm to the industry, as such decisions assess the level of detriment to animal welfare against the potential benefits of a project.

defaultThe duty will not apply to the economic regulatory functions of the Civil Aviation Authority
default.
default Including Trinity House Lighthouse Service, the Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioner of Irish Lights (in respect of its regulatory functions in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default)
default The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was included in the original consultation on the growth duty. However we have since clarified that they are a police function and it would not therefore be appropriate to bring SOCA within scope of the growth duty for regulatory functions.
