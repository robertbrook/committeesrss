[normal]The Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority
[normal]The new financial services regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), were recently given statutory growth duties through the Financial Services Act 2012, which require them to have regard to 
[normal]‘the desirability of sustainable growth in the economy of the United Kingdom in the medium or long term’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]They are also required to have regard to the principle of proportionality. The Government believes these duties are appropriately framed for regulators of financial services, given the nature of financial services markets and their role in the economy, while being sufficiently similar in intent to this growth duty to remove any necessity to apply it to
[normal] their non-economic regulatory functions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pensions Regulator
[normal]In the Budget 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Government’s intention to provide the Pensions Regulator (tPR) with a new objective to support scheme funding arrangements that are compatible with sustainable growth for the sponsoring employer. This announcement followed a call for evidence earlier this year by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on whether a new employer-focused objective is appropriate. The majority of respondents to that call for evidence favoured such a change, recognising the importance of strong, healthy employers to defined benefit pension schemes. The new objective is therefore included in the Pensions Bill, currently before Parliament. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given that there is already a growth-focused objective focusing on key tPR functions before Parliament, the Government has decided on balance not to apply the new growth duty to tPR for now. The Government considers that it is important to allow the new tPR objective to complete its passage through the Parliamentary process and to bed in before considering further the need for additional duties. Should it become apparent that the application of a growth duty to tPR’s other functions is a sensible and proportionate change the Government will include tPR within scope of the growth duty. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Immigration functions (specifically the immigration-related
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]regulatory enforcement functions of the Home Office)
[normal]Immigration functions now fall within the full Home Office portfolio.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The Home Office’s priorities are the interlinked objectives of ensuring our national security and a safe, cohesive society. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The management of the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s border and migration system is key to supporting these objectives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Where possible, and balanced against the wider security interests of the 
[normal]UK
[normal], migration initiatives and policies will support economic enrichment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In addition, the immigration system is subject to high volumes of litigation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The vast majority of judicial review applications, for example, are immigration cases (over 70% in 2011).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We believe the risk of vexatious challenges concerning the application of the growth duty is therefore higher than in relation to other 
[normal]regulatory functions and the Government has therefore decided to exclude immigration functions from the growth duty for the time being.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is precedent for this - in the Equality Act 2010 immigration functions were excluded from similar duties in order to limit exposure to legal risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Appendix A[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Information on [bold]the definition of[bold] a regulatory function for the purposes of clauses 58 to 61 of the Draft Deregulation Bill[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 61 of the Draft Deregulation Bill defines a regulatory function to which the duty to have regard to the des
[normal]irability of economic growth can apply.  It states:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“ 61 Sections 58 to 60: interpretation[bold](1) In sections 58 to 60, “regulatory function” means:
[normal](a) a function under or by virtue of an Act or subordinate legislation of
[normal]imposing requirements, restrictions or conditions, or setting standards
[normal]or giving guidance, in relation to an activity; or
[normal](b) a function which relates to the securing of compliance with, or the
[normal]enforcement of, requirements, restrictions, conditions, standards or
[normal]guidance which, under or by virtue of an Act or subordinate legislation,
[normal]relate to an activity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) 
[normal]              
[normal]In subsection (1)(a) and (b) the references to a function include a function
[normal]exercisable by or on behalf of the Crown.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3) In subsection (1)(a) and (b) the references to an activity include:
[normal](a) providing goods and services; and
[normal](b) employing or offering employment to a person.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4) 
[normal]              
[normal]In sections 59 and 60, “Minister of the Crown” has the same meaning as in the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](5) 
[normal]              
[normal]In this section, “subordinate legislation” has the same meaning as in the
[normal]Interpretation Act 1978.
[normal] 
[normal]” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This definition has been adopted to ensure 
[normal]that 
[normal]the policy objectives are achieved and 
[normal]that 
[normal]the duty to have regard to growth is 
[normal]applied 
[normal]to 
[normal]all 
[normal]regulator
[normal]y functions to which it would be appropriate. It is also consistent with the existing definition that underpins the statutory code of practice for regulators (Regulators’ Compliance Code). The definition above does not expressly exclude economic regulatory functions; however the Government is clear that this duty is designed to apply to non-economic regulatory functions, rather than economic regulatory functions.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Economic r[bold]egulatory functions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In the 
[normal]UK
[normal], economic regulation has typically been introduced in areas where network effects and/or economies of scale create circumstances - such as natural monopolies – which limit the prospects for effective competition. 
[normal]The aim of economic regulation is to create a system of incentives and penalties that replicate the outcomes of competition in terms of consumer prices, quality and investment and puts the protection of consumers’ interests at its heart. 
[normal]Typically, economic regulators oversee infrastructure sectors such as gas and electricity (Ofgem), Water (Ofwat) and Communications (Ofcom). Economic regulation in these sectors caps the prices that dominant companies can charge in order to promote efficiency and fairness, while providing them a return on their assets and investments. 
[normal]Economic regulation has also been applied to non-infrastructure sectors where similar institutional arrangements apply, such as the future economic regulation of healthcare services (Monitor).
[normal]Economic regulation is a qualitatively different form of regulation to non-economic regulation (such as that undertaken by regulators such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Environment Agency) which do 
[normal]not [bold]correct for the market failure of natural monopoly 
[normal]or [bold]promote efficiency within a market. 
[normal]However t
[normal]he distinction is not absolute. There are some bodies that conduct a mix of both economic and non-economic regulatory functions (for example safety), such as the Civil Aviation Authority. Government is clear that it aims to ensure that as wide a range of non-economic regulatory functions 
[normal]as possible are
[normal] captured as part of the 
[normal]gr
[normal]owth 
[normal]d
[normal]uty. It therefore is seeking to apply the 
[normal]g
[normal]rowth 
[normal]d
[normal]uty to the non-economic regulatory functions of such bodies, where the level of non-economic regulatory activity is significant.

[normal] 
[normal]The duty will not apply to the project licensing decisions of the Animals in Science Regulation Unit
[normal].  The industry concerned has specifically asked that project licensing decisions be omitted to avoid harm to the industry, as such decisions assess the level of detriment to animal welfare against the potential benefits of a project. 
[normal] 
[normal]The duty will not apply to the economic regulatory functions of the Civil Aviation Authority
[normal].
[normal] Including Trinity House Lighthouse Service, the Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioner of Irish Lights (in respect of its regulatory functions in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal])
[normal] The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was included in the original consultation on the growth duty. However we have since clarified that they are a police function and it would not therefore be appropriate to bring SOCA within scope of the growth duty for regulatory functions.
