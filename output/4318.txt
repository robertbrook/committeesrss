[[[&#xa0;]]]The RCUK Energy Strategy Fellowship has recently launched a Prospectus exploring research, skills and training needs across the energy landscape. The Prospectus was commissioned by Research Councils UK (RCUK) who constitute the primary audience for the report. The Prospectus contributes to the evidence base upon which the RCUK Energy Programme can plan research and training activities. However, a number of the findings and recommendations concern the wider UK energy innovation system.  The Fellowship Team acted independently in producing the Prospectus, drawing on an extensive series of workshops, stakeholder interviews and literature reviews. The recommendations are grouped according to their main focus:&#xa0;&#xa0;This evidence draws on both the Prospectus and the judgements of the Fellowship team, focussing on the question posed in the Call for Evidence. We have raised wider issues where we believe these to be relevant to the question being posed.&#xa0;While there is a very large overlap between low-carbon innovation (the subject of this Inquiry) and energy innovation (the subject of our work), there are differences. Low-carbon innovation could cover land-use change, as well as materials and manufacturing development. Energy innovation includes advances in technologies in the fossil fuel industries, which would not typically be viewed as low-carbon.  &#xa0;

[[[Question 1: ]]]

[[[Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Question 2: ]]]

[[[Does]]]

[[[ the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other ]]]

[[[low carbon technologies?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 3: ]]]

[[[What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?]]]&#xa0;

[[[Question 4]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation pr]]]

[[[ocess, including over the long-term?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 5: ]]]

[[[What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?]]]&#xa0;

[[[Question 6: ]]]

[[[How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low ]]]

[[[carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 7: ]]]

[[[How is the Government maximising ]]]

[[[opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?]]]
