[[[Written evidence submitted by the Society of Biology (RaD0008)]]]&#xa0;The Society of Biology welcomes the Committee’s attention to research and development funding for science and technology; a core sector that underpins the UK’s economic stability through novel products and job creation, and is pleased to have sight of the detailed analysis in the National Audit Office memorandum on this topic. &#xa0;The NAO memorandum confirms the value of R&amp;D carried out by UK business, where the life sciences play a major role and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are the dominating sectors. The UK business R&amp;D spend, for which tax incentives are so important, is bolstered by our particular strengths in life sciences, software, and advanced engineering research that attract substantial Foreign Direct Investment. The UK’s talent and attractive research environment is strengthened by BIS’s commitment to improve the interface between Higher Education Institutions and businesses, and supportive statements by Government that 'investment in science is an investment in our future’. &#xa0;At both the 2010 and 2013 spending reviews, Government recognised the sustained excellence of the science sector with a flat cash settlement for the resource budget. Although we welcomed the ring fence, we note that if the Government wants a growth economy, it must support a sector that employs more than 5.4m UK workers and provides an impressive return on investment. Above inflation growth in the science budget is therefore needed if the sciences are to deliver their full potential for improving the economy and wellbeing. It is essential that the virtual cuts in the science budget are reversed if the research community is to deliver the full benefit the country needs. &#xa0;The UK is currently the number one in Europe in terms of Foreign Direct Investment, but maintaining our international competitively is crucial, particularly as the global economy changes and BRIC nations advance.  The NAO memorandum clearly shows that the UK is falling behind on R&amp;D intensity at just 1.9%, way off the 3% target for the European Commission by 2020.  The UK’s failure to aim for this target is concerning and contradictory to Government rhetoric on the importance of the UK science sector.&#xa0;Government Departments have a key role in funding research outside of public labs, and should be seen as an integral part of the UK’s research ecosystem.  This area of funding has been severely hit by recent cuts, creating concern about training, skills development and policy- relevant research across the sciences. These budgets should also be taken into consideration when investigating the resilience of the UK science sector.

[[[Future Inquiries]]]There are several lines of inquiry that the Select Committee may like to consider which would be beneficial to the UK science R&amp;D sector. The Society of Biology suggests the following: Recently Government has increased capital funding though specific infrastructure announcements such as  the £50m for a National Graphene Institute, investment in scientific facilities, including The Francis Crick Institute and Pharmavision,  and £150 million of capital investment in 2015-16 to fund health research infrastructure in the areas of dementia, genomics and imaging. Funding is also promised for the ‘Great Eight’ technologies for which analysis has suggested Government should be promoting with further capital investment and technology support. R&amp;D funding is welcome where it is needed and of most use, but does this shift toward directed funding conflict with the established Haldane Principle? The Chancellor stated in his 2013 Spending Review announcement: ‘Our philosophy is simple: trust people to make their own decisions and they will usually make better ones’. What are the processes for deciding the allocation of capital funding? How should this best integrate with the Research Council’s remit and activities?The pharmaceutical sector is a key driver for innovation in the UK, however over recent years pharmaceutical R&amp;D within the UK has undergone a significant transformation. An ecosystem of collaborative research partners is emerging which encompasses small and large pharma, SMEs, academia, health charities and the NHS, with each contributing complementary skills and expertise. Job losses at UK sites for GSK, AstraZeneca and Pfizer in recent years cannot be ignored. What is the future for UK Pharma, and how can the Government ensure its continued success?The BIS R&amp;D Scoreboards were discontinued in 2012 because of budgetary concerns. These scoreboards allowed for transparent, impartial and up to date evaluation of the level of R&amp;D activity in the UK, tracking of historical data trends and benchmarking of UK R&amp;D activity against other nations. Given global fiscal uncertainty, we argue that this type of analysis firms up policy decision making, and could help to inform and encourage  investment in the UK by highlighting our strengths and allowing for closer inspection of where policies are, or are not working. How has the discontinuation affected the ability for Government and others to track policy and investment efficacy? Has this type of analysis been picked up elsewhere, and if so, to what budgetary costs? &#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013               Department for Business Innovation and Skills Leverage from public funding of science and research.
