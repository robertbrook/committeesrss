I have over 31 years’ experience in engineering, from apprenticeship, tradesman, through professional engineer status undertaking design works, and the running of a previous engineering SME business.\n&#xa0;\nI am currently the sole employee &amp; company director of my company thus, under the NICEIC Approved Contractor (AC) scheme, I am the Principal Duty Holder (PDH), the Qualified Supervisor (QS), and the sole electrician in the company.\n&#xa0;\nMy company does not restrict itself to domestic electrical works, and it lists small regional companies, and large high profile public sector organisations within its client base, for both electrical installations and other works.\n&#xa0;\nI am on times called upon by a local private training provider to assist in the delivery &amp; examination of various City &amp; Guilds electrical installations courses, typically on the wiring regulations, along with inspection &amp; testing of electrical installations.\n&#xa0;\nI am also part of the “management team” that runs an independent internet discussion forum on the electrical industry.  This is primarily not for profit, but is maintained as a peer to peer help forum for the promotion of electrical safety, help and advice to householders &amp; the profession. (http://talk.electricianforum.co.uk/)\n&#xa0;\nAs a result of my participation in this forum, I therefore monitor other similar forums around the internet, and therefore gauge the general level of competence and feeling in the industry.\n&#xa0;\nMy company is not structured to undertake domestic electrical works, as 90+% of our business is B2B, and the company is VAT registered, for such a small organisation, I find this is off-putting to the general public.  Therefore we do not compete in that market and the areas we do work incur us larger overheads than the average domestic electrician &amp; electrical installer, thus I further find our costs also mean that we do not compete in the domestic installation sector.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, the company undertakes medical installations works for our local health trust in patients’ homes, so I do get to see the level of quality and safety of electrical installations being undertaken in the domestic installation industry, past &amp; present.\n&#xa0;\nI therefore feel qualified and competent to make the following observations on my summary above, and feel that my comments can be considered valid and partisan as in general and where possible, the company does not compete for business in the private domestic electrical installations market to the general public.\n&#xa0;\nEvidence:Having watched the last meeting of the Communities and Local Government Committee of the 2\nnd\n September 2013, I have felt that I had to make my opinions known, and, felt that I should take some time to formulate my ideas.\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe general public lack awareness of the:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrequirements of building regulations &amp; Part P in particular.\nThe schemes themselves admit to a lack of awareness of the building regulations and Part P with the general public, however, the schemes cannot seem to present a united front for the industry and promote the positive benefits of these regulations to the general public, as an aide to safety, which they are.\n&#xa0;\nThis is somewhat now confused by the changes to the Part P document in England, which has resulted in differing requirements in areas of the UK.\nThe schemes see intent on only promoting their own members and therefore their promoting their own businesses.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndangers of electricity.\nFrom my experience in the industry there is a definite lack of knowledge in the dangers that can be posed by electricity, and this I feel is confirmed by the lack of awareness of the building regulations, and how quickly and easily the general public will tackle significant electrical works, with little if any prior knowledge and competence to do this, and to confirm that the work they do is safe.\n&#xa0;\nThe schemes themselves seem to do little to promote these dangers to the public as a united front, pushing for a safer industry.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsafety requirements that companies &amp; employees need to adhere to (Such as EAWR89).\nDue to the lack of understanding the general public rarely understand the dangers and the requirements placed upon legitimate professional electricians in the work that they undertake and the dangers that electricity can pose to both the house holder &amp; the electrician.\n&#xa0;\nAgain the schemes do not provide a unified front for the industry to explain why competent electricians have to work to specific standards.\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrequirements of BS7671 (IET Wiring Regulations Seventeenth Edition).\nAgain the schemes do not provide a united front to explain to the public on behalf of the industry that electricians, electrical contractors and domestic installers must meet the requirements of this standard, in their installations works, thus the public do not comprehend the requirements placed on the contactors, therefore they look for the cheapest, and often un-registered, possibly even incompetent persons to undertake the works.  Even if they do select a registered contractor, there is no guarantee of the person undertaking the works in their home being qualified and competent to do so.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe fragmentation of the schemes:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndoes nothing to promote safety in the industry &amp; awareness of the above points with the general public.\nI feel that my explanations of the points above express my opinions as to why the industry needs a single voice to act on its behalf.  The public is in general fully aware that gas work being undertaken by an enterprise as part of a business undertaking must be undertaken by a GASsafe registered individual.  GASsafe is as far as I understand a not for profit organisation, which in general has its primary aim the upholding of gas safety in all aspects of gas installations, maintenance and repair works.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nand the lack of a single register run by a not for profit organisation leads to the leaders of the industry putting company profits above the safety and promotion of the industry to the general public and therefore the safety related points listed above.\nFrom what I saw in the video of the meeting, it seemed that the two organisations represented, I say two because there were three representatives from organisations which are linked into one, at a higher business level, namely, the ELECSA (ECA), the ESC &amp; the NICEIC, had no real desire to provide a united front for the industry based on the promotion of the industry and electrical safety.  When the organisations it seems are constructed as profit making enterprises, then their duties as a business is to provide a return on the investments of their shareholders is it not?  That is to make a profit, rather than promote electrical safety and the control of the quality &amp; safety of the electrical installation industry.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nbeing run for profit results in a lack of a rigorous assessment process, and allows basically unqualified people to trade and work in the electrical industry.\nThe assessment procedure undertaken by the schemes seems flawed in its very nature.  I can only speak about my personal experience of the NICEIC Approved Contractor assessment process as this is the only one I have knowledge of.  When my company comes up for assessment, I offer all of the jobs that we have undertaken since the last visit to the assessor to visit, some will be easier to get to than others, however, I will also suggest jobs where there have been issues, or I have queries that I would like to discuss, I hold all of our work open to assessment.  To achieve Approved Contractor status, we had to provide 5 examples of electrical works, commercial, industrial and domestic, to achieve this status.  The assessment and all subsequent assessments are a full day long.  To join the NICEIC Domestic Installer (DI) scheme it seems from the literature that only 2 examples of work are needed, and that the assessment is half a day, and that there is a reduced level of qualification required of the person being assessed.  Neither of the NICEIC schemes require the assessment of all personnel undertaking electrical works within the enterprise being assessed.  My business is slightly differently as I am the only person in the business undertaking all roles with regard to electrical installations works, however, this does not prevent me from increasing the work we undertake by utilising contractors and sub-contractors under our enrolment to undertake works.  These contractors could well be \nunassessed\n.\n&#xa0;\nFrom what I understand, and forgive me if I am wrong, the ECA enrolment scheme is similar to the NICEIC AC as it was originally a competing scheme, the ELECSA enrolment system is similar to the NCIEIC DI scheme.\n&#xa0;\nThe only scheme that seems to differ is that by NAPIT, where by all “operatives” must be assessed.\nHowever, it seems that all schemes seem to undertake their assessments in a day or half a day per office, no matter how many “operatives” operate from that office.\n&#xa0;\nQuite how this can be done I don’t quite follow.  It would be interesting to compare how the schemes actually undertake their assessments.\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe schemes:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nnor the contractors they assess seem to take ultimate responsibility for  the work undertaken.  It seems to fall on the house holder.\nWhilst I appreciate that there are situations where the responsibility for work rests solely with the electrical contractor, there seems to be no redress to the scheme provider that has assessed that contractor as competent.  A single register such as GASsafe has no one to hide behind, no one for the contractor to threaten to leave and join a commercially competing scheme if the scheme operator wants to make their assessments more rigorous, or wishes the contractor to remedy works which have been the subject of a complaint, and the householder has no redress on the scheme for “certifying” that contractor as competent.\n&#xa0;\nAlso, the responsibility for compliance with building regulations seems to lie with the house holder, and the contractors, and schemes are totally absolved from this, this does not seem to be made clear to the general public.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nwill not entertain investigations into complaints of poor or dangerous work passed to them by another electrician, electrical contractor, or electrical engineer.  A complaint has to come from the customer, the person who is possibly least able to understand the technicalities of the situation.\nI actually contacted GASsafe about this point before preparing my submission.  I asked GASsafe if they would investigate possibly unsafe gas work if it were reported by another GASsafe registered contractor.  They confirmed to me that they look into all reports of unsafe gas work, no matter where the report originates.\n&#xa0;\nIt seems that the electrical scheme providers will only undertake an investigations into unsafe electrical works if the complaint is made by the end customer, for example the householder.  As I say above, the householder could well be unable to make a competent judgement on this situation, and a qualified and competent electrician would.  It seems the schemes consider it a conflict of business interests to investigate work of one contractor which has been reported as unsafe by another.\n&#xa0;\nNow there is such a level of commercial competition in the schemes I suspect that this will be extended, as contractors can jump schemes as much as they like, the schemes have no control over the workmanship that the contractors undertake, especially when there are easy registration options offered to transfer schemes.\n&#xa0;\nWith the reduction in notifiable work under Part P now in England, the restricted control that the schemes could exercise over this work has been further reduced.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nseem more interested in brand protection than safety.\nAs far as I can tell, there have been more prosecutions &amp; actions brought by the schemes for fraudulent use of their branding than there have for poor, shoddy or dangerous workmanship.\nThe schemes can easily bring about prosecutions for their brand protection because more often than not it seems those who are using this banding, are using it because they are not registered, and cannot get registered, thus there is little commercial suicide involved, in that the entity being prosecuted cannot jump ship to a commercially competing register, who will welcome them and take them on board, as long it seems as they can pay the registration fee.\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndo not want a “GASsafe” type of register run not for profit as a single face to the industry.\nIt seemed from the video footage of the last meeting there was no will to generate a single not for profit scheme to promote electrical safety and the electrical industry, this is not surprising considering my other observations and, that the witnesses present at the table were all, representatives of commercial enterprises which compete for the registration market place, rather than provide a safety &amp; quality assessment of the work of the contractors they register.\n&#xa0;\nThey both want to be the biggest, thus have the largest income from the contractors.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, I do not believe that a single commercial entity is the right way to go, as this entity would then be able to hold the electrical installers to ransom over fees charged etc. even though it would perhaps have control of the safety of the industry, it would also have the industry having to pay whatever it wished for registration.\n&#xa0;\nThis I feel is akin to the level of pricing of the big energy providers are forcing on the general public at the moment, when realistically there is not a fully free market for the public to go to, and in this modern age, gas &amp; certainly electricity are as much an essential part of life as water &amp; sewage provision.\n&#xa0;\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndo not seem to be able to undertake a robust and independent assessment of the contractors they assess to ensure that they are competent.  Based on these assessments often solely in the domestic market place, these contractors are moving on to more complex &amp; dangerous environments, and undertaking work that is endangering employees and could be considered in breach of EAWR89, the Provision &amp; Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER98), &amp; the Management of Health &amp; Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (MHSWR), as well as the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HASAWA).\nWhilst I only have personal experience of the assessment process of the NICEIC AC scheme, I have anecdotal reports of other scheme assessments.\n&#xa0;\nI have also seen work undertaken, whilst outside the remit of domestic electrical works, by a NAPIT assessed contractor, this individual, who had moved away from his domestic work and into industrial works, which come under much tighter rules and are often more dangerous than domestic installations, and certainly more complex. \nThe assessing scheme could have been any one, but, with it being NAPIT, these tales make things perhaps somewhat worse, as the operative will have been personally assessed by the NAPIT regional assessor.\n&#xa0;\nI was called to a machine that had a fault, I was called upon to assist my customers electrician in rectifying this fault.  When rectifying the fault we identified a latent defect in the safety circuits of the machine, this had been present since the machine had been implemented &amp; commissioned by the NAPIT contractor.\n&#xa0;\nWithout going into too much detail, machine emergency stop and associated circuits are designed and implemented to fail safe and if \nANY safety device is operated the machine should stop safely.  The lack of competence of this NAPIT contractor had resulted in the systems being wired such that \nALL devices had to be operated before the machine would stop safely.\nThis we obviously rectified and implemented a correct and safe function.\n&#xa0;\nI have been related a tale where the same contractor disabled an automatic door switch which resulted in a heavily laden locomotive having to make an emergency stop inside a large factory so that it did not crash through its exit door, which failed to open, because of the switch having been disabled.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\nFootnote:Should you wish to discuss any of these points in further detail, then I would be more than happy to do this and whilst involved in the electrical industry I would hope that I can provide a balanced viewpoint with regard to the best interests of the consumer, both the general public and commerce.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
