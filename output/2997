default‘"The fallacy of composition" is a logical error - a mistaken belief that what seems good for an individual will still be good when others do the same thing.

default To be fair to the DfT they did not see an economic case for this hugely damaging scheme – the Chancellor overruled them.
default Though the Inspector at the Westbury Bypass Inquiry in Wiltshire did look critically at the claims of economic benefit and reduction of out-commuting.
