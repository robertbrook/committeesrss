&#xa0;Written evidence from Boyd Johnston (CYS0100)&#xa0;Key to improving the safety of cyclists is to alter the mindset of the minority of drivers who cause the danger through inattention or aggressive driving. The introduction of strict liability combined with an education campaign aimed at both drivers and cyclists would go a long way in this regard.&#xa0;I am 63 years old and a very experienced cyclist and car driver. I have commuted by bike in Glasgow for the last 8 years. I that time I have been hit twice by cars in circumstances where the drivers just simply did not look properly. I have also had many close shaves, most due to carelessness on the part of drivers, but a small number due to deliberately aggressive driving.&#xa0;I have to say that in this part of the world, HGV's are not a significant problem for cyclists, but I recognise that this is not the case in other parts of the country.&#xa0;My suggestions for improvements are:•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; strict liability•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; an education campaign aimed at drivers and cyclists•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; an ongoing, high-profile campaign by the police, targeting dangerous, aggressive and distracted drivers in particular aimed at improving the overall standard of driving on our roads and reducing the level of casual law-breaking by motorists (speeding, hand-held mobiles etc.)•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; segregated facilities will in the longer term encourage more cyclists to take to the roads.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
