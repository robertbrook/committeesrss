[[[A. Education]]]. We believe strongly in the importance of improving educational opportunities to improve the future for Palestinian residents of Jerusalem. Thus, the Foundation supports numerous initiatives such as learning centres, professional development for teachers and educators, and more. The Evaluation report3 noted that it is key to expand the target population of those involved in peace-building activities to include the mainstream in order to broaden its support. For this reason the Foundation is also involved in projects such as Language as a Cultural Bridge, the Living in Jerusalem Advanced Civics Course, the Erna D. Leir Peace Kindergarten and the Max Rayne Hand in Hand School for Bilingual Education. Projects such as MICHA and the Hattie Friedland School for the Deaf provide vital services for both Jews and Arabs, and are able to bridge cultural gaps through this service provision. 

[[[B. Community Development in Palestinian Community]]]. We recognise the importance of services for the Palestinian community in everyday life, especially given its dire socio-economic situation. The Foundation has been instrumental in establishing and supporting community centres and facilities throughout the city, most significantly in Wadi Joz, Beit Safafa and the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. We have also aided health and welfare service providers in delivering necessary care, such as in the construction and expansion of the Sheikh Jarrach Medical Centre, and in ongoing support for the Elderly Services Centre in the Old City.

[[[hange]]]. In order to systematically advance peace on the ground it is critical to develop agents of change. Two of the Jerusalem Foundation’s major projects in this area are the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) and the Adam Institute for Democracy and Peace.

[[[Rights Advocacy]]]. Enabling Palestinian residents to access their legal and social rights is of utmost importance in paving the way for a peaceful future in the region. Two examples of important projects, initiated by the Jerusalem Foundation together with its partners, are the  Atta’a Assistance Centre for the Rights of East Jerusalem Residents and Grey Action (Council for the Rights of the Elderly).&#xa0;
