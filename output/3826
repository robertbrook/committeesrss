defaultJune 2011 was when the Commission wrote to Departments inviting them to submit candidates for the next cycle of SLR work starting in 2012. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere has been no further request made since then. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDepartments 
defaultare,
default however, free to submit candidates at any time. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIndeed the S
defaulttatute Law (Repeals)
default Act 2013 contained a number of repeals submitted by Departments and others after the work leading up to that Act had started. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn other words
default,
default there is a rolling programme of SLR work carried out at the Commission
default,
default which Departments and others can contribute to at any time. 
default&#xa0;
defaultObviously
default,
default if it is left too late in the run up to a Bill
default,
default it will be impossible to process it in time for that Bill and instead it would be picked up as part of our next cycle of work.

defaultWe are not aware that the Better Regulation Executive has ever sent the Commis

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur research shows that 20 Legislative Reform Orders have been made pursuant to the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith three exceptions we have found no evidence that the Commission was consulted on any of them. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exceptions are the Legislative Reform (Limited Partnerships) Order 2009 (which implemented a Law Commission proposal and so involved input from the Commission), the Legislative Reform (Health and Safety Executive) Order 2008 and the Legislative Reform (Local Government) (Animal Health Functions) Order 2009.  The Commission did not respond to the latter two consultations. 
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur research also examined the position under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, which was superseded by the 2006 Act. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOf the 30 Regulatory Reform Orders made under the 2001 Act, the only evidence that we have found that the Commission was consulted on any of them relates to two orders that implemented Law Commission proposals. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn conducting our research we used information provided by the LexisNexis website.

defaultThe Law Commission has been reviewed a number of times over the years. Each time it has been reviewed all of its functions have been retained. The most recent review is a Triennial Review. Stage 1 of the review has been completed and the outcome reported to Parliament (
defaultto 
defaultwhich you have referred in your footnote)
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe characteristics enjoyed by the Commission in terms of its independence, impartiality and expertise apply to its SLR function as they do to the Commission
default’s
default more general law reform functions.  Respondents to the Triennial Review who commented on the Commission’s SLR function were overwhelmingly in support of this area of the Commission’s work. The following is an extract from the report by the Ministry of Justice on Stage 1 in relation to the Statute Law Repeal function
default (
defaultparas
default 50-52):
defaultThis function has an important role in reducing regulation and red tape, helping to remove unnecessary law and making the statute book more accessible for individuals and businesses applying it. For example, as noted above, the most recent Statute Law (Repeals) Bill included tax law provisions from 2010 that had been overtaken by subsequent changes but were still technically in force and therefore a potential source of confusion. This function of removing obsolete and unnecessary legislation complements the Government’s Red Tape Challenge process, which aims to identify and remove legislation that, while still in active use, is deemed unnecessary and unhelpful.
defaultThere was some limited discussion of the value of the repeals function among a few respondents to the call for evidence. This minority felt that the function was not perhaps the best use of limited resources, as obsolete law has no practical effect and therefore does no harm. 
defaultHowever, as with other functions, most respondents were in favour of its retention. This was not only based on the principle of rule of law and the benefits of an accessible statute book but also reflected the fact that the function remains in regular use, an argument borne out by the function’s links to Government priorities. As the volume of statute law passed in 2009 alone stood at 23 Acts and 2247 pages,
default 
defaultthe need for repeal is likely to remain in future.
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn relation to the Law Commission’s functions as a whole the report concluded
default (
defaultpara
default 55)
default:
defaultThe overwhelming weight of evidence from respondents to the call for evidence is in favour of retaining all of the Commission’s substantive functions. The Government agrees with this conclusion, in view of the clear contribution these functions make to the development of better and more effective law.
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to grasp that the SLR work carried out by the Commission relates solely to the repeal of laws that are obsolete or otherwise no longer of practical utility. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor that reason, the Commission's evidence on the draft Deregulation Bill relates solely to the provisions in the Bill (clauses 50 to 57 and Schedule 16) that are concerned with the repeal of laws of this kind. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMost of the Bill appears to relate to the freeing of businesses and individuals from "red tape" and unnecessary burdens. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThat amounts to the repeal of laws that are actually having an effect whereas the Commission's SLR work is concerned with the repeal of laws that have no effect even though they remain in force as a matter of law.
default1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs to how long it might take the Commission to run a project to repeal the sort of obsolete laws that appear in Schedule 16, our SLR Bills typically contain around 10 topics or projects and we estimate that these take between 4 and 12 months to complete, depending on the size and complexity of the topic.
default&#xa0;
defaultA topic can cover very many individual pieces of legislation. For example, the tax legislation topic in the Statute Law 
default(
defaultRepeals
default)
default 
defaultAct 2013
default 
defaultrepealed 56 Acts in whole or part. The railways topic in the same Act repealed 297 Acts
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEach SLR project starts with research, moves onto consultation on the research, and finishes in the form of a report and draft Bill to the Justice Secretary. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe research tests each repeal candidate (there may be well over a hundred in any repeals project) to check whether it is of any practical utility. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis will include checking Parliamentary records including the original debates on the candidate, examining other public records, and studying a range of legal and historical works to provide context and background information. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe research is then written up and issued as a consultation paper to
default persons
default in central or local government, in industry or elsewhere who may be in a position to examine and comment on the repeal proposals. Typically we will consult for up to 3 months, dealing with enquiries and responses during that time. After the consultation period has closed we move into producing the draft Bill and report which is sent to the Justice Secretary for introduction into the legislative process. The Law Commission’s written evidence provides more information on the special legislative procedure that applies to its Statute Law

defaultThe proposals referred to are those set out in the Law Commission's evidence to the Committee in paragraphs 37 to 41. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThey relate to (1) improved communications between Government and the Commission
default,
default (2) the possibility of more frequent SLR Bills
default, and
default (3) using SLR Bills to revoke secondary legislation where this is appropriate.
default1.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo the best of our knowledge, Departments have not asked us to consider the revocation
default&#xa0;
defaultof the Grey Squirrels (Prohibition of Importation and Keeping) Order 1937.
default&#xa0;
default However, both that order and the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932 are under review as part of the Commission's Wildlife law reform project.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission is not concerned with any other provision in Schedule 11 to the Bill.
