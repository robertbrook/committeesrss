[normal]Submission from [bold]Paul Everall CBE, Chief Executive and Company Secretary [bold]LABC[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am submitting this evidence on behalf of LABC, the representative 
[normal]body for the building control teams in local authorities in England and Wales. We have some 3000 members working in over 300 local authorities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Public Awareness[bold]Condition 6 of the DCLG Conditions of Authorisation (CoA) requires scheme operators to adverti
[normal]se the scheme, explain its purpose and potential to members, and its use to customers.  It is apparent however that work is being carried out and not notified to a local authority or scheme operator, either in ignorance or deliberately.  Instances of work 
[normal]not notified, are only likely to come to light during the CON 29 search questionnaire for the conveyance process when a property is sold or let.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Consumers often rely on advice given by a contractor on whether or not the work needs to be notified under t
[normal]he building regulations.  It is not possible to monitor the quality of this advice. Nor is it possible to monitor the number of installations where a contractor fails to notify relevant work.  Condition 19 of DCLG CoA requires scheme operators to ensure th
[normal]at scheme members notify all completed work to the scheme and forw
[normal]ard a certificate of Building R
[normal]egulations compliance to customers.  It is difficult to see how this can be effectively monitored as only the contractor is aware of installation work undertak
[normal]en. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Skill level of operatives[bold]IF works are carried out by a contractor registered under a CPS then that CPS operator is expected to check and monitor the minimum technical competencies of the operator against minimum nationally recognised skills and competency levels.  The DCLG CoA 
[normal]req
[normal]uires
[normal] this measure to be documented to EN 45011 standard and accredited by UKAS within two years of initial authorisation.  As the CoA 
[normal]was
[normal] only introduced in June 2012 existing schemes have until 6 July 2014 to satisfy this requirement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Extent of monitori[bold]ng[bold]CoA 
[normal]requires
[normal] new members to a scheme to have a minimum of one site surveillance inspection per year for the first two years.  After that the CPS operator is able to take a risk based approach by which members need only have one 
[normal]on-site
[normal] inspection every 
[normal]three years.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The DCLG CoA apply to all schemes, be they electrical, window, or heating related, therefore all schemes should monitor their members to the same standard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The CoA do not require monitoring be carried out by an independent third party, and
[normal] many CPS operators directly employ their technical monitoring personnel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] At least one scheme on the other hand contracts out the monitoring of work carried out by their members to a specialist independent company.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While it is possible for each CPS to ha
[normal]ve a feedback loop on common faults, there is no mechanism for this information to be made available or for co-ordination between different scheme operators. Ideally the DCLG monitoring system should be looking for performance statistics that demonstrate C
[normal]PS are reviewing regulatory compliance and what common issues may need to be addressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Condition 20 of the DCLG CoA requires “the scheme operator to provide information DCLG requires in order to carry out its oversight functions, both on a regular bas
[normal]is or ad hoc as required”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alongside this condition by way of ex
[normal]planation, it is suggested that t
[normal]his is likely to include:
[normal]Periodic reports on membership numbers, number of work notifications to local authorities, number of formal consumer complaints and t
[normal]heir outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DCLG have introduced a UKAS accreditation requirement for all CPS operators as a way of monitoring their performance against the CoA.  However using the findings of this as a monitoring system for further use is difficult due 
[normal]to 
[normal]the confide
[normal]ntial
[normal] nature of the accreditation process. UKAS are not permitted to compile a list of common complaints and failings, and certainly not for discussion between different CPS operators, so it is not possible to obtain such a list unless DCLG can write it into th
[normal]e CoA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Production of such lists on a voluntary basis created by the CPS themselves may prove difficult, again due to confidentiality and a need to protect the business case of each CPS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Condition 20 also indicates that DCLG may obtain information direc
[normal]t from UKAS reports on scheme accreditation, but this is very strictly confidential between UKAS and DCLG and it is not information that can be shared elsewhere.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Adequacy of review [bold]The number of surveillance inspections is not related to the number of 
[normal]installations carried out and in the opinion of LABC is not rigorous enough particularly when compared to the number of building control inspections carried out on every job that is done through a building notice or full plans application to a local author
[normal]ity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]e)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Effect of Competition[bold]Competition is primarily one of costs and charges and inevitably reduction in costs to encourage registrants will have an effect on the quality of surveillance and monitoring. Budgeting balances between advertising and promotion
[normal] of a scheme, and operation and monitoring will also be affected.  Regrettably, competition to provide ‘the best’ inspection and monitoring service is unlikely to attract registrants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LABC fully support the setting up of a single register of competent ele
[normal]ctricians, as we believe that this is likely to improve the standards of domestic electrical work.  We would be happy to work with the electrical scheme operators to manage and promote such a register.                                                       
[normal]                             
[normal]f) Adequacy of supervision by DCLG[bold]It was only 2012 that DCLG introduced the CoA and incorporated a requirement for CPS operators to achieve UKAS accreditation for their schemes.  All have to achieve accreditation by June 
[normal]2014 with many already having done so.  Although accreditation takes into account the qualities of the surveillance officers and includes observation of a sample site visit, the main focus of EN 45011 is a head office audit.  LABC have reservations on the 
[normal]adequacy of the audit to ensure consistent and competent monitoring of installations particularly taking into account the frequency of site visits which can be as little as one every three years and takes no account of the number of installations undertake
[normal]n by the contractor.
