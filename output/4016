defaultSubmission from defaultPaul Everall CBE, Chief Executive and Company Secretary defaultLABCdefault&#xa0;
defaultI am submitting this evidence on behalf of LABC, the representative 
defaultbody for the building control teams in local authorities in England and Wales. We have some 3000 members working in over 300 local authorities.

defaultPublic AwarenessdefaultCondition 6 of the DCLG Conditions of Authorisation (CoA) requires scheme operators to adverti
defaultse the scheme, explain its purpose and potential to members, and its use to customers.  It is apparent however that work is being carried out and not notified to a local authority or scheme operator, either in ignorance or deliberately.  Instances of work 
defaultnot notified, are only likely to come to light during the CON 29 search questionnaire for the conveyance process when a property is sold or let.  
default&#xa0;
defaultConsumers often rely on advice given by a contractor on whether or not the work needs to be notified under t
defaulthe building regulations.  It is not possible to monitor the quality of this advice. Nor is it possible to monitor the number of installations where a contractor fails to notify relevant work.  Condition 19 of DCLG CoA requires scheme operators to ensure th
defaultat scheme members notify all completed work to the scheme and forw
defaultard a certificate of Building R
defaultegulations compliance to customers.  It is difficult to see how this can be effectively monitored as only the contractor is aware of installation work undertak
defaulten.

defaultSkill level of operativesdefaultIF works are carried out by a contractor registered under a CPS then that CPS operator is expected to check and monitor the minimum technical competencies of the operator against minimum nationally recognised skills and competency levels.  The DCLG CoA 
defaultreq
defaultuires
default this measure to be documented to EN 45011 standard and accredited by UKAS within two years of initial authorisation.  As the CoA 
defaultwas
default only introduced in June 2012 existing schemes have until 6 July 2014 to satisfy this requirement.
default&#xa0;
defaultc)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExtent of monitoridefaultngdefaultCoA 
defaultrequires
default new members to a scheme to have a minimum of one site surveillance inspection per year for the first two years.  After that the CPS operator is able to take a risk based approach by which members need only have one 
defaulton-site
default inspection every 
defaultthree years.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DCLG CoA apply to all schemes, be they electrical, window, or heating related, therefore all schemes should monitor their members to the same standard.
default&#xa0;
default The CoA do not require monitoring be carried out by an independent third party, and
default many CPS operators directly employ their technical monitoring personnel.
default&#xa0;
default At least one scheme on the other hand contracts out the monitoring of work carried out by their members to a specialist independent company.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile it is possible for each CPS to ha
defaultve a feedback loop on common faults, there is no mechanism for this information to be made available or for co-ordination between different scheme operators. Ideally the DCLG monitoring system should be looking for performance statistics that demonstrate C
defaultPS are reviewing regulatory compliance and what common issues may need to be addressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultCondition 20 of the DCLG CoA requires “the scheme operator to provide information DCLG requires in order to carry out its oversight functions, both on a regular bas
defaultis or ad hoc as required”
default&#xa0;
defaultAlongside this condition by way of ex
defaultplanation, it is suggested that t
defaulthis is likely to include:
defaultPeriodic reports on membership numbers, number of work notifications to local authorities, number of formal consumer complaints and t
defaultheir outcomes.
default&#xa0;
defaultDCLG have introduced a UKAS accreditation requirement for all CPS operators as a way of monitoring their performance against the CoA.  However using the findings of this as a monitoring system for further use is difficult due 
defaultto 
defaultthe confide
defaultntial
default nature of the accreditation process. UKAS are not permitted to compile a list of common complaints and failings, and certainly not for discussion between different CPS operators, so it is not possible to obtain such a list unless DCLG can write it into th
defaulte CoA.
default&#xa0;
default Production of such lists on a voluntary basis created by the CPS themselves may prove difficult, again due to confidentiality and a need to protect the business case of each CPS.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCondition 20 also indicates that DCLG may obtain information direc
defaultt from UKAS reports on scheme accreditation, but this is very strictly confidential between UKAS and DCLG and it is not information that can be shared elsewhere.  
default&#xa0;
defaultd)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdequacy of review defaultThe number of surveillance inspections is not related to the number of 
defaultinstallations carried out and in the opinion of LABC is not rigorous enough particularly when compared to the number of building control inspections carried out on every job that is done through a building notice or full plans application to a local author
defaultity.
default&#xa0;
defaulte)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEffect of CompetitiondefaultCompetition is primarily one of costs and charges and inevitably reduction in costs to encourage registrants will have an effect on the quality of surveillance and monitoring. Budgeting balances between advertising and promotion
default of a scheme, and operation and monitoring will also be affected.  Regrettably, competition to provide ‘the best’ inspection and monitoring service is unlikely to attract registrants.
default&#xa0;
defaultLABC fully support the setting up of a single register of competent ele
defaultctricians, as we believe that this is likely to improve the standards of domestic electrical work.  We would be happy to work with the electrical scheme operators to manage and promote such a register.                                                       
default                             
defaultf) Adequacy of supervision by DCLGdefaultIt was only 2012 that DCLG introduced the CoA and incorporated a requirement for CPS operators to achieve UKAS accreditation for their schemes.  All have to achieve accreditation by June 
default2014 with many already having done so.  Although accreditation takes into account the qualities of the surveillance officers and includes observation of a sample site visit, the main focus of EN 45011 is a head office audit.  LABC have reservations on the 
defaultadequacy of the audit to ensure consistent and competent monitoring of installations particularly taking into account the frequency of site visits which can be as little as one every three years and takes no account of the number of installations undertake
defaultn by the contractor.
