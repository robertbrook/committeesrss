[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[1.  My Aims]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am writing as an individual, and one of many,  who would like to live in a rural community, but who is unable to do so for lack of access to land whereupon I might be allowed to build a modest dwelling and create my income from that land.   &#xa0;I would wish to join forces with others as a co-operative of some description,  in order to buy a woodland with a view to:   &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; managing the woodland for timber, wildlife and fuelwood -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; creating a forest garden (food security using perennial woodland and fruiting plants)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; building our  own houses using the resources of the woodland and the local community to high environmental standards (roundwood, strawbale and such like)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; creating businesses using the resources of the woodland and local community (willow basketry, mushroom farming, market gardening, orchard and berry fruit, cottage food industries, beekeeping, arts and crafts and such like-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; enhancing the attractions for tourists (woodland walks and bike trails, activity days for families)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; enhancing the facilities and attractions for the local community (educational and volunteering opportunities, forest schools, craft workshops and such like)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; providing work opportunities and training for local youth &#xa0;Many of these ideas are familiar and have proven exciting and successful opportunities for community-owned woodlands, but in order for rural communities to remain sustainable, multi-generational populations and facilities are urgently required.  Housing remains a major problem with rural populations ageing, schools closing and along with them the social fabric as facilities dwindle (doctors &amp; dentists, shops, libraries, banks, post-offices, bus services etc etc).  Meanwhile, crofting lands are increasingly abandoned and unproductive as their tenants age.&#xa0;

[[[ of ways:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Subsidy and tax advantages inflate land values, which limits new entrants,-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The use of land as an investment vehicle rewards speculation and inhibits innovation-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Subsidy and tax advantages ensure the price of land is divorced from its productive value,  which rewards inertia and inhibits sustainable development.&#xa0;3.  A Land Agency should function to enforce and proactively enable Land Reform with a view to increasing productivity, biodiversity, community buy-outs, community owned energy projects and liberating abandoned croft lands, assisting planning permissions for new builds on croft lands, creating new croft and woodland crofts as well as helping newcomers through the process of finding and purchasing land and self-build planning.   &#xa0;October 2013
