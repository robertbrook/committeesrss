[[[quality education]]]. The Global Partnership – made up of governments, civil society organizations, international institutions, teachers, private foundations, and the private sector – provides funding to support the development and implementation of high-quality education sector plans in the world’s poorest countries and  helps coordinate support around those plans. Fundamental to the Global Partnership’s work is ensuring education sector plans are inclusive and meet the educational needs of all children. In its report to the UN Secretary General in May 2013, the 

[[[United Nations High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on ]]]

[[[the Post-2015 Development Agenda]]] highlighted:&#xa0;‘The Global Partnership for Education is getting quality education to marginalized children, coordinating education’s many players, offering aid without wasteful replication, and following local leadership’&#xa0;2.2              With the support of the UK and a number of other donor partners, the 

[[[Global Partnership has]]] 

[[[transformed international cooperation]]] in education in developing countries. Since 2002, it has helped to pioneer the coordination of development partners in support of nationally owned and implemented education sector plans. In doing so, the GPE has improved the alignment of external technical and financial resources with sustainable, nationally relevant education strategies. Due to the value of GPE processes in improving education development and the catalytic impact of GPE financing on system strengthening in the education sector, GPE has become one of the most significant sources of education financing for the poorest countries in the world. &#xa0;2.3              Since 2009,

The Implementation Plan for GPE’s Strategic Plan includes a specific outcome on the access of children with disabilities to inclusive and quality learning. It further commits GPE and its partners to support the creation of inclusive education systems, in particular: &#xa0;environments for children with disabilitieseffectiveness to improve learning outcomes for marginalized children, in particular children with disabilities.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Global Partnership’s approach is comprehensive, supporting inclusive education and the education of children with special needs at the country, regional and global level.

[[[analysis and planning]]]

[[[–]]]

[[[ ]]]explicit support for inclusive education is articulated in the GPE Guidelines for education sector plan development and appraisal. These guidelines make specific reference to the need for consideration of disability in the process of education sector plan preparation, education sector plan appraisal, implementation strategies and targeted monitoring. For example, in preparation for the development of an education sector plan, sector analysis should include analysis of the needs and situation of marginalized groups, including children with disabilities. The appraisal section of the Guidelines, which guides development partners’ assessment and endorsement of the sector plan (on which eligibility for GPE funding is based), also refers to disability. It promotes target setting for each of the marginalized and at-risk groups such as children with disabilities as well as underserved communities, girls, the poor, orphans, children in hard to reach communities, ethnic minorities, refugee and internally displaced populations, and children affected by HIV and AIDS. The guidelines also promote the identification of specific strategies and activities to ensure equity in the provision of basic inputs across these groups as well as an inclusive approach to mainstreaming support to marginalized groups.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[sector plans]]] – the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) team of the GPE Secretariat is conducting a comprehensive evaluation of member countries’ education sector plans.  The evaluation includes an equity dimension that assesses, for example, whether sector plans address education for children with special needs. It will inform improvements to sector monitoring and help to identify data gaps. The evaluation is expected to be concluded by mid-2014. Previous analyses indicate sector plans in a number of GPE – endorsed countries include specific strategies to target children with special needs, and detailed activities and timelines.  

[[[Guyana]]]

[[[’s]]] education sector plan, for example, includes specific activities such as conducting a national study to determine the number of students with special needs as well as creating special resource centers. Similarly, 

[[[Ethiopia]]] has adopted a strategy for special needs education within its education sector program. &#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[children with special needs]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[- ]]]several GPE grants directly finance education activities for children with special needs. In 

[[[Cambodia]]], for example, a GPE grant of US $57.4 million for the period 2008-2012 is supporting the Ministry of Education and Youth to conduct a survey on the needs of marginalized and disabled children excluded from education. A total of 13,175 children aged 11-15 were screened  in 56 elementary schools under the Out-of-School and Disability Survey, which used a state-of-the-art methodology for data collection and referring to services of children with disabilities and impairments, and provided them with eye glasses at the low cost of US $2 a pair. For the first time, the survey also provided high-quality data on disability and education, which enabled the Ministry to plan and budget for more targeted interventions, and ultimately better address the issue of access to primary education for the most marginalized. As a result, the out-of-school population in Cambodia was halved between 2007 and 2011, a large part of which was due to a significant increase in the amount of disabled children able to attend school. Under this initiative, teachers from 56 schools were trained on vision testing so teachers can assess whether children need to be referred for refraction or for an eye exam. The results of the GPE-funded survey were also shared with other Ministries and development partners in Cambodia, prompting a number of education programs to support children with disabilities and impairments. These initiatives range from inclusive teacher training, to disability awareness campaigns, and vision and hearing screenings for children in primary schools.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Similarly, 

[[[Moldova]]] is currently implementing a GPE grant of US $4.4 million for the period 2012 to 2014, with the aim of improving access, quality and inclusiveness of preschool education. The grant is a continuation of two successfully completed grants implemented from 2006 to 2010. Since 2006, GPE has provided Moldova with technical assistance to revise sanitary reforms and legislation encouraging inclusive approaches, as well as the promotion of integrated services across the education, health and social protection sectors. Moldova has also developed key documents promoting inclusiveness such as standards for learning and development of children (from birth to 7 years old), standards for pre-school teachers, and a guide on socio-educational inclusiveness of children with disabilities, and continues to promote inclusive approaches through a broader teacher training/mentoring program. With the support of GPE, two ‘pilot’ centers have been established for the rehabilitation of children with special needs within mainstream kindergartens in Straseni and in Criuleni (respectively 15 and 24 children benefitted). More recently, GPE funding supported the establishment of one additional rehabilitation center for children with disabilities in Ceadir Lunga UTAG Gagauzia (61 beneficiaries), and there are plans are to create a similar center in Nisporeni (17 expected beneficiaries). GPE support has also helped to leverage support from other partners, such as UNICEF and local NGOs, for the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream institutions.&#xa0;

[[[(GRA) Program]]] - the GRA Program supports capacity development, knowledge sharing and knowledge development at the regional and global levels and is complementary to the country level process. It fosters innovation through the systematic provision of services and products that enlighten, engage, and energize partners to apply new knowledge and evidence based good practices to resolve education challenges. A proposal submitted by the World Bank was approved in July 2013 for US $3 million to improve the management of moderate disabilities of school-age children through school based health interventions to ensure children, especially girls, complete primary education. The program aims to improve learning outcomes and access to education in 15 GPE developing partner countries, including 10 countries in Africa and 5 in Southeast Asia. The program will address knowledge gaps in operational and technical understanding of disability and provide the support needed to include children with disabilities, impairments and untreated health conditions to prevent them from dropping out, and to improve access to education. The activity will be managed by the World Bank in cooperation with WHO, Sight Savers, Save the Children, Partnership for Child Development, Imperial College, Children Without Worms and national NGOs will be involved at country level. &#xa0;3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Data S]]]

[[[trategy for I]]]

[[[mproved Education Sector Planning and Implementation]]] – in many GPE countries the lack of reliable data, including data on children with disabilities, remains a major constraint. This is especially the case in fragile and conflict-affected states, which account for almost half of GPE’s overall country portfolio. As noted in the MAR Update 2013, the Global Partnership has already made considerable progress in the area of results by introducing a systematic framework for aggregated results reporting, and by publishing an increasing volume of data on its work. These reforms have enhanced GPE’s capacity to assess the extent to which GPE-endorsed education sector plans address disability, and whether the educational needs of all children are addressed in GPE countries.&#xa0;3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, the Partnership has recently put in place a

[[[ ]]]Data Strategy for Improved Education Sector Planning and Implementation. The strategy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing a number of data-related challenges in GPE countries, particularly in relation to the need for timely reliable data as a basis for effective monitoring of the implementation of education sector plans. The new strategy sets out a number of concrete steps the GPE intends to take in this regard, including: &#xa0;               developing a proposal for financing education sector analysis&#xa0;The new strategy will help the Global Partnership to better measure the impact of its work at country-level, and in addressing the education needs of all children.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A major revision of the GPE funding model is underway to maximize the efficient and effective use of GPE resources in order to help achieve its mission. Taking into consideration the results of the MAR, lessons learned and feedback from its partners, the revised funding model will incentivize and reward the delivery of results against strategic plan objectives, development effectiveness and increasing value for money; and leverage additional domestic and external financing for education. &#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Revision of the GPE Fund will precede replenishment of the Global Partnership (2015 to 2018). The replenishment campaign was announced in New York in September, and will culminate in a pledging conference on the 26th of June in Brusssels, hosted by the EU. The replenishment of the Global Partnership is an opportunity for the international community to turn around the current decline in donor aid for basic education and leverage additional domestic resources to create lasting change. &#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With its country-led and inclusive approach, 

[[[the Global Partnership ]]]

[[[is ]]]

[[[an investment in transformative development]]]

[[[ and a model for the post-2015 framework]]]. A successful replenishment will cement GPE’s value-added in providing a global picture of the extent to which education sector plans address the educational needs of the most marginalized, and based on this, promote inclusive education and best policy and practice for children with special needs in GPE countries. Renewed support will also enable the Global Partnership to effectively champion inclusive education and to advocate for the inclusion of important equity dimensions of education in the post 2015 development agenda.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 2002, the Global Partnership has allocated nearly USD 3.8 billion (by the end of 2013) to 59 countries in support of education. More than 40% of GPE’s total disbursements supported children’s education in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Specifically, GPE helped put an additional 58 million children in primary school; increased primary school completion rates and literacy rates, especially among young girls; and spurred developing partner governments to increase their domestic financing for basic education. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK is the largest donor to GPE followed by Australia and Denmark. Under GPE’s 2011-2014 replenishment cycle the UK has pledged over USD 400 million (subsequently revised to over USD 475 million), and has helped the Global Partnership achieve significant results particularly in the area of girls’ education, learning and education in fragile and conflict-affected states. The UK is also a member of the GPE Board of Directors - Donor Constituency 3, and is a Supervising Entity for GPE grants in Rwanda and Zambia.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2011, the UK MAR highlighted several strengths for the Global Partnership including: the allocation of a significant portion (65%) of its resources to countries in the top quartile of the index of poor countries; its strong contribution to MDGs 2 and 3; and positive reforms in relation to governance, financing and results. The review also suggested a number of priority reforms, particularly in the areas of results and strategic and performance management. The recently published MAR Update 2013 ranks GPE fourth of all multilateral organizations reviewed for progress against the reform priorities identified in the original review. Specific examples cited in the MAR Update for GPE include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; aggregated reporting on GPE results and education outcomes in developing partner countries&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; revised grant application appraisal process emphasizing gender equality&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; accelerated funding for fragile countries, which has led to a 50% increase in the pool of GPE-funded fragile states  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; developed a Strategic Plan 2012 – 2015, with suitably ambitious goals and objectives&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; revised funding model which is more transparent and predictable, and&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; expanded GPE Secretariat providing better advice and technical support to developing country partners.&#xa0;&#xa0;8&#xa0;
