[[[MEP]]]&#xa0;

[[[Q153 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much for giving up your time, which we know is very precious. I know you are doing lots of other things. It is very nice to meet you again. This session will probably last approximately 60 minutes. Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Do any of you have relevant interests? No, so you will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website.I am going to ask if you could begin by stating, for the benefit of the transcriber, your name and official title.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: My name is Emer Costello. I am the MEP for Dublin region in Ireland and I am a Labour Party MEP for Dublin, Ireland.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. I think you probably know what the purpose of our inquiry is: we are part of the European Union Select Committee of the House of Lords. We have the remit to look at the internal market infrastructure and employment. Of course, we do reports and send them to the Commission and to the Government. Our last witness said that she had seen our reports and thought that they were quite good. We are obviously following the Directive on unemployment, and we decided to look into this because the consensus is that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Unfortunately there are all sorts of reasons for that. We have had a lot of witness sessions from youth, businesses and all sorts of people involved in employment. We are nearing the end of our inquiry now, and we will probably produce a report in mid-April before the Easter Recess. We thought it was a good idea to come over here to see how we could unravel some of the problems we still have with the information we have been getting. We have 12 on the Committee. For reasons of resources and all the rest of it only a few have come on this trip—there is not a lot of point in taking too many people on trips such as this—but I am very grateful to members of the Committee who have given up these two days to do this. I am particularly grateful to you for giving us your time for us. We are going to ask you questions. You have had notice of the questions?

[[[Emer Costello]]]: I have indeed, yes.

[[[Q154 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] I said that there is a general consensus that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Could you summarise for us your own view of the exact nature of the current problems, and the issues that you are more concerned about?

[[[Emer Costello]]]: I will preface any remarks by welcoming you to the European Parliament, and commending you on taking the time to come here to the European Parliament to investigate and explore these issues at a European level here in Brussels. I think it is a fantastic initiative and I really do want to commend you.Secondly, I am a member of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee in the European Parliament. Youth unemployment is a major issue in Ireland. It has certainly been one of the issues that I have particularly focused on since taking my seat here in the European Parliament almost two years ago. To that end, I have been holding a series of meetings across the Dublin region, doing consultations with the various different stakeholder organisations, young people, people who work with young people in the business, education, youth work and training sectors, and those who come from unemployment organisations—the whole gambit of stakeholder involvement. I have been holding those meetings, first, to identify the issues that are particularly relevant in the Dublin region and to look at what those stakeholders feel would be the solution. That is my background and experience and how I came to this. At the end I can give you a copy of the speech I gave to the last meeting and a copy of the report that I submitted to the Irish Government, which is in relation to the consultations that I have been having. I have also given Commissioner László Andor

[[[ ]]]a copy of my report.As you are aware, youth unemployment is one of the greatest crises—if not the greatest crisis—that is facing the EU. One in four under 25 year-olds is unemployed in the European Union. We have approximately 26 million unemployed across the European Union. About 5.5 million young people are unemployed. There are a number of issues that concern me about that from a Dublin perspective. One of the biggest issues that is facing us in Ireland, particularly in Dublin, is the huge level of emigration of young people. It is a particular issue and problem because it is causing a major brain drain. Even the 1980s—I come from that generation—a lot of people emigrated across the water to the UK. However, now we find that with the crisis that is facing Europe, people are now looking much further afield and are going to Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They are travelling continents apart. The scale of emigration is having, and will continue to have, a major impact on Ireland and on the Irish economy. We are losing some of our brightest and our best. That is not to say that those who stay are not bright and not some of our best, but at the same time it is a very worrying development.I am very much an advocate of enabling and facilitating people to travel, because I believe that for young people to travel to work outside their country of origin is hugely educational and very insightful and when they come home they bring back certain skills. That can be hugely important. So while I would advocate very much that people should travel, many people, particularly many young families, are leaving and are not travelling with the intention of coming home. They are putting down roots in other places, and that is particularly worrying.Another aspect of the whole youth unemployment issue, which is relevant to Ireland but applies to most European countries, is that many of the young people who are unemployed are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Many of them are a year or more unemployed. That has a real scarring effect on their own lives with their families and with their communities in terms of their ultimate ability to find employment, their earning capabilities, and even right through to their pension rights. That will have a major impact, and one of the legacies that we see very much as a result of the austerity and troika period that we have had in Ireland is long-term unemployment, particularly among young people, who may never fully recover from that experience. They are not able to make the kind of personal decisions at milestones in their lives that young people are normally able to make. They are not able to decide to leave home and live independently, and it is very difficult for them to make decisions about getting married and starting a family. All those decisions are deferred, postponed or somehow altered and there is no natural progression for these young people. That is the real scarring impact of unemployment on young people. The families of young people and parents are absolutely heartbroken. Over the Christmas period in particular we are struck by various different stories of families on Skype to families in Australia, and by grandparents who have never seen their grandchildren. It is really sad. Those kinds of issues are felt quite acutely, and it is something that I am conscious of. Youth unemployment is a major issue in Ireland, particularly in my own constituency of Dublin. To highlight the extent of it in Dublin, the rate of youth unemployment is about 28% and approximately 60,000 young people are signing on. That does not tell the whole story of those who may not be in education, employment or training either, so we know that there are more. We know that about a third of the young unemployed people in Ireland live in Dublin; they are concentrated in the capital city. That has a very negative impact on the city. It is not good for the city and it is not good for social issues or the communities where these young people are living and wandering about maybe with a sense of aimlessness. These are the huge problems that we are facing. It is important to say that if an economy wants to be dynamic and competitive, it is very difficult to call yourself an open, dynamic, competitive economy when one in three or four of your young people are unemployed. That is really difficult. It is a major challenge and one that we have to address for the long term.

[[[Q155 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Thank you very much for that introduction. Clearly, it is not just a European problem, it is an international problem, or could be in due course. The Committee may be concerned—I am certainly concerned—about the co-ordination not only of the Commission but of national Governments, trade unions and employers. Surely, we should be treating this—and I would welcome your views on this—as a major problem. Do you think we are getting it all together when it comes to the exchange of best practice between different countries, proper co-ordination and leadership?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] This time last year, certainly the European Parliament had long identified youth unemployment as the major issue that was facing the European Union. This time last year, under the Irish presidency the conclusion of the EPSCO council was very clear, and the conclusions of the council at the start of the year when the Heads of Government came, was that it was very important that we dealt with the issue of youth unemployment. On 6 February 2013 the EPSCO council put in place that this would be a priority of the Irish presidency that this be dealt with, that it should be dealt with in a co-ordinated way, that there should be some kind of European funding and that there should be a programme to tackle the problem so that it was not tackled in an ad hoc way.It was very much the European Parliament that proposed the Youth Guarantee and the concept of a youth guarantee. The Commission took that proposal on board and was very positive about it. I think it was an affirmation of that when the EPSCO Council said, “Okay, we believe in this, and if we are seriously going to pursue the issue of youth unemployment we have to put financial resources behind it”. So it was agreed that €6 billion in financial resources would go into the Youth Guarantee: €3 billion from the youth employment and €3 billion from the European Social Fund. It was hugely important that there was that proposal.Currently, all member states in the European Union co-ordinating youth employment and youth unemployment responses have been asked to put together a proposal for their youth employment programmes. The Youth Guarantee money applies to countries with regions where youth unemployment is over 25%. As far as I know, the Commissioner told us before that that 21 out of 28 countries would be entitled to draw down funding from that.To answer your question, it took some time to acknowledge that youth unemployment was a problem that needed to be addressed in a co-ordinated way. We have not yet seen all submissions from the member states as to how they intend to draw down the money and what programmes they are putting in. I have a request in at the moment, and I understand that the Irish Government under Joan Burton have put in a request and their programme for funding. I am waiting to see that. I believe that the quality of those programmes will be assessed by the Commission. It is important that those programmes do not just draw down European funding but are clear, co-ordinated responses and have all the stakeholders involved. That is why I engaged with the trade unions, employers’ organisations, education and training experts, people who were working in the field of youth work and young people themselves. I consulted them in a series of meetings I had across Dublin. Some of the findings from that were important, but they are also saying that there is no co-ordinated approach at the moment. It is hoped that perhaps the Youth Employment Initiative will pull that together.

[[[Q156 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Is it appropriate for the EU Commission to have a role in youth unemployment? What you have said is absolutely appropriate for Ireland, and certainly sharing examples with us would be useful. But there are certain countries in the European Union where that would not necessarily be appropriate. I would have thought that this was in the area of “good to have” and “let us see if whether we can produce a framework”—we the Commission—but is being so descriptive and prescriptive not going to take up a huge amount of bureaucratic time?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] I feel it is really important that this is seen to be a priority of the European Union. Employment, and the aim and aspiration of full employment, has to be a priority that the European Union upholds and supports in whatever way it can. I agree with you in the sense that some countries have more acute problems than others. It is important to acknowledge that. That is why the Youth Employment Initiative targeted specific countries with high levels of unemployment. It is also important to acknowledge that all countries are having increasing problems of youth unemployment, even countries that did not traditionally have it. When we are looking to achieve full employment and to put people into work it is important that we try to ensure that we are able to provide decent work. The decent work agenda should really accompany this. That is why it is important that mechanisms are put in place to make young people job-ready. It is not as if there are no vacancies, even in the European Union, but there is a huge skills mismatch.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You are absolutely right.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: That can be supported through the use of EU funds, such as the ERASMUS+ funding, which is aimed at all levels of students.One of the issues that has also come up, very much in my own seminars in Dublin, is the whole issue of vocational education and training. In some countries, vocational education and training has equal status with higher education, and people who have the accreditation from vocational training are respected as much as any of the professions. However, in Ireland and probably in the UK also, because our systems are very similar, there is a huge respect for higher education, and vocational education is very often treated as the Cinderella or the poor relation. So there is a need. The European Commission also, in its education and training programme, has a major role to fulfil in helping to change mindsets and to achieve parity of esteem for vocational education.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is exactly right.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: I am very concerned and working towards this in Ireland and looking to see how we can actually achieve this.

[[[The Chairman:]]] In terms of good practice, the German system of apprenticeships is one area.

[[[Emer Costello:]]] That is right, and the dual system of education in Austria or Finland is another. The other issue for Ireland is that there are five main categories of apprenticeship, which are divided into trades. If you look at the experience in many other countries there are hundreds of different areas of apprenticeships.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Exactly.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: In Ireland, the Minister for Education, Ruairí Quinn, is currently undertaking a review of apprenticeship. One of the areas that is being looked at is how can we expand apprenticeships into areas like the green economy, caring and the hospitality industry.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You made a point about ERASMUS. That is the first time that has been mentioned today. ERASMUS is tailing off at a time when it should be becoming more important. Do you know of any reasons for that?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] I would not actually agree. The new programme, ERASMUS+, is a redesign of the life-long learning programme. I come from a background—and have to declare my interest in this—of 10 years working in Léargas, the national agency in Ireland. I worked very closely particularly with the British Council, which had the contract to manage the programme in the UK. We worked with all the national agencies. I worked in the national agency that had the co-ordination responsibility for all the education programmes. We did not do ERASMUS itself, the Higher Education Authority did that, but we did all the school and adult education programmes and all the other programmes. We also did Leonardo da Vinci, the vocational training programme, and the youth programmes. I see that there is enormous potential in programmes like that. I objected to the name of the new programme, ERASMUS+, because I think it is elitist and brings up connotations just with higher education. I was quite attached to the name of Leonardo da Vinci.I do think that those programmes have a major role to play. Leonardo da Vinci, for example, is a really innovative programme that will equip people with employment skills. I was Lord Mayor of Dublin in 2009-10, and I established what was called the Lord Mayor’s Commission on Employment, because at that stage the crisis was very much beginning to take root in Dublin. I was hugely concerned about the challenges that were facing Dublin city. One of the actions that came out of that was that we joined forces with one of the institutes of technology in Tipperary. It was involved in a Leonardo da Vinci programme with an institute in Germany retrofitting and housing insulation. It was a hugely successful programme. A lot of the people who participated in those types of programmes, even short vocational training programmes, were able find jobs in a self-employed capacity, having completed some of that training. Programmes like Leonardo da Vinci, which develop people’s vocational training, open up new horizons and give them the opportunity to gain work experience in another country, are hugely important. The experience of ERASMUS students travelling abroad is important. The new ERASMUS+ programme, which will become evident as it is rolled out, is geared to try to enhance young people’s skills and try to make them job-ready.

[[[Q157 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I would like to pick up on the different elements of the actions the EU is taking. There is the youth employment programme: the Youth Guarantee. Then there is the Youth Employment Initiative, with the extra money that has been found of €6 billion. There is also an emphasis on some of the European Social Fund programme now being devoted to creating employment opportunities for younger people. You mentioned that you had been running seminars. I know it is early to judge how the latter part of these programmes is working, but you mentioned that there was a feeling that there was a lack of co-ordination. Can you elaborate on that? Where do you think there is a lack of co-operation and what could be done to try to change it? Are we getting best value from these initiatives or could more be done?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] In the first instance, a lot will depend on how the youth employment initiatives are rolled out. To date, there are a number of issues. In Ireland there have been a number of training agencies and vocational and education training boards. A lot of changes are taking place in relation to that at the moment. There are community employment initiatives and vocational training programmes. Sometimes there is not as much co-operation as there might be between the various different elements that are involved. I think that was one of the issues that Ruairí Quinn saw when he took on the role of Minister for Education: there are labour activation courses, there is community employment, and then there are education programmes. The training courses were operated through what were then the FÁS centres, and they came under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, whereas a lot of the education programmes came out of the Department of Education and Skills. So in Ireland there is an attempt to try to co-ordinate that now to see if we can come up with a more comprehensive system.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] In a sense, you are trying to bring the business side closer to education.

[[[Emer Costello:]]] Yes. The other thing that we are doing is rolling out the new Intreo centres. That means when a person finds themselves unemployed and they turn up at an employment exchange for the first time to sign on, it is not that they are going in to sign on and receive money; they are going to a centre that is going to facilitate their entry back into the workforce as quickly as possible. So the Intreo centres are not just places where people collect their cheques or sign on for their giros or whatever; they are places they will go to where they will be provided with job advice and counselling. A personalised training and education programme can be put in place for that person. That is something that I think has been missing, and the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, is very keen that we should try to activate that.That is where the Youth Guarantee will be very important. The Youth Guarantee is supposed to be based on a rights-based approach that will look at the needs of the person, rather than just trying to slot people into the existing provision. As somebody who was a counsellor and worked very much underground in my local area, I could see the problem, too, where you do one course, you do one programme, and all of a sudden you are told it is two years before you can do anything else. Having done a programme or having done a course a person will say, “I know that I need to get the skills in this particular area”. But when they try to get the skills in that particular area they are told, “Sorry, because you have done this programme you are not entitled to do anything further for another two years. Go away and come back to us in two years’ time”. That is an absolutely crazy situation to have. So I think that rolling out the Intreo centres will be quite useful.The other thing I mentioned is that we are reviewing the apprenticeship programme at the moment. A lot of the youth organisations said that it is really important that the Youth Guarantee and the youth programmes that we have should be voluntary: that young people should not be compelled to take part in them. Certainly, there is a major carrot involved for them, because since we began to discuss this, as you are probably aware the budget situation in Ireland has become quite serious. We had a very difficult budget. We had to take €2.5 billion out of our economy in the last budget in October. There was a request by the troika to take €3.1 billion out of the economy but the Labour Party insisted that no more than €2.5 billion would be taken out of the economy. From my perspective, one of the more painful and difficult budgetary decisions was the decision to reduce the level of benefits that are given to young people. So there is a substantial incentive given to young people to start training programmes. They will certainly be paid much more than they would be paid if they were unemployed and claiming unemployment benefit.

[[[Q158 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] I would like to pursue the question of who does what best. You are making a strong case for the EU being involved in doing things, and that the Youth Guarantee is one of those. What things do you think are better done at that sort of level by the European Union and what things are better done by member states? How would you rate that problem?

[[[Emer Costello]]]: I think that the European Union through the provision of funding, such as provided by the Youth Guarantee or the European Social Fund, should provide member states with the capacity to deliver what is needed. I do not see it as, “This set of actions is youth actions and this set of funding is national actions”. That is important as we try to develop a European framework of qualifications and try to address a proper system of mutual recognition of qualifications across the EU.From that point of view, while member states are very well equipped to design and develop their own national qualification systems and work within that, it is important that there is a co-ordination and transparency of qualifications across the European Union, which will facilitate the mobility and the freedom of movement of workers across the EU. It is very difficult to have the mobility that the EU aspires to, and which the internal market would say we should have, if we do not have a mutual recognition of qualifications. There is an important role for the EU there to come up with some funding for it, but I would not say that one is exclusive of the other.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] How do you rate the way in which the various EU policies have been applied in Ireland? How would you rate the effectiveness of the different policies?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] I would say that Ireland is one of the real success stories of EU funding. The European Social Fund is particularly important. Last year we celebrated 40 years since our entry into the European Union and the referendum. I think Ireland and the UK entered at the same time. At the time Ireland entered the EU, from our perspective there have been huge advances, because joining the European Union, or the Common Market as it was called then, opened up a huge market. Quite frankly, before that Ireland was very dependent on the UK’s cheap food policy. We were seen as a mechanism for providing the UK with food, but we had difficulty reaching markets outside of that. One of the successes of Ireland’s entry into the European Union was workers’ and women’s rights. I am not sure what the situation was in the UK at the time, but when we joined the European Union there was a marriage bar for women in the Civil Service; women had to resign from the Civil Service once they got married.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That was not so in the UK.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: That was not so in the UK but we had that in Ireland. There was the whole equality treatment in terms of social protection, but one of the big areas that helped Ireland to advance, with its entry into the European Union, was the development of the institutes of technology, or the regional technical colleges as they were called at the time. This goes back to the whole idea of vocational training. Instead of developing a whole series of universities—we had three or four universities: as much as we could sustain—we developed a lot of the regional technical colleges in strategic locations. My own hometown, Dundalk—although I represent Dublin and I have lived in Dublin longer than I have lived anywhere else, I am originally from Dundalk, which is just on the border between Dublin and Belfast—had a very blighted history in many ways, being a border town, and it had developed a certain reputation over the years as well.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Bandit country.

[[[Emer Costello:]]] So they say. I would not necessarily agree with that, but it suffered the consequences of being a town on the border. It developed an institute—an RTC—which is now an institute of technology, and that has contributed to the overall development of the town and its ability to attract major industries there. So I think that Ireland does demonstrate success. Also, the structural fund has helped us to develop a whole road network, and our infrastructure to a large extent. Becoming a member of the European Union was hugely beneficial to Ireland, no more so than the whole area of the Social Fund, the development of education and training programmes through the ESF. I know that the state training agency developed, apart from the regional technical colleges, many programmes that are funded through ESF as well. Many of the participants in those programmes became highly skilled and were able to go on to make Ireland the knowledge economy that it is now, an economy that is capable of attracting high-end industry. We have had a lot of various different member states come to Ireland to see how Ireland has drawn down the Social Fund as well.

[[[Q159 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is a great example and we all know it. What has happened in Ireland is rammed down our throats all the time, which is great. The point is that we are where we are and we are all affected by this high youth unemployment, which has long-term effects on whether people who are out of work for any length of time are ever going to be employable again, and all the social problems that you have mentioned.I am told we are running out of time, so I will ask you the question. To what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand-side, the availability of jobs, and how well are young people prepared for the labour market with regard to their skills or employability?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] This is another big issue that has come up. People say, “The Youth Guarantee says that a young person will be made a quality offer within four months of leaving full-time employment or education”. Perhaps we could touch on that before we finish: a quality offer of an apprenticeship, a training place or education place, and an offer of a place within four months. The question comes up, “Well, what happens at the end of that training period if the jobs are not there?”. I suppose in the first instance, while we are experiencing the downturn, it is important that we have people who are job-ready for when the economy does actually recover. So there is very much that, but I think there has to be dual action in preparing people for the job market without being able to provide the jobs. That can be difficult. You can do so much in trying to address the skills mismatch, which I mentioned earlier. I think it is hugely important to address the skills mismatch. At the same time, there will be people who will emerge from these training programmes with the expectation of getting a job. That is why, from my point of view and from the perspective of my political group here in the European Parliament, Europe needs to come up with an injection of stimulus or growth that will see growth in the economy that will help create jobs.

[[[Q160 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] I will just throw a statistic at you. I do not know whether it is true or false and perhaps you can tell me. The Irish Prime Minister said that if all the IT jobs that were vacant in Ireland were filled there would be no youth unemployment. In other words, the jobs are there but the skills are not. We all think we are brilliant at IT, but we are not, with all the new developments in IT. If the EU has to be involved in trying to divvy up the whole thing, would it not be better to be doing something specifically aimed at IT training in every member state?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] Certainly in a country like Ireland IT training is particularly important. I am not familiar with that particular quote from the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny. What I would say is that I know a number of companies that do locate to Ireland, particularly some of the IT companies, may locate some of their sales positions there. One of the huge problems is languages. The Commissioner had an interesting perspective on this. I had a meeting with him some months ago in relation to the roll-out of the Youth Guarantee. I said that people from countries like Ireland are going to America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and he said that it is interesting to see, when you look at the level of vacancies across the European Union, that they are choosing to travel not across the European Union but to different continents. That is very often because they travel to a continent where they have a language affinity.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, exactly.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: Not only IT training but the way we teach languages in schools is going to have to be revised. We have to look at producing people who have high quality language skills.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, that is absolutely right. Look, this has been fascinating and we could stay here for another hour but unfortunately we are being booted out. Well, not as inelegantly as that. I am sure that lots of ideas will come to you over the next few days, so can I ask if you could jot them down to help us in our report and to further our discussions? We are almost at the end of witness taking so we would be most grateful.

[[[Emer ]]]

[[[Costello]]]: Can I leave these with you? These are copies of my report. I had another meeting in Tallaght in November. That is annexed there. That is the full report of all the meetings that I held with the stakeholders. The names of the stakeholders who attended the meetings are there, so even though you will not be familiar with the organisations it will give you an idea of who they are and what we did. I will leave you with all the copies of those that I have, and I will give you a copy of the speech that I gave at the last meeting because that tried to encapsulate some of the issues that came up at some of the other meetings.

[[[The Chairman:]]] If you were in my position now, what questions would you be asking you?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] Wow, now there is a question. To be honest, the questions that you had here are very important, but one of the areas that we need to look at is how to give young people some kind of ownership and hope. If we are talking about youth employment initiatives, I think the involvement of young people in the roll-out of those is hugely important.

[[[The Chairman:]]] We have had young people as witnesses.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: I am very impressed, yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] We had them and it was really fiery. When I asked my first question about which organisation they go to for jobs, they just said in front of us—we are Members of the House of Lords, do not forget—“Job Centres are crap”, and it went on from there. But it was good. They said they really felt engaged with us and I think they were delighted that we had gone to the trouble. We did the same in Birmingham. They were tough and they brought us down from whatever cloud we were on. I give you the tip that if more European countries actually asked their young people, they might get some staggering answers—not that they would necessarily use that word. I think that we have covered that, but if you think of any other points that we should cover because we only have a few weeks left.

[[[Emer Costello:]]] The other issue that I mentioned to you was the quality framework, which I believe is hugely important. If we are developing internships and placement programmes or whatever, it is important that we develop that framework. I know that the Commission has moved towards developing a quality framework for traineeships and internships. That has to be developed and improved on. There is a possibility that they could be open to abuse, but at the same time I believe that internships can provide a major stepping stone into employment. They are good for employers, and they are good for employees. It gives them a chance to try each other out, and that is very important.

[[[Q161 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Are you working at trying to develop a framework for those?

[[[Emer Costello:]]] Yes, we are, but I think it has to come with a contract. It has to come with something that says that a certain level of skills will be delivered. Ideally, I would like to see it come with an accreditation process at the end, which perhaps could be tied into the accreditation of prior learning. Therefore the skills derived over a period of training in a job placement would be accredited in some way, so that somebody would have something that sits within the European qualifications framework that they could see.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you so much.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: I hope that that was useful.

[[[The Chairman:]]] In fact, we are not being booted out but you are.

[[[Emer Costello]]]: That is fine as I have other places to go to. It was nice to see you.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It was nice to see you too. &#xa0;
