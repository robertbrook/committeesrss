[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;1.1              With a membership of over 410,000 registered nurses, midwives, health visitors, nursing students, health care assistants and nurse cadets, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the voice of nursing across the UK and the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world. RCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promotes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the Government, the UK parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations.&#xa0;1.2              The RCN welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Health Committee’s annual inquiry in to public expenditure in the NHS. The RCN has responded to the elements of the terms of reference as posed by the Committee which it feels qualified to comment on. &#xa0;

[[[Plans being m]]]

[[[ade by NHS bodies to enable them to meet the Nicholson Challenge, and whether the NHS is succeeding in making efficiency gains rather that cuts. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1              The RCN accepts that the NHS needs to make financial efficiency savings due to the current economic climate. However, in far too many cases, as we have highlighted in previous submissions to the Committee, NHS bodies are making short term cuts to services and personnel rather than well thought through, genuine efficiency savings. These cuts will, and are, inevitably affecting the quality of patient care. &#xa0;3.2              The RCN’s Frontline First campaign collects and publishes data on cuts to NHS personnel and specifically nursing posts. The campaign calls for our members on the ground to tell us where they are seeing cuts to posts, where waste is evident and where innovations are developed. This information is then robustly verified and analysed before it is published. More recently the campaign has developed to use the Government’s own workforce figures. &#xa0;3.3              According to the most recent data (for July 2013), the qualified nursing, midwifery and health visiting workforce lost 3,859 FTE roles (6,468 headcount) since May 2010, a decrease of 1.2 per cent.&#xa0;Support to doctors and nursing staff, including roles such as health care assistants and assistant practitioners, has also decreased by a similar proportion, with 2,719 full time posts lost (7,058 headcount).&#xa0;3.4              Although the aggregated qualified nursing, midwifery and health visiting workforce has decreased over the last three years, the picture is more complex than this. Workforce numbers for both qualified midwives and qualified health visitors have actually increased. The midwifery workforce has increased by 1,311 FTE roles since May 2010, and the health visiting workforce has increased by 700 FTE roles. These figures, however, blur the effect of cuts to the nursing workforce. If these figures are removed from the aggregated data, it indicates a&#xa0;true fall of 5,870 FTE nurse roles (or 7,578 headcount) since May 2010.&#xa0;3.5              Although the nursing workforce has decreased overall, posts have been lost from different services at varying rates. The RCN is extremely concerned that the areas which have seen the greatest proportional workforce losses are also those where investment is urgently needed.&#xa0;3.6              In mental health services, the workforce has seen a decrease of nearly 2,000 full time nursing staff since 2010.&#xa0;This is despite years of rising demand for mental health care. In England, 48,631 people were detained in hospital for assessment and/or treatment of a mental disorder under the Mental Health Act in 2011/2012, and a further 4,220 patients were subject to community treatment orders (CTOs) – a 5 per cent increase in detentions and 10 per cent increase in CTOs compared to the previous year. Mental health services are now showing increasing levels of strain, with evidence suggesting that at least 1,711 mental health beds (9 per cent of the total) were closed between April 2011 and August 2013.&#xa0;The learning disability nursing workforce has also seen significant long term decline, with 800 full time roles lost since 2010, a fall of around 15 per cent.&#xa0;3.7              After a decade of workforce expansion, peaking in 2009-2010, the community nursing workforce has in the last three years seen a fall of 1,744 full time roles, or 3.6 per cent of the workforce.&#xa0;Despite rhetoric of a shift from acute to community models of care, the proportion of nurses working in community services has changed very little, from 14.3 per cent of the total nursing workforce in 2002, to 15.1 per cent in 2012.&#xa0;Losses have been particularly acute in the district nursing workforce, which has been declining year on year for the last decade, with 1,312 full time posts lost since 2010 (a 17 per cent decrease).&#xa0;3.8              In addition to those posts lost so far, the RCN’s 2012 report on the community nursing workforce identified that services would suffer disproportionately more from an ageing nursing workforce.&#xa0;In the community workforce, 38 per cent of nurses were found to be aged 50 and over, compared to 23.6 per cent of the acute, older people and general nursing workforce.&#xa0;With 59.2 per cent of the community nursing workforce aged 45 and over, a large proportion will reach retirement age in the next decade, compounding the urgent need to build the community workforce capacity in the future.&#xa0;3.9              The RCN is also aware, through intelligence and information gathered, of many NHS trusts which have instigated recruitment freezes and delete vacancies so that they can reduce their wage bill through ‘natural wastage’ and avoid making direct job cuts. This obviously has a negative effect on the level of service that can be provided. &#xa0;3.10              Nursing posts are also being downbanded, where nursing staff are having to accept the regrading of their jobs. It is also where experienced qualified nursing posts are replaced with those of a lower band or unregistered health care assistants. The RCN has repeatedly drawn attention to these issues and the risk to patient safety they represent. &#xa0;3.11              Nurse staffing levels and skill mix have a direct impact on the health outcomes that can be achieved. The Government should mandate the use of staffing levels tools which allow for local flexibility and variability. In too many cases we are seeing patients suffer because of inadequate nurse staffing levels. In several recent Government commissioned reports this correlation between nurse staffing levels and patient outcomes has been identified; most recently by Sir Bruce Keogh in his review of 14 NHS trust with above average outliers in mortality rates. These trusts were put under ‘special measures’ with all of them undertaking urgent reviews of their nurse staffing levels. It is clear that these strains have been brought about by financial constraint. Staffing levels and skill mix must be planned and based on a sound clinical rationale, not budget availability.&#xa0;3.12              There is now an overwhelming evidence base for the use of mandatory safe staffing levels; it is now time to act on this evidence. &#xa0;

[[[Effectiveness of the mechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in the NHS.]]]&#xa0;4.1              NHS England is currently reviewing the funding allocation formula that is used to allocate funds to CCGs across England.The proposed revisions to the allocation formula mean that there will be no weighting for levels of deprivation in local areas, or which have poor health outcomes. Instead, the new allocation formula will be based on the predicted demand for health care for the population as a whole. Some of the biggest losers in terms of NHS funding cover the same areas of the country where we have the highest incidences of chronic and long-term illness.&#xa0;4.2              Research published by the HSJ and the University of Liverpool on 7th October 2013 shows that, under the new proposed formula:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.3              The RCN is committed to reducing inequalities in access to health care. The RCN believes that the funding allocation should continue to have a mixed system of weighting to reflect levels of deprivation and also the age of populations in local areas, or which have poor health outcomes.  &#xa0;

[[[Prospects for the long-term viability of NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1              The NHS continues to face one of the most significant financial challenges in its history. The anticipated continuation and increase of costs saving measures within the NHS beyond 2014/15 will inevitably result in even further pressures on the delivery of services. The RCN has consistently highlighted that current funding is unlikely to meet the costs of the rising health demand.&#xa0;5.2              Despite the stated intentions of politicians, health experts and NHS mangers to move services from acute hospitals into the community, both to reduce costs and to have more person-centred care, the RCN on the whole has found very little clear evidence of this shift actually happening on the ground. Moving care away from secondary settings in to the community must be seen as key to achieving meaningful efficiencies and service redesign. &#xa0;5.3              The RCN believes that NHS organisations need to work together to provide real service transformation that brings care closer to home and integrates care around the patient. This can result in efficiency savings and benefit patients, but will require co-operation between trusts and investment in the short-term. &#xa0;

[[[The impact on the provision of adult social care of the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savings]]]&#xa0;6.1              The King’s Fund reports that local authority spending on social care has fallen for four years in succession, and fewer people are using publicly funded care than ever before. With 87 per cent of local authorities setting their eligibility criteria at substantial or higher, it has become much harder for people to access care. &#xa0;6.2              Reducing the spending on social care  will inevitably lead to an increase in need and also the further complication of individuals requiring care. The NHS and nursing staff, both in acute and community settings, are then required to fill the growing gaps in social care provision for patients with increasingly complex conditions. 75 per cent of RCN members responding to a 2012 survey on community nursing said that the pressure on their team had increased as a result of cuts to social care provision made by local authorities.  &#xa0;6.3              Readmissions, or the so-called ‘revolving door’, are a result of insufficient support in social care or community settings. Nursing staff frequently experience the frustration of seeing a healthy patient discharged into community care, only to see them readmitted into acute settings weeks down the line owing to the absence of appropriate community care.  &#xa0;6.4              The Care Quality Commission’s The state of health and adult social care in England: an overview of key themes in care in 2011/12 found that if discharge arrangements and planning for discharge are not sufficient, there is an increased risk of emergency readmission, the national average for emergency readmissions within 0-7 days of discharge that required at least an overnight stay was 2.5 per cent, but this increased to  3.8 per cent for emergency readmissions within 8-30 days, where external factors were more likely to contribute to the readmission.&#xa0;6.5              A recent report from the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation illustrated what we are hearing from our members. It showed that the number of elderly patients who have been readmitted following early discharge has risen from 3,658 in 2001/2 to 6,810 in 2010/11, a rise of 69 per cent. The report also showed that the situation had worsened in the last three years. &#xa0;6.6              Delayed discharge figures can be used to quantify the levels of pick up by the NHS of social care needs.  On any one day a significant number of patients (approximately 4,000 in England), mostly over the age of 75, are being cared for on an acute ward in hospital when they could be cared for in the community.  In 60 per cent of these cases it is caused by social services failing to meet their responsibilities;  they are either not assessing the patient for community care or cannot provide the care the patient needs to be able to leave the acute care setting.

[[[additional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budget]]]&#xa0;7.1              The additional funding taken from the NHS budget - £1 billion a year by 2014 - is intended to be used for partnership working between the NHS and social care providers, to allow for more people to be cared for in the community.  However, this funding is not ring-fenced and the RCN is concerned that this money is not being spent directly on this. The King’s Fund shares this concern and reports that the transfer of NHS resources is helping, but not always in the way intended – to provide additional capacity for care. Of the money allocated from the NHS to promote joint working this year, 32 per cent (£253 million) is being used to offset cuts to local authority services and to help meet demographic pressures.&#xa0;7.2              Using the NHS budget to bail out social care goes against the Government's pledge to ring-fence and protect NHS spending. Without ensuring that these funds are spent on providing social care services, the NHS is still faced with filling the gaps in social care provision with all its associated costs and problems described above, but with £1 billion less funding.&#xa0;

[[[Progress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care services]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1              Integration of health and social care services is not only seen as providing patients with timely access to seamless care, but also a way of eliminating costly duplication of services and ensuring patients are given the care they need in the right setting. However, integration of health and social care services in England is still very much piece meal and individually programme based. &#xa0;8.2              While there are many excellent examples of integrated care delivery across the country, including specific teams, projects and processes, many of which are led or designed by nurses, there is a wide variation. Some examples have been enabled by the development of NHS Care Trusts, integrated or pooled budgets, and the Department of Health’s Health and Social Care Integration Programme (HSCIP). However, there have been inconsistencies in policy and project implementation with no significant learning mechanisms in place or application of best practice. We hope that the Government programme of integration ‘Pioneers’ is successful in developing a tangible way forward in this area. &#xa0;8.3              Funding issues also impact on the ability to integrate services, as RCN members are increasingly informing us, multi-disciplinary teams are being left short of critical impact from social workers and other disciplines owing to budgetary cuts.  This means that patients with complex needs are not benefiting from crucial multi-disciplinary services, which look at their needs holistically and aim to ensure that their patient journey is smooth.     &#xa0;8.4              Despite the notable effort of nursing and other care professionals, the structures, processes and systems in place have not consistently been designed around the service user to allow integrated care. If integrated care is to become a system-wide reality, then consistent political focus and leadership at local and national levels are needed to ensure appropriate mechanisms, including funding, are in place enable the delivery of joined up care at all levels.
