"Written evidence submitted by Helen Mountfield QC, (LAI 0015)&#xa0;OVERVIEW1.  \nI am a QC in private practice \nspecialising in administrative and constitutional law.   I was called to the Bar in 1991 and took silk in 2010.   Before taking silk I was on the Treasury A Panel.   I have appeared bo\nth for and against public authorities\n  in \nall courts of\n England and Wale\ns, the CJEU and the ECtHR.   For example, I represented the Lord Chancellor in  \nWilkinson v Kitzinger (Lord Chancellor &amp; Attorney General Intervening) \n \n[2006] EWHC 2002 \nFam as to the compatibility of the Civil Partnerships Act 2005 with human rights legisl\nation\n.   I sit as a civil recorder and a Deputy High Court judge in the Administrative Court.  \n&#xa0;\n2. \nThis \npaper is my \npersonal \nsubmiss\nion on the implications \nof the government's civil legal aid proposals, set out in its response to the consultation exercise\n, \nTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps. \n&#xa0;\n3\n.  In my view, the proposed changes\n to legal aid\n are a serious thre\nat to the rule of law\n.  They will, if introduced, undermine\n the right of\n access to justice\n: \n in particular, access to justice to challenge improper state action, for some of society's most vulnerable people, and those most vulnerable to abuse of state power (for example, those in its custody).\n4\n.  \nTh\ne\n declared premise of the \nTransforming Legal Ai\nd Proposals \n&#xad;\n \nis \nthat a fair justice system with 'fair outcomes' is essential in our democratic society, and that legal aid is the 'hallmark of a fair, open justice system'.\n  The same has long been recognised by the European Court of Human Rights and other\n European constitutional courts\n.   Access to legal aid as a gateway to access to justice  is especially important when litigation is brought by a subject of st\nate action, to challenge the legality of it\n.   Since \n \njudicial review is the means by which cour\nts restrain the executive when it acts outside the law, access to judicial review is essential to the rule of law and executive accountability.\n5.   The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 \n(LASPO) \nalready severely limits legal aid fo\nr judicial review.  The government acknowledges that the scope for further savings is very small.  Nevertheless, only eight days after LASPO came into force, the Ministry of Justice published proposals which would further remove legal aid for judicial \nrevi\new, in ways and to a point at which would undermine the effective availability of judicial review and its constitutional purpose\n.\n  These changes have not been significantly amended, in response to overwhelming concern expressed in response to the consulta\ntion.\n6\n.  \nA serious feature of the proposals is their intention to remove access to legal aid (and by necessary implication, access to the courts) for groups of people defined by status.   \nA\nnother serious feature is their apparent 'ideological' \nopposition \nto\n judicial review which underpin\ns the proposed changes\n, and the apparent desire to put much state activity beyond court scrutiny by way of judicial review\n.   It has not been disputed that the measures will\n, even on the Ministry of Justice's most \noptimistic view, save very little (£6 million).  Careful figures illustrating that the 'reforms' will\n cost far more than they will save\n have not been disputed\n.  (Indeed the cost of implementing a test where a recipient of legal aid services must prove a pe\nriod of past lawful residence will be almost unworkably complex and costly).  \n7.  \nThe \n principal purpose of the civil legal aid proposals appears to be the \nSecretary of State's intention to cut down on use of judicial review\n.  However, the means chosen to\n achieve this end are not aimed at the cases with low prospects of success, but at particular categories of case, chosen by reference to characteristics of intended litigants, and measures which will prevent \nany \n case, no matter how meritorious, from being\n pursued at a profit. Public statements by the Secretary of State indicate that he perceives judicial review to be \nimproperl\ny used as a tool of political opposition.    This is \nbased on a misunderstanding of the approach taken by the courts, which are astu\nte to \nkeep within their proper constitutional realm, but are an essential check upon misuse of public power where it is exercised unlawfully or improperly.\n7\n.  \nThe proposals - particularly when read in conjunction with the parallel consultation \nJudicial Re\nview: Proposals for Further Reform \n (6 September 2013)  mean that the base of specialist legal suppliers of social welfare law is likely to be removed.   \nThese are not 'fat-cat' lawyers: the equity partners in many successful London legal aid practices are\n paid less than teachers or senior nurses.   \nThe proposed legal aid changes are likely to lead to whole-sale exit from the market, and the experience and expertise lost  will not, therefore, be capable of being replaced  if, \nas seems likely, \nmany suppliers\n cease to provide\n such services altogether \nin the light of the proposed\n changes\n.\n8.  The \nobvious adverse impact of the \nproposals \nfor operation of our justice system has\n generated serious concern across the profession, including from \nthose who act primarily\n \nfor \n public authorities\n, and judges\n.\n It is not insignificant that former House of Lords and Supreme Court judges have expressed themselves in such anxious terms in relation to the proposals\n.  Lord Brown (a former Treasury Devil) questioned whether the p\nroposals were compatible with the Lord Chancellor's duties under section 1 Constitutional Reform Act; Lord Hope (the recently retired Vice President of the Supreme Court) said that \n              \n\"I find it hard to believe that a government which truly respected the ru\nle of law - \n              \nwhich had taken the trouble to understand what that phrase really means, and to \n              \nstudy the\n \nconsequences of what it has in mind - would have contemplated \n              \nintroducing the [civil legal aid proposals]\".\nLord Scott said that respect for the rule of law is \n\"cultural ... it is not to be found in every country and it is not immutable. ... Respect for the rule of law is capable of being forfeited and lost if excessive cuts are made affecting potential litigan\nts .. It cannot be taken fo\nr granted by the Government that that will not happen and I hope they will keep that in mind\".\n9.   It is also almost inconceivable that the government's proposals are compatible with EU law\n (Article 47 of the Charter of Rights),\n Articles 6 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights\n and Article 15 of the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women\n.  Adoption of these proposals \nwould undermine the existence \nof the justice system which our constitutional \ntradition and our international law obligations demand.\n10.   In short, the implications of the proposals to ref\norm civil legal aid\n amount, in many cases, to effective removal of access to \nmechanisms of redress against unlawful state action\n.  The\n \nproposals\n \nundermine \nacc\ness to justice\n, public accountability and the rule of law.  These \nform \n the\n roots of a democratic society\n, and the proposals, in undermining these, undermine democracy\n.  \n&#xa0;THE RESIDENCE TEST11.  The proposal is to exclude from  civil legal \naid\n eligibility\n those who cannot show twelve months lawful residence and those not lawfully present in the United Kingdom.    Note that the onus will be on the person seeking help - perhaps urgently - to demonstrate\n eligibility\n, by\n providing documentary pr\noof\n.\n   Anyone who cannot demonstrate the requisite period of lawful residence \n \nwill be unable to access legal advice or representation, no matter how \nurgent or \nacute their need for help\n.\n12.  The\n proposal\n to introduce a residence test\n undermines the\n principle of equality before the law:  \n\"Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws.   There is no distinction between British nationals and others.  He who is subject to English law \nis entitled to its protection\"\n per Lo\nrd Scarman in \nKhjawaja \n [1984] AC 74 at 111G. \n13.\n  T\nhe proposed exceptions to application of the residence test are very narrow, and leave many obvious injustices and lacunae.   \n14.  \nContrary to some media reports, \n \nno \n general exception \nis proposed \nfor \n'vulnerable persons' or cases concerned with liberty\n.\n \n  \nThus:\n* \nAsylum seekers are included \n \nbut only while they are seeking asylu\nm\n;\n* Current immigration detainees are included \nbut only while they remain detained, and only in relation to challenging the \nfact of their detention\n.   Challenges to mistreatment in detention or discrimination in detention are therefore excluded.  'Tanja', whose case concerning sexual assaults by Serco officers at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre was recently reported  in \nthe \nObserver\n \nnewspaper\n  would not be eligible for legal aid in relation to such complaints.\n* Those who can show reasonable grounds that they are trafficking victims are included \nbut only in rela\ntion to immigration claims, some \nemployment claims and \ndamages claims against the alleged trafficker\n.  In relation to any other advice or challenge (eg concerning eligibility for welfare benefits\n, community care\n or mental health support) \nsuch a person \nwould be out of scope.\n* Victims of domestic violence are i\nncluded \nbut \nagain only in relation to limited categories of claims\n.\n15.   Those who will be excluded from eligibility for legal aid (and hence access to justice) by the residence test include:\n* those who have suffered serious abuse of power by UK state ag\nents but who reside abroad (for example\n Baha Mousa'\ns family, a person extraordinarily rendered to Guantanamo Bay\n);\n* children who have resided in the United Kingdom for most or all of their lives, and\n who would be eligible for formal leave to remain, but\n w\nhose parent\ns\n \nhave\n failed to regularise their immigration status\n.\n* children without parental support who cannot provide evidence of twelve months' lawful residence.\n*  disabled people and mentally ill people who cannot provide proof of twelve months' lawf\nul residence will be unable to access even emergency help.\n16.   There will \nthus \nbe categories of people who\n, irrespective of the extent of their needs or the merits of their case \n are effectively outside the reach of the rule of law.\n   These people are di\nsproportionately likely to be female, or children, or disabled.  Yet the equality consequences of these proposals do not appear to have been considered adequately or at all.  T\nhey are likely to breach article\n 15 of the UN Convention on the Elimination o\nf D\niscrimination Against Women and articles 12 and 13 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n17.  Lest it be suggested that the 'exceptional funding' provisions under s10 LASPO provide an adequate safety net, it is clear that the exc\neptional funding mechani\nsm does not work.   Section 10 LASPO\n provides a theoretical entitlement to assistance if failure to provide it would breach human rights or EU law rights.  However, \nafter six months of the scheme's operation, research showed\n that only 233 applications have been received, and \nof these only six had been granted.   The form is 17 pages long, and there is no funding for solicitors to complete it.  One street homeless man with learning difficulties was refused exceptional funding \nto \nhelp him \nregularise his immigration status so as to enable him to become eligible for community care help\n.\n18.  Nor does it appear that the lacuna could be filled by a public interest body - such as Child Poverty Action Group or Medical Justice - could\n bring a representative claim in relation \nto an area of wider public interest, since the parallel consultation \nJudicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform \n (06/09/2013) proposes removing standing from such bodies.\n19.  It is unlikely that the \nintroductio\nn of a \nresidence test will save money.  In addition to the costs of administering it, \nthere are likely to be significant costs incurred by local authorities dealing with the destitute\n.  T\nhe likelihood is that there will be significantly more self-represen\nting litigants in the Administrative Court list.  The costs of this - to other litigants, \nto the reputation of the British justice system, in creation of delays, and to the administration of courts - are enormous.    They do \n not appear to have been factor\ned in to the ostensible costs savings.\n   See the observations of Lord Justice Ward in \nWright v Michael Wright Supplies Ltd \n [2013] EWCA Civ 234 at [2]:\n\"What I find so depressing is that the case highlights the difficulties increasingly encountered by the \njudiciary at all levels when dealing with litigants in person. Two problems in particular are revealed. The first is how to bring order to the chaos which litigants in person invariably – and wholly understandably – manage to create in putting forward thei\nr claims and defences. Judges should not have to micro-manage cases, coaxing and cajoling the parties to focus on the issues that need to be resolved. Judge Thornton did a brilliant job in that regard yet, as this case shows, that can be disproportionately\n time-consuming. It may be saving the Legal Services Commission which no longer offers legal aid for this kind of litigation but saving expenditure in one public department in this instance simply increases it in the courts. The expense of three judges of \nthe Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurred if the litigants had been represented. With more a\nnd more self-represented litigants, this problem is not going to go away. We may have to accept that we live in austere times, but as I come to the end of eighteen years service in this court, I shall not refrain from expressing my conviction that justice \nwill be ill served indeed by this emasculation of legal aid.\n\"\n&#xa0;\nPRISONERS20.  \nThe MOJ proposes removing  legal aid for a very wide variety of cases arising in prisons (even if internal complaints mechanisms/ombudsmen have not resolved them, even if the complaints are constitutionally important ones).  \nThe proposals for removing civi\nl legal aid for prisoners \nhave \nnot materially altered, save that the requirement to have a criminal legal aid contract for prison work has been removed.  \n21.   \nPrisoners\n \nin the complete control of the state.  \nWithout legal aid, they are probably unable to\n obtain independent scrutiny of complaints against it.  \nRemoving \nlegal aid to enable them to challenge state action, where other means of redress have failed, is \ntherefore antithetical to the rule of law.  The suggestion that prisoners should use alternati\nve means of resolving grievances such as internal complaints and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman does not obviate this concern, since judicial review has always been a \nremedy of \nlast resort, but \none which \nsometimes \nproves\n necessary. \n22.   Removing access to a lawyer in many cases \n means\n in effect\n removal of access t\no justice in the case of \na person who is incarcerated\n.\n However, it is doubtful that the small, specialist \nprison law \nfirms \nwill be able to absorb 17.5% cuts in fees and the\n reduc\ntion in the scope of \nprison law eligible for legal aid, especially given the ongoing proposal that much initial preparation work for judicial review remain unpaid or subject only to discretionary payment.\n22.  Removal of legal aid for prison work mea\nn that there will be many important issues where injustice may go unredressed.  For example:\n- miscategorisation of a prisoners\n in too high a security category\n;\n- unlawful denial of access to offending behaviour courses and/or re-settlement work for releas\ne on parole;\n- representations on whether a mother should be separated from her baby or admitted to a mother and baby unit;\n- representations on assaults in prison.\n23.  Apart from individual injustices going unredressed, it is likely that withdrawal of in\ndependent advice and assistance will render safe management of prisons more \ne very significant. \ndifficult.  (Lord Woolf's report in 1990 into the Strangeways pris\non disturbances shows a link). \n24.  Work by Dr Nick Armstrong demonstrates that the on-costs \nof the proposed removal of prison legal aid - mainly as  result of prisoners being categorised in too high a security category and an increased number of complaints to the Prisons &amp; Probation Ombudsman.  \n&#xa0;\nJUDICIAL REVIEW25.  The consultation response pro\nposes of a 17.5% fee cut and \n \nno payment for claimant lawyers for work undertaken unless and until permission to proceed by way of judicial review is granted by a court\n.  That is so \neven if the claim was well-founded but judicial aid is no longer needed, f\nor example, because the executive body backs down before the c\nlaim is determined by the court\n.\n   In combination with other changes above, and the proposals in the parallel judicial review consultation (eg on standing), these proposals are likely to drive s\nmall, specialist, \nefficient firms out of business\n.\n26.  The c\numulative\n practical effect - if not the intention - will be to remove a vital constitutional safeguard against misuse of executive power.\n  It is of particular concern, however, that it \ndoes \nappear to be the intention of the Ministry of Justice to prevent even well-founded applications for judicial review from proceeding, both by limiting legal aid  for judicial review, and by other restrictions on legal aid, including - as noted above - by re\nmoving standing for \npublic interest litigants such as charities and NGOs.\n&#xa0;\nBORDERLINE/TEST CASES27.  Equality of arms is important in all litigation, but especially in litigation between an individual and the state.    The proposal to remove legal aid fun\nding from 'borderline' cases affects those in which a lawyer cannot fairly estimate the prospects of success: that is, test cases which establish important points of law of general public importance.   The examples given in the paper from Richard Drabble Q\nC - which I have seen - illustrate how removal of funding for such cases would enable the government to be the sole judge of when a 'test' case can be brought to challenge a judgment which it considers wrong, in circumstances where individual litigants cou\nld not obtain funding to oppose them.   \nEXAMPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALLY SIGNIFICANT CASES WHICH COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED WITHOUT LEGAL AID  AND WHICH WOULD FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF LEGAL AID UNDER PRESENT PROPOSALSR v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Simms  [2000] 2 AC 115 House of Lords\nPrison service policy and instructions preventing prisoners' oral interviews with journalists (even on questions of whether wrongly convicted) were held by the House of Lords to be unlawful. \n(Would \nbe ou\nt of scope because would \nfall within prison complaints  exclusion\n plus loss of expertise\n)\nR v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Daly \n[2001] UKHL 26, [2001] 2 AC 532 HL\nThe Home Secretary's blanket policy of searching legal correspondence \nin prison cells in the prisoner's absence was an unjustified infringement of the right to legal professional privilege.\n(Would fall within prison complaints exclusion\n plus loss of prison expertise\n)\nR(Anufrijeva) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[2003] UKHL 36, [2004] 1 AC 604 House of Lords\nWhether a benefit decision triggering removal of benefits could be regarded as final (affecting a large number of claimants).  Court of Appeal in \nR(Anufriejeva) v Southwark London Borough Council \nfound against claimant;
