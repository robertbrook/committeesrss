"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by UK Green Building Council&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGeneral comments2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK Green Building Coun\ncil (UK-GBC) is an independent, \nmem\nbership-based\n \ncharity\n committed to radically improving the sustainabil\nity of the built environment by \ntransforming the way it is planned, designed, constr\nucted, maintained and operated. We have around 400 members from across the property and construction sector, including house builders, local authorities, Registered Providers and product manufacturers. UK-GBC was on the steering group for the Housing Standards Review technical committee.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is UK-GBC’s view that the time was right for a review and rationalisation of \nthe current range of voluntary standards applied to new homes. \nHowever, we have always maintained that the changes must support deliver\ny of \nhigh quality sustainability homes \nthat are \nfit for the future. W\nith the demise of the CSH and \nomissions \nin the Housing Standards Review consultation \naround issues like materials, we risk losing a momentum that has transformed the way homes have been built over the last seven years.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK-GBC \nagrees \nthat where appropriate, standards should be brought into Building Regulations\n. However, we believe that this process should happen\n as soon as possible, and we do not believe that th\ne government's self imposed 'o\nne in two out' rule is a valid excuse to delay action.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the key functions of the CSH was to set out the direction of travel for Building Regulations. In our view it has been helpful to have a sense of what best practice looks like that developers can and should aspire to, and in the absence of the CSH the onus will be on the industry to drive innovation and best practice. Some developers have embraced sustainability and are innovating and achieving impressive sustainability standards. For them, there are elements of the CSH that were deeply frustrating, because inevitably the CSH is prescriptive. However, the industry has a ‘long tail’, with many companies who are either not interested in sustainability, or not able to carry out the necessary research and development to innovate. We need a new kind of \nsustainability framework which allows the leaders to keep pushing the boundaries, but also provides the guidance and drivers to act for the rest of the industry. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe that suitable transitional arrangements must be put into place, and where \nLocal Planning Authorities (\nLPAs\n)\n already have higher standards in place \nwhich have been tested through due process and accepted as viable, \nthey should be allowed to keep those higher requirements until the new regulations take over (e\n.\ng\n.\n Part L 2016). There is no sense in weakening requirements which are\n already\n being met, only to raise them again in 2-3 years.  \n&#xa0;Comments on specific issues:&#xa0;\n3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnergy3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe strongly support the zero carbon 2016/2019 policies, and we agree that fabric energy efficiency standards are the domain of national standards and so we broadly support the approach outlined in the consultation document. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, t\nhere is always going to be an interplay between building regulations and planning on energy issues. Building regulations should take care of fabric efficiency, onsite carbon compliance and Allowable Solutions, but plann\ners\n should have input into the renewable energy strategy for the development. We agree that the rather blunt 'Merton rule' approach, whereby a percentage of renewable energy is required, is \nusually not the right approach. However, we agree that where viable, \nL\nP\nAs should be able to require developers to link up to\n low carbon or\n \nrenewable energy \nschemes where they exist,\n or will exist in the future,\n as part of a borough wide plan for low carbon and renewable energy.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere are \nenergy related issues\n \nwhich are currently in the CSH, but not \nin the proposed new standards. These include:\n&#xa0;\n3.3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDrying space – this is a key element to provide healthy internal environments in the context of increasing air tightness. The Code requires clothes drying provision within the bathroom and the space be mechanically ventilated \nwith a humidistat control. This issue should be taken account of in \nBuilding Regulations Part F.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnergy efficient white goods\n. Our \nmembers’ \nexperience is that the Code does \nimpact on \nthe \nefficiency of the \nwhite goods which are installed in dwellings.\n Low efficiency white goods are, unfortunately, still available\n.\n There is a role for tighter product regulation here.\n&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndoor Environmental Standards4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe agree with the Challenge Panel's assertion that standards for daylight, sunlight and ventilation should be more thoroughly investigated.\n \nDaylighting, sunlight and ventilation are all intertwined and must be considered as a whole. The tools for assessing these matters should also be reviewed. \n \n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLinked to the above, the issue of overheating is a real concern as new homes become more airtight. The government’s response to the issue has so far been inadequate, despite the fact that private sector guidance exists on this issue - for example\n CIBSE Guide TM52 sets overheating standards. \nUK-GBC believes that \nSAP should\n be improved to better\n address this issue as a matter of urgency\n – as recommended by the Zero Carbon Hub\n 3 years ago.\n&#xa0;\n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWater5.1&#xa0; \nSince the upper standard of 105 l/p/d + 5l external use is achievable at no/minimal extra cost, we think this should be the baseline standard for all new homes. Our members are meeting this standard on new homes as a matter of course, at no extra cost.\n Code level 5 (80 l/p/d) is usually not viable, apart from in exceptional circumstances. \nIn future there could be scope for 'allowable solutions' type approaches for water, but that approach would need to be developed at a national level.\n&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMaterials6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe st\nrongly disagree with leaving considerations about m\naterials to the market\n. While we recognise that EU policy is beginning to address these issues through standards like CEN TC350, we still feel that there’s a need for national driver to encourage the procurement of healthier and more sustainable construction materials\n. This is perhaps the biggest omission in the proposed new Housing Standards.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssue\ns such as\n responsible sourcing, toxicity, Ozone depleting potential, and off-gassing of materials in air-tight homes should be addressed as a matter of urgency through new guidance and\n through Building R\negulation\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe HSR process was \ninadequate when it came to considering materi\nals. \nA materials expert group should be set up as soon as possible to advise on this matter and where best in the regulations these issues should be addressed.\n&#xa0;\nOther issues&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEcology7.1&#xa0; \nIt is not clear from the consultation document what the proposals are for dealing with the ecology credits from the CSH. Indeed, the issue of ecology is not mentioned at all. We think the CSH has spurred developers into thinking more about ecology at the design stage, and would not want to see its importance downgraded with the demise of the CSH. We agree that ecology is a planning issue, and we think the government should make clear that in the absence of the CSH, all LPAs should have clear policies for improving the ecological value of land through development, as part of their local plan\n.\n&#xa0;\n3 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
