[normal]Now is the moment to act on inclusion of disabled people[bold] – the negotiations towards a 
[normal]post-2015 development framework[bold] represent a unique opportunity to
[normal] reverse the neglect of disability as a core development issue
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID’s welcome recent commitments[bold] should be the 
[normal]beginning of positioning the UK to lead a revolution in disability-inclusive development
[normal], starting by 
[normal]embedding disability as a core part of [bold]D[bold]FID’s[bold] work[bold].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]should move in a 
[normal]careful, phased approach [bold]towards disability-inclusive development[bold] as part of a wider strategic focus on equity and inclusion[bold]. These principles should be embedded throughout DFID’s 
[normal]strategy, structures and processes[bold], with 
[normal]a 
[normal]strategy 
[normal]championed at a senior level 
[normal]reflected by the inclusion of disability as a 
[normal]core requirement of[bold] country plans, business cases [bold]and the 
[normal]disaggregation of programme plans and results[bold].
[normal] DFID should move towards making disability-inclusion a 
[normal]requiremen[bold]t of bilateral and multilateral funding[bold].

[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Education should be an early priority for DFID’s inclusive approach[bold]. The exclusion of di
[normal]sabled ch
[normal]ildren 
[normal]denies their human right to education and 
[normal]will prevent the world reaching MDG 2. DFID is the leading donor to 
[normal]education and should lead the way with a 
[normal]strategic focus on[bold] equity and[bold] inclusive education[bold] that benefits all child
[normal]ren (not just disabled children). 
[normal]Inclusive education is the right approach to [bold]strengthening education systems, improving teacher-training and[bold] delivering better quality education[bold]. This should be complemented by additional efforts to 
[normal]reach the most marginalised [bold]disabled children out of [bold]school[bold].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An inclusive approach will only become reality 
[normal]if implemented on the ground by DFID’s Country Offices [bold]and in-country partners[bold]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]implementation of central strategy and 
[normal]guidance can be
[normal] challenging 
[normal]with
[normal]in
[normal] DFID’s devolved structure. Embedding inclusion will require 
[normal]strong
[normal] accountability mechanisms, [bold]designated leads [bold]within country offices, 
[normal]thorough
[normal] training [bold]for [bold]all country advisers, [bold]and 
[normal]substantive
[normal] 
[normal]consultation with Disabled People’s Organisations[bold].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK has a crucial role in 
[normal]leading its global partners on inclusion[bold]. DFID’s 
[normal]dialogues
[normal] with 
[normal]developing country governments[bold] provide an 
[normal]opportunity to challenge 
[normal]attitudes toward disability and encourage an incl
[normal]usive education approach. DFID
[normal] should urge the 
[normal]Global Partnership for Education to champion [bold]education for disabled children[bold] and should work with the 
[normal]Global Partnership on Children with Disabilities, the UN W[bold]ashington Group on Disabilit[bold]y Statistics, [bold]UNICEF, the World Bank and UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics[bold] 
[normal]in 
[normal]a global 
[normal]effort

[normal]The Prime Minister and DFID should continue to 
[normal]champion a disability-inclusive post-2015 framework[bold], parti
[normal]cularly the “
[normal]no one left behind[bold]” principle, the 
[normal]disaggregation of indicators by disability[bold], and the approach that 
[normal]no target should be considered met unless for all social groups, including disabled people[bold]. The UK is well-positioned to lead on 
[normal]a 
[normal]post-2015 
[normal]‘
[normal]Global Partnership on Disability Data’[bold].

[normal]RESULTS is an international grassroots advocacy organization working to generate the public and political will to end hunger and extreme poverty. RESULTS supports a network of volunteer
[normal]s
[normal] across the UK and in five other countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico and USA). RESULTS works in 
[normal]partnership with decision-makers, experts and civil society to take effective action and to speak out in favour of anti-poverty measures that really wor
[normal]k. RESULTS UK is a 
[normal]steering group 
[normal]member of the Global Campaign for Education

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disability has long been neglected as a “niche” area of development, deemed by many to be too complex or too small an issue to be core to development efforts. The MDGs fai
[normal]led to mention disability
[normal], yet we now know that disabled people make up an 
[normal]estimated 15% of the global population, and that disability is both a cause and a consequence of poverty. 80% of disabled people live in developing countries and the UN calls them “
[normal]the world’s largest minority[bold]”
[normal]. Without including 
[normal]disabled people
[normal], it is cl
[normal]ear that 
[normal]many of[bold] 
[normal]the MDG targets will not be reached[bold].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities[bold] has 
[normal]led to
[normal] 
[normal]a step-change in 
[normal]the 
[normal]recognition of the right
[normal]s
[normal] of disabled people to be included in all aspects of their own development. The UNCRPD also places an obligation on signatories like the UK 
[normal]to ensure aid programmes include disabled people[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A major barrier to the recognition of disability as a core devel
[normal]opment issue has been the 
[normal]appalling lack of data available[bold]. Information is often speculative and out of date. A lack of reliable and consistent data at national level feeds a lack of clarity internationally. This has ultimately 
[normal]left disabled people invisib[bold]le, left behind by development efforts[bold]. 
[normal]However,
[normal] 
[normal]with dramatic improvement
[normal]s in data over recent years
[normal], there is now 
[normal]a[bold]n unprecedented[bold] opportunity[bold] to bring the needs of disabled people into the light.

[normal]Post-2015 n
[normal]egotiations 
[normal]represent a unique opportunity to
[normal] reverse the neglect of disabled people
[normal] by ensuring that 
[normal]the new framework explicitly includes disability as a core issue[bold]. 
[normal]DFID’s recent commitments should be 
[normal]the [bold]first step towards the UK leading [bold]a revolution in disability-inclusive development, starting by embedding disability as a core part of [bold]DFID’s[bold] work[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]RESULTS and our grassroots volunteers have long campaigned for disabled children to have a
[normal]ccess to quality education. It is estimated that there are 93 million disabled children globally
[normal], and in most 
[normal]countries, they are 
[normal]more likely to be out of school than any other group of children[bold]. 
[normal]In Nepal
[normal], it is estimated that 85% of all children out of s
[normal]c
[normal]hool are disabled. In Ethiopia
[normal], fewer than 3% of disabled children have access to primary education
[normal]. In some countries 
[normal]being disabled more than doubles the chance of never enrolling in school[bold]. Disabled children are also less likely to remain in school 
[normal]and transition to the next grade
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he exclusion of disabled children not only denies their 
[normal]human
[normal] right to education, but makes it impossible for the world to reach the MDG of universal primary education by 2015. 
[normal]57 million children of primary age are st[bold]ill out of school[bold] around the world and progress all but stalled
[normal]. 
[normal]It is estimated that 
[normal]disabled children may make up over [bold]a third of [bold]the [bold]out-of-[bold]school population[bold]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lack of understanding, negative attitudes and discrimination[bold] towards 
[normal]disability
[normal] are major
[normal] challenges, 
[normal]often
[normal] leading parents 
[normal]in low-
[normal]income countries 
[normal]to 
[normal]hide away their [bold]disabled children[bold] and leading governments and education decision-makers to segregate disabled children into
[normal] “special” schools[bold] – often inappropriately – which tend
[normal]s
[normal] to compound the exclusion from the mainstream and perpetuate the myth that disabled people should be “helped” and not empowered to lead their own productive lives
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disability is also 
[normal]inextricably linked to other factors which exacerbate exclusion and i[bold]nequality[bold]. For instance, 
[normal]ethnic minority 
[normal]girls
[normal] living with disabilities experience triple exclusion. A recent GCE UK report noted that of all the excluding factor
[normal]s, disability has the strongest correlation with poor educational outcomes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The recent commitments made by DFID
[normal] are 
[normal]important and welcome progress[bold], and as part of 
[normal]the Global Campaign for Education (
[normal]GCE
[normal])
[normal] UK
[normal],
[normal] RESULTS has sought to support DFID in this process
[normal]. The announcement that 
[normal]all future [bold]schools built with direct UK support will be built accessibly[bold] is 
[normal]an important 
[normal]statement 
[normal]to 
[normal]DFID’s
[normal] developing country 
[normal]and donor 
[normal]partners. DFID’s
[normal] commitment to work with global partners to 
[normal]improve the data and evidence on disability[bold] goes to the heart of the 
[normal]current invisibility of disabled people. DFID should now 
[normal]build on these steps to embed disability-inclusion within its work[bold] and position itself to champion disability-inclusive development with its partners and 
[normal]with
[normal]in the post-2015 dialogue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In
[normal] 2010
[normal], 
[normal]RESULTS UK published
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]report which 
[normal]raised
[normal] serious concerns about implementation
[normal],
[normal] since then, progress has been made
[normal]. At the time, DFID had been 
[normal]among
[normal] the first donors to recognise the importance of a 
[normal]“twin-track” approach [bold]which sees the “mainstreaming” o
[normal]r inclusion of disabled people in all aspects of their development work (
[normal]eg.
[normal] ensuring education support disabled 
[normal]children
[normal]), coupled with additional inputs and resources which recognise the extreme marginalisation of disabled people and go further in suppor
[normal]ting them.
[normal] DFID has since put in place 
[normal]useful 
[normal]guidance 
[normal]for its Country Offices
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, despite 
[normal]some examples of good practice, 
[normal]DFID still
[normal] 
[normal]has no formal framework for the systematic inclusion of disabled people throughout its programmes[bold], and 
[normal]no formal [bold]checks[bold] are in place to ensure that 
[normal]DFID’s work results in 
[normal]improved 
[normal]development outcomes for disabled people.
[normal] As part of GCE
[normal] UK, RESULTS UK has raised concern
[normal]s
[normal] that 
[normal]implementation remains a real problem[bold]. For instance, in a survey of six Country Offices in 2
[normal]012, GCE UK found that 
[normal]only half of the offices were 
[normal]aware of the 
[normal]existing 
[normal]guidanc
[normal]e
[normal], and 
[normal]only one was implementing [bold]it[bold]. I
[normal]n a 
[normal]later 
[normal]report, GCE UK noted that there 
[normal]were
[normal] 
[normal]only two mentions of the word “disability” across 14 DFID Country Operational Plans[bold]. There is substantial risk that the current momentum will be lost unless 
[normal]there is 
[normal]robust implementation [bold]to embed [bold]disability-inclusion within DFID’s [bold]work[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should move in a 
[normal]careful, phased approach towards disability-inclusive development as part of a[bold] wider strateg[bold]ic focus on equity[bold] and inclusion[bold] that could be similar to its ‘
[normal]Strategic Vision for Girls and Women
[normal]’
[normal]. These principles should be embedded throughout DFID’s 
[normal]strateg[bold]ies[bold], structures and processes[bold], with a high level 
[normal]prioritisation
[normal] 
[normal]reflected by the inclusion of disability as a 
[normal]core requirement of[bold] country plans, business cases [bold]and the disaggregation of programme plans and results[bold] to demonstrate 
[normal]how
[normal] DFID’s work is supporting disabled people. DFID should move towards making disability-i
[normal]nclusion 
[normal]a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding agreements[bold], starting with the next cycle of aid reviews.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This strategic focus should be 
[normal]championed at a [bold]senior[bold] level[bold]. The work of Judith Heumann, Special Advisor for International Disability Ri
[normal]ghts at the US State Department
[normal], could provide a useful reference point. Ms Heumann told the APPGs on Disability and Global Education for All in 2012
[normal] that
[normal] she works closely with USAID to embed disability within their work, with focus on their funding deci
[normal]sions, internal processes and training for staff
[normal]. The AusAid strategy ‘
[normal]Towards a disability-inclusive Australian aid programme
[normal]’
[normal] could also be a helpful 
[normal]model
[normal].

[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Education should be an early priority for [bold]DFID’s inclusive approach[bold], building on the recent commitment on accessible school construction
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK is the 
[normal]largest bilateral donor to basic education[bold] and 
[normal]so has an 
[normal]opportunity to lead and influence oth
[normal]er donors and developing countries
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]should le
[normal]ad the way with 
[normal]a strategic focus on equity and inclusive education that benefits all children[bold], particularly the most marginalised
[normal] (not just disabled children). 
[normal]As a recent 
[normal]GCE
[normal] report emphasises
[normal], the UNCRPD established inclusive education as the key mechanism to deliver the right to education for disabled children. 
[normal]Inclusive education systems can be defined as all children learning together in mainstream classrooms, irrespective of the different 
[normal]ranges of abilities and disabilities, with teaching methods, materials and school environments that address the needs of all 
[normal]children
[normal], and additional, individually tailored support as needed
[normal]. 
[normal]They can be a powerful tool in addressing inequalities, tackling
[normal] discrimination and changing societal attitudes towards embracing 
[normal]diversity
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UNICEF notes that inclusive education 
[normal]is
[normal] by no means 
[normal]a luxury
[normal] available only to the privileged. Rather, examples of inclusion in education can be found in all regions, and challe
[normal]nge the notion that such an 
[normal]approach cannot be taken in low resource contexts
[normal]. 
[normal]The GCE report 
[normal]argues
[normal] that 
[normal]i[bold]nclusive education is the right approach to strengthening education systems, improving teacher-training and delivering better quality [bold]education[bold] [bold]for [bold]all[bold]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I[bold]nclusive education is [bold]a good[bold] investment[bold], enabling developing count
[normal]ry governments to spend limited 
[normal]budgets on a system which benefits all children rather than inefficiently channelled towards a few children in segregated schools (which again reinforces the perception that disability is a cost to the state). 
[normal]Directly relevant to DFID’s recent commitment 
[normal]on accessible school construction, UNICEF 
[normal]highlights
[normal] that the 
[normal]costs of integrating accessibility into new buildings can be negligible[bold] (less than 1% of the total cost) compared to the higher cost of 
[normal]adapting
[normal] completed buildings
[normal].
[normal] Ultimately, supporting the 
[normal]education of disabled children will 
[normal]yield 
[normal]a substantial economic benefit 
[normal]to 
[normal]the developing countries where DFID works
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID is a 
[normal]leader in supporting 
[normal]teacher-[bold]training[bold], which is fundamental to meeting MDG 2 and improving 
[normal]educational 
[normal]quality
[normal]. 
[normal]DFID should match its commitment on accessible school construction with this equally crucial aspect of inclusion, committing that 
[normal]DFID will integrate disability and inclusive education throughout the teacher-training it supports[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In line with a “twin trac
[normal]k” approach, DFID should 
[normal]also 
[normal]put in place additional [bold]projects[bold] and resources to support disabled children[bold]. DFID already takes this approach with 
[normal]gender
[normal] through its ‘Girls Education Challenge’ fund
[normal]. 
[normal]Similarly,
[normal] DFID 
[normal]could have a dedicated fund to 
[normal]support[bold] pr[bold]ojects to r[bold]each out-of-[bold]school disabled children; tackle discrimination about disability; and support children with complex needs in community settings[bold]. DFID should take a 
[normal]cross-sector approach[bold], linking to 
[normal]early childhood, 
[normal]nutrition, health and humanitarian
[normal] programmes and ensuring that these too are inclusive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An inclusive approach will only become reality if implemented on the ground[bold]. 
[normal]RESULTS UK’s experience
[normal] suggests that implementation of central strategy and guidance is challenging given DFID’s devolved structure. Embedding inclusion will require 
[normal]st[bold]rong accountability mechanisms[bold]. 
[normal]RESULTS UK recommends that 
[normal]designated leads[bold] 
[normal]should
[normal] 
[normal]be identified in DFID’s Cou
[normal]ntry Offices to be responsible and accountable for ensuring 
[normal]that 
[normal]the needs of disabled peop
[normal]le are included in DFID’s work. 
[normal]T[bold]horough training [bold]on inclusion should be made mandatory [bold]for [bold]all Country A[bold]dvisers[bold].
[normal] As part of GCE UK, RESULTS UK has welcomed discussi
[normal]ons with DFID about incorporating disability into ‘continuous professional development’ for Country Advisers, and we urge DFID to proceed with integrating disability and inclusive approaches 
[normal]into
[normal] future training.
[normal] Finally, DFID’
[normal]s Country O
[normal]ffices should be r
[normal]equired to engage in 
[normal]substantive, regular consultation with Disabled People’s Organisations[bold] to ensure the participation of disabled people in the planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID’s [bold]dialogues[bold] with developing country governments[bold] provide 
[normal]opportunities
[normal] to challenge 
[normal]unhelpful 
[normal]attitudes toward disability and encourage an inclusive approach
[normal] at national level
[normal]. 
[normal]DFID should seek to 
[normal]build the capacity of national governments t[bold]o put in place appropriate legislative frameworks and [bold]deliver[bold] these [bold]through[bold] ambitious national plans for inclusion[bold] 
[normal]supported by[bold] [bold]improve[bold]d[bold]

[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In education,
[normal] one systemic barrier is the problem of 
[normal]divided ministerial responsibility [bold]within developing country governments[bold], where education for disabled children is the responsibility of a different ministry than that responsible for the education of non-disabled children
[normal]. This division reflects 
[normal]and reinforces 
[normal]the view that the disabled n
[normal]eed welfare rather than 
[normal]equal access to
[normal] education
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]it 
[normal]often leads to 
[normal]a 
[normal]segregated 
[normal]education system with disabled children separated into “special schools”
[normal]. 
[normal]DFID should call on national governments to invest in inclusive systems[bold], with responsibility for
[normal] the education of 
[normal]all
[normal] children
[normal] 
[normal]clearly within the remit of the Ministry for Education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]should 
[normal]use its role on the Board of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Global Partnership for Education (GPE)[bold] to 
[normal]urge [bold]the[bold] [bold]GPE[bold] to [bold]champion [bold]inclusive [bold]education for disabled children[bold].
[normal] The GPE is the only multilateral partnership devoted to getting all children into
[normal] school for a quality education
[normal]. The 
[normal]GPE
[normal]’s unique partnership model, which 
[normal]coordinates
[normal] donors, civil society and private sector investments in support of nationally-led educa
[normal]tion plan
[normal]s
[normal], provides an important vehicle for DFID to give global reach to its disability commitments. The GPE 
[normal]has already committed to supporting disabled children 
[normal]within
[normal] its new strategic plan
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In June 2014, the GPE will hold a replenishment campaign to[bold] re-galvanise the education community[bold] with pledges to its fund and commitments to increase domestic financing and bilateral aid to education. 
[normal]DFID should use this important moment to call for a global effort to improve support for disabled children’s educa[bold]tion[bold].

[normal]DFID 
[normal]should 
[normal]play a leading role
[normal] 
[normal]in improving
[normal] 
[normal]data on disability at a global and national level[bold]. Progress is already being made through the 
[normal]Global Partnership on Children with Disabilities[bold], and work by the 
[normal]UN Washington[bold] Group on Disability Statistics[bold]. 
[normal]UNICEF[bold], the 
[normal]World Bank[bold] and 
[normal]UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics[bold] all have expertise which should 
[normal]form part of
[normal] a more coordinated effort. Donors like DFID should seek to turn global knowledge-sharing into national action by 
[normal]supporting capacity-building within[bold] national governments and statistical agencies[bold] in developing countries.

[normal]The 
[normal]Post-2015 
[normal]negotiations represent a 
[normal]once in a lifetime opportunity to reverse the neglect of disabled people[bold]. 
[normal]The Prime Mini
[normal]ster 
[normal]has already played an important role as a co-chair of the UN High Level Panel 
[normal](HLP) 
[normal]and has been champion
[normal]ing
[normal] disability-inclusion and the principle of “no one left behind”. The 
[normal]UN High Level Meeting on Disability and Development[bold] in September was the highest level gathering of decision-makers on this issue for many years, and DFID Minister Lynne Featherstone MP’s intervention at this event was widely praised
[normal].

[normal]We urge DFID to 
[normal]continue championing these issues throughout the tough[bold] inter-governmental negotiations that lay ahead[bold]. We cannot be complacent – with so many priorities on the table, there is a great risk that concepts like ‘disaggregation by disability’ 
[normal]will be lost[bold]. We all have a collective responsibility to ensure that do
[normal]es not happen. DFID should fight for 
[normal]the “
[normal]no one left behind” [bold]principle
[normal], [bold]the
[normal] disaggregation of indicators by disability [bold]to measure progress, and the approach that
[normal] no target should be considered met unless for all social groups, including disabled people[bold].

[normal]The 
[normal]HLP
[normal] called for a 
[normal]“
[normal]data revolution[bold]” 
[normal]for post-2015
[normal], and 
[normal]nowhere is this more needed[bold] than with disability[bold]. The MDGs have resulted in dramatic strides in development data, but disability has been left behind. 
[normal]W
[normal]e urge the UK Government to 
[normal]lead
[normal] a “
[normal]Global Pa[bold]rtnership on Disability Data[bold]” that would bring the needs of disabled people into the light and demand the urgent action 
[normal]needed 
[normal]to achieve
[normal] the UN Secretary-General’s vision of
[normal] “
[normal]a life of dignity for all
[normal]”
[normal].

[normal] For example, DFID’s ‘Guidance Note on Education for Children with Disabilities’ quotes a World Bank paper that concluded that educating disabled children reduces welfare costs and futu
[normal]re dependence, and increases children’s own potential productivity and wealth creation in turn helping to alleviate poverty. See p3, DFID (2010), ‘Guidance note: Education for children with disabilities – improving access and quality”,

[normal] UNESCO highlight
[normal] that 1.7million more new teachers need to be recruited to achieve universal primary education by 2015, and that teacher-training needs huge improvement to deliver good quality education. See for example, UNESCO Education For All Global Monitoring Report (
