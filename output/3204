defaultIn our submission to the Scottish Government’s Land Reform
default Review Group
default 2013
default, we 
defaultput 
defaultforward compelling evi
defaultdence of the pivotal role that many of Scotland’s landowners fulfil. Underpinning 
defaultthe contribution of 
defaultmany of Scotland’s 
defaultlandowners is the fundamental belief in, and commitment to, property rights, which see
defaultm to be continually under attack without regard to consequence. 
default 
defaultThe Scottish countryside lacks the 
defaultinvestment 
defaultit 
defaultrequires, 
defaultin part due to the 
defaultconstant reviews of property rights
default which undermines confidence and discourages long term investment

defaultWe believe that further legislation or substantive change

default but 
defaultconcede
default that some of current legislation may

defaultlandowners are already determined
default to act responsibly within the regulatory framework, change and improvement can be best achieved through 
defaultcommunity engagement and 
defaultthe dissemination of 
defaultinnovat
defaultive ideas and best 
defaultpractice, not more legislation. Case studies, as an example, provide a more positive and constructive stimulus and encourage buy-in whilst more legislation tends to act negatively and encourage polarisation.

defaultWe contest 
defaultthe principle that there is demonstrable evidence to support 
defaulta more diverse landownership pattern and we see no evidence of any democratic mandate to drive this.

default&#xa0;
defaultAbout Usdefault&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultThe Scottish Countryside Alliance (SCA) is a devolved policy and budget centre of the wider Countryside Alliance. The SCA is recognised by government and voluntary sectors as a representative body for country sports and community interests in Scotland. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultOur mission is to promote and protect Scotland’s rural and wider countryside and the well-being and continued prosperity of those who live and work in it. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe Countryside Alliance has over 100,000 
defaultmembers many
default of whom are directly involved in a w
defaultide variety of rural landownership and rural business management throughout Scotland, all of whom are vitally important to the continued prosperity and sustainability of rural Scotland. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultToday landowners’ business interests are very diverse and for th
defaulte majority their landholdings are relatively modest with many managing 500 hectares of less. Whilst diverse in size and makeup, Scotland’s landowners take the responsibility of land stewardship extremely seriously and are significant contributors to the he
defaultalth and vitality, as well as future economic sustainability, of the rural sector.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.4 
default              
defaultWe work with key decision makers to ensure that all aspects of our countryside are enhanced, not diminished. We also have to ensure that people living in rural 
defaultcommunities are adequately supported. Without people in our rural communities, there will be no countryside tourism and no county sports. The SCA ensures that the voice of the countryside is heard by the public and key decision makers. It is in everyone’s 
defaultinterest that Scotland’s countryside thrives and offers opportunities to everyone, regardless of where they live.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLand Reformdefault&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultThe Scottish Countryside Alliance believes that there is a lack
default defaultof clarity over the rationale and 
defaultremit of Land Reform in Scotland
default. The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill Policy Memorandum states that its objective is '
defaultto remove land-based barriers to the sustainable development of rural communities
default' (Scottish Parliament, 2001). However, it is not clear what 
defaultform this sustainable development should take, or what 
defaultthese ‘barriers’ are or what the Bill’s priorities should be
default. For example, some have proposed that the 
defaultBill 
defaultcould focus on reversing local economic and environmental decline, whilst others have suggest
defaulted it could play a role in increasing the population and economic activity of rural communities (
defaultSQW
default, 2007;
default&#xa0;
defaultSQW
default, 2009). 
defaultI
defaultt is not clear whether the '
defaultland based barriers to the sustainable development of rural communities
default' referred to by the Scottish Parlia
defaultment primarily concern land ownership or 
defaultland stewardship,default as both are likely to be important in terms of sustainable development and different measures would be required for each. For example, many of the potential benefits associated with land and asset ownership may not be achievable through community ownershi
defaultp alone, as benefits such as increasing the financial viability of land and improving local services also depend on how these are managed.
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThe Scottish Countryside Alliance (SCA) strongly supports the objective of the sustainable development of rural c
defaultommunities through increasing the opportunities for them to undertake and control the development of their environments. However
default,
default the SCA reject
defaults
default the thought process that barriers to sustainable development will be removed simply by increasing diversity of
default land ownership. Given the agricultural marginality, population scarcity and isolated nature of certain tracts of the countryside, parts of it simply cannot be economically sustainable without sources of external funding.   
default&#xa0;
default3.
default2
default              
defaultThe community/tenant absol
defaultute right to buy dominates the academic literature in comparison to either access rights or the crofting community right to buy. Arguably that perception remains despite the fact that it has had little direct use in purchasing land or other assets for comm
defaultunity/tenant ownership. Aside from the challenges thrown up by the administrative processes of the community right to buy and the need to manage potential conflict with landowners’ interests, much depends on the human and financial resources available to a
default group with regards to whether they will engage with the Act. It remains the case that most community groups’ experience of the Act has been confined to going through attempted or actual registration of an interest to purchase land, with no actual gain of 
defaultland or assets.

defaultimpact of
default&#xa0;defaultCdefaultommunity defaultRdefaultight defaulttdefaulto defaultBdefaultuy default(CRtB)
default default&#xa0;
defaulthas been commented on by a number of researchers. The
default&#xa0;
defaultJoseph Rowntree Foundation
default&#xa0;
defaultstates that the benefits of

default and facilitate large-scale community asset ownership) appear to have been

defaultrelatively small scaledefault. (

default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultMany of the observations made in relation to the community right to buy are equally applicable to the crofting 
defaultcommunity right to buy. Indeed, the challenges associated with the definition of the crofting community, mapping of the land to be purchased and balloting of the community make it an even more daunting process to embark upon than that of the community righ
defaultt to buy. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultThe Crofting and Community right to buy 
defaultopportunity has
default struggled to inspire communities to take up ownership for a number of reasons, but fundamentally, prospective applicants are failing through the lack of a financially viable business plan as opposed to an unresponsive or hostile landowner
default. 
defaultResearch highli
defaultghts that not all communities are equally well placed to achieve the full benefits of land and asset ownership. In addition, without the right conditions in place, ownership can bring with it more risks than benefits.  (Aiken et al, 2011; JRF, 2011; Skerra
defaulttt, 2011).
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultThe Scottish Countryside Alliance (SCA) welcomes the principle of developing further the ability for more people in rural and urban Scotland to have a stake in the ownership, governance, management and use of land, which will lead to a 
defaultgreater diversity of land ownership, and ownership types in Scotland. However we may have a differ
defaultent understanding of 
defaultwhat constitutes success in relation to Land Reform in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultWe believe that landowners and private estates in Scotland are some
defaulttimes unfairly portrayed as being separate from their local communities and cited for holding back or prohibiting development. This is an inaccurate generalisation. 
defaultLandowners in Scotland are not the standardised stereotype some portray, but come in all sh
defaultapes and sizes; individuals, trusts and communities. Whatever the ownership type they are all engaged in diverse economic activity delivering sustainable economic growth throughout Scotland; which is far more important to Scotland’s communities and economy
default, than simply asking “who owns the land”. 
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultThe Scottish Land Fund (
defaultSLF
default) was set up by what was then the New Opportunities Fund, now the Big Lottery Fund (
defaultBIG
default), and represented a major new source of funding for asset-based community development in 
defaultrural Scotland by providing a new mechanism to support ownership activities along with the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 ('the Act'). It was administered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (
defaultHIE
default) in partnership with Scottish Enterprise, and delivered thr
defaultough
default&#xa0;
defaultHIE
default's Community Land Unit.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultThe fund was launched initially with £10m and was supplemented in 2003 with a further £5m. Its main objectives were:

default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultUnder the
default&#xa0;
defaultSLF
default&#xa0;
default239 grants were awarded which amounted to £13.5 million. The average grant size was about £56,000, though the five largest grants together accounted for just over half of the 
defaulttotal
default&#xa0;
defaultSLF
default&#xa0;
defaultbudget. The fund helped 188 community groups to own their own land and assets. Around 5,500 people have worked directly as part of these group
defaults.

defaultof the

defaultSLF
default. Firstly, it states that the value 
defaultof the grants awarded will not make more than a modest change to the pattern of land ownership in rural Scotland. It also states that land and asset ownership facilitated by the fund cannot be seen as an end in itself.

defaultnumber of
default&#xa0;

defaultwhich it hoped would inform the development of the successor to the 
defaultSLF
default&#xa0;
default(Growing Community Assets). 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default2
default              
defaultThe Scottish Countryside Alliance welcomes the introduction of policies designed to encourage and facilitate the transfe
defaultr/sale to communities of land and other assets in the ownership of government, its agencies and local authorities
default, which
default have been taking shape at both a Scottish and UK level for some time. One of the earliest such measures, the Transfer of Crofting Estat
defaultes (Scotland) Act 1997, 
defaultmaking possible
default community ownership of croft land presently owned by Government. The Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) National Forest Land Scheme (NFLS), dating from 2005, is similarly intended to enable communities to take charge of state-owned land, and has led to a 
defaultnumber of such transfers
default, 
defaultsome of them involving substantial areas. Further
defaultmore
default such moves, this time with an urban as well as rural focus, are integral to the thinking behind the Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill (CERB) now in development by the Scot
defaulttish Government. 
default4.3
default              
defaultThe Scottish Countryside Alliance welcomes the 
defaultcommunity
default interest in acquiring Crown owned/managed
default foreshore and seabed resources. 
defaultIt is our understanding that the
default S
defaultcottish 
defaultA
defaultffairs 
defaultCommittee has
default already inquired into C
defaultrown 
defaultE
defaultstate Com
defaultmissioners (CEC)
default 
defaultoperations in Scotland. The Committee might wish to return, in a land reform context, to its recommendation that CEC ‘responsibilities for the seabed [and] the seashore’ should be devolved to Scotland
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultEven if all these interests and
default ownerships can be identified and mapped, the costs and
default 
defaultadministration involved in transferring stakes in the ownership, of land, may be prohibitive
default 
defaultand may outweigh the perceived benefit. A possible solution for simplifying the process of
default 
defaultidentifying land
default and ownerships might be for the Scottish Government to consider allowing
default 
defaultowners to consolidate old titles by providing technical expertise, grants for legal expenses
default 
defaultand surveying costs and a waiver of Fees for recording dues to allow owners to register t
defaultheir
default 
defaultsubjects voluntarily in the Land Register at no cost.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultA further matter requiring urgent attention in a public asset transfer context is the 
defaultop
defaulteration of EU State Aid rules. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
defaultWhile there are aspects of Land Value Tax in its purest sense which might be worthy of further detailed consideration in the context of reform of the taxation of land and property, we have concerns that what has been proposed as “Land Value Taxation” by ce
defaultrtain analysts in relation to possible Land Reform in Scotland falls well short of the principles of Land Value Tax explained in some detail in the Mirrlees Review. In that 
defaultr
defaulteview, it is suggested that Land Value Tax would replace a number of other taxes (
defaultincluding taxation of rental property, Council Tax, Business Rates and Stamp Duty Land Tax). With 
defaultonly 
defaultpart of the taxation system currently devolved (a proportion of Income Tax, Business Rates, Council
default Tax and, from 2015, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and Landfill Tax), it is not possible 
defaultat this time 
defaultto consider the introduction of a pure form of Land Value Tax in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default              
defaultThe SCA does not believe that there is a need to change t
defaulthe law of su
defaultccession governing how a person's property passes on after his or her death. It is our understanding that in Scotland the distribution of a person's testate or partially intestate estate is governed by the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964 - the Act provides 
defaultfor the estate to be distributed in a specific way and according to law to the surviving relatives of the deceased.  
defaultIt is our understanding that the most recent review of succession by the Law Commission Scotland focussed more on how people lived in Scotl
defaultand in relation to their marital or civil relationship status as opposed to where they live and what they bequeathed after death. Further to this, significant evidence was submitted to the Law Commission review in relation to the detrimental effects of “la
defaultnd fragmentation” where families had differing levels of claim to landed or agricultural holding. 
default&#xa0;
default5default              defaultThe Scottish Countryside Alliance Visiondefault&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultThe SCA vision is one of community inclusion, wherever possible,
default 
defaultwhere an individual land owner and a locali
defaultsed community, 
defaulthave 
defaultwork
defaulted
default in harmony to achieve many of the objectives within the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 without the need for draconian measures such as community buyouts.   
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultWe believe that evidence sourced from the 
defaultRural Analytical Unit 
defaultand 
defaultRural Environment Science and Analytical Services 2012 
defaultresearch, highlights that not all communities are equally well placed to achieve the full benefits of land and asset ownership. In addition, without the right conditions in place, ownership can bri
defaultng with it more risks than benefits (Aiken et al, JRF, 2011; Skerratt, 2011). These can include financial, legal, social, and environmental issues, which impact on the ability of the land or asset to achieve its full potential in terms of community empower
defaultment. It is therefore important that mechanisms are available to prevent 
defaultun
defaultsustainable applications being advanced, even with the support of initial government funding sources. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultCommunity land ownership has been defined by the government as 
default“broadly, 
defaultto mean locally-based communities of various types gaining increased control over, and access to, the physical assets in their locality, for the purpose of exploiting opportunities and realising rural development benefits for the community
default”
default. The 
defaultgovernment’s HIE Community Land Unit’s
default 
defaultfirst objective is 
default“to promote community-led land purchase or management initiatives, including partnerships
default.
default 
defaultHowever, from the experience of already completed buyouts, it would seem that the amount that can be raised
default by community organisations, from private or third sector sources – from participant’s contributions, donations, fund raising, etc – is generally quite insufficient to fund the projects. This problem will be compounded in future by the inevitable dwindling
default of interest from the benevolent community outsider, and as private sponsorship of community buyouts declines as the initial headline and symbolic cases are won.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default4
default              
defaultThese facts are acknowledged by the community on the Isle of Ghiga, one of Scotland’s fir
defaultst community initiatives. The original funding for the buyout came from a Scottish Land Fund grant of £3.5 million (£1 million of which had to be repaid within two years) and a £0.5 million grant from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The community sold th
defaulte old laird's house and fundraised on the island to repay the loan. Further grants coming from the Government's Rural Empty Properties Fund for renovating the cottages and one of £130,000 towards a wind farm; a Big Lottery grant is helping modernise the ol
defaultd steadings for self-catering accommodation, they have also taken out commercial loans. They are slowly moving towards financial independence, but at present are still dependent, to a certain extent, on grants and ongoing fundraising. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
default"Many island res
defaultidents have very high expectations of the community trust, but they seem unaware of just how big a commitment is involved both in time and responsibility. I worry sometimes about the strain it can put on people.”
default&#xa0;
defaultKerrie Redington Highlands and Island Enter
defaultprise
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultAnother sale under the Act, in Inverness-shire, collapsed after the Newtonhill Trust failed to find the funds needed to complete the purchase. In that instance, CKD Galbraith was acting for the owners of Newtonhill
default Woodlands and had received an offer when the community registered an interest in the land and brought the sale to a halt. As a result, says CKD Galbraith, the buyer withdrew. A spokesperson for CKD Galbraith claimed that the property has been blighted as 
defaultan investment. 
default“It has been dragged through the marketplace and there is considerable anxiety in the minds of anybody still in the market for the woodland that community interest will resurface,”
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultThe SCA do not see the need to amend further the Land R
defaulteform (Scotland) Act 2003. We believe that the cultural and financial constraints coupled with the need to “manage through a committee “greatly restricts the potential of any new ownership initiative and that targeted communities can best have involvement 
defaultin the management of land, and or other assets, through an integrated management system and a structured business plan.   
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default              
defaultMany of Scotland’s rural and urban land holdings or other assets have been in the hands of individual and extended families for 
defaultgenerations; with, by and large a successful stewardship and governance of the land or asset. Much of the Scottish uplands and coast are of little commercial land interest or value, dominated by scrub, heath or heather moorland, the landscape offers more t
defaulto Scotland’s biodiversity and carbon sequestration than commercial productivity.  In the current global weather climate it would be foolish to ignore the heritable knowledge of land management in these rural areas and to allow others to change the manageme
defaultnt regime in favour of ill-conceived financial reward. Surely the status quo offers and facilitates good stewardship and governance of land and is 
defaultin the 
defaultnational interest.
