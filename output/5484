defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Good morning, Minister
default,
default and thank you for being available to speak to us today on the departmental Annual Report.
default 
defaultWe are short of time, so I will just quickly ask everyone to introduce themselves for voice transcription purposes and then we will get on.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default defaultI am Martin 
defaultDonnelly, Permanent Secretary of the Department.
defaultVince defaultCable:default Vinc
defaulte 
defaultCable, Secretary of State.
defaultHoward Orme:default Howard 
defaultOrme, Director General, Finance and Commercial.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default I want to start with a few questions on the ONS quarter 
default3
default GDP statistics and, first of all, the construction sector.
default 
defaultDespite all the public good news on the economy, the current construction sector output is significantly below its 2011 level, even though the broader economy is growing.
default 
defaultGiven the strategic significance of construction, do you think that economic growth and the construction sector’s role within it could be undermined by the construction sector’s lack of progress?
defaultVince defaultCable:default It is certainly relatively weak, you are quite right.
default 
defaultThe construction industry took a terrible pounding in recent years.
default 
defaultThere was a combination of factors
default:
default the collapse of the housing market in the crisis and then commercial property and, 
defaultparticularly following the 2009 B
defaultudget, very big cutbacks in capital spending, so the construction industry was very depressed.
default 
defaultThere is some indication at the moment that there is recovery, but as you quite rightly point out, it is lagging behind the rest of the economy and in order to make its 
defaultappropriate contribution we have to see, particularly, a signi
defaultficant upturn in house building—that is one of the key drivers—
defaulttogether with progress on the big infrastructure projects.
default 
defaultThe surveys, as opposed to the backward-looking indicators, do suggest that there is a much more positive spirit in that industry, but it has been through a torrid time and it still has not shown the level of recovery we 
defaultwould 
defaultwant.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default You have talked about housing; how reliant do you think the construction sector is on the Government’s home ownership and housing s
defaultchemes, some of which you have
default exercised some concern about?
defaultVince defaultCable:default It is an important component.
default T
defaulthe only thing I have said that is at all controversial is that you need to manage demand as well as boosting supply, but 
defaultI think 
defaultwe can all agree on that
default; i
defaultt is just a question of how best you do it
default. I
defaultndeed, the Bank of England and 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury have recognised that by changing the emphasis of the Funding for Lending Scheme so that it is now targeted at small business rather than at the mortgage market.
default 
defaultThere is recognition that demand had to be managed and it is being managed.
defaultI would just add one other thing on the construction industry.
default 
defaultWe do recognise in BIS that quite apart from the big macroeconomic factors affecting construction
default,
default there are some specific issues in relation to that industry that have been overlooked for very many years.
default Construction is one of our 11 
defaultsectors, because it is core to the economy.
default 
defaultWhen we have
default got 
defaultthe industry round the table, as we have, we realise there are very, very deep issues regarding lack of skills, which come from a boom-bust cycle approach in parts of the industry
default, the lack of co-ordination. I
defaultnnovation in the British construction industry is very weak compared with some other countries
default;
default 
defaultScandinavia
default has much more advanced building techniques.
default 
defaultWe are trying to work with the industry on a long-term partnership basis, along with the rest of the industrial strategy to deal with those issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default You have par
defaulttly pre-empted my next question. If I may, I shall
default package a number of issues in just one question.
default 
defaultFirst of all, are you concerned that the industry seems over-reliant on housing schemes and, b
defaultasically, what are you doing to
default broaden the role that construction has and deal with the problems that are within it?
defaultVince defaultCable:default Housing is a necessary part of the sector and indeed we want to see lots more houses being built, so if you mean over-reliance, it is not at the expense of housing supply.
default 
defaultWe want to see a lot more houses built.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default I am talking about what steps you are tak
defaulting to improve construction in
default the non-housing sector.
default 
defaultNobody is saying that there should be any diminution.
default 
defaultVince defaultCable:default No, indeed.
default 
defaultThe group we have now assembled around the construction industry is designed to address those bigger systemic, strategic issues.
default As you know, Sir David 
defaultHiggins’
defaults
default track record is outstanding and he is chairing that group.
default 
defaultPart of what we are trying to do is to make sure that there is a long-term process in train for training.
default 
defaultOne of the things that really worries us is that
default,
default as the construction industry picks up from very low levels, it will immediately run into bottlenecks of skilled workers, many of whom disappeared from the labour market in the downturn.
default 
defaultWe are trying to work with the 
defaultindustry to make sure that we have proper apprenticeship programmes, that they are identifying skill bottlenecks ahead and trying to identify other bottlenecks.
default 
defaultIt is extraordinary that on some building sites I go to you find that they are having to import bricks
default,
default because the kilns were closed down in the slump and they are now having to restore that capacity.
default 
defaultTherefore, to the extent to which we can in BIS with the limited instruments that we have, we want to try to help them deal with skill issues and other bottleneck problems.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default defaultYou may have seen the construction industrial strategy 
defaultConstruction 2025
default, which set out four high-
defaultlevel ambitions for the next 11 
defaultyears
default:default to be cheaper, faster, have 50% lower emissions and improve our overall trade performance.
default 
defaultA delivery plan around that will be presented to the Industry Council next month, so that we are taking forward delivery of the strategy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default We will monitor that carefully.
default 
defaultYou mentioned, Minister, the
default Funding for Lending Scheme, and quite rightly 
defaultyou said that demand was largely thro
defaultugh housing and needed to be re
defaultfocused on lending to small businesses.
default 
defaultHave
default you any evidence that the take-
defaultup from small businesses has improved since then?
defaultVince defaultCable:default Not enormously.
default 
defaultAs I understand it, the November figures are a bit better, but small business lending, as we have discussed many times in Committee, is very depressed.
default 
defaultIt reflects the way in which the regulatory system bears upon the banks, the risk weights attached to SME lending, their general switch to more conservative policies.
default 
defaultIf we look over the last few months, the net lending decline, which was apparent over 
defaulta
default long period of time, does appear to be bottoming out.
default 
defaultThere is some evidence that it may be increasing and there are a lot of positive things happening that may not be fully captured in the statistics.
default 
defaultI am not sure, for example, that the peer-to-peer lending would be captured in the normal bank statistics.
default 
defaultSome of the other things we are financing and supporting, like invoice lending, asset-based funding, may not be captured in the numbers.
default 
defaultThe sense we have is that the position is improving, but it is profoundly unsatisfactory.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default I was interested in Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultDonnelly’s remarks about the work he was doing with the construction industry.
default 
defaultThe construction industry was always going to be absolutely central to any move out of recession and into the uplands of growth, not least because it impacts upon those emotional strings
default,
default like well-being and the feeling that 
defaultthings are getting better, that
default lie at the very basis of confidence.
default 
defaultWhen did you start doing your work with the construction industry and could you give us a slight update on the availability of bricks, which is pretty central to this whole issue?
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default As you say, construction is a key industry across the economy and we
default identified it as one of the 11 
defaultsectors 
defaultwhere
default Government partnership had the most to offer
default, s
defaulto we have been working on the industrial strategy for over a year.
default 
defaultWe published it last summer.
default 
defaultWe are taking it forward with a delivery manager being paid for by the industry and we are seeing a return of confidence.
default 
defaultThe latest ONS figures in January did show construction output had increased 2.6% between the third and second quarters last year and 6% year-on-year, so it is moving forward.
default 
defaultThere is more to do in specific areas, like bricks and like skills and, as the Secretary of State has said, these are issues being picked up in the delivery plan, which the sector itself is taking forward with support from the Department and across Government.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default Is your Department not a bit late on this?
default 
defaultShould it not have been doing this contingency thinking three and four years ago?
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default Well, we have aimed to pull together a medium-term strategy.
default 
defaultI think what we are doing now is the right thing to do.
default 
defaultYou can always challenge us to have done it earlier—
defaultMr Binleydefault:default defaultI just have done.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default default—or better, but we are very much on the case now.
defaultVince defaultCable:default defaultI have been regularly meeting the construction industry, the house builders, the construction products industry ever sin
defaultce we came into g
defaultovernment.
default 
defaultThe big step forward, which the Permanent Secretary has just described, is that we now have all these people around the table together.
default 
defaultThey hitherto saw themselves in very fragmented terms and we are now trying to approach it in a more strategic way.
default&#xa0;
defaultChairdefault:default I do not want to labour this point, but part of the problem is that the Department seems very good at producing strategies but we are coming to a point where, reasonably, we expect to see some delivery and we are coming to the end of this particular Parliament.
default But 
defaultwe will monitor the progress of this.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawidefault:default Welcome, Secretary of State.
default 
defaultBefore I ask about the utilities,
default may
default I
default,
default obviously
default,
default commend you on making shareholder votes on executive remuneration binding?
default 
defaultThat is an important step to make sure that we address rewards for failure.
default Sky 
defaultNews are reporting that you are irritated by the news over the 
defaultweekend that the board of Royal 
defaultMail may be thinking of a substantial increase in the Chief Executive’s pay package and you are threatening to use the Government’s vote to vote against any substantial increase.
default 
defaultCan you just tell us where you stand on this?
defaultVince defaultCable:default Royal Mail have
default not approached me, as a principal shareholder
default, and I have not spoken to Sky 
defaultNews.
default 
defaultObviously there are people out there fishing for information on a 
defaultquite 
defaultsensitive subject, but I would simply point out to the
default senior management of the Royal 
defaultMail that we have introduced a remuneration system that requires shareholder approval—
defaultChairdefault:default Minister
default,
default we are having difficulty in hearing you.
default 
defaultDo you think you could speak up?
defaultVince defaultCable:default I would simply, 
defaultwhen I do meet them
default, 
defaultremind them of the new policy that shareholder approval is required for their remuneration policy and also that they should be consulting with their own work
default 
defaultforce on matters of pay.
default I think t
defaulthe speculation is rather premature.
default 
defaultThey 
defaulthave not made an approach to us
default as a shareholder
default,
default and I think people are just anticipating an argument that might come down the track or may not.
default 
defaultNadhim Zahawidefault:default Thank you for that clarification.
defaultChairdefault:default defaultWe will watch that closely and bring you back on it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawidefault:default Yes, indeed.
default 
defaultThe demand for gas for electricity production reduced in the third quarter of 201
default3 and contributed to the utilities
default sector’s contraction by 5.9%.
default 
defaultIs this a positive or negative development, Secretary of State
default?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultIt
default could be an indicator of weak demand, but all the other evidence we have from the rest of the economy suggests that is not the case.
default 
defaultIt could be a positive factor, which is that we are learning to use energy much more efficiently.
default 
defaultAs you know
default—
defaultwe have 
defaultdiscussed it in this Committee—
defaultthere are enormous pressures on the energ
defaulty-intensive industries and there are
default problems of competitiveness internationally.
default 
defaultI know from talking to them that they are making big steps to use gas and electricity more economically and that may well be a factor there.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawidefault:default You have told us in the past that this could be a reflection of the fact that other bits of the economy are not going so well and therefore pulling demand up.
default 
defaultHowever, as you quite rightly point out, other parts of the economy are doing well, so you think this is more about efficiency.
default 
defaultVince defaultCable:default It could be.
default 
defaultIt is a good question and I am just guessing as to what the reasons might be; I have not done an analysis on it.
default But,
default prompted by you, we can go away and do more work on it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawidefault:default That would be very useful, if you can do an analysis on this.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default It is perhaps just worth adding 
defaultthat 
defaultthe figure you quoted is, of course, correct, but on an annual basis it has been pretty flat.
default 
defaultProduction output only fell by 0.1% and there was growth in water supply and sewerage, so it will be interesting to see what the next quarter’s figures look like.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawidefault:default The Chancellor said that it is right to focus on productivity and what we can do to improve the productivity.
default 
defaultIs this a priority for the Department?
defaultVince defaultCable:default It is, but I am reasonably positive about what is sometimes presented as a negative figure, which is the fact that productivity has fallen very sharply in the last five years since the peak of the crisis.
default 
defaultEssentially what has happened is that, contrary to many people’s expectations, unemployment has been nothing like as bad as it could have been or it was in the interwar period or it is in countries like 
defaultFrance
default and 
defaultSweden
default.
default 
defaultUnemployment has been kept down and employment has grown through a very difficult period, but at the expense of productivity.
default 
defaultClearly thou
defaultgh, over the medium and long 
defaultterm, if the country is going to recover in a sustainable way and if living standards are going to rise, living standards can only rise on the back of productivity, so clearly it has to be a key priority and it is one of the themes that underpins our industrial strategy.
default 
defaultAll the work we are doing with aerospace, the motor vehicle industry is about driving productivity improvement.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default If we can take that point a little further, the ONS has published new data this morning and that indicates that of the last nine quarters productivity has fallen in this country in seven of them.
default 
defaultAt a time when the pressure from unit labour costs is hardly high and hours worked in the economy are now higher than they were in 2008, do we not have a really serious problem here and what is the strategy of the Government to address this?
defaultVince defaultCable:default We have a serious problem if it continues, but the poor productivity performance is a flipside of having a relatively favourable performance on employment.
default But
default if we are going to go forward, you are perfectly right
default:
default productivity has now to improve.
default 
defaultAs I say, it is one of the key drivers in our industrial strategy.
default 
defaultOur Department is working with some of the key industries—aerospace, cars, biosciences, supply chains for energy and others—and a lot of the work around innovation, skill training, supply chain rebuilding is about improving British productivity.
default 
defaultThat is what we are doing and you are now seeing spectacular improvements in productivity in some of those key manufacturing sectors.
default 
defaultIt has not happened through the rest of the economy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawidefault:default You
default have answered my next question.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe Office 
defaultfor
default Budget Responsibility is saying that it is difficult to explain the abrupt fall and persistent weakness of productivity.
default 
defaultI was going to ask you what your analysis is, but you have given us that analysis.
default 
defaultIt would have been nice to have been explicit in addressing this major issue of productivity in the Annual Report and Account
defaults
default and I just wonder why that was not addressed so clearly in the Annual Report.
defaultVince defaultCable:default It 
defaultcertainly 
defaultisn’
defaultt through lack of awareness of the issue
default. 
defaultWe may just use different language.
default 
defaultWe talk about achieving growth and growth is a combination of the labour force and productivity.
default 
defaultIt is the two things together and that is simple arithmetic, so it is implicit in our emphasis on growth.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default You quite rightly commented that this, to a certain extent, is
default the 
defaultflipside of higher
default-
defaultthan
default-
defaultexpected 
defaultsustained levels of employment—
defaulthigher than one would reasonably expect looking at the GDP figures.
default 
defaultThe flipside of that, of course, is that private sector investment has been pretty flat.
default 
defaultDo you think there is a very real dang
defaulter that the ability to have low-
defaultcost labour is demoti
defaultvating companies from investing that
default potentially could raise productivity?
defaultVince defaultCable:default I certainly accept it is a factor.
default 
defaultIf you are a company contemplating automation, there is obviously a reduced incentive to automate if your labour costs are being driven down in other ways, which is what has happened over the last few years.
default 
defaultThe issues around investment are very real.
default 
defaultIf this recovery, which is very important and very positive, is going to take permanent form, the next big step will be evidence of substantially increased investment.
default 
defaultFor perfectly good reasons it is not happening at the moment.
default 
defaultIt may be that factor that we have just discussed is a much bigger factor.
default 
defaultThere is still a lot of spare capacity around and if you are a company, you use up your existing capacity before putting in new plant.
default 
defaultThat is what all companies would sensibly do and the evidence we have from industrial surveys—bodies like the Engineering Employers Federation, the CBI and others—is that business is now much more positive about future investment.
default 
defaultAs I say, it is only survey data
default; 
defaultit is not yet the backward-looking ONS data, but it does indicate that those cash piles that have been sitting around will 
defaultget
default into real investment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default Whilst we are on this focus of productivity, I notice that the Office for Budget Responsibility said, beyond what you have already quoted, that much of the loss of productivity is structural.
default 
defaultSlightly ominously, they said it 
default“
defaultwill not return even as the economy recovers.
default” 
defaultIf that is the case, we have a really serious problem that needs attention and maybe, you might say, needed attention before now.
default May
default I ask if you agree with that and, if you do, what your Department and Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultDonnelly might be doing to ensure that we make sure it does not happen?
defaultVince defaultCable:default Given that it is the OBR, I would not want to quarrel with their analysis.
default 
defaultThey are authentic, independent and we take their analysis very seriously.
default I think the point that Robert 
defaultChote and his team would make is that we have not just had a historically disastrous financial crisis with all its consequences
default;
default it has been dealt with in an unusual way, particularly by 
defaultextremely cheap monetary policy, and t
defaulthis has had all kinds of consequences for the way that business 
defaultbehaves. B
defaultut we are now getting back to something like normality and the next big step, as I have already said, is to look at a sustained period of investment leading to productivity improvement
defaults
default. 
defaultYou asked what the Department is doing about it.
default 
defaultI talked about the industrial strategy.
default 
defaultWhat we would argue in the Department is that there is quite a lot that the Government can do, if I can use economic jargon, to crowd in private investment.
default 
defaultSome of the things 
defaultwe are doing through the Green investment b
defaultank
default—
defaultco-investing private projects, the work we are doing through the Regional Growth Fund, the co-financing of investment in innov
defaultative projects in universities—
defaultwould not happen were it not for the interventions we are making.
default 
defaultAs I say, we are limited in what we can do for financial reasons, but that investment is helping private investment to happen and that, in turn, is helping to drive productivity.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr defaultBinleydefault:default defaultMay
default I switch focus?
default 
defaultMuch of what we are talking about is very dependent upon the good work or otherwise of the Department and tha
defaultt is why I want to switch to Mr 
defaultDonnelly.
default 
defaultYou may remember that the staff surveys last year were not particularly good; in fact, they were quite depressing, as 
defaultcommented on by my colleague Mr 
defaultZahawi.
default 
defaultYou went on to say that you were ahead of the game in restructuring and you pretty much bet your salary on the fact that 
defaultthe 
defaultfigures would improve.
default 
defaultThey have not done so, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultDonnelly
default,
default and I therefore wonder whether you are going to advise the Secretary of State that your salary ought to be reduced.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default Well, fortunately for me, Mr 
defaultBinley, they have improved.
default 
defaultWe have seen a significant increase of 2% in the previous year, 3% overall in this year, very large increases in terms of management leadership and vision in the Department and of all of the issues that we surveyed, about 80% of them had more positive scores than the year before.
default 
defaultThat does not mean there is not more to do and we are very focused on delivering it, particularly over the year ahead
default,
default in terms of management systems and ensuring that staff’s voice continues to be heard, but we are making progress.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default defaultI would expect much, much quicker improvement.
default 
defaultLet me come back to what you said about taking the pain early on and then look at why your engagement statistics to the Civil Service average of 58% are down.
default 
defaultThat is the fact of the matter.
default 
defaultNow, I repeat, given that you said they would be above that situation this year, will you hold to your word and tell the 
defaultSecretary of State that you have not done what you said you would do and therefore you feel that you ought to have a cut in salary, as you suggested?
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default I said they would improve and they have improved.
default 
defaultThey have improved significantly and across the board.
default 
defaultIt is true that we are still below the Civil Service average and that is not where we want to be.
default 
defaultWe are doing pulse surveys, as we discussed last year, to make sure that we are checking that progress is continuing during the year, but we have had some rather large increases in key areas of clarity of vision, of shared approach between Ministers and officials, of staff feeling that they are listened to and their ideas are taken note of.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default Your overall statistics are below the Civil Service average.
default 
defaultIf your objective is to be average, I am not sure that I, as a businessman, would agree that that is a good thing to do.
default 
defaultI would expect to see you above that average.
default 
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default And our longer-
defaultterm aim is to be so.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default You told us to hold you to that if you did not achieve better results in that respect and I repeat again
default:
default are you prevaricating or will you go to the Secretary of State tomorrow and say, “Look, S
defaultecretary of State, I really didn’
defaultt achieve what I said I would
default,
default and therefore take 20,000
default 
defaultquid a year back”?
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default But we did achieve an improvement.
default 
defaultWe have further to go, but we have achieved a significant and wide-ranging improvement across the
default key
default—
defaultMr Binleydefault:default As a businessman, I would be bitterly disappointed with the record shown in this survey and I expect you to be too.
default 
defaultLet me now just change focus one more time
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is a matter of interest to me—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Just before you do, could I just raise the point that, if my memory serves me right, the reasoning that you put for the poor scores last year was that you had had to take a whole raft of unpo
defaultpular staffing decisions early, t
defaulthat you had done it, shall we say, ahead of other Departments and it would be reasonable to assume
default that
default morale and figures in the BIS Department would show an increase.
default 
defaultGiven what you said—and you made the comparator with other Departments—would it not be reasonable to expect you now to be ahead of those figures reflected in the difficult decisions that are being made in other Departments
default?
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default It is absolutely reasonable to look at the trend and the pace of progress.
default 
defaultIf you disaggregate the figures, in a lot of areas we have moved up to or beyond the Civil Service average, including in terms of leadership, confidence in management, confidence in vision for the Department as to what we are trying to do in partnership with our Ministers.
default 
defaultWe have also delivered a lot.
default So while
default there is certainly more to do, I am personally very pleased
default,
default and I think it is a reflection on the hard 
defaultwork 
defaultof the Department and its leadership team
default,
default that we have moved them in the right direction.
default 
defaultThe areas that remain a challenge are
default:
default pressures of work, where people are concerned about how much work they have to do
default,
default and there is, rightly, concern about the quality of our IT, in particular, which we are in the process of changing over the spring as we move to a new IT contract.
default 
defaultI would hope and expect that that will be reflected in the figures as we go forward too.
default 
defaultVince defaultCable:default Can I just say perhaps a brief word in defence of the Permanent Secretary, who is under pressure on this?
default 
defaultThe reason why there is staff pressure is because we are trying to do some very tough things in terms of cutting administrative costs.
default 
defaultOver this Parliament, we will have cut our administrative costs by over 50%, which I think is one of the highest, if not the highest, in 
defaultWhitehall
default.
default 
defaultWe have been asked to do more and that is right, but I would not expect the staff necessarily to be cooing with pleasure at being put under growing pressure, which they are, and they are not ending; the Treasury has not said, “Thanks guys, you can now relax
default.” 
defaultThere is pressure to do more and more in terms of administrative saving and pressure of work and that is the context in which the 
defaultstaff are operating.
default 
defaultI do meet the staff representatives frequently—well, every six months, if you regard that as frequent.
default 
defaultI have not had any feedback from them
default,
default and speaking face
default-
defaultto
default-
defaultface with
default our representatives, that they feel the Department is managing this badly.
defaultMr Binleydefault:default 
defaultYour defence of your staff is admirable and that is recognised. I would say, however, in terms of Mr Donnelly’s words, that had there not been any improvement at all, I would be asking him to give you his resignation, not only to take a £20,000
default&#xa0;
defaultcut in his salary, quite frankly, as Mr Donnelly suggested last year. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultWe will look forward to seeing the Department perform above the Civil Service average next year. Do you think that is possible?
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default 
defaultIt depends partly on what happens everywhere else. I can say that for our Department we are committed to continuing to improve across the range of indicators, because they are relevant to the quality of service we provide to Ministers, the taxpayer and the country as a whole, so it is important.
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultWell, I am sure we will be looking at this in one year’s time and will be holding you to account again.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default 
defaultI just am concerned—forgive me, this is not a personal attack on you in any sense, Secretary of State. The storms of political innuendo and party friction were described by a former Prime Minister as being the rocks on which Governments flounder. They have been battering at your door relentlessly of late and I wonder if you would tell me, in terms of the performance of your Department, whether those shocks really do smack home. I do not wish to say specifically what I am talking about, but I think you understand.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI would be interested to know what those specific things are
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default 
defaultThe specific things are the troubles created for your particular party by Lord Rennard; that was the particular point, but I wonder whether those shocks do harm Government
default.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI do not see the connection between Lord Rennard’s affairs and the morale of my staff. It is an interesting—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default 
defaultNo, I was talking about whether they harm Government, Secretary of State.
defaultVince defaultCable:default I am 
defaultnot sure that they do. I would simply say, on behalf of my own Department, like everybody in senior positions in the Cabinet, we take a bit of a battering, 
defaultand that is life and you learn to cope with it; I am still here. In terms of BIS specifically, I would simply say we have seven Ministers: two Lib Dems, five Conservatives. I would say—and I am not saying this just for effect—we have a very good collegiate team and it works across the coalition. I frequently speak out, as you know, and make waves on policy issues, but in terms of the human relationships and working relationships at the coalface, we do very well. These things happen outside Government and—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default 
defaultSo we can disregard it in that respect.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI think you can, yes. 
defaultMr Binleydefault:default I 
defaultam grateful and I am pleased about that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultSecretary of State, I remember back in autumn 2010 when we were debating the student funding changes, one of the positives that you and, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister used to try to win over waverers was the extension of tuition fee loans to part-time students for the first time. Since then, part-time entrants at undergraduate level have fallen by 38%. What is your reflection on that?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI am concerned about it and, you are quite right, it was one of the areas where we thought we had made a step forward. Some of the other things we had to do were painful and reflected shortage of money and we wanted to do it in a sensible way and, where full-time undergraduates are concerned, we have been pleasantly surprised by the outturn
default:
default demand has not been affected; people from underprivileged backgrounds want to go into higher education in great numbers; the finances of the universities are in much better shape. There are some very good outcomes from what was a very painful exercise. 
defaultOn part-timers, none of the factors that are negative in respect of the rest of the university sector seem to apply, because there is no numbers control. Part-timers have been given, as you acknowledged, access to the student loan scheme. I meet frequently with the Open University and other institutions that do part-time students to try to get to the bottom of this. Nobody has a simple explanation for it and it is a big challenge to us to try to turn this round. But I accept that, in the spectrum of things we do, this is a weak and worrying area.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultDo you think it was helped by the decision to take £40
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion away from the part-time student component of Student Opportunity Funding?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultSorry, are you talking about the public discussion of that?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultNo, I am going to come on to that, but the decision last year to take away £40 million, which was the part-time student funding component of the Student Opportunity Allocation.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultLike a lot of the things we have had to do, it was not pleasant
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultI know it was not pleasant, but did it help the situation in terms of addressing the issue?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI am sure it did not help the situation, but the point I would make is that the fall off in part-time students is a trend that has been going on for quite a long time. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultBut it has accentuated steeply since 2010.
defaultVince defaultCable:default It certainly did not help; I would accept that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultMore specifically, what are you doing about it?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultThere are various things happening that are positive in that space. I suppose if you are asking what we are doing about wanting to encourage them, the area where part-time study has not fallen off and, indeed, it is positive, there is real growth, is in higher education provided in further education colleges. That is something we have actively promoted. We want to see higher education widened and through a range of providers and FE colleges have a particular, distinctive role. They may be better than conventional universities at picking up people wanting a second start in life, which is where a lot of the part-time students come from. We have also supported adult participation in other ways through the FE sector, so that may be one way in which we can address the adverse trend, but I frequently meet the sector. I am very keen to take ideas from them as to how we can reverse a trend that certainly I do regard as worrying.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default 
defaultCan I add one example to that? We have been looking at the evidence, as we do when these things happen, and we commissioned Universities UK to do a report into this issue, which was published, you may recall, in October
default.
default One of the issues they identified was the question of equivalent and lower qualifications policy—that we focused support on students studying for the first time at a particular level. In the light of that, we have looked at this again and relaxed the rules in engineering, technology and computer science.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultMay I move on to the issue that I think you were anticipating, Secretary of State, in relation to the Student Opportunity Allocation? We discussed this with the Universities Minister last week, when he was not able to give us any assurances that the allocation would not be cut. There have obviously been reports that it is to be cut by 60% and indeed that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is pushing for a complete withdrawal of that funding. What is the current position and would you not accept that it would have a significant impact on widening participation programmes, particularly in relation to retention and support for those universities that are doing most in this area?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI ignore some of the press noise around this because this is the time of year when the Government sends a letter to HEFCE—the Higher Education Funding Council—setting out financial allocations. We are currently in the process of deciding how those 
defaultshould be made.
default 
defaultWe have increased funding for certain kinds of activities, as you saw in the autumn statement.
default 
defaultEqually, we have to cope with a top slice; we have to cope with the 2015
default&#x2011;
default16
default 
defaultspending review allocations, which of course affect universities because the academic terms
default force us to think over two years. So there is a process of allocation currently taking place. 
defaultNow, it is perfectly understandable that the people out there in the universities are concerned about how it will affect them and there is a time-honoured tradition where people look at the worst-case scenarios affecting their particular set of interests and talk about it publicly
default.
default We understand that, but I think within a short period of time you will find that we have come to an agreement on how to make those allocations. I am very conscious of the pressures around that particular budget. I cannot give you concrete assurances, because we have not come to a final decision, but I certainly do not want to do anything that would damage the wider participation agenda.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultWhen are you planning to send out the grant letter? I think in the past it has never been sent later than 23 January.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultIt may well have been, but we do not have a fixed deadline. We have to get agreement as to how we do it with our colleagues in Government and that is what I am working on. It will be soon, but I am not giving a date.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultI have been reading for the last two weeks that it was due soon. Given the fact that there is, I think it is fair to describe, a degree of nervous uncertainty within the higher education sector, and that certainty is a very important thing for all businesses, and the HE universities are businesses as well, when can they reasonably expect to know that?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultAs I say, I cannot give a precise date. The important thing for them to understand, and I am sure you do anyway, is that we are dealing with quite a lot of moving parts. It is not just the letter to the universities. There is a letter to the Skills Funding Agency, which affects FE; we have to get that right and, as you know, I attach great importance to FE and the contribution it makes
default.
default There is the funding of science research. These things all interact and we have to get the various moving parts working together before we make a pronouncement affecting one sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultWould you accept, though, Secretary of State, that it would have significant impact on some of the neediest groups of students within higher education? 
defaultSheffield
default 
defaultHallam
default 
defaultUniversity
default in my constituency has written to the Member for Sheffield Hallam pointing out that it is those with caring responsibilities, looked
default&#x2011;
defaultafter children, low-income families, disabled students who would be the most impacted by withdrawal of Student Opportunity Funding. Do you think that is right?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultYes, I know the Vice Chancellor and his views, which are shared by many other vice chancellors and I share the analysis. Yes, we have to be very careful, in the allocations we make, not to damage the wider participation agenda. I visit universities frequently, as does the Universities Minister, and I am very conscious of the pressures they are under.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultYou made reference to the autumn statement. Obviously, the Chancellor in the autumn statement said that the proposed expansion of student numbers was directly funded by further sales of sections of the student loan book. Last week, your Director of HE, Matthew Hilton, told us there was no such link. What is the situation? Who is right—is it the Chancellor or your Director of HE?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultYou may correct me, but I am not sure that he used the word “direct” link
default.
default There is a link in the sense that the point he is making is that we want to spend more money on important priorities, including higher education and our Department, through asset sales, is helping to realise cash, which indirectly supports it. I do not think the Chancellor intended to say that there was some kind of one-for-one linkage between the two things. Symbolically it is quite important.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultI think if you read the autumn statement, there is no other reasonable interpretation of what he said
default.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultWell, I am just giving my interpretation
default.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultIn that case, I think it is a very unreasonable one. The autumn statement was pretty explicit on this
default.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI know members of the Committee understand higher education funding. It is a complicated area, but you obviously do understand as a Committee that it is a different kind of funding in terms of the way that public accounting deals with things. I do not think anybody in the Treasury or anywhere else in Government would expect a mechanical, one
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultone relationship between the two things.
defaultMr Walkerdefault:default 
defaultMy recollection is that the wording used was “offset” rather than “directly linked”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultWe could probably have a long debate about the relationship between “offset” and “directly linked”, but I think it was a reasonable interpretation of it.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI think what Mr Walker says is absolutely right. There is an offset, but it cannot be done in a mechanical, one-to-one way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultMr Hilton did say that the Treasury had underwritten the expansion regardless of whether the loan book was sold. What impact will that have on your budget if the book is not sold?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultHoward, can you explain the financing of it?
defaultHoward Orme:default 
defaultThe context of the issue is that this was additional spending and the Chancellor was saying how within the fiscal envelope that was going to be funded
default.
default If there is a variation against the envelope—say, for example, we did not press the button on student loans—then we would have to be sitting down with the Treasury along with the rest of the Government to see how that was going to be made up, but it would be taken as one of the variations that has to be handled. There is specific extra spending that needs to be funded. There is a proposal in place. If there is a variation to those plans, then there is a discussion with the Treasury about how we handle it.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default 
defaultI would just add that it is not unique to do this. We did it, you may recall, a couple of years ago in terms of the spectrum sales and how that funding was going to be used to pay for capital. It is a way of bringing these issues together as we go forward. We obviously have to manage our budget within the overall spending review process and then, beyond that, we would have to look again at the wider liabilities and assets of the Department
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultOn the management of the Department’s budget in relation to higher education, a failure to have controls on private sector courses was something that a number of people, including this Committee, flagged up warnings about. As late as March, the Universities Minister was robustly defending that policy; seven months later, you scrapped it and imposed controls. What hole did that leave in the budget and why did you fail to recognise the warnings that you were given?
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default 
defaultYou will not be surprised to hear that I do not have anything in substance to add to what David Willetts said to you last week, but it is important to underline in this area, as I know the Committee is aware, that there are considerable uncertainties. As we move 
defaultinto opening up demand, the question of how many, or indeed how few, students are going to take up, we do not have a lot of historical data to do estimates from, so inevitably there is a degree of uncertainty. We have to take our best central estimate and then we have to be ready to respond rapidly, as we were in this case, when it appears that in certain areas, and particularly in certain courses, the take-up has been much larger than we had expected. That is what we have done and the measures that we have taken are having an impact and working. As David Willetts said, we do ultimately have to live within our budgets.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfielddefault:default 
defaultMy question was, what hole has that left in your budget? What was the cost of unanticipated costs as a result of the decisions you took on that? Perhaps you can write to us on that, because I am testing the Committee’s patience.
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultIt would be very helpful if we could have a figure on that.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default 
defaultOkay.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default 
defaultIn the old system of university regulation, HEFCE was able to attach conditions to the provision of grant. With the shift now towards a predominantly fees-based funding structure, would you accept that HEFCE’s ability to have the same leverage in regulating the system is diminished?
defaultVince defaultCable:default defaultLogic
defaultally, yes, indeed. That is the new world we are moving into in which there is greater freedom for students and universities, but yes, the degree of leverage is necessarily diminished under that system.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default 
defaultIs that not a concern—that you may end up weakening the ability to regulate the sector as a whole?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultThe aim of Government is not to have more regulation of the sector for its own sake. There are certain things we want the sector to achieve. Indeed, in the autumn statement we had additional funding for STEM subjects, particularly to reinforce the teaching of engineering and high-cost subjects, and we can send signals to the sector in that way. But direct central control is clearly diminishing, because that goes with the model.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default 
defaultThe Higher Education Institute has expressed the view that primary legislation might be required to sort out, in a sense, who is the lead regulator in the system and to provide clarity on that front. What would your response to that recommendation be?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultSo far, we have managed without new legislation and maybe in the next Parliament people will come back and have a look at that, but through dialogue with the sector and through the various financial streams that we have, we have been able to achieve our objectives. But I think there is an open debate out there as to whether more or less regulation is needed and it is something we may well have to come back to.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default 
defaultMinister of State Willetts’s response to many of these points has been to point out that there is a new sanction that is available under the new regulatory system, which involves barring students
default 
defaultfrom institutions that had not met the terms and conditions for access to state loans. Has that new power come into force as yet?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultBasic quality requirements, yes, indeed
default.
default The controls that we have put on the private providers have that effect.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default 
defaultIs there a problem, though, with, in a sense, HEFCE being asked to regulate funds that it does not directly provide
default?
default A lot of these funds are now coming from the private sector.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultIndeed. It is no longer a Gosplan institution—the  higher education system. We had what we called free universities, but the higher education system operated like the former 
defaultSoviet Union
default. Universities were told exactly what they could do, exactly how many students they could have and exactly what they should study. We do not think that is appropriate in our kind of world. We want students to be able to choose; we want universities to have freedom to adapt their courses, so inevitably HEFCE, which is the intermediate body between Government and the sector, does not have the degree of control that Stalin would have liked under that kind of system. We are moving into a different world and it does involve loss of control.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default 
defaultLast week with Minister of State Willetts we explored another of the points that the Higher Education Commission have expressed views on. They have said, “We are concerned that there is a growing unregulated sector of higher education that may be offering insufficient provision to students.” What is your Department doing to address this?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultAs the Permanent Secretary said, and maybe he can develop it a little bit, we have taken concrete action to rein back some of the expansion in the alternative providers. Just to be very clear, a lot of these alternative providers are very good, innovative institutions. They do not necessarily operate like traditional universities, but they provide high-quality courses in a different way and amongst the alternative provision come the FE colleges, which goes back to the discussion with Mr Blomfield. We are not trying to rein back good, innovative experiments, but at the bottom end of the market, if I can put it like that, there may well be serious problems of quality. There also is an immigration control issue, which we have tried to deal with too. I do not know whether you want to set out the specific measures we took.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default 
defaultOne 
defaultimportant one, as you will be aware, was introducing number controls for alternative providers in the 2014
default&#x2011;
default15 financial year based on the 2012
default&#x2011;
default13 recruitment levels.
default 
defaultThen, from 2015
default&#x2011;
default16, we would aim at high-quality alternative providers and that is the quality control point. We would free them in the same manner as for other HEFCE-funded provision while keeping the control on the higher-risk end. We are trying to get that balance right and it is one that we have to go on reviewing as we go forward.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultTurning to the issue of apprenticeships, Secretary of State, what analysis has your Department carried out about which age group benefits most from undertaking apprenticeships and which age group benefits the economy most from undertaking apprenticeships?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultThe figures show that apprenticeships have been expanding quite rapidly for all age groups except 16 to 19, and that almost certainly reflects employer preferences for people who have work experience. That is why the apprenticeship reform that we are taking through at the moment, and that my colleague is leading on, is bringing in this concept of traineeships, so that young people, school leavers, can pass through a period where they have the basic 
defaulteducational requirements, where they have some work experience and support for that and then they are in a better position to go into the apprenticeship route. As it stands at the moment, the 16 to 19-year-old has been declining relative to adults.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultYes, and it has declined in the recent year. From your analysis, are these young people going into formal education in another sense or are they forming part of the NEET group?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultQuite a lot of them are going into formal education. There is obviously a big NEET problem that we are trying to address in a variety of ways with the Youth Contract. It is high and it is a worrying social phenomenon
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultHas there been interest from employers about this traineeship-type model and when can we expect it to deliver?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultIt is only just getting under way. I have seen some figures in the last week or so that suggest that there is genuine interest in the traineeship model, but it is far too early. We can certainly brief you on the figures we have, which are very fragmentary.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultIt would be helpful. Given the urgency and given the fact of the extent of long-term unemployment amongst under 19-year-olds in this country, which remains very high, I would have thought there would be a strategy that would tell us the date of implementation, how many are anticipated in each year. It would be very helpful for the Committee if we had more information.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultWe can certainly give you a progress report
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walkerdefault:default 
defaultThis is a key area, particularly because we have the whole discussion about raising the participation age. One of my concerns is that that is often misrepresented as just raising the school-leaving age. Can you confirm, Secretary of State, particularly in respect of the BIS Department, it is very important that we see raising the participation age as work, training and school and that therefore, overall, it is your aim to increase the number of apprenticeships, traineeships, whatever you want to call them—the number of training opportunities in work for 16 to 19-year-olds?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultYes, that is the objective and, clearly, I have been out a lot talking to employers. They find it very difficult to take on teenagers, partly because a worryingly high number do not have basic English and maths and mainly because habits of work have not been established
default.
default In particular, in the economic conditions that we have had recently when companies are under pressure, particularly SMEs, they want people who are ready for work and we have to create a pathway, which is what the traineeships are designed to do.
defaultMartin defaultDonnelly:default 
defaultWe already have over 500 company providers who have committed to delivering traineeships in the current year. It is a constant effort and a lot of time and indeed funding goes into trying to talk to employers, including small employers, to make sure that they connect with the apprenticeship system, which of course is in their interest, so we have another apprenticeship week on 3 March. We also have systems of incentives when they take on younger employees; they get a £1,500 payment in smaller businesses. We are working very hard to ensure that having raised the quality of those 16 to 18 apprenticeships, as we needed to do, we are also extending the range.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultMr Donnelly, on the point you just raised about the apprenticeship week, what are you going to do about the gender segregation of apprenticeships as part of that initiative and what discussions are you having with small employers, in particular, about the gender divide, which has been raised by our Committee?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultThere is recognition that there is a particular problem around engineering apprenticeships. That is where there is a desperate shortage of young women. The analysis we have suggests that the problem is not really with the employers. Of course, no doubt some of them could be more sensitive to concerns that women have, but it starts much earlier on; it is 12-year-olds, 10-year-olds. It is about getting people into the right career path.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultCould I just turn to the issue about the Advanced Learning Loans? Our Committee staff noticed a reference reported in 
defaultFE Week 
defaultthat you are withdrawing this particular scheme and there is also a reference in the National Audit Office Departmental Overview, but we were unable to find any statement that you had made to Parliament in this regard. Can you tell me, was a written Ministerial Statement made or what the announcement was?
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultThe 24+ loan scheme has worked well. In other words, there is a very big take-up for most of the training and it is exceeding our expectations, but in the apprenticeship area there was very little take up. We concluded that that was not working and decided to cease it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultYes, but what I am asking for is, when did you make that decision and how did you make that public? We only found out simply by chance, as a Committee. There did not appear to be any announcement made to Parliament. It seemed to have gone into a newspaper first of all.
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultI can certainly try to find out why we did not brief Parliament more thoroughly. That is a perfectly fair point, but we responded to evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechindefault:default 
defaultThere are only 516 who have used that particular scheme in the last nine months. Can you tell me what is happening to the money that was put aside for those loans? Is it going to be put back into the apprenticeship budget? 
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultThat is my understanding, but can we check that?
defaultHoward Orme:default 
defaultYes, it has been recycled into other parts that are doing better.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultI understand from 
defaultFE Week 
defaultthat the SFA website is still advertising these loans. There does seem to be some muddle and confusion. An announcement is in 
defaultFE Week
default but Parliament is not aware of it, and the Skills Funding Agency, not exactly an insignificant player in this area, does not seem to be aware of it. What is going on? 
defaultVince defaultCable:default 
defaultIf they are advertising 24+ loans for FE that is fine.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultNo, loans for apprenticeships. I have to qualify what I say. It is taken from FE. I am 
defaultassuming it is correct, but no doubt, if it is not, you will clarify that.
defaultVince Cable:default I do not know where the communications failure has occurred.
default 
defaultWe can investigate that, but certainly it is absolutely right that they should be advertising 24+ loans, because that is the policy and it is working.
default 
defaultOn the apprenticeships, it has ceased and we can find out why the message has not got through.
defaultChair:default I would be grateful to receive that information.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default You said earlier that the small business lending market is very depressed and the latest 
defaultSME Finance Monitor 
defaultshows that SMEs are overwhelmin
defaultgly under-
defaultconfident that their application for a loan or an overdraft would be approved.
default 
defaultYou know this is a massive problem
default up and down the country and it is having a big effect on businesses. On average, the confidence does not seem to have improved over the last two years. Do you think this lack of confidence is acting as a brake on growth?
defaultVince Cabledefault Yes
default I do, and it is a potentially very serious one as the economy recovers, because the backbone of the economy and job creation is the SME sector and they have to feel confident that they will have access to finance as they do it. It was because we realised that this was a problem and potentially a more serious problem that we set up the Business Bank, which is now operating in different ways. As you know, we pulled together all the various finance schemes and, as a consequence of that, the amount of money available under the guarantee schemes has increased quite dramatically in the last year. As to the new money for new types of lending, as I say, there is a £300 million offer out in the market at the moment, which we are using for unconventional funding. Yes, the premise of your question is quite right.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clarkdefault:default 
defaultWe are going to ask some more detailed questions on the Business Bank, but one of the key barriers seems to be the way the banks themselves behave. 31% of would-be loan seekers say that they felt they were discouraged by the bank, either directly or indirectly. A lot more of it was indirect discouragement; people felt they were put off, so they did not go ahead with the application. What do you think you can do to try to shift that culture so that companies go ahead with the process?
defaultVince Cabledefault:
default 
defaultThere is almost certainly a discouraged demand problem. We argue with the banks about how important that really is. What is beginning to happen is that the established banks are changing their culture. Certainly I frequently engage with the heads of the leading banks—Barclays, RBS, Santander and the others—and after a very long period where the major banks disengaged from relationship banking through branches, they are now recognising that was a mistake. They are now retraining staff so that they can engage properly with small business and indeed welcome them rather than regard them as a problem. We are beginning to see that happen. There are now some very good role models; Handelsbanken is the one people often look to as a good example
default.
default Some banks—
defaultSantander
default—I know are ambitious in trying to expand their small business lending, but for the established major banks, whether they are publicly or privately owned, this is a more difficult issue, but I think they have the point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clarkdefault:default 
defaultYou have been before this Committee on quite a number of occasions now and been asked about this issue, which obviously is a concern throughout the House. You have announced a range of initiatives and spoken about a range of things your Department has tried to do. Obviously, there has been a whole range of further announcements 
defaultover recent months. What confidence do you have that your approach now will be more successful and do you have any evidence that you can give to the Committee to show that we are beginning to see an improvement? You talked about a bottoming out earlier on, but what do you have to show that is evidence that the way you are now handling it as a Department will be more successful than previously?
defaultVince Cabledefault:
default I 
defaultam very confident that the interventions we are making are making a difference and we can certainly make all the information available to you on, for example, the guarantee schemes, which are now much more proactive and have happened. We are not talking about promise in the future; they have happened and are happening
default.
default Some of the new types of funding, like to peer-to-peer lending, are happening very rapidly and are happening partly because of Government support through the various schemes that we have, including those now under the umbrella of the Business Bank. There are changes happening quite rapidly, we are benchmarking them and that accounts in some measure for the fact that I am in a more optimistic frame of mind about that than I have been in the past. 
defaultKaty Clarkdefault:default 
defaultI know we have time issues, but I think we have some more detailed questions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walkerdefault:default 
defaultClearly, we all want to see banks lending more effectively to SMEs. The Business Bank will not be investing directly in small businesses, so how can it boost lending through to the SME sector?
defaultVince Cabledefault:
default 
defaultIt is not lending directly, because that would involve setting up a whole new chain of branches and we do not think that is cost effective, particularly as there are new banks—as you know, Williams &amp; Glyn’s has been hived off and TSB
default.
default We think it is better for it to act in a wholesale capacity. The new funding, which is where they are currently out in the market at the moment looking for private sector partners, involves things like new banking institutions that are funding debt in new ways for companies. We hope that some of the new challenger banks may be able to draw on the Business Bank, but that is how it will operate. It will not operate through a high street facade. Maybe people are frustrated and are saying, “Where is the Business Bank? It is not in our area.” It is not intended to be. The leverage that it can obtain in this way is already very striking and through the projects that have already been negotiated—I have forgotten the ratio but it is something like 1:10—we think we can do far more with taxpayers’ money than lending it out directly. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walkerdefault:default 
defaultI hope that turns out to be the case. You mentioned in your previous comments a degree of disengagement by some of the major banks, particularly on branch lending. Do you think the prospect of a large reorganisation and caps on branch numbers would encourage engagement or do you think that would be a distraction from re-engaging with SME customers
default?
defaultVince Cabledefault:
default I 
defaulthave been critical of that particular proposal, partly on the grounds that a lot of things—we are talking about Mr Miliband’s recommendation—are happening. One of his proposals was to have two new challenger banks. Well, we have just created two new challenger banks out of Lloyds and RBS. It was not straightforward, because there are quite complex issues about dividing up the technology platforms, but that has happened. There is a wide range of challenger banks now coming into the market. We had many of them around the table in my Department a couple of weeks ago, looking at the problems they face in terms of getting access to the clearance network and so on. These things are happening and there is a lot of innovation and the Business Bank is very much behind that. 
defaultOne thing I have not mentioned and where I would qualify my earlier response to you is there is one area where we do effectively do direct lending, which is through the Start Up Loans scheme. That is growing very, very rapidly. We do work with private and charitable bodies who act as intermediaries, but we are much more directly engaged in that than in other Business Bank activities.
defaultMartin Donnellydefault:
default 
defaultThe other specific area it is worth mentioning is the area of wholesale guarantees, where from this spring the Business Bank is going to be able to make it easier for other banks to lend without having capital issues. That is potentially a very important step forward that makes lending to SMEs relatively more attractive
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockartdefault:default 
defaultYou will not be surprised at my continuing interest in the Green investment bank. Having looked at the Mid
default&#x2011;
defaultYear Report and at the Annual Report, it is quite telling that there is so little detail really about the forecast £700 million underspend in the Green investment bank. In fact, you would have to really be an accountant to pick up on it, because in the annual accounts it makes a small appearance in variance between 
defaultDEL
default capital outturn and estimate. Why is there so little detail on that in these reports and what were the reasons behind that underspend?
defaultVince Cabledefault:
default 
defaultThey have invested quite a lot already. We had a figure of £700 or £800 million objective and most of that is on the way to being committed. There has been a bit of a hiatus caused by one specific issue, which were the delays in getting out the electricity market review strike prices for offshore wind. That affected the willingness of investors to proceed and make commitments that the Green investment bank will support, but now that issue has been resolved they do not see any problem with pushing ahead with financial commitments. However, if your question is about lack of transparency and lack of clarity, then maybe that is an issue I can take up with the Chairman and try to make sure you are properly briefed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockartdefault:default 
defaultThat was the second part of my question, certainly. Are you therefore saying that you are confident, or your Department is confident, that that underspend will be taken up and it has just been the hiatus in electricity market reform and perhaps the due diligence around what are exceptionally large projects?
defaultVince Cabledefault: I 
defaultmet the Chairman and the Chief Executive last week and I asked them exactly the same question. They are optimistic that their deal flow is substantial and will speed up now they have clarity over the policy.
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: 
defaultIt is worth adding that we deliberately set up an agreement with the Treasury, as you will know, on the Green investment bank on the basis that it did not have to rush deals through for an arbitrary end-of-March deadline and it could pursue commercial timing. It has that flexibility between years, which is very important.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockartdefault:default 
defaultFrom my perspective, the worry I have is that the focus on very large projects is making it quite difficult for them to find investments in 
defaultScotland
default particularly, because although there are huge numbers of projects there, by their nature they tend to be smaller projects. Can anything be done to help them to be able to aggregate projects, to structure finance in a different way to be able to help that?
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultI think they are very conscious. This is an institution using public money and the point I have made to them quite often is that we therefore want it to be publicly visible. 
defaultWe do not want to interfere, but we do want it to be publicly visible so that people in 
defaultScotland
default and everywhere else can see where the money is going and identify with what is a very good and successful institution. 
defaultThe explanation for what you are describing is that when they are dealing with relatively small projects they tend to do it through funds, so there is a kind of aggregation of small projects in funds they support
default.
default I have been round large numbers of openings, including a couple in 
defaultScotland
default, which have benefited directly from Green investment bank activity, but I hear what you say. This is a good institution, we helped to create it, it has good political support, but we must be able to demonstrate what is happening on the ground.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default defaultObviously, we are now running into time for Prime Minister’s Questions. I understand, Minister, that you are okay to stay for some time; is that correct?
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultYes, if you wish me to
default.
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes, and provided we have Members who are not committed to PMQs, then we will continue, for a while anyway. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockartdefault:default 
defaultOn a slightly different subject, which is local economic growth, the National Audit Office says that the portfolio of initiatives on local economic growth has seen mixed progress and slow job creation. Your Mid
default&#x2011;
defaultYear Report identifies that agenda as “a big challenge”, so could I ask—put you on the spot—what are your three main priorities in relation to that local growth agenda and how will your strategy achieve those?
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultWhen you are talking about the local growth agenda, we are talking about different things. It is partly making sure that institutions like the Regional Growth Fund are effective. There was some initial criticism of it, but we now feel very pleased with the quality of the projects, the amount of private sector leverage that they are obtaining, so continuing building on the Regional Growth Fund would be No.1.
defaultNo. 2 would be improving the overall performance of the Local Enterprise Partnerships. They are, necessarily, of variable quality and varying degree of readiness. We are trying to avoid a dependency culture. We try to encourage them to develop on their own with some core funding, so the work that I do and the Minister of State, Mr Fallon, does with the Local Enterprise Partnerships is crucial.
defaultThe third step will be next financial year, when there is a much bigger pot of funding under which the local growth arrangements can work, most of them operating through the LEPs, some of them through a City Deal type arrangement. Making a success of that will be the third priority.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockartdefault:default 
defaultThe second part of my question, however, was how are you going to measure, how can you see whether these have been effective? You talk about ensuring that the Regional Growth Fund leverages private funds in, but how are you going to measure the success of that? You talked about the variable quality of LEPs; that in itself is a difficulty. There are difficulties of it being between Departments; it is not entirely within your gift in BIS. There are quite a few challenges there. What processes do you have in place to measure the effectiveness and success of those things?
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultIf you are talking about a central body like the Regional Growth Fund, there are established metrics that are used in terms of value for money, benefit-cost ratio, jobs created
default.
default There is always going to be an argument about how much is genuinely additional. That is an inherent problem when you are supporting new investment: would they have done it anyway? We think we do it in a rigorous way. The Public Accounts Committee are there to hold us to account, to make sure that we are giving accurate and meaningful analysis, so there is a process in respect of the Regional Growth Fund that is now, I think, pretty impressive.
defaultIn terms of how you measure the performance of the Local Enterprise Partnerships, that is more difficult. The whole point about letting go and letting local organisations, including local government, have more discretion is that you lose control of what they do and, indeed, of its impact. We go back to the arguments that were at the heart of the Heseltine report: do you try to do these things out of central Government and control them and measure them and have tight control of performance, or do you just cut some of the umbilical cord to central Government and let local organisations flourish, in which case some of them will make mistakes?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockartdefault:default 
defaultEqually, though, there is a balance between just throwing money at a problem and hoping that it does what you want and making sure that you are getting value for money for that.
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultExactly. It is the issue about devolved government, which you will know from Scottish experience.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultGiven the PAC report on lending to small business and the role of the Business Bank, could you give me some sort of idea of just how you feel you will be responding to that?
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultThe criticism is a little bit dated
default.
default If we are talking about the various financial support mechanisms for SMEs, those have now been rationalised. They are being brought together under the Business Bank—certainly those of central Government; we cannot account for what local councils do. Of the ones that operate centrally, the only exception is UK Export Finance, which operates separately, but all of the others are now rationalised and operate within a common framework and a common system of management, so we have anticipated that criticism and have addressed it.
defaultA more difficult issue is all the various schemes related to business advice. There are some that operate out of central Government, like the GrowthAccelerator, but there are many others operating locally. We have charged the Business Bank with the responsibility of trying to rationalise as much of this business advice as possible, but this is a second priority beyond making sure that the funding to SMEs goes ahead. However, we do want to rationalise those advice schemes and we know that they have proliferated over the years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harrisdefault:default 
defaultLast year, you reported that about three quarters of UKTI’s customers were satisfied with the service they received and I wanted you to comment on how that compares with the latest figures that might be available.
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultI do not have the satisfaction surveys to hand, but my impression is that the reforms in UKTI have been effective and are appreciated by business. The big new development, as you will know, is the establishment of local Chamber
default&#x2011;
defaultbased activities on the 
defaultground in the countries, which are specifically designed to help SMEs to get out into the big growth markets. I have just come back 36 hours ago from the Gulf, where two of these projects, one in 
defaultDubai
default and one in 
defaultAbu Dhabi
default, are being launched this year and I think this UKTI model now of working through much stronger local Chambers will make a step change for the better.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harrisdefault:default If 
defaultand when you are able to give us the satisfaction figures, we will look forward to seeing them. 
defaultMy next question is about our export targets generally. We have made some great improvements this year in various areas, but we still have a huge hurdle to go. The target of a trillion of exports by 2020 does not, at the moment, look like it is going to be hit, I believe, but I just wondered if you could comment on how BIS contributes to your ambition to increase towards that target and what impact you feel your Department is having on that at the moment.
defaultVince Cabledefault:
default It is disappointing that exports have been flat in real terms for the last two years, but I do not see why this should make us pessimistic about reaching the target objective by the end of the decade, which is still quite a long time off.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harrisdefault:default 
defaultWe will need something like a 10% increase year-on-year to reach it.
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultYes. Trying to understand why we are where we are is important. We have had a substantial devaluation in the back of 2008 and 2009 of 25% overall and it is disappointing that that has not resulted in a big increase in export performance and import substitution, as it should have done. Economics tells us that should have happened and it did not and probably the main reason is the fact that half of our visible exports are to the European area, and of course you know about the eurozone crisis. Depending on how optimistic you are about the eurozone, that will influence demand in the future. 
defaultThe reason why I am positive about the rest of the decade is that an enormous amount of effort has gone in through UKTI at official level and also ministerial support for promoting exports into the big emerging markets. The figures we have vary from the spectacular to the good, and enormous effort has gone into 
defaultRussia
default, 
defaultChina
default, 
defaultIndia
default and then the next tier, 
defaultTurkey
default, 
defaultIndonesia
default and so on. I am actively involved in that process. I see a lot happening on the ground, but there is a time lag, because when companies pitch up in 
defaultIndia
default or 
defaultBrazil
default they do not just walk away with a big export order. It normally takes quite a while to line up your agents and local offices and so on, so I think the effort that has been put into the emerging markets will produce its reward, but there will be a time lag.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harrisdefault:default 
defaultSo you think the IMF and the OBR have been unnecessarily pessimistic, not sufficiently gung ho about it.
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultYes, I think so
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harrisdefault:default 
defaultI gather the National Audit Office concluded that each Government Department needed to have a more detailed action plan about how it was 
defaultcontributing to that target. Whose responsibility would it be to split the target into objectives for individual Departments and who would be monitoring Departments’ performance?
defaultVince Cabledefault: I 
defaultknow the Prime Minister takes a personal interest in this through the Economic Committee of the Cabinet. He regularly chairs meetings, oversees the work of UKTI and individual Departments. It is fair to say that Government Ministers spend much more time than they used to as export salesmen for Britain, even in Departments like, say, Health, which traditionally was not associated with exporting, and my colleague David Willetts sees universities as an export industry. That is a new way of looking at it and he is very often in the field trying to promote exports, so the point you make is well understood even without monitoring it.
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: 
defaultThe other reason for optimism that I would add is that, thanks to good work by UKTI, Ministers and business, 
defaultwe have retained 
defaultour position as the first destination for inward investment in 
defaultEurope
default. That inward investment, over time, as we have seen not least in the automotive sector, produces both jobs and, very often, more exports. The more we maintain our position as an attractive base for inward investment, the more we help ourselves, over time, with the export performance. I was in 
defaultFrance
default yesterday talking to MEDEF, the CBI equivalent, about 
defaultBritain
default as an investment destination for them and got very positive feedback.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harrisdefault:default 
defaultWhat are the measurable objectives specific to the BIS Department that are contributing to this overall target, though?
defaultVince Cabledefault: 
defaultTogether with the Foreign Office, we are one of the two sponsoring Departments of UKTI. I have taken a particular interest in what we can do and again it is indirect, because it is a shared responsibility with the UK Export Finance body, which was moribund for many years
default.
default There are complicated arguments about legal challenges, but they did very little to promote British exports, frankly, apart from a few big bulky military contracts. It has now been re
default&#x2011;
defaultengineered. They now have mechanisms to support small business and again we are trying to help in that way.
defaultOne other point I would add in terms of what we are trying to do is you cannot just isolate exports. Import substitution is just as important. If you are trying to improve the trade performance of the country, making things here rather than importing them is just as important as exporting, and we are noting a quite encouraging trend in re
default&#x2011;
defaultshoring in industry and with services—call centres, for example. That is just as good as exporting and in many ways it is easier to realise it. That is one of the big themes of our industrial strategy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baindefault:default defaultSecretary of State, according to the latest figures from the ONS, in the year to November our trade balance weakened and it now stands at £3.2
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion in deficit. We are doing much better in services than in goods. We do have a surplus in services, but our deficit in goods with the EU has worsened to £6.4
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion over that period. What more can your Department and the Government as a whole do in terms of completing the single European market in goods and services? The Commission Work Programme talked about having a second Single European Act. Is that going to make a difference to this trade position that we have?
defaultVince Cable: defaultI certainly believe in doing more in terms of opening up the single market, but of course it is two
default&#x2011;
defaultway trade.
default 
defaultIt does not necessarily mean you benefit in terms of the trade 
defaultbalance, but it is a good thing to do for our economy and certainly one of the British Government’s priorities is to promote the agenda of a single market into areas like digital, which is where it is largely incomplete.
default 
defaultIn terms of energy, there are wider issues around energy security, but we do not have an effective single market in energy.
default It will
default encourage the Commission and member states to complete or certainly make further progress on services
default. T
defaulthere are all kinds of blockages there around mutual recognition of professional qualifications, for example.
default 
defaultHowever, I have no need to remind you that if we are deepening the single market and particularly services, this is about freedom of movement.
default 
defaultAs you will have discovered, that is a fairly toxic issue in the 
defaultUK
default at the moment, but that is inherent in the single market.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultJust before we move on, you quite rightly indicated that our export performance will, in part, be determined by the level of demand in other parts of the country over which we have very little control. However, looking at the NAO figures for export—and again I would concede this is a historical problem as well—we basically do not seem to be overcoming it. We still seem to be underperforming in the context of other rivals, including 
defaultGermany
default, 
defaultFrance
default and 
defaultItaly
default. The NAO concluded: “Departments lack a more detailed action plan on how their work will contribute towards this £1
default&#xa0;
defaulttrillion ambition, for example, by breaking it down into deliverable objectives, what actions they need to take to meet those objectives, and timescales for delivering and quantifying outcomes. The Departments could then be held accountable for their performance”. Would you comment on that?
defaultVince Cabledefault: All my experience of dealing with the Trade Minister and with UKTI, which would be the delivery body for making these things happen and, indeed, with our embassies overseas, is that they do operate on fairly tight performance metrics. One of the big changes in recent years has been that some of the staff who are brought in from the private sector are paid on a performance basis, so in many ways the spirit of your question is already recognised.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do they have deliverable targets per country
default&#x2011;
defaultbased UKTI unit?
defaultVince Cabledefault: I think so. Certainly for several of the countries that I go to there are trade targets. I have just come from the 
defaultUnited
default&#xa0;
defaultArab
default&#xa0;
defaultEmirates
default and the target is £15
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion, I think, by 
default2015. In
default 
defaultIndia
default, there is an explicit target and certainly the same is true of 
defaultChina
default. I do not know if it is a case of everywhere. Usually these are jointly agreed with the country in question, because otherwise they are a bit meaningless. If you are asking for a frank opinion, personally I do not think these export targets help enormously, but they are symbolically useful in declaring an ambition and I think they are fairly common practice, if not universal. Is that correct?
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I do think the NAO said “deliverable”. I think everybody accepts that if you just pluck out aspirational targets, they may not be meaningful.
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: As the Secretary of State said, UKTI have become much more focused on the metrics of delivery. At the same time, there are some real issues that they are grappling with. Some very large contracts can take several years of work and therefore do not feature in a 12
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth period, whereas dealing with smaller-value issues, perhaps for SMEs, would and we need to make sure that we use metrics that add the maximum value over time. Similarly, 
defaultsome companies who want UKTI support do not particularly want to look at one country, but they may want to look at a range of countries in their own sector and we have to make sure the metrics are flexible enough to do that. What we are also doing is making sure that all of our economists across BIS, the Foreign Office and UKTI itself produce a single analysis of the business opportunities in different countries with a Foreign Office post, so that we are working from the same information base, which then goes through to companies with an interest.
defaultChair:default This should be the last block of questions: ease of doing business, which you touched on a few moments ago.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline Dinenage:default I know that the ease of doing business ranking is something that you put a lot of store by and last year we were ranked 11
defaultth
default by the World
default&#xa0;
defaultBank in this table and, in 2014, have now gone up to 10
defaultth
default. Are you satisfied with this progress? 
defaultVince Cabledefault: We will only be satisfied when it is No. 1, but there is recognition that this is something we need to do. We want to encourage an entrepreneurial culture and the evidence suggests we are getting a lot of start
default&#x2011;
defaultups. Part of doing start
default&#x2011;
defaultups is making it easier for people, first of all, to establish their company with all the registration issues around Companies
default&#xa0;
defaultHouse and tax, and then making it easier for them to take on their first employees, and we are systematically working our way through that. The one tangible area where progress has been made is in the replacement to Business Link, which we have seen has been happening online. The initial experience with gov.uk for business was not brilliant and a lot of work has been done since to improve it, so somebody wanting to set up a business looking for practical help through the online system of advice now has a much better offering.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline Dinenage:default What else are the nine countries that are above us doing better than us, do you think?
defaultVince Cabledefault: I am not sure exactly, but I suspect that 
defaultaccess
default to finance is tricky. It is very often friends and family, as you know. Other countries, 
defaultGermany
default most notably, have a very good local banking system, which we do not have; hopefully, we are getting some signs of progress. That is why we have done the Start Up Loans scheme. I think those are the main areas, but there may be others you want to suggest.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline Dinenage:default So we are making slow but steady progress in that ranking, but in terms of the ease of starting a business we have fallen from 18
defaultth
default in 2013 to 28
defaultth
default in 2014. Why do you think we have fallen 10
default&#xa0;
defaultplaces in the last year? 
defaultVince defaultCable
default: I do not know how they have measured that, because I have just given you on
defaulte
default or two examples of things that are happening to make it easier. Do we have an explanation? 
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: Each of these industries uses rather different and, quite often, inevitably, subjective or impressionistic measures. We are trying to drill down to find out how they are all made up. For example, one of them is how long dispute resolution takes through your courts; another is access to energy in a straightforward way. We are also trying to market effectively what we have delivered, such as the more than £1
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion reduction in the cost of regulation for businesses over the last three years. We are monitoring each of these indices and we are 
defaulttrying to drill down to find out what difference is produced by change, so that we improve our position as well as focusing on the substance of just making life easier for business.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline Dinenage:default So we are confident that next year, when we all meet again, we will be zooming up the league tables in every—
defaultVince Cabledefault: That is certainly our aim, but as the Permanent Secretary said, some of these measures are a bit mysterious. We are not just trying to meet the measures for the sake of it. We want it to be easier to start up companies and we have our own way of judging where we fall behind.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I thought the response from Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultDonnelly was curious in so far as, presumably, the criteria used to evaluate our standing in effect have not changed significantly in a year and whereas there may be a case for drilling down and finding out about deficiencies, that does not explain the drop in comparative performance. 
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: It also, of course, depends on what other countries do and in one of the indices, I believe it is the World Bank one, our performance stayed very strong but one or two other countries improved theirs and there is quite a lot of bunching. Whether you end up 8
defaultth
default, 9
defaultth
default, 10
defaultth
default or 11
defaultth
default can depend rather more on what other people are doing than on what you are doing, but we are very conscious that this is a relative measure and we want to make sure, as a marketing tool, that the 
defaultUK
default continues to improve.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are you looking at what the other countries that have improved are doing that we may be able to adopt? 
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: Yes. What we are trying to do is examine, for each of the key indices, how they are made up, what the people who make them up judge and then how we can change the information they have—and sometimes their information is not always fully up to date or not detailed enough—so that we are giving them the best information that shows where the UK is. In some areas where we do need to improve and, as the Secretary of State said, 
defaultit makes sense 
defaultto do so, we are working across Government to drive those improvements.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Briefly, because I did not want to prolong the discussion earlier, I would ask Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultDonnelly and Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultOrme if they could provide us with subsequent written information quantifying, first, the impact on the Department’s budget of the delay in regulating numbers of private providers; secondly, what impact the change in calculation of the RAB charge has on the Department’s budget; and thirdly, your current calculation of the cost of the expansion of undergraduate numbers and therefore the exposure that the Department’s budget will face if the loan book is not sold.
defaultVince Cabledefault: The first and the third we have talked about and we promise good information. We have not talked about the RAB charge issue. As I am sure you know—you follow this closely—the RAB charge has increased significantly, mainly because of different projections of earnings growth. If, on the back of this recovery, earnings growth were to recover substantially in the next few years, the RAB charge would come back down again. It is a volatile statistic, and of course we have to have a number; that is the methodology that we employ. It does not affect the real world, but as part of our long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm accounting we have to have it. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I very much appreciate that and we had a lengthy discussion with the Universities Minister last week, where he was talking about the modelling the Department is doing based on an anticipation that there might be a longer period of lower than anticipated earnings and therefore just to get some sense of what the impact of that would be.
defaultVince Cabledefault: We are happy to share the modelling with you as best we can. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That would be very helpful. Just before we conclude our questions, could I pick up one issue that you raised yourself? That is the Start Up Loan fund. Can I make it clear that I think this is very important? It fills a gap in the market that is not provided by other, more conventional financial institutions, but it is very much needed and, I believe, is quite successful in terms of the applicants. There has been some press criticism, I believe, of the lack of accountability of the money. Now, bearing in mind, inevitably, such a fund is going to have a higher risk profile than others, could you just say what you are doing to try to blunt any attacks on that fund in terms of accountability for public finance?
defaultVince Cabledefault: I am not sure I can answer concretely. The key issue with the Start Up Loan scheme goes back to the previous question, it is the RAB charge: what default rate you assume. That is what the Public Accounts Committee and indeed your Committee will want to know. These are very early days and there is quite a small default rate, as you would expect; they have not been going very long. After a year, who knows? The Prince’s Trust has a default rate of 40% or something, so if we do better than that we would be doing particularly well in terms of the integrity of the loans. Your question is a perfectly fair one. It is taxpayers’ money and some of it will be lost and we do need to have a proper system of measuring this. I am sure our people do. It is a question of how we then feed it into the accountability mechanisms, isn’t it?
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: Yes. The other aspect that we do try to be aware of and you will be aware of, which is difficult to put a monetary value on, is people who fail in six months or a year may restart more successfully in two or three years. Our figures do not pick that up, but it is a reality and it is very important socially as well as economically. We do need to take a broad view of this while making sure we safeguard the money wherever we can.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Yes, I quite understand that. I am trying to get replies that will find a political rebuff to those critics of it because, like you, I feel it is a very important scheme, but it is one that is vulnerable to attack. When do you think you will be in a position to give us some figures on the effectiveness of it?
defaultVince Cabledefault: On the first year’s work, do we know?
defaultMartin Donnellydefault: I am not sure, simply because to give you meaningful figures we will need to map against previous experience, like the Prince’s Trust. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I accept that there are comparators that you would want to evaluate it against, yes.
defaultHoward Ormedefault: We can give you figures on the start
default&#x2011;
defaultup, but I take the point that this is a high
default&#x2011;
defaultrisk area, so we need to make sure we do protect the reputation there. Given that they are loans, they will need to run their course before we really get to see the performance. We also want to see the impact they are having in business terms.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Yes. Even at this point, though, you should be able to give some idea of the level of interest and take-up, even if you cannot give the level of detail.
defaultVince Cabledefault: Take-up is not a problem.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default I would be grateful for that information. We did have some other areas of questioning, but many of them can be addressed in terms of written questions, so may I thank you for coming before the Committee and staying during Prime Minister’s Questions? I also thank the Committee Members, many of whom would probably have wished to be in Prime Minister’s Questions. Arising from your responses, obviously we may feel it appropriate to ask some follow–up questions and would be grateful for your response on them, but thank you very much, Minister and your staff.
