"&#xa0;\nWri\ntten evidence from Charles Ellis (TWR0004)\n&#xa0;\nDear Mr Stringer,\nI was watching the Select Committee meeting on 7th January 2013 where you were asking questions of Stewart Wingate CEO of Gatwick Airport - I didn't catch it all but at about 15:18, he claimed that \nhe had over 500 of his staff dealing with the customers in the airport. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs a witness on the check in desk side at Gatwick airport North terminal I can verify that he had only 4 of his staff at the check in desk area and 1 of his staff down below at the \narrivals section, none of them had any useful information and could not contact anyone that was able to help. \n&#xa0;\nMy father in law was trapped the other side of security and he told me that there were similar numbers that side. \n&#xa0;\nNot sure where the other 490 o\nf his staff were but they were not dealing with customers / passengers. \n&#xa0;\nI would suggest calling one of those 4 assistants to give evidence they may be more accurate.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
