"VEP 0036\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission by Lord Lester of Herne Hill QC VEP 0036&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nArticle 46\n requires \nContracting Parties to abide by final judgments against them by the Strasbourg Court\n. As the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern has confirmed\n in his evidence to the JCHR\n, it would be a clear violation of the UK’s international legal obligations were the Government and Parliament to refuse to comply with the Hirst judgment.\n See also the JCHR’s reports\n referred to in my written evidence\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is also important to have regard to the UK’s international obligations as party to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n Article 25 of the ICCPR\n protects the right and opportunity of every citizen, subject to reasonable restrictions, to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic election by universal and equal suffrage. Article 2.2 obliges the parties to adopt necessary legislative measures to give effect to the IPPR protected rights.\n \nThe UK ratified the ICCPR in 1976 without making any relevant declaration or reservation in relation to Article 25.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNo.\n . The obligation imposed by Article 46 (1) is an international legal obligation.\n State responsibility for complying \nwith the Convention involves all\n three branches of government, executive, legislative and judicial and the other public authorities of the United Kingdom and its countries and regions\n&#xa0;\nIt is ir\nrelevant that Article 46 was not inco\nrporated. M\nost provisions of the Convention other than the Convention rights and freedoms\n were not incorporated because they are unnecessary to give effect to t\nh\nose rights and freedoms in domestic law.\n&#xa0;\nThe Ministerial\n Code describes Ministers as having an overarching duty to comply with the law including international law and t\nreaty obligations. T\nhe Government confirmed in a Written Answer by Lord \nMcNally on \n27 June 2013 (WA 160) \n that there are o current plans to amend paragraph 1.2\n in light of the HIrst case\n .\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMy\n reference to Greece\n’s withdrawal from the Council of Europe \nunder the junta was\n intended\n to draw attention to the fact that if the UK were to refuse to compl\ny with it\ns \nduty to abide by the Court’s final judgments against the UK, \nwe would \ntoo \nbe compelled \nto withdraw from the Convention system rather than face expulsion.\n It was not of course intended to suggest that our political circumstances are similar to those in Greece under the junta.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK has had an unblemished record of complying with judgments of the Strasbourg Court until now a\nnd of upholding the European rul\ne of law. Other states have dragged their feet in complying with judgments, but I know of no example of a state refusing to comply with Article 46.\n The UK prides itself on being a rule of law country and it is reasonable that successive Governments have been strongly criticised for their failure to comply with Article 46.\n&#xa0;\nThe fact that other states violate Convention rights is irrelevant\n to the obligations of \nthe \n UK as a Contracting Party\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Human Rights Act gives effect to Parliamentary sovereignty by preventing our courts from striki\nng down Acts of Parliament. If \nprimary legislation cannot be read and given effect compatibly with the Convention rights, the courts may grant a declaration of incompatibility leaving its to government and Parliament to decide whether to take remedial action.\n&#xa0;\nThe fact that Parliament \nhas exclusiv\ne responsibility to make the law\n does not affect the State’s responsibility to comply with rulings of the European Court of Human Rights : eg., in the East African Asians case\n (1973) 3 EHRR 76\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever the Strasbourg Court and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in its\n supervisory capacity, recognise\n a wide area of discretionary judgment for the legislature in choosing the means of complying.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Human Rights Act would then have to be amended to remove protection of the Convention\n rights to private property, education and political freedom. It would be an odd decision for a Conservative government to take since it was a Conservative Government th\nat ratified the First Protocol.\n And it would undermine the basic c\nivil rights and libertie\ns of our fellow citizens\n&#xa0;\nUnlike Switzerland and every other State party to the Convention, \nthe UK does not have a written constitution protecting fundamental human rights.\n It was only in 1990, \nafter Switze\nr\nla\nnd had ratified the Convention,\n \nthat\n Swiss \nwomen were given the right to vote in every canton. The Convention was the crucial lever\n for women’s enfranchisement.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nI do not agree. \nThere were no such intention\n and it was \nand is \nobvious that the right to vote was inherent in Article 3.\n&#xa0;\nThe Churchill\n Government signed and \nratifi\ned Protocol No. 1 in \n1952\n on behalf of the UK \nwithout making any reservation or declaration in relation to Article 3.\n \n&#xa0;\nIt was unnecessary \nfor\n the drafters of Article 3 \nto make explicit reference to the right to vote since it is inherent in the very concept of a modern democratic society in which the people choose their legislature in a secret ballot\n \n.\nI do not understand how free elections could be held under conditions ensuring the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature without the right to vote.\n&#xa0;\nThe Strasbourg Court’s\n interpretation of Article 3 was first explained 25 years ago in Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v Belgium (1987) 10 EHRR 1, paragraphs 46-54, and was not controversial or objected to by our government. \n The British judge on the Court, Sir Vincent Evans, was former Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office. The Court agreed with the approach of \nthe Euro\npean Commission of Human Rights which \nobserved in that case, “Universal suffrage, the central element of any \ngenuinely democratic political system, must seek to ensure ‘the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.’”\n&#xa0;\n Suppose \nhypothetically \nthat only men or only white people were e\nntitled to vote in P\n elections\n \nto the legislature, \nor that Jews were excluded\n. It is \nobvious that this would engage Article 3\n \nof the First Protocol.\n For example in Aziz v Cyprus (2008) 46 EHRRv39, the Court found a violation of article 3 where members of the Turkish-Cypriot community living in the government-controlled area of Cyprus were refused permission to be included on the electoral r\noll; or Sejdic and Finci v Bosnia and Herzeg\novina (Grand Chamber 2009) \nwhere Roma and Jews were excluded under the Constitution from being elected to the legislature\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties contains general principles for the interpretation of treaties.\n \n&#xa0;\nArticle 31.1 provides that \n“A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”\n \nUnder the heading “Supplementary means of interpretation, Article 32 provides that \n&#xa0;\n“Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its\n conclusi\non, in order to \nconfirm the meaning\n resulting from the application of Article 31, or to determine the meaning when the application of Article 31: \n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nleaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nleads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”\n&#xa0;\nPreparatory work does not have the same authentic character as Article 31 “ Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law (7\nth\n ed., 2005), 632.\n&#xa0;\nThat is the approach of our own courts in deciding whether to have recourse to parliamentary debates or other extrinsic material to interpret\n primary legislation\n \n: Pepper v Hart\n[1992] UKHL 3\n . It is supplemental and exceptional\n. \n&#xa0;\nOur courts also use an updating approach to statutory interpretation, rather than being tied to an inflexible approach that is tied to the original intention of the legislature.\n: Bennion on Statutory Interp\nr\netation (5\nth\n ed., \n 2008), section 288,  889-914: Presumption that updating construction to be given.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe preparatory work \nreferred to by Anthony Speaight QC and\n Dominic Raab MP is not relevan\nt\n to the intention\n of the drafters of Article 3. \nMr Raab refers \nto objections made by the Attlee Government to include in the Convention what became Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 \n.\n \nIt was when the Churchill government came to power that Protocol. No. 1 was agreed, and there is nothing in the preparatory work on Protocol No. 1 to indicate any intention to exclude the right to vote in elections for the choice of legislature. Th\ne\n main UK concern was to protect\n the unelected nature of the House of Lords\n from being held to be contrary to Article 3\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt would be within the wide area of discretionary judgment allowed to government and Parliament\n. Cyprus, Ireland and Hong Kong have n\not found it necessary so to impose such rstrictions\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe test to be satisfied will remain the test of proportionality. The Court will continue to recognise a wide margin of appreciation in this area, especially if Parliament has carefully considered\n the options and come to a well-\ninformed conclusion\n that is not manifestly unreasonable\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nEuropean institution charged with supervising the execution of Hirst is the Committee of Ministers of the Council\n of Europe\n. The Committee will certainly have regard to the evidence given to your Committee and to the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and the debates on actual legislation in both Houses.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nSo will the Court in deciding pending and future claims.\n \n In its admissibility decision of 26 June 2013 in McLean and Cole v United Kingdom, the Court stated (paragraph 35) that “There is no doubt that for as long as the legislation remains unchanged, those who remain in post-conviction detention will continue potentially to be victims of a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. However, the effect of the voting prohibition will only be felt if a further election to a ‘legislature’ occurs before amending legislation has been enacted.”\n&#xa0;\nThe Court also noted\n \nthat (paragraph 36) “a draft bill has been \npublished and a joint committee has been charged with carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny of the bill. The committee will report by 31 October 2013\n \n …. Further, the Committee of Ministers is actively supervising the steps taken by the United Kingdom authorities to implement the Court’s rulings in Hirst and Greens and M.T. It will next assess the position in September 203.”\n&#xa0;\nThe Court \ncontinued (paragraph 37) “In light of these developments and given that the Court has already delivered two rulings finding the respondent State to be in violation of Article 3 …, there is nothing to be gained from examining applications concerning future elections \nat this time. If amending legis\nlation is not brought into force prior to any futures elections to the ‘legislature’, it will be open to applicants to lodge, within six months of the date of the election, a new application to the Court.” \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClaims for compensation would be brought with strong prospects of success. If the UK were in persistent violation of Article 46, t\nhe UK would have to withdraw from the Council of Europe \n(to avoid expulsion) \nand would be in breach of its EU obligations. \nSee Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYes\n, because it would indicate \nthe\n \nUK\n Executive and Parliament were \nunwilling to\n \nrespect the rule o\nf international and European\n law.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is likely \nthat damages would be awarded \nand the UK would be obliged to pay \ncompensation \nby way of just satisfaction\n: s\nee McLean and Cole v United Kingdom.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt would mean that the Court of Justice as well as the European Court of Human Rights and UK courts would \nbe likely to \nfind further breaches by the UK\n and to award compensation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf disenfranchisement is intended to be p\nunitive the\nn the punishment must fit the crime in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The use of length of sentence is one way of seeking to do this; another way is to leave it to the judge’s discretion in the circumstances of the particular case as part of sentencing..\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThat would be complex and expensive\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt would be cumbersome and add \nunnecessary burdens\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013 \n&#xa0;\n"
