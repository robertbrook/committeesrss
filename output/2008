defaultMy husband and 
defaultmyself
default are private individuals unassociated with any organization. 
defaultAs keen walkers and admirers of the British countryside and its magnificent national parks, we wish to write to the committee to request their consideration of the following:
defaultin all national parks and areas of natural beauty .
defaultAs things are, it is really upsetting to meet rowdy and sometimes dangerous cars and bikes along the paths mostly used by walkers and cyclists.  
defaultThey are destructive of the paths and noisily out of place in these peaceful and beautiful areas.  
defaultTax-payers money is constantly being spent repairing green lanes damaged by off-roaders.  
defaultRed tape is involved when agencies have to be pressured into doing these repairs and when rights of way claims have to be processed.
defaultThe government is trying to save money,  and deregulate, is it not?  
defaultThese requests would seem to be in keeping with those aims and contribute to the betterment of the environment for ourselves and our descendants.
defaultThank you for this opportunity to express 
defaultour views.
