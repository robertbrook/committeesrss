[normal]My husband and 
[normal]myself
[normal] are private individuals unassociated with any organization. 
[normal]As keen walkers and admirers of the British countryside and its magnificent national parks, we wish to write to the committee to request their consideration of the following:
[normal]in all national parks and areas of natural beauty .
[normal]As things are, it is really upsetting to meet rowdy and sometimes dangerous cars and bikes along the paths mostly used by walkers and cyclists.  
[normal]They are destructive of the paths and noisily out of place in these peaceful and beautiful areas.  
[normal]Tax-payers money is constantly being spent repairing green lanes damaged by off-roaders.  
[normal]Red tape is involved when agencies have to be pressured into doing these repairs and when rights of way claims have to be processed.
[normal]The government is trying to save money,  and deregulate, is it not?  
[normal]These requests would seem to be in keeping with those aims and contribute to the betterment of the environment for ourselves and our descendants.
[normal]Thank you for this opportunity to express 
[normal]our views.
