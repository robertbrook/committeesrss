[[[the Welsh Liberal Democrats (DWB 13)]]]

[[[Executive summary]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]1.1&#xa0; The Welsh Liberal Democrats are the state party of the Liberal Democrats in Wales. 1.2&#xa0; We are very glad that the Government in Westminster established the independent Commission on Devolution in Wales (the ‘Silk’ Commission) to review the present financial and constitutional arrangements in Wales. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are represented on the Commission by Rob Humphries, Director of the Open University in Wales. 1.3&#xa0; We welcome the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister’s announcement on November 1st 2013 in Cardiff that the UK Government accepts the majority of the Silk Commission’s recommendations. The draft Wales Bill will place into law the majority of the Silk Commission’s recommendations for fiscal powers. We have regularly supported reforms to increase the responsibility that Welsh ministers have over the money they spend, but also to ensure that they have the right legal and financial powers to deliver a wide range of solutions to the challenges Wales faces, particularly in order to stimulate the Welsh economy.1.4&#xa0; Liberal Democrats, in Wales and across the UK, believe that power and authority derive and flow upwards from the people and that power must be exercised at the most appropriate local level. We have long supported a federal system as part of our vision for the UK’s constitutional future. The Silk Commission and draft Wales Bill present a unique opportunity to strengthen this framework as far as Wales in concerned.1.5&#xa0; We are submitting this evidence for your consideration in order to voice our views on the draft Wales Bill. While generally supportive, we are keen to see swift progress on this legislation. We would recommend that if scrutiny of the draft Wales Bill goes well then the actual Bill should be commenced in this session of Parliament.

[[[Devolution of taxation and borrowing powers]]]

[[[Partial devolution of income tax, and full devolution of stamp duty land tax, landfill tax, business rates and other smaller taxes to the National Assembly for Wales and Welsh Government.]]]2.1&#xa0; The Welsh Liberal Democrats welcomed the Silk Commission’s recommendation that income tax should be devolved to the Assembly, subject to a referendum, and that 10p should be deducted from each of the main UK rates in Wales, with the Welsh Government able to set to vary the basic, higher and additional rates of tax independently.2.2&#xa0; We were pleased to see the UK Government’s offer of devolving income tax on the same basis as that legislated for in the Scotland Act 2012. While not our preferred method of devolving income tax, we welcome this as a major step forward in the devolution settlement for Wales. 2.3&#xa0; Sharing the income tax base between Westminster and Cardiff Bay would significantly enhance the accountability of the National Assembly and the Welsh Government, as income tax contributes the greatest proportion of tax revenue in Wales and would provide a relatively stable revenue stream. 2.4&#xa0; We welcome the Government’s agreement with the Silk Commission that SDLT, landfill tax, business rates and other smaller taxes would be devolved to the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government. We also welcome the UK Government’s announcement that the Assembly should be given the power to introduce specified taxes, subject to agreement of the UK Government.2.5&#xa0; The devolution of SDLT could enable the National Assembly to address the acute housing crisis in Wales, by helping to lower the cost of developing and buying houses in Wales. The property market in Wales has distinct characteristics from elsewhere in the UK and devolution of SDLT would help Welsh Government policy better reflect this. The Welsh Government response to the UK Government consultation on devolving SDLT claims that ‘a devolved and reformed tax’ could ‘have the potential to promote jobs and economic growth in a way that would benefit both Wales and the wider UK’. Devolution of landfill tax will provide an excellent lever in a policy area largely devolved to the National Assembly. Greater control over business rates beyond the multiplier would allow the Welsh government to deliver a more coherent reform of business rates and encourage business investment. These taxes will greatly help to stimulate the Welsh economy, and we welcome their devolution.2.6&#xa0; The UK Government has said it will keep the devolution of aggregates levy under review, with the intention of devolving in the future subject to the resolution of on-going state aid issues and negotiations at an EU level.2.7&#xa0; Given that waste management and recycling are largely devolved to the National Assembly, and landfill tax is to be devolved as well, we would support the devolution of aggregates levy to the National Assembly if on-going state aid issues can be resolved. 2.8&#xa0; We would encourage the Welsh Affairs Committee to work with the UK Government to ensure that investigations into resolving this area progress.3.1&#xa0; The Welsh Liberal Democrats believe that the people of Wales should be able to decide whether the Welsh Government and National Assembly should have responsibility for an element of income tax. We believe that the National Assembly for Wales is the right body to be able to trigger a referendum on the devolution of income tax and is provided for in the draft Wales Bill.3.2&#xa0; The Welsh Liberal Democrats support and hope for progress to be made in this area soon. We will be campaigning firstly for a referendum to be held and then for a positive outcome in that referendum.3.3&#xa0; We would hope that the UK Government and the Welsh Government will work together to ensure that triggering and holding the referendum is a smooth process and progresses as soon as is feasible following the passage of the Wales Bill.3.4&#xa0; We would recommend that the Welsh Affairs Committee work with the UK Government to ensure the smooth passage of the Wales Bill.4.1&#xa0; The Silk Commission said that to be fully accountable for its spending decisions The Welsh Government should be able to influence the total of its capital spending in any one year as well. The Silk Commission recommended the Welsh Government has the capacity to borrow for capital investment on a prudent basis subject to limits agreed with HM Treasury. In addition, the Welsh Government should be given similar powers to the Scottish Government over borrowing for current spending to manage the volatility of tax receipts under the new funding system.4.2&#xa0; In our submission to the Silk Commission, we asked for borrowing powers equivalent to those proposed for the Scottish Parliament – capital borrowing limit of 10% of the total capital budget each year, with a cap at around 10 times this. We also asked for a very small amount of revenue borrowing. 4.3&#xa0; The UK Government has accepted in principle the case for devolving borrowing powers, but the precise levels of capital borrowing will depend on the outcome of the income tax referendum. The UK Government will provide the Welsh Government with early access to limited capital borrowing powers in advance of the implementation of tax powers in order to begin projects such as the M4 development in South Wales. 4.4&#xa0; The Welsh Liberal Democrats welcome these borrowing powers as a way to provide the Welsh Government with more scope to stimulate the economy with investment in significant capital expenditure projects.6.1&#xa0; We supported extending the length of the current (fourth) Assembly to avoid an election clash in 2015. Now that the Westminster elections will be every five years, we support extending Assembly terms to five years in order to avoid future clashes.6.2&#xa0; This will help ensure that Assembly issues receive the hearing they deserve during election campaigns. Some confusion exists over which powers are held by Westminster and which are held by the National Assembly. Research by the Wales Governance Centre suggests people’s perception of how far devolution has gone depends on how far they would like devolution to go. These findings may reflect the lack of clarity in the Welsh devolution settlement. Maintaining a separation between the two cycles of electoral campaigns would help ensure that clarity between the responsibilities of the two institutions and their impact on Wales is improved. 6.3&#xa0; Whilst not the most common, five year terms are found across the world for other national legislatures. We support a five-year fixed term, to complement the introduction of five-year fixed-term parliaments by the UK government. 7.1&#xa0; We support the removal of the ban on dual candidacy. 7.2&#xa0; The ban was introduced in 2006 as the then UK Government felt losing constituency candidates becoming regional Assembly Members “devalues the integrity of the electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive to vote in constituency elections.”  7.3&#xa0; In reality it has reduced voter choice and undermined the credibility of the electoral system by punishing parties for success. The argument that turnout would diminish as voters would be unprepared to vote in elections where some losing constituency candidates were likely to be elected as regional candidates has been proven to be unfounded and it is accepted in Scotland and the London Assembly. 8.1&#xa0; No-one should be able to serve as an AM and an MP concurrently. This prohibition currently exists for the European Parliament. Being an AM, MP or MEP should be a full-time job and should not be undertaken alongside a comparable full-time role.8.2&#xa0; Consequently, we support the introduction of ban on dual mandates.&#xa0;9.1&#xa0; The Welsh Liberal Democrats welcome the majority of the UK Government’s announcements on recommendations of the Silk Commission Part I. They present a historic opportunity for Wales and Welsh democracy.9.2&#xa0; While generally supportive of the draft Wales Bill, we are keen to see swift progress on this legislation. We would recommend that if scrutiny of the draft Wales Bill goes well then the actual Bill should be commenced in this session of Parliament.9.3&#xa0; We would recommend that the Welsh Affairs Committee work with the UK Government to ensure the smooth passage of the Wales Bill.9.4&#xa0; We would recommend that the Welsh Affairs Committee work with the UK Government to ensure the smooth passage of the referendum on income tax powers.9.5&#xa0; We would encourage the Welsh Affairs Committee to work with the UK Government to ensure that investigations into resolving state aid issues around the aggregates levy area progress.16 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.clickonwales.org/2013/11/polls-suggest-were-a-land-of-wishful-thinking/  UK Government White Paper on Better Governance for Wales (2005), pp.28-9
