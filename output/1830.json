"              \nWritten submission from the Nationwide Association of Fostering Providers, Independent Children’s Home Association and the National Association of Independent Schools and Non-Maintained Special Schools (LGP 28)Background to Submission &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProcurement Survey Details (Results Published May 2012)&#xa0;&#xa0;\nHowever, we would suggest more needs to be done to create real and lasting change on the ground for providers if they are to operate in an environment which does not create unnecessary red-tape.\nHow can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives?  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;How can the current framework for Local Government Procurement be improved?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;About us&#xa0;&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
