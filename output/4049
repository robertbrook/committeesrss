defaultrity of respondents (

default said few

default ha
defaultd a basic understanding
default. A further

default per c
defaultent
default)
default said hardly any were aware, with a further 
default36.2
default 
defaultper cent
default saying that few we

defaultThis suggests that around five in every six electricians defaultexperience defaultpoor levels of defaultBuilding Regulationdefault defaultawarenessdefault among consumersdefault.default&#xa0;default1.3default 
defaultWhen asked whether 
defaultthe two 
defaultconsumer facing 
defaultregisters
default should come together and f
defaultorm one that would
default promote
default all full scope registered electrical installers working in England and Wales, 72.2 per cent of respondents though
defaultt
default they should, 16.7 per cent weren’t 
defaultsure and only 11.1 per cent thought they shouldn’t. 
defaultThe creation of one single 
defaultlist
default would help to create an easier message to promote the use of Competent Registered Electricians to consumers via. The promotion of this single quality mark and 
defaultlist
default by all e
defaultlectrical Competent Person Scheme Providers would also help focus the message and therefore the promotion.
default&#xa0;
default1.4default 
defaultThe 
defaultsingle 
defaultquality mark
default would go
default 
defaultsome
default way to raising the profile of com
defaultpetent, registered electricians 
defaultand electrical safety in the home, but 
defaultawareness is not just about a memorable mark, easy to use search facility
default,
default and a simple message.

defaulteport, compiled by EC Harris, noted
default:
default 
default“The building control enforcement landscape is one of extremes. On the one hand there is an e
defaultxtremely, perhaps unduly, low level of formal enforcement applied. Against this there is a massive (5million p.a.) portfolio of informal compliance
default interventions being conducted.
default It has also been shaped by the particular unwieldiness of building control la

defaultextensive 
defaultanecdotal evidence from 
defaultNAPIT 
defaultmembers
default,
default means unregistered 
defaultinstallers and 
defaultcowboys who chose not to comply with the regulations or notify work are able to undercut those 
defaultcompetent 
defaultregistered
default electricians. 
default&#xa0;
default1.7default 
defaultAnecdotal evidence also exists 
defaultto suggest that work carried out by r
defaultegistered 
defaulti

defaultdoes not always comply with Building
default Regulations and is not always notified as it should be.

defaultT
defaulthere are many electrical installations carried out each year by inadequately trained individuals such as unregistered electricians and rogue trad
defaulters. 
defaultWhen asked about the nature of the electrical work they do, 60.4 per cent of survey respondents said remedial work to electrical installations accounted for, on average, between 26 and 75 per cent of their work load.default This type of work accounted for le
defaultss than 26 per cent of the workload of 
default30.7
default per cent of respondents but a worrying 
default7.6
default per cent said this accounted for more than 76
default percent of their workload.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.2default 
defaultWhen asked about the nature of this remedial work
default, 88.9
default per cent of respondents indicated that they had been called out to fix the work of a non-registered electrician, 
default45.8
default per cent said dealing with the work of non-registered electricians 
defaultaccounted for between 26 and 75 per cent of their work and 7.8 per ce
defaultnt estimated that the figure was higher
default.default defaultThe extent of non-compliant work which had been carried out by registered members of Electrical Competent Person Schemes did not form part of the survey.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.default3default 
defaultThe Committee may be aware of the provision of new Condi
defaulttions of Authorisation set by DGLG in 2012.
default 
default One of the most significant requirements set out in this new document is that all CPS providers gain 
defaultmust 
defaultUKAS accreditation before June 2014. The industry standard the CPS providers work to in order to satisfy
default UKAS accreditation criteria is the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification (EAS). This specification was written by the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) in collaboration with a number of industry stakeholders including NAPIT Trade Associati
defaulton and UKAS.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.default4default 
default59
default per cent of respondents to the survey 
defaultbelieve the EAS standards are satisfactory in showing the electrical installers are of a standard to complete work which complies with wiring regulations and building regulations
default. Only 
default5.3
default per cent said EAS standards were too low, while 
default6.2
default per cent said they were too high. A further 
default29.3
default per cent weren’t sure. 
defaultThis defaultshowsdefault that the defaultvast defaultmajority of respondentsdefault who were able to comment on this question believe defaultEAS will ensure the defaultprovisiondefault ofdefault adequate training moving forward.default default&#xa0;default2.default5default 
defaultHowever, the EAS 
defaultonly refers to ‘enterprises’ and does not ensure
default all operatives 
defaultworking on electrics within a company 
defaultare brought up to the same
default skill 
defaultlevel.
default NAPIT TA members have often expressed concerns that the c
defaulturrent emphasis in this document on registered enterprises/ qualified supervisors
default (QS)
default 
defaultmean
defaults
default only one 
defaultelectrical installer 
defaultin each registered enterprise need 
defaultto 
defaultdemonstrate their competence 
defaultvia the EAS standards and through
default regular assessments
default.
default 
default  
default2.default6default 
defaultMany
default survey respondents
default profoundly disagree with this approach. 
defaultWhen questioned on the qualified supervisor model, 64.4 per cent of respondents 
defaultsaid 
defaultthat it was 
defaultunacceptable and dangerous as the QS may not always be present at all stages of installation pr
defaultocess
default and
default may not see a potential fault.
default Only 25.1 per cent were of the opposite view, that
default it was
default 
defaultacceptable and safe as the QS has responsibility for all electrical work done b
defaulty non-assessed electricians. A further
default 10.4 per cent weren’t sure. 
defaultThis sugges
defaultts
default the majority of 
defaultrespondents
default would
default 
defaultsupport steps towards an individual competency model
default that
default would increase the e
defaultxtent to which all operatives are brought up to the same skill level
default.

defaultI
defaultndustry estimates suggest that there are currently 
default58,000 
defaultpracticing 
defaultelectrical installers 
defaultin England and Wales
default, of which only 40,000 are currently registered.
default 
defaultThis means there may be around 18,000 
defaultelectrical installers
default whose competency, and therefore ongoing ability to comply with the Building Regulations, is not reviewed. On top of this, it is estimated that a staggering 0.95 million jobs a year are carried out by DIYers
default, of which five per cent
default are currently notifiable
default.
default A
default 2011
default 
defaultsurvey of 3,763 
defaultelectrical installers
default 
defaultregistered with ECA, Elecsa, NAPIT and the NICEIC
default 
defaultprovided a useful insight into this. Respondents to that survey estimated that
default 
default25.19 per cent of non-registered installers’ work
default,
default and 63.43 per cent of DIY en
defaultthusiasts’
default,
default was “usually poor”.
default This suggests that there are 
defaultlots
default of people 
defaultcarrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply

default who may not have

defaultIn total, 85.3 per cent of 
defaultsurvey 
defaultrespondents th

default all installe
defaultrs carrying out 
defaultwork under the Building R
defaultegulations should be registered as Competent Persons, while 81.1 per cent
default would

defaultIn total, 86.4
default per cent of respondents, say they 
defaulthave had their work reviewed 
defaultby their Competent Person Scheme Provider NAPIT Registration, 
defaultto a standard that ensures it continues to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.
default 
defaultA further 7.1 per cent were unsure w
defaulthile 6.4 per cent said they did not.

defaultT
defaulthe specification mentioned above, EAS, will further regulate the training and assessment criteria 
defaultto be met by 
defaultcompetent registered
default

default.
default 
defaultIn total, 
default65.5 per cent of respondents said they thought th
defaultese standards were either satisfactory or too high (with only 5.6 per cent saying they were too low)
default.

defaultThe survey asked: Which of the statements about the competition between CPS

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.2default 
defaultResponses indicate that all of these factors 
defaultplay a part
default in the current 
defaultelectrical Competent Person Scheme arena
default. A total of 20.4 per cent thought competition was bad because it drove standards down and 28.2 per cent thought it was bad because it limited c
defaultonsumer awareness. However, this is set against the 38.2 per cent of respondents who thought that competition was good because without it prices would be higher and the 59.6 per cent that thought competition was good because it 
defaultoffered
default them choice.
default&#xa0;
default5.3default 
defaultBy
default recoding
default this data into positive and negative statements, we can see that while 48.6 per cent of respondents thought competition was bad, more than twice as many (97.8) saw competition as a good thing for them.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.4default 
defaultThe two negative aspects of competiti
defaulton that we have identified here are currently being addressed 
defaultin line with
default DCLG
default’s 2012

default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.5default 
defaultIt is hoped that the new EAS 2012 standards,
default to be
default introduced in June 2014, will help to address the current issues in the industry
default aro
defaultund the dilution of standards
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.6default 
defaultT
defaulthe concern that competition creates a confused market for consumers
default has also been addressed. 
defaultOne of 
defaultDCLG
default’s 
defaultConditions of Authorisation is
default to
