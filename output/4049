[normal]Summary:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Extent of[bold] Competent Person Scheme and Building Regulations[bold] Awareness[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1[bold] 
[normal]When asked about 
[normal]levels of consumer awareness
[normal] 
[normal]of the Competent Person
[normal] Scheme
[normal], the majo
[normal]rity of respondents (
[normal]39.3
[normal] per cent
[normal])
[normal] said few
[normal] of their customers
[normal] ha
[normal]d a basic understanding
[normal]. A further 
[normal]35.
[normal]6
[normal] per cent said hardly any
[normal] of their customers
[normal] were aware 
[normal]of the initiative. 
[normal]This indicates that more than three quarters of electrician[bold]s [bold]experience low [bold]levels of co[bold]nsumer awareness [bold]of the Competent Person Scheme[bold].[bold]  
[normal] 
[normal]1.2[bold] 
[normal]In r
[normal]esponse
[normal] to
[normal] whether
[normal] consumer
[normal]s were aware
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] their
[normal] responsibility to ensure electrical work in their home complies with the Building Regulations, almost half (
[normal]48.
[normal]2
[normal] per c
[normal]ent
[normal])
[normal] said hardly any were aware, with a further 
[normal]36.2
[normal] 
[normal]per cent
[normal] saying that few we
[normal]re aware of their responsibilities. 
[normal]This suggests that around five in every six electricians [bold]experience [bold]poor levels of [bold]Building Regulation[bold] [bold]awareness[bold] among consumers[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.3[bold] 
[normal]When asked whether 
[normal]the two 
[normal]consumer facing 
[normal]registers
[normal] should come together and f
[normal]orm one that would
[normal] promote
[normal] all full scope registered electrical installers working in England and Wales, 72.2 per cent of respondents though
[normal]t
[normal] they should, 16.7 per cent weren’t 
[normal]sure and only 11.1 per cent thought they shouldn’t. 
[normal]The creation of one single 
[normal]list
[normal] would help to create an easier message to promote the use of Competent Registered Electricians to consumers via. The promotion of this single quality mark and 
[normal]list
[normal] by all e
[normal]lectrical Competent Person Scheme Providers would also help focus the message and therefore the promotion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4[bold] 
[normal]The 
[normal]single 
[normal]quality mark
[normal] would go
[normal] 
[normal]some
[normal] way to raising the profile of com
[normal]petent, registered electricians 
[normal]and electrical safety in the home, but 
[normal]awareness is not just about a memorable mark, easy to use search facility
[normal],
[normal] and a simple message. 
[normal]T
[normal]ightening up
[normal] the
[normal] Building Regulation enforcement 
[normal]framework 
[normal]and introducing measures that may reduce the ability of 
[normal]unsafe
[normal],
[normal] electrical
[normal] 
[normal]installers
[normal] 
[normal]to undercut c
[normal]ompetent, regist
[normal]ered operatives are also steps
[normal] that would need to 
[normal]be taken to
[normal] decisively 
[normal]address
[normal] the problem of low consumer awareness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lack of Enforcement[bold]1.5[bold] 
[normal]The limitations of current 
[normal]B
[normal]uilding 
[normal]C
[normal]ontrol enforcement 
[normal]of Building Regulation compliance 
[normal]were h
[normal]ighlighted in a DCLG report commissioned during the consultatio
[normal]n process for changes to Part P which took place in 2012. The r
[normal]eport, compiled by EC Harris, noted
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]“The building control enforcement landscape is one of extremes. On the one hand there is an e
[normal]xtremely, perhaps unduly, low level of formal enforcement applied. Against this there is a massive (5million p.a.) portfolio of informal compliance
[normal] interventions being conducted.
[normal] It has also been shaped by the particular unwieldiness of building control la
[normal]w and the constraints of it
[normal]s formal enforcement procedures
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6[bold] 
[normal]The lack of adequate enforcement of the Building 
[normal]Regulations 
[normal]alluded
[normal] to
[normal] here
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]supported by 
[normal]extensive 
[normal]anecdotal evidence from 
[normal]NAPIT 
[normal]members
[normal],
[normal] means unregistered 
[normal]installers and 
[normal]cowboys who chose not to comply with the regulations or notify work are able to undercut those 
[normal]competent 
[normal]registered
[normal] electricians. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7[bold] 
[normal]Anecdotal evidence also exists 
[normal]to suggest that work carried out by r
[normal]egistered 
[normal]i
[normal]nstallers 
[normal]does not always comply with Building
[normal] Regulations and is not always notified as it should be.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Adequacy of T[bold]raining [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Non-registered Individuals[bold]2.1[bold] 
[normal]T
[normal]here are many electrical installations carried out each year by inadequately trained individuals such as unregistered electricians and rogue trad
[normal]ers. 
[normal]When asked about the nature of the electrical work they do, 60.4 per cent of survey respondents said remedial work to electrical installations accounted for, on average, between 26 and 75 per cent of their work load.[bold] This type of work accounted for le
[normal]ss than 26 per cent of the workload of 
[normal]30.7
[normal] per cent of respondents but a worrying 
[normal]7.6
[normal] per cent said this accounted for more than 76
[normal] percent of their workload.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold] 
[normal]When asked about the nature of this remedial work
[normal], 88.9
[normal] per cent of respondents indicated that they had been called out to fix the work of a non-registered electrician, 
[normal]45.8
[normal] per cent said dealing with the work of non-registered electricians 
[normal]accounted for between 26 and 75 per cent of their work and 7.8 per ce
[normal]nt estimated that the figure was higher
[normal].[bold] [bold]The extent of non-compliant work which had been carried out by registered members of Electrical Competent Person Schemes did not form part of the survey.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]3[bold] 
[normal]The Committee may be aware of the provision of new Condi
[normal]tions of Authorisation set by DGLG in 2012.
[normal] 
[normal] One of the most significant requirements set out in this new document is that all CPS providers gain 
[normal]must 
[normal]UKAS accreditation before June 2014. The industry standard the CPS providers work to in order to satisfy
[normal] UKAS accreditation criteria is the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification (EAS). This specification was written by the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) in collaboration with a number of industry stakeholders including NAPIT Trade Associati
[normal]on and UKAS.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]4[bold] 
[normal]59
[normal] per cent of respondents to the survey 
[normal]believe the EAS standards are satisfactory in showing the electrical installers are of a standard to complete work which complies with wiring regulations and building regulations
[normal]. Only 
[normal]5.3
[normal] per cent said EAS standards were too low, while 
[normal]6.2
[normal] per cent said they were too high. A further 
[normal]29.3
[normal] per cent weren’t sure. 
[normal]This [bold]shows[bold] that the [bold]vast [bold]majority of respondents[bold] who were able to comment on this question believe [bold]EAS will ensure the [bold]provision[bold] of[bold] adequate training moving forward.[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.[bold]5[bold] 
[normal]However, the EAS 
[normal]only refers to ‘enterprises’ and does not ensure
[normal] all operatives 
[normal]working on electrics within a company 
[normal]are brought up to the same
[normal] skill 
[normal]level.
[normal] NAPIT TA members have often expressed concerns that the c
[normal]urrent emphasis in this document on registered enterprises/ qualified supervisors
[normal] (QS)
[normal] 
[normal]mean
[normal]s
[normal] only one 
[normal]electrical installer 
[normal]in each registered enterprise need 
[normal]to 
[normal]demonstrate their competence 
[normal]via the EAS standards and through
[normal] regular assessments
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]2.[bold]6[bold] 
[normal]Many
[normal] survey respondents
[normal] profoundly disagree with this approach. 
[normal]When questioned on the qualified supervisor model, 64.4 per cent of respondents 
[normal]said 
[normal]that it was 
[normal]unacceptable and dangerous as the QS may not always be present at all stages of installation pr
[normal]ocess
[normal] and
[normal] may not see a potential fault.
[normal] Only 25.1 per cent were of the opposite view, that
[normal] it was
[normal] 
[normal]acceptable and safe as the QS has responsibility for all electrical work done b
[normal]y non-assessed electricians. A further
[normal] 10.4 per cent weren’t sure. 
[normal]This sugges
[normal]ts
[normal] the majority of 
[normal]respondents
[normal] would
[normal] 
[normal]support steps towards an individual competency model
[normal] that
[normal] would increase the e
[normal]xtent to which all operatives are brought up to the same skill level
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Extent[bold] [bold]and Adequacy [bold]of the R[bold]eview of [bold]Electrical Work and those carryin[bold]g it out[bold]3.1[bold] 
[normal]I
[normal]ndustry estimates suggest that there are currently 
[normal]58,000 
[normal]practicing 
[normal]electrical installers 
[normal]in England and Wales
[normal], of which only 40,000 are currently registered.
[normal] 
[normal]This means there may be around 18,000 
[normal]electrical installers
[normal] whose competency, and therefore ongoing ability to comply with the Building Regulations, is not reviewed. On top of this, it is estimated that a staggering 0.95 million jobs a year are carried out by DIYers
[normal], of which five per cent
[normal] are currently notifiable
[normal].
[normal] A
[normal] 2011
[normal] 
[normal]survey of 3,763 
[normal]electrical installers
[normal] 
[normal]registered with ECA, Elecsa, NAPIT and the NICEIC
[normal] 
[normal]provided a useful insight into this. Respondents to that survey estimated that
[normal] 
[normal]25.19 per cent of non-registered installers’ work
[normal],
[normal] and 63.43 per cent of DIY en
[normal]thusiasts’
[normal],
[normal] was “usually poor”.
[normal] This suggests that there are 
[normal]lots
[normal] of people 
[normal]carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply
[normal],
[normal] who may not have
[normal] had
[normal] their work reviewed at all
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] 
[normal]I
[normal]ntroducing a more effective framework to 
[normal]encourage
[normal] more
[normal] electricians 
[normal]to 
[normal]choose
[normal] to register 
[normal]under
[normal] the Competent Person Scheme
[normal] 
[normal]and discourage
[normal] 
[normal]householders from attempting electrical work themselves
[normal],
[normal] would improve this situation. 
[normal]In total, 85.3 per cent of 
[normal]survey 
[normal]respondents th
[normal]ought
[normal] all installe
[normal]rs carrying out 
[normal]work under the Building R
[normal]egulations should be registered as Competent Persons, while 81.1 per cent
[normal] would
[normal] support the introduction of a legal requirement for all practicing electrical installers to be registered as individually competent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold] 
[normal]In total, 86.4
[normal] per cent of respondents, say they 
[normal]have had their work reviewed 
[normal]by their Competent Person Scheme Provider NAPIT Registration, 
[normal]to a standard that ensures it continues to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.
[normal] 
[normal]A further 7.1 per cent were unsure w
[normal]hile 6.4 per cent said they did not.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.4[bold] 
[normal]T
[normal]he specification mentioned above, EAS, will further regulate the training and assessment criteria 
[normal]to be met by 
[normal]competent registered
[normal] 
[normal]electrical installers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In total, 
[normal]65.5 per cent of respondents said they thought th
[normal]ese standards were either satisfactory or too high (with only 5.6 per cent saying they were too low)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Effect of [bold]Registration Scheme and Register Competition[bold]5.1[bold] 
[normal]The survey asked: Which of the statements about the competition between CPS 
[normal]providers
[normal] do you a
[normal]gree with:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2[bold] 
[normal]Responses indicate that all of these factors 
[normal]play a part
[normal] in the current 
[normal]electrical Competent Person Scheme arena
[normal]. A total of 20.4 per cent thought competition was bad because it drove standards down and 28.2 per cent thought it was bad because it limited c
[normal]onsumer awareness. However, this is set against the 38.2 per cent of respondents who thought that competition was good because without it prices would be higher and the 59.6 per cent that thought competition was good because it 
[normal]offered
[normal] them choice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3[bold] 
[normal]By
[normal] recoding
[normal] this data into positive and negative statements, we can see that while 48.6 per cent of respondents thought competition was bad, more than twice as many (97.8) saw competition as a good thing for them.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4[bold] 
[normal]The two negative aspects of competiti
[normal]on that we have identified here are currently being addressed 
[normal]in line with
[normal] DCLG
[normal]’s 2012
[normal] Conditions of 
[normal]A
[normal]uthorisation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5[bold] 
[normal]It is hoped that the new EAS 2012 standards,
[normal] to be
[normal] introduced in June 2014, will help to address the current issues in the industry
[normal] aro
[normal]und the dilution of standards
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6[bold] 
[normal]T
[normal]he concern that competition creates a confused market for consumers
[normal] has also been addressed. 
[normal]One of 
[normal]DCLG
[normal]’s 
[normal]Conditions of Authorisation is
[normal] to
[normal] promote awareness of the Competent Person Scheme to consumers.
[normal] 
[normal]This response highlights 
[normal]the effec
[normal]ts of competition in the market
[normal] going forward, will be 
[normal]predominantly
[normal] 
[normal]positive.
