defaultIntroductiondefaultPrudhoe Transport
default (now the East 
defaultTynedale
default)
default Working group was established by Prudhoe Community Partnership in 2008. Prudhoe is a 
defaulttown
default of about 12,000 residents and is the largest town in the 
defaultTyne
default 
defaultValley
default. The town lies about twelve miles to the west of 
defaultNewcastle upon Tyne
default and 
default12 miles east of Hexham
default. The county’s main administrative centre is in 
defaultMorpeth
default, about 15 miles to the north as the crow flies.
defaultThe town lies to the south of the River Tyne, in a steep sided valley. The town has a station on the 
defaultNewcastle
default – 
defaultCarlisle
default railway line, but the station,
default being in the valley, is situated at the foot of a steep climb from every part of the town. Most residential properties lie between one and two miles from the station.
defaultThe River Tyne provides a natural barrier to movement to and from the north. Consequentl
defaulty the town’s main road run
defaults
default east-west
default. Connection to the main arterial routes of the A1 and A68 lie about six miles east and west respectively.
defaultIt can be seen, therefore, that, for a
default growing
default town of an appreciable size
default with surrounding villages
default so close to
default a major conurbation, connectivity (by all forms of tra
defaultnsport) is somewhat limited. The
default nearest accident and emergency centre is in Hexham, with major hospitals in Newcastle, 
defaultAshington
default and Durham. Jobcentres are in Hexham and Blaydon. The town has only one
default supermarket of note, with the nearest low-cost supermarkets being in Blaydon and Hexham. Mainstream education is well provided in the town,
default but children from 
defaultOvingham
default and Low Prudhoe face a steep uphill walk of up to one and a half miles to reach the town
default’s High School.
default 
defaultF
defaulturther education is in Newcastle, Hexham, 
defaultKirkley
default near 
defaultPonteland
default, and 
defaultAshington
default, all 12 miles or more away
default.
default The
default nearest cinemas and theatres are in Hexham, Gateshead and Newcastle.
defaultIf “isolation” were to be defined as “the state of being i
defaultsolated or separated”, (Concise Oxford Dictionary), then Prudhoe
default and surrounding villages
default might well be considered to be isolated, being cut off from hospitals, higher and further education and employment opportunities. Within the town, many areas are more
default than 400m walking distance from the nearest bus stop. Large parts of the town have no appreciable bus service before 0900 and after 1500. In addition, 
defaultPrudhoe’s
default immediate environs consist of a number of villages and hamlets of varying size, many with no o
defaultr very limited public transport provision.
defaultThe town is also growing, with a proportion of new housing being affordable housing, where car ownership is often low; without access to transport, such residents will find access to employment particularly diffic
defaultult. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNorthumberland County Council has a passenger subsidy cut-off, after which it consider
defaults the cost to be too high and not represent value for money. As a consequence, large parts of Prudhoe have no bus services after 1500hrs Mondays to Saturdays and none at all on Sundays. Whilst we appreciate that public funding is limited, it does mean that
default public transport provision in our town and in the surrounding villages is very limited, especially when compared to the provision in 
defaultGateshead
default, our neighbouring authority, where provision in their more rural areas continues up to 
defaultmidnight
default, seven days a we
defaultek, using conventional buses.
default&#xa0;defaultThe lack 
defaultof bus services on the largest housing estate in our town, and the lack of service after 1500 to most of the town, has serious implications across all elements of society in the town. For example, Drawback, a post-second world war mixed housing development
default, is between 0.4 and 0.7 miles from the town’s main bus stop and comprises about one fifth of the town’s population. After 1500hrs it has no bus service of its own, which means that people in work, elderly returning with shopping, or indeed anyone limited 
defaultto public transport has no option other than a long uphill walk.
default Parts of Drawback are more than 1.3 miles from the town’s railway station, making rail use impractical for many people.
defaultBy the same token, there are significant demogra
defaultphic changes taking pla
defaultce. P
defaultarts of the neighbouring village of 
defaultStocksfield
default a
defaultre now inhabited
default by retired people, or individuals who have lost a partner. Despite improved health and longer life, such people will reach a point where driving is no longer an option, and many will fi
defaultnd themselves more than 1.1 miles from a regular bus service.
default&#xa0;defaultThe main challenge
default to reducing isolation in Prudhoe and its environs is to provide a basic bus service between about 0645 and 2300, seven days a week, rather than the 0930 – 1500 service, six days a week, that much of the town has at present. Where possible, a local bus ser
defaultvice should offer through ticketing to the ‘trunk’ bus services that run east-
defaultwest through the town, as well as through tickets to trains, together with practical connections.
defaultA second challenge is to provide services to the even more isolated rural hamlet
defaults, consistent with the needs of their local (albeit small
defaulter
default) populations. Places such as Hedley on the Hill and High 
defaultMickley
default have no
default daily
default bus
default service at all and have
default ageing populations who would benefit from suitable connecting bus services 
defaultthree or four
default 
defaulttimes a day. In particular, while our local churches are thriving, many elderly people are unable to attend because there are no services on Sunday mornings. People in these communities are also unable to participate in sporting or shopping opportunities o
defaultn Sundays.
defaultA third challenge is to open up employment opportunities for jobseekers in Prudhoe
default and villages
default. For example, there are no easy public transport links to main centres of employment such as 
defaultTeam
default 
defaultValley
default in 
defaultGateshead
default, or Hexham’s industrial estate 
defaultto the north of that town. Northumberland is concentrating its job creation efforts into the south east of the county (
defaultAshington
default, 
defaultBlyth
default and 
defaultCramlington
default), which cannot be accessed by public transport easily from Prudhoe
default – it would be impossible for someone 
defaultto consider shift work in a factory there without access to a car.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrudhoe has one community transport serv
defaultice that enables elderly people to travel into Hexham twice a week, using a bus that collects people from their homes. While this is appreciated, it is of very limited benefit to the vast majority of people in the town
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is unacceptable in an area
default the size of Prudhoe that such a large part of the population should be more than half a mile from a regular bus or train service
default. This could be easily addressed by providing funding for an effective town service to extend the existing town bus service that operates for just five hours a day, six days a week. While we accept that such a service is unlikely to be provided on a commer
defaultcial basis, the County Council must consider that the lack of such a service leads to large parts of the population to suffer acute isolation, particularly in the evenings when cultural and leisure activities in nearby towns simply can’t be accessed withou
defaultt a car.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have touched on this earlier. Northumberland County Council claims to be unable to afford to provi
defaultde an extended town bus service. We estimate that a good town bus service would cost the county about
default an additional
default £60,000 a year – about £5 per resident
default. If the service was properly integrated with our trunk bus and train services, additional bus revenue
default might offset the cost by between one third and one half of the total, if the service was properly marketed. Opening up
default large parts of the town
default and villages
default with a substantially
default improved 
defaulttown 
defaultbus service would be of great benefit to the wellbeing of the po
defaultpulation, opening up access to sport, recreation, health services, shopping and cultural activities, but this is difficult to estimate beforehand and only p
defaultossible to evaluate afterwards. We would suggest that Prudhoe might be an ideal town in which to tri
defaultal a ‘demonstration project’ over a two year period to properly evaluate the economic, social and wellbeing benefits of improved public transport in an area suffering increasingly from isolation.
