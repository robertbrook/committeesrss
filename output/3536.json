"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from King’s Fund (PEX0033)&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe King’s Fund is an independent charity working to improve health and health care in England. We help to shape policy and practice through research and analysis; develop individuals, teams and organisations; promote understanding of the health and social care system; and bring people together to learn, share knowledge and debate. Our vision is that the best possible care is available to all.\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NHS is \nmore than two and a half years th\nrough the \nmost significant period of financial constraint in its history\n,\n \nwith the \nprospects beyond 2015 looking even more challenging\n.\n \nAt the aggregate level,\n \nit has\n \nso far \nmanaged reasonably well, \nin large part due to continued \npay restraint and reductions in the tariff. However, \nthis masks growing pressures within the system, with \nan increasing number of providers now in deficit\n and \nmany struggling to meet the \nA&amp;E waiting time target.\n The reality for many NHS organisations is that they now face a difficult choice between \nmaintaining\n quality of care and balancing the books.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe plans being made to meet the Nicholson Challenge and whether the NHS is succeeding in making efficiency gains rather than cuts&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince April 2011, The King’s Fund has published a quarterly monitoring report which analyses NHS performance against key indicators and tracks progress in \nimproving productivity\n based on a regular survey of NHS finance directors. Although the survey is \nnot a representative sample\n, \nand\n \nsome \ncaution should be exercised in comparing results\n between quarters\n, it does provide valuable insight into how the NHS is responding to the Nicholson Challenge.\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reports \nshow\n that NHS organisations made good progress in meeting productivity targets\n during the first two years of the Nicholson Challenge\n. In 2011/12,\n an average saving of 4.7 per cent was reported by those responding to \nour\n survey, against an average cost improvement programme (CIP) target of 5.1 per cent. In 2012/13, an average saving of 4.6 per cent was reported against an average CIP\n target of 4.9 per cent. These findings are \nbroadly \nconsistent with other evidence about the \nprogress \nmade in meeting the Nicholson Challenge\n,\n including the National Audit Office’s assessment of \nsavings\n made in 2011/12.\n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, our \ntwo \nmost recent reports reveal a significant \nfall \nin\n confidence among those surveyed about whether CIP targets can \ncontinue to be met\n. \nOur most recent report, in September 2013, found that only a third \nof NHS trust finance directors were confident of meeting \nan average\n CIP target for 2013/14 \nof 4.9 per cent. \nThis \ncontrast\ns with\n around 70 per cent who were confident of meeting their target for \n2012/13 \nin\n our\n February report\n. This \nreinforc\nes\n warnings that \nthe \nquick wins\n have been identified and that \nsavings will become progressively harder to achieve over time.\n&#xa0;\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCG finance leads - surveyed for the first time for our September report – were much more confident\n than their counterparts in NHS trusts\n, with nearly 70 per cent expecting to meet an average \nQIPP \ntarget of 2.5 per cent in 2013/14. \nNHS England and CCGs are forecasting a combined surplus of £596 million, although the number of CCGs predicting a deficit has increased from nine to 24.\n \nWith NHS England in particular still finding its feet, \nit will be vital to maintain financial control -\n NHS England \nis\n \nexpecting to spend £318 million more than planned on direct commissioning and is now \nforecasting a £93 million deficit in its commissioning budget, mainly as a result of higher than anticipated expenditure on specialist services\n. \n&#xa0;\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall, t\nhis \nsuggest\ns that \nthe strain is\n being felt most in the provider sector, which is not surprising gi\nven the year-on-year reductions in the tariff\n and other pressures they are facing\n (see below)\n.\n \nOn the prospect\ns\n \nfor\n meeting the target \nt\no deliver £20 billion in productivity improvements \nacross the NHS \nby 2015,\n only 10 per cent of those surveyed for our most recent report rated the chances as better than 50/50, with \nthe majority (56 per cent) identifying a high or very high risk the target will not be met.\n \n&#xa0;\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nnote the assurances given to the Committee’s previous inquiry and the findings of the National Audit Office report that\n the bulk of the savings made in 2011/12 were recurrent.\n Nevertheless, we \nremain concerned that \na significant element\n of the progress so \nfar has been delivered through\n \npay restraint, reductions in the tariff and cuts in management costs \nrather than genuin\ne improvements in productivity. We also reiterate our concern that too much emphasis has been placed on generating financial savings, rather than on improving \nthe \nquality \nof services for patients\n.\n&#xa0;\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nP\nay rises for most NHS staff \nfrozen for two years from 2011/12 and \nlimited to\n 1 per cent in 2013/14.\n It remains to be seen whether the government is successful in deferring the planned 1 per cent pay rise \ndue \nin April 2014. \nOpportunities remain to reduce the costs associated with the use of agency staff, locums and staff sickness. \nHowever,\n pay restraint i\ns\n not a long term substitute for efficiency gain. With staff costs making up the bulk of the NHS budget and significant pressures on providers to maintain staffing levels following the shocking failures of care highlighted by the Francis report, there is little or no \nfurther \nroom for manoeuvre in reducing staff costs.\n&#xa0;\n10)\n \nAlongside this, year-on-year reductions in the tariff mean that it \nwill have\n been cut by nearly 7 per cent in real terms by 201\n4\n/1\n5\n, increasing pressures on providers\n. As the Committee pointed out in its previous report, the tariff is a blunt instrument for driving productivity improvements which does little to drive efficiencies among commissioners. \nWith providers coming under increasing pressure, \nthe\n potential \nto \nreduc\ne\n \nit further\n \nis\n limit\ned\n.\n&#xa0;\n11)\n \nM\najor reconfigurations of services are essential to improve quality of care\n and have the potential to improve financial sustainability (although they often result in significant short term costs, \nas is\n the case with the proposed changes to services in South London and Mid Staffordshire)\n. \nHowever, \nprogress continues to be slow and has been hampered by notable setbacks such as the failure to bring the long-running review of children’s heart surgery to a conclusion. The picture is further complicated by the \nincreased involvement of the competition authorities in decisions about mergers and service changes. There are clearly lessons to be learned for the NHS from the Competition Commission’s recent decision to reject the proposed merger between Bournemouth and Poole hospitals. However, the risk is that this and other decisions \nresult in\n competition law \nbeing seen as\n an impediment to service change\n.\n&#xa0;\n12)\n \nWe remain concerned about the lack of capacity in the new health system \nto undertake large-scale reorganisations across wide geographical areas, especially in London, where the need for change is particularly urgent. We have proposed that \nNHS England's London office takes on a city-wide planning role, working with CCGs, and that hospitals work together in large-scale networks based on the three existing academic science networks \nto drive change. This would have the benefit of ensuring that major changes to services are overseen by the most experienced leaders and is \nan approach we \nbelieve\n could be replicated elsewhere in the country.\n&#xa0;\n13)\n \nThe Department of Health has previously indicated that 20 per cent of the productivity improvements needed to meet the £20 billion target will come from transformational change, with the bulk of this due to be delivered during the second half of the Nicholson Challenge period. \nGiven the difficulties experienced so far in delivering transformational change, the lack of capacity for driving large scale \nreconfigurations\n, the additional complexity created by the interventions of the competition authorities and the political difficulty of agreeing changes \nto services \nin the run up to a General Election, \nthe risk is that\n \nthat \nany \nchange will \ncontinue to be \nincremental \nand fragmented\n,\n \nwhen \nit needs to be urgent\n and substantial\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe effectiveness of the mechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in the NHS&#xa0;\n14)\n \nNHS England is currently review\ning\n the NHS allocations process, having rejected \nproposed \nchanges to the \ncurrent \nallocations \nformula as being inconsistent with its duty to reduce health inequalities. \nWhile recent debate has largely focused on the relative weight \nthat should be \ngiven to age a\nnd deprivation in the formula, more fundamental questions should be asked about whether the current process, which has remained largely unchanged since the 1970s, is fit for purpose.\n \nAt the heart of this is whether the resource allocation process is simply a mechanism for distributing funding\n or \nshould be \na\n more\n active policy tool\n for supporting wider NHS objectives\n. \nAs we set out in a report on this earlier this year, \nthere is \nsignificant \nscope for it to \nbe used \nas the latter\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n15)\n \nIn the short term, immediate improvements could be made to reduce \nthe \ncomplexity\n of the current formula\n, increase transparency and improve\n the way that need is estimated\n.\n \nThe review s\nhould also \nexamine\n the \noperation of the \n‘pace of change’ adjustment \n(previously decided by ministers, now by NHS England) which is \nbuilt in to the process to \nprevent areas being destabilised by \nlarge\n year-on-year swings in funding. In practice, this has reduced the impact of efforts to reallocate funding and insulated areas from change.\n&#xa0;\nThe prospects for the long term viability of NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts&#xa0;\n16)\n \nDespite the challenging financial environment, \nNHS\n \nproviders have\n so far held up \nreasonably \nwell at the aggregate level\n. Overall, the NHS in England reported a surplus of just over £2 billion in 2012/13. Our latest quarterly monitoring report found that nearly \n90 per cent of NHS trust finance directors and CCG finance leads surveyed expect to break even or record a surplus in 2013/14. However, the\nse\n figures obscure \nthe fact that \nan increasing\n number of trusts \nare struggling - seven of 42 NHS trust finance directors reported that they are forecasting a deficit.\n&#xa0;\n17)\n \nThese findings are \necho\ned by other evidence. \nMonitor\n’s latest quarterly monitoring report found that\n, i\nn the first \nquarter of 2013/14, \n48\n foundation trusts \nwe\nre in deficit\n (41 of which were acute trusts)\n,\n \nup from 36 in the same \nperiod last year\n.\n \nIt noted that trusts are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver efficiency savings and that some of those reporting deficits have not done so before. \nIt also noted that\n many \nof those planning a surplus \nare \nforecasting that this will be le\nss than 2.5 per cent of income, \nsuggesting that\n more organisations \nare in \na \npotentially \nvulnerable financial position. T\nhe \nNHS \nTrust Development Authority recently report\ned\n that \n31 NHS trusts (30 of which are acute providers) \nare planning a deficit by the end of 2013/14\n, \nan increase of five on the beginning of the year and \npotentially \nleav\ning\n the \nNHS trust \nsector \nwith a deficit of\n around £\n150\n million\n.\n Overall, \nthis means around half of all \nacute providers are now either in or predicting a deficit.\n&#xa0;\n18)\n \nT\nh\nese pressures\n \nare\n \npartly \ndue to reductions in the\n tariff\n but\n have been exacerbated \nin the acute sector \nby other measures\n such as the 30\n per cent\n marginal rate for ‘excess’ emergency admissions\n, which\n \nour \nlast quarterly monitoring report suggested has resulted in a significant loss of income\n in many trusts,\n without having much, if any, impact on admissions.\n \nTh\ne\ns\ne\n \npressures are\n reflected in EBITDA margins for trusts which have steadily declined from 7.1 per cent in 2008/09 to 6 per cent in 2012/13.\n Smaller hospitals face particular challenges because they have a higher proportion of fixed costs and lower margin non-elective work. We note that Monitor is looking at the issues faced by smaller providers - we will be undertaking our own work in this area too.\n&#xa0;\n19)\n \nAn added pressure for many acute trusts is \ncaused by \nCCGs seek\ning\n to shift outpatient activity in\nto\n community settings. While this can make care more accessible to patients, evidence suggests that initiatives \nto move care closer to home can \ndrive up costs. \nM\nuch greater scrutiny of commissioning strategies \nis needed \nto ensure that they reduce costs for \nhealth economies\n as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n20)\n \nWith \na growing\n number of trusts in deficit, others may be forced to follow the recent example of Barts \nwhich has been forced to cut staff, including 161 nursing posts, in the face of significant financial difficulties\n.\n Meanwhile, many hospitals are struggling to \nmeet \nthe fo\nur hour A&amp;E waiting time target, underlining how difficult it will be for providers to continue to\n maintain quality of care and balance the books.\n \nThere are also significant pressures in the mental health sector, with recent evidence suggesting that more than 1,700 mental health beds have been closed since 2011.\n&#xa0;\n21)\n \nThe pressure will increase in 2015/16 following confirmation of another year of essentially flat funding and the announcement of the new £3.8 billion Integration Transformation Fund\n (ITF)\n.\n \nWhile \nthis provides\n \nan \nopportunity to drive \nforward \nintegrated care, it will result in an average reduction in funding \nfor CCGs \nof approximately £17 million\n, adding significantly to pressures in the provider sector\n. As the graph below shows, while \n‘healthcare’ spending will \nhave \nincrease\nd\n over the period up to 2015/16, once the ITF and transfers to local authorities are accounted for, \nthis translates to\n a 2 per cent real terms cut in ‘NHS’ spending in 2015/16 and a \n1.4\n per cent\n cut over the period from 2009/10 to 2015/\n16.\n&#xa0;\n              Real changes in NHS spending with and without transfers to local \n              \ngovernment\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n22)\n \nBeyond this, t\nhe prospects look even more challenging. Overall, NHS England has forecasted a potential funding gap of £30 billion by 2021, based on current trends in funding and demand. While this may be unduly pessimistic, it is clear that the NHS will remain under significant financial pressure and will need to continue to find year-on-year productivity improvements for the rest of the decade.\n \nMany NHS \norganisation\ns now face a difficult choice between ensuring quality of care and balancing the books\n&#xa0;\nThe impact on adult social care of the 2010 Spending Review settlement and ability of local authorities to make efficiency savings&#xa0;\n23)\n \nWhile the government’s decision to allocate additional resources to adult social care in the 2010 spending review was welcome, this has been more than offset by an overall reduction in financial support to local government of \nmore than\n 30 per cent. \n2\n013/14 is the fourth consecutive year \nthat \nlocal authorities\n have reduced \nsocial care \nbudgets, with a planned reduction of £795\n million\n contributing\n to\n a cumulative reduction of £2.68\n \nb\nillion\n over the past three years.\n&#xa0;\n24)\n \nAlthough c\nouncils \nhave a strong track record of delivering efficiency savings,\n \nit \nis clear that \ntheir room for manoeuvre is \nnow severely\n limited, \nwith £104\n \nm\nillion\n of this year’s savings coming from the\n direct withdrawal of services.\n 87 per cent of councils now only respond to needs classified as substantial or critical under the Fair Access to Care (FACS) criteria. \nThe decision in the 2013 Spending Round to impose a further reduction in grant funding of 10 per cent in 2015/16 will add to these pressures. \n&#xa0;\n25)\n \nAs a result, t\nhe number of \nolder \npeople receiving publicly funded services has \nfallen \nby \n26\n per cent since\n \n2009/10, with an equivalent reduction of 21 per cent among working age adults over the same period.\n Given the overriding imperative to provide care \ncloser\n \nto \nhome and reduce the need for \nresidential care and \nhospital admissions, it is particularly worrying that the \nlargest \nreduction has been in the use of community-based services such as home care (down 25\n per cent\n) \ncompared to nursing home care (down \n4\n per cent) and residential care (down 1.7 per cent\n).\n&#xa0;\n26)\n \nSince the Committee’s previous report, t\nhe government\n has \nannounced its decision\n \nto implement the \nDilnot Commission’s \nproposals\n, albeit with a higher cap \non individual costs \nthan the Commission recommended of £72,000. We welcome this as \na \nsignificant \nmilestone and a \nstepping stone to wider r\neform. \nHowever, i\nmplementing the proposals \nwill be challenging, with high risks\n \nof confu\nsion, complexity and complaints.\n \nWithout a major public awareness campaign, there is a real danger that many people will see the reforms as worse \nthan\n the current system, rather than an improvement on it\n. \n&#xa0;\n27)\n \nImplementing the \nDilnot Commission\n’s recommendations will not solve the social care funding challenge. As the Commission\n concluded \n‘…\n \nthe government must devote greater resources to the adult social care system. As well as funding for new reforms, additional public funding for the means-tested system is urgently required’.\n \nThe central challenge is to assess the total quantity of resources needed to ensure that people have access to the right level of support\n. For many people it is eligibility for help, not protection from co\nsts\n that is the primary issue. Setting the national eligibility threshold at the moderate level under the FACS criteria would increase the number of people helped by 23 per cent. However, at an estimated cost of £2 billion, it is hard to see this happening in the current financial climate. \n&#xa0;28)\n \nThe combination of unremitting financial and demographic pressures is undermining the government’s aim of putting social care on a stable footing through the Care Bill and the additional resources from the NHS. The House of Lords Committee on Public Services and Demographic Change was not exaggerating when it concluded that the social care system is in crisis.\n&#xa0;\nThe impact on NHS plans of decisions made by local authorities and the use of the additional funding for social care from the NHS budget&#xa0;\n29)\n \nThe 2010 Spending Review announced that £1 billion would be transferred to local authorities from the NHS \nover the four years to 2014/15, with further transfers of \n£100 million and £200 million pledged \nfor\n 2013/14 and 2014/15 in t\nhe White Paper \nCaring for our Future\n. \nE\nvidence \nsuggests \nthat CCGs and local authorities are working well together to agree how the transferred money is used. \nHowever, o\nf the money allocated this year, \n£366 million (\n46\n per cent\n) is being used to offset cuts to services and help meet demographic pressures\n, rather than to drive transformational change\n.\n This is another indication of the pressure on budgets and a lost opportunity to promote integrated care.\n&#xa0;\n30)\n \nDelayed transfers \nof care \nhave remained largely stable over the last three years \nwith t\nhe proportion of delays attributable to social care \nhaving \nfallen \nto 27 per \ncent in September 2013\n. \nAlthough we share the Committee’s concern about the reliability of \nthe national\n data given \nthe strength of \nanecdotal evidence that delayed transfers are a significant problem in some areas, this \ndoes suggest that local authorities are prioritising hospital discharge, possibly at the expense of support \nfor\n pe\nople living in their own homes.\n&#xa0;\n31)\n \nAs set out above, the \ncreation of \nthe\n Integration Transformation Fund from 2015/16 represents a major opportunity to drive forward integrated care\n, although it will increase pressures on NHS organisations\n.\n Expectations \nabout \nwhat the \nF\nund will achieve are high – \nnational conditions that must be addressed in local plans include\n \nprotecting\n social care services, relieving pressure\ns\n on \nemergency care and ensuring seven-d\nay working to \nsupport\n hospital discharge. Robust plans to achieve this will almost certainly involve reductions in hospital activity\n, adding to financial pressures in the acute sector\n. \n&#xa0;\n32)\n \nThe Committee’s previous report was enthusiastic about the potential for health and wellbeing boards (HWBs) to be the forum for developing integrated care, a view that we share. Our recent report based on a national survey of HWBs found that they have made good progress in establis\nhing themselves\n.\n However, there\n \nis \nlittle sign that they have begun to grapple with the most pressing local issues such as service reconfigurations and\n \nonly nine of 65 responses to this question in our survey identified integrated care as a priority.\n \nBoards appear to recognise the need to change gear, with 62 per cent of respondents saying they would like to play a greater role in commissioning services. T\nhe requirement that boards sign off local plans will be an important test of their readiness to take on a stronger commissioning role across all services.\n&#xa0;\n33)\n \nThe long term ambition should be to plan with 100 per cent of NHS and social care resources, not just the \n3 per cent represented by the \nITF\n. \nThis raises bigger \nquestions about \nwhether\n \nthe post-war settlement\n,\n which established the NHS as a universal service, free at the point of use and social care as a separately funded, means-tested service\n, remains fit for purpose\n. \nThis is why we have\n established an independent commission\n,\n chaired by Kate Barker\n,\n to explore \nwhether, and if so how, the NHS and social care system should be brought closer together\n.\n&#xa0;\nProgress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care services&#xa0;\n34)\n \nThe Committee’s previous report emphasised the need to increase the scale and pace of integrated care. \nSince then, the government has signalled a more ambitious approach to delivering integrated care with \nkey national bodies\n signed up to a shared definition and commitment on integrated care, the creation of the ITF and the recent announcement \nthat \n14 pioneer areas \nwill\n lead the way in developing integrated care.\n&#xa0;\n35)\n \nIntegrated care not only improves patient outcomes and experience, but also offers significant opportunities to make more efficient use of resources by reducing waste, duplication and fragmentation. However, it is important to recognise that transformational change take\ns\n time to demonstrate results. The \npotential \nfor integrated care \nto deliver financial savings remains to be seen, and there may be a need to invest in new models of care before resources can be released from existing models. \n&#xa0;\n36)\n \nP\nrogress in implementing integrated care locally remains variable. Anecdotal evidence indicates increasing interest, with some parts of the country making good progress in developing \nand delivering \nambitious plans. However, the \nfinding from our survey\n \nthat\n most HWBs \nhave not identified\n \nit\n as a priority highlights the need for them to take a much stronger lead in driving it forward\n locally\n. \n&#xa0;\n37)\n \nDespite high level political commitment, \nthere has been little, if any, progress in addressing \nthe \npolicy barriers that undermine the development of integrated care. T\nhere \nis \na need for much greater urgency \nin \naddress\ning\n \nthese\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nProgress in making NHS efficiency savings\n; National Audit Office, 2012\n NHS England board paper, November 2013\n Ibid\n \nImproving the allocation of health resources in England: How to decide who gets what\n; The King’s Fund, 2013\n \nPerformance of the foundation trust sector: Quarter ended 30 June 2013\n; Monitor, 2013\n \nSummer report for the period 1 April to 31 July 2013\n; NHS Trust Development Authority, 2013\n Newham Recorder 5 November 2013\n BBC News and Community Care survey, October 2013\n \nADASS Budget Survey 2013\n; Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, 2013\n \nFairer Care Funding\n; The report of the Commission on Funding of Care and Support, 2011 \n \nHealth and wellbeing boards: One year on\n; The King’s Fund, 2013\n"
