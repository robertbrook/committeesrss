default evidence given to your Committee’s inquiry on climate science, the BBC Head of Editorial Standard’s
default,
default David Jordan
default said
default that 
defaultthe BBC “…had decided not to follow Jones' key recommendations on climate change: ‘[Jones] made one recommendation that we did 
defaultnot take on board. He said we should regard climate science as settled … we should not hear from dissenting voices on the science.’"
defaultWhile writing my Report to the BBC Trust on science coverage I was in general impressed by the breadth, depth and balance o
defaultf the Corporation’s treatment of the subject, and have been equally so by its rapid and effective responses to many of the suggestions I made (that of the dangers of “false balance” included).

default, though,
default greeted with 
defaultsome
default 
defaultdisagreement
default by respec
defaultted commentators
default:
defaultDaily Mail (Melanie Phillips):
default “… wickedly cynical propaganda to promote a false belief”.
defaultSunday Times (Nigel Lawson):
default … characterised chiefly by ignorance and intolerance”.
defaultDaily Express (David Rose)
default … seems to want BBC coverage to be su
defaultbject to quasi-Stalinistic thought policing”.
defaultDaily Telegraph (Christopher Booker)
default 
default“
default… the astonishing claim that the only problem with the coverage of climate change was not that it was too biased, but that it was not biased enough”.
defaultDaily Telegraph (James
default Delingpole)
default “… a sustained and brilliant rebuttal to the threadbare notion that our state broadcaster is in any way capable of being fair and balanced”.
defaultA similar but less immoderate statement was made 
defaultmore 
defaultrecently in 
defaultThe Guardian 
defaultby Peter Preston:
default 
default“
default2,00
default0 climatologists signing pieces of paper don't automatically convert a doubting public. … I'm an urgent believer in doing something about global warming. But I also live in a democracy. And nothing is QED”.
defaultIn spite of such claims
default, I emphatically did not s
defaultay that “we should regard climate science as settled … we should not hear from dissenting voices on the science”. 
defaultWhat I did in fact say in the BBC Trust report was: 
default“
defaultFor science … there is a wide acceptance of a body of scrutinised fact, interrupted by r
defaultare moments when ideas change. Constantly to call in external voices unwilling to accept that principle is not to engage in debate but in meaningless polemic.
default … 
defaultAttempts to give a place to anyone, however unqualified, who claims interest can make for false
default balance: to free publicity for marginal opinions and not to impartiality, but its opposite.
default … 
defaultThere should be no attempt to give equal weight to opinion and to evidence.

defaultThe
default producers of the
default recent 
defaultToday Programme 
defaultpiece on the new IPCC report tried, we a
defaultre told, more than a dozen 
defaultqualified climate 
defaultscientists willing to give an opposing view but could not find
default a single
default one (a hint, perhaps, that there is indeed a scientific consensus on global warming). Instead, they 
defaultgave equal time 
defaultto a
default well-known expert 
defaultand to
default Australian 
defaultretired geologist with no background in the field: in my view a classic of “false balance”.
defaultHaving said that, I reiterate that in my view BBC science coverage is good and getting better, that the Corporation responded quick
defaultly and effectiv
defaultely to most of my
default recommendations and that the balance 
defaultproblem is
default now
default less severe than it was. Indeed, it now seems to be more or less confined to news reporting abou
defaultt climate change. Why the BBC remains
default so obsessed with contrarian views 
defaulton this subject I 
defaultdo not know.
