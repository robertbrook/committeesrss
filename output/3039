[normal]Written evidence submitted by Professor Steve Jones (CLC0067)[bold]In
[normal] evidence given to your Committee’s inquiry on climate science, the BBC Head of Editorial Standard’s
[normal],
[normal] David Jordan
[normal] said
[normal] that 
[normal]the BBC “…had decided not to follow Jones' key recommendations on climate change: ‘[Jones] made one recommendation that we did 
[normal]not take on board. He said we should regard climate science as settled … we should not hear from dissenting voices on the science.’"
[normal]While writing my Report to the BBC Trust on science coverage I was in general impressed by the breadth, depth and balance o
[normal]f the Corporation’s treatment of the subject, and have been equally so by its rapid and effective responses to many of the suggestions I made (that of the dangers of “false balance” included). 
[normal]M
[normal]y report
[normal] was
[normal], though,
[normal] greeted with 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]disagreement
[normal] by respec
[normal]ted commentators
[normal]:
[normal]Daily Mail (Melanie Phillips):
[normal] “… wickedly cynical propaganda to promote a false belief”.
[normal]Sunday Times (Nigel Lawson):
[normal] … characterised chiefly by ignorance and intolerance”.
[normal]Daily Express (David Rose)
[normal] … seems to want BBC coverage to be su
[normal]bject to quasi-Stalinistic thought policing”.
[normal]Daily Telegraph (Christopher Booker)
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]… the astonishing claim that the only problem with the coverage of climate change was not that it was too biased, but that it was not biased enough”.
[normal]Daily Telegraph (James
[normal] Delingpole)
[normal] “… a sustained and brilliant rebuttal to the threadbare notion that our state broadcaster is in any way capable of being fair and balanced”.
[normal]A similar but less immoderate statement was made 
[normal]more 
[normal]recently in 
[normal]The Guardian 
[normal]by Peter Preston:
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]2,00
[normal]0 climatologists signing pieces of paper don't automatically convert a doubting public. … I'm an urgent believer in doing something about global warming. But I also live in a democracy. And nothing is QED”.
[normal]In spite of such claims
[normal], I emphatically did not s
[normal]ay that “we should regard climate science as settled … we should not hear from dissenting voices on the science”. 
[normal]What I did in fact say in the BBC Trust report was: 
[normal]“
[normal]For science … there is a wide acceptance of a body of scrutinised fact, interrupted by r
[normal]are moments when ideas change. Constantly to call in external voices unwilling to accept that principle is not to engage in debate but in meaningless polemic.
[normal] … 
[normal]Attempts to give a place to anyone, however unqualified, who claims interest can make for false
[normal] balance: to free publicity for marginal opinions and not to impartiality, but its opposite.
[normal] … 
[normal]There should be no attempt to give equal weight to opinion and to evidence.
[normal]”
[normal]The
[normal] producers of the
[normal] recent 
[normal]Today Programme 
[normal]piece on the new IPCC report tried, we a
[normal]re told, more than a dozen 
[normal]qualified climate 
[normal]scientists willing to give an opposing view but could not find
[normal] a single
[normal] one (a hint, perhaps, that there is indeed a scientific consensus on global warming). Instead, they 
[normal]gave equal time 
[normal]to a
[normal] well-known expert 
[normal]and to
[normal] Australian 
[normal]retired geologist with no background in the field: in my view a classic of “false balance”.
[normal]Having said that, I reiterate that in my view BBC science coverage is good and getting better, that the Corporation responded quick
[normal]ly and effectiv
[normal]ely to most of my
[normal] recommendations and that the balance 
[normal]problem is
[normal] now
[normal] less severe than it was. Indeed, it now seems to be more or less confined to news reporting abou
[normal]t climate change. Why the BBC remains
[normal] so obsessed with contrarian views 
[normal]on this subject I 
[normal]do not know.
