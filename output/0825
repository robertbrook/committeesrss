Written evidence from defaultthe national Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating programmedefault (LTC 75)default&#xa0;defaultThis submission is made on behalf of the national DAFNE programme and as such relates to the provision of structured education for adults with Type 1 diabetes.
default&#xa0;
defaultDose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE) is a skills-based structured education programme in flexible intensive insulin therapy and self-management for adults with type 1 diabetes. On a DAFNE course adults (17+ years) with type 1 diabetes are provided with the knowledge and skills to match their insulin dose to their chosen food intake, enabling them to manage their food choices on a meal by meal basis and in a range of different situations. Specially trained diabetes nurses and dietitians deliver every DAFNE course, which provides 38 hours of structured education to groups of 8 on an outpatient basis over 5 consecutive days or 1 day per week for 5 weeks.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DAFNE Collaborative comprises all healthcare professionals involved in DAFNE from all of the participating training centres, steered by an elected DAFNE Executive Board. This central DAFNE function provides strategic leadership and direction to DAFNE development, research and implementation. DAFNE is a not for profit hosted within the NHS.
default 
defaultThe current funding structure relies on financial contributions from all participating diabetes services to sustain the key contributions to quality assurance, peer review and audit.
default&#xa0;defaultProvision of the DAFNE programme as a component of diabetes services for people with type 1 diabetes will achieve improved patient outcomes in terms of reduced complications and extended life expectancy with associated cost savings, improved quality of life, and fulfilment of the 5 NICE standard criteria for structured education.

default&#xa0;default1.1
default              
defaultDoctors, diabetes specialist nurses and diabetes dietitians can be trained to deliver DAFNE to people with type 1 diabetes in any location. Traditionally, most type 1 diabetes care is delivered in 
defaulthospitals, but many DAFNE diabetes teams deliver courses in community and primary care settings, and utilise staff from primary care teams. As such, this bridges the gap between primary and secondary care, and increases knowledge of type1 diabetes and its management within the primary care setting.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultType 1 diabetes is characterised by insulin deficiency that can only be treated with insulin injections. The management issues of type 1 diabetes are very different from type 2 diabetes, and require the input from experienced specialist teams, for example:
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultCurrently the massive demand for type 2 diabetes services overwhelms the need for specialist type 1 diabetes care and it is neglected. We propose specific and specialised type 1 diabetes care is of paramount importance.
default 
defaultThe DAFNE Collaborative fully supports the Association of British Clinical 
defaultDiabetologists
default (ABCD) ‘Lost Tribe’ campaign for dedicated and specific commissioning for adult type 1 diabetes services in England
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultDAFNE have been actively engaged with NHS Diabetes to provide education and support for commissioning of type 1 diabetes services
default. The current payment mechanisms have thwarted primary and secondary care integration. New models of care could be developed, for example, after the provision of the structured education programme by the specialist team the patient can be discharged to primary care but with open access to the specialist team for insulin management support, structured education refreshers and follow-up as part of the care pathway.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultUltimately, appropriate structured education can result in adults with type 1 diabetes functioning independently in the community, with a reduced requirement for support from healthcare professionals for 
defaultglycaemic
default control.
default 
defaultThis benefits the patient but also the health service by freeing up healthcare professional time to focus on more complex cases.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultType 1 diabetes is a different disease from type 2 diabetes, with different treatment needs and education requirements.
default 
defaultThis is not often understood by commissioners. We believe that it is counterproductive for commissioners to be required to ‘reinvent the wheel’ when commissioning for type 1 diabetes services. National programmes which fully meet the required key criteria, such as DAFNE,
default 
defaultare available off the peg fully evidence based and 
defaultcosted
default. We propose that structured education for type 1 diabetes should be commissioned centrally to facilitate commissioning high quality type 1 diabetes care and make it easy for commissioners to avoid the current post code lottery.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStructured education programmes, such as DAFNE, are designed to educate individuals, taking their own insulin requirement and lifestyle into consideration.
default 
defaultEach patient will develop the skills to adjust their insulin dose on a meal by meal basis in a range of situations (e.g. physical activity and 
defaultduring illness).
default 
defaultGoal setting and action planning are integral tools of the course and are reviewed at follow-up.
default 
defaultUltimately DAFNE training provides the individual with knowledge and skills empowering them to control their condition rather than have the condition control them.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultPeople with better controlled type1 diabetes and an empowered understanding of their condition are less likely to access acute services for complications of their condition and its treatment. Healthy people with diabetes will be economically productive in the workforce, sustaining employment and not accessing income related support due to inability to work.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultType 1 diabetes costs the NHS £1.9 billion per year, half of which is spent on the treatment of complications. Maintaining good glycaemic control can help prevent or delay the onset of these complications
default.
default 
defaultThere is evidence
default that DAFNE training leads to clinically and statistically significant improved glycaemic control.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultThe economic impacts of DAFNE are significant. York Health Economics Consortium published an economic evaluation of DAFNE showing it:
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultDAFNE data were considered by NICE as part of the initial consultation for 
defaultNICE Technology Appraisal60, 
defaultin which DAFNE is the only programme named as an example of high quality structured education.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultReview of national and local DAFNE service clinical audit data shows:
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultThe economic and audit data from DAFNE have been used to prepare a case study for the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention(QIPP) collection on the NHS Evidence database. The QIPP case studies are examples of initiatives improving quality and productivity across the NHS and social care. Case studies are evaluated based on quality improvements, savings, evidence and implementation and are peer reviewed. The DAFNE case study:
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultHence the provision of DAFNE by specialist diabetes teams can lead to increased life expectancy, whilst reducing NHS costs by the reduction of hypos, DKA and the development of the costly long-term diabetic complications.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultPeople with diabetes are more likely to have depression than those without diabetes.
default 
defaultThe stress of the diagnosis of a long-term condition, the possibility of developing or the development of long-term diabetic complications and not feeling in control can all lead to mental health issues. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultStructured education leads to informed and empowered individuals who feel in control of their diabetes.
default 
defaultIn addition to the biomedical and economic evidence for DAFNE, there is also evidence of improved psychological outcomes following the completion of the DAFNE course in terms of improved quality of life and psychological wellbeing
default sustained for up to four years post course
default.
default 
defaultThere is evidence that anxiety and depression also reduce post DAFNE
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultHigh quality structured education to enable self-management is the corner stone, and a requirement
default,
defaultof diabetes care. NICE Technical Appraisal 60 recommends that "structured education is made available to all people with diabetes at the time of initial diagnosis and then as required on an on-going basis, based on formal, regular assessment of need".
default 
defaultDAFNE was uniquely mentioned in the NICE guidance as an example of high quality structured education.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultThe provision of structured education 
defaultthat fulfils the nationally agreed criteria from the time of diagnosis, with annual review and access to on-going education
default, is the first of the 13 quality standards set out in the Diabetes in Adults Quality Standard
default issued in March 2011.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultDAFNE is the only nationally delivered programme for adults with type 1 diabetes which meets the nationally agreed key criteria.
default 
defaultIt is delivered by 60 specialist diabetes teams (across 138 localities) in England and as of the 29 April 2013, 22,382 adults with type 1 diabetes had completed a DAFNE course.
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default              
defaultCurrently there is a huge variation in access to structured type I diabetes education across England.
default 
defaultWe estimate that DAFNE is available in approximately 50% of specialist diabetes services.
default 
defaultThere is no reliable information to verify what education people with type 1 diabetes are offered.
default 
defaultThere is a plethora of guidance about structured type 1 diabetes education but a postcode lottery of access to it.We believe that there should be a national mimimum standard for type 1 diabetes care that is mandated and audited to drive improvement for this costly and burdensome condition.
