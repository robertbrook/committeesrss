defaultWritten evidence submitted from defaultQuality of Life Associationdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default1.1 Quality of Life 
default(QLA) 
defaultwas the first Lao Civil 
defaultS
defaultociety 
defaultO
defaultrganisation to provide assistance and support to 
defaultunexploded ordinance (
defaultUXO
default)
default survivors in Lao PDR as well as to people with disabilities. In its daily activities, QLA sees the barriers 
defaultthat people with disabilities (
defaultPWD
default)
default, including survivors, are facing
default,
default and tries 
defaultto 
default break them down to empower PWD and develop opportunities for them to participate 
defaultfully in 
defaultsociety
default, to contribute 
defaultto the development of their countries
default,
default and 
defaultto 
defaultadvocate for their rights . 
default&#xa0;
default1.2 From QLA experience this can only be achieved if PWD benefit from mainstream and disability specific services as reflected by the twin track approach
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 PWD, including survivors, are people with a lot of capabilities
default,
default and not acknowledging 
defaultthis
default would be detrimental to any development efforts. They should thus, directly or via their representative associations, be given 
defaultthe 
defaultopportunity to participate actively 
defaultin 
default the definition of policies and programs, 
defaultand in 
default their implementation and monitoring
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4 Development program
defaults
default and policies should reflect those considerations so 
defaultas 
defaultto be inclusive of and accessible to PWD, including survivors, from the very moment they are drafted to the moment they are implemented and assessed. Only then
default will
default development efforts  reach the most vulnerable and 
defaultwill 
defaultPWD  benefit from them on an equal basis to other
defaults,
default thus making sure no one is left behind.
default&#xa0;default2. Introduction of the work of Quality of Life Associationdefault&#xa0;
default2.1 To answer the need
defaults
default of unexploded ordnance  victims, and people with disabilities  the Quality of Life Association  
defaultwas 
default set up in 2011 and became the first Lao Civil Society Organisation  providing assistance and support services to victims of unexploded ordnance , people with disabilities  and poor families in the Xieng Khouang Province in Lao PDR.  The QLA Operational Team and Board of Directors are made up of Lao nationals, some of whom are UXO survivors. The objective to 
defaultset up the association in Xieng Khuang province because it is one of the most bomb affected areas in Laos. “Xieng Khuang, know for the Plain of Jars, is also the plain of scars.”
default&#xa0;
default2.2 The presence of the buried bombs affects the quality of life of local people in many ways. Economic development is stalled. Children need to learn at an early age that they must be careful around their homes and villages. Agriculture is more difficult and often dangerous. Many people who have survived an accident need expensive medical care and follow-up treatment; families who have lost a loved one also need economic support and new livelihoods.             
default2.3 The QLA supports UXO affected communities and PWD through training on animal raising, weaving and dyeing, and the production of hand-crafted souvenirs. Another important aspect is emergency and long term medical care, including rehabilitation, as well as psycho-social support.
default  
defaultThe QLA has run training courses for UXO accident survivors, family members of UXO victims and PWD in nine villages of the province
default. The Association
default  targeted 
defaultthese villages 
default for assistance after it conducted a survey among local communities.
default“We select 15 people representing 15 families in a village to attend a course. We firstly give priority to a UXO affected family member and UXO survivors and persons with disability because they are our target groups. Our second priority is poor families. After attending a training course on livestock or poultry raising, each person is given 600,000-700,000 kip to use as capital to undertake this activity. Those who attend a training course on weaving, making handicrafts or tailoring can sell their products at the QLA village shop.” 
default   
defaultThe association provides all the materials needed for trainees to make the products and pays them for each item in accordance with their ability and the orders placed by the QLA. A training course on tailoring has taught women how to sew small fabric bags to contain laptops and mobile phones.
default 
defaultThe association will continue to help UXO affected communities and PWD in all districts of the province because a large number of people need assistance and have no permanent job
default 
defaultto provide them with a regular source of income.                                                                      
default&#xa0;
default2.4 
defaultThe Lao Government ratified the UNCRPD on 2

defaulted
default selected government Ministries to formulate and implement Ministerial action plans to support the inclusion and development of persons with disabilities in the Lao PDR. 
defaultThe Lao Disability Decree is issued in order to determine principles, rules and measures 
default to be
default taken for the protection of rights and interes
defaultts of persons with disabilities;
default to formulate policies on treatment, health rehabilitation, vocational training, employment promotion and other policies aiming at promoting self-development and self-reliance 
default for persons with disabilities;
default  
defaultand 
defaultto eliminate all forms of discrimination against persons with disabilities, in order to create 
defaultthe 
defaultconditions for persons with disabilities to participate fully and on 
defaultan 
defaultequal basis in social activities. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe Lao Disability Decree is not yet finalized by the Lao Government.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default5
default Nevertheless, as of today in Lao PDR, PWD including survivors, are facing barriers to access basic services such as health, education and employment on 
defaultan 
defaultequal basis 
defaultto 
default their peers. This lack of access to basic services leads to reduced opportunities to contribute to the economic, social and cultural life of their families and communities. The result is that PWD may not participate fully 
defaultin 
default social and community development and face additional 
defaultdifficulties to elevate their social and economic situation. So, the QLA is encouraging PWD, including survivors, in Xieng Khouang Province to participate in family and community life and contribute to  local development. However, when basic services are developed that are not accessible for UXO survivors and persons with disabilities, the challenges are often too difficult to overcome.  
default&#xa0;
default3. Reason for submitting evidence:default&#xa0;
default3.1 Given the fact that QLA is a pioneer in this field in Lao PDR, it was of outmost importance for us to share our views. Besides, Lao PDR being the most affected country in terms of cluster munitions contamination, this was also an opportunity for us to call
default for 
default synergies to be made between victim assistance and the broader disability and development frameworks
default -
default to make sure that there exist specific policies for survivors, especially thanks to victim assistance provisions in the Oslo and the Ottawa treaties
default;
default but also 
defaultto make sure 
defaultthat PWD, and thus including survivors, can benefit from the efforts that are made for the development of a country or of a region. Indeed, achieving our goals in term of development is illusory if PWD, including survivors and other vulnerable persons are left behind
default,
default as  has been recalled recently at the highest level with the report of the High 
defaultL
defaultevel 
defaultP
defaultanel
default, 
default th
defaultat
default  of the UN Secretary General
default;
default and  the discussions around the post 2015 agenda.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultThe Lao PDR is a least developed country experiencing poverty. The country is ranked 133 out of 177 nations in the Global Development index. Approximately 23% of the population lives on less than $1USD per day. Persons with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to poverty  in society. The Lao National Growth and Poverty Eradication Scheme (2003) reported physical and mentally handicapped/blind groups represent the highest percentage (18.5%) of people  at-risk of poverty in Vientiane Municipality. Lack of awareness and understanding by government policy makers and officials lead
defaults
default to exclusion of persons with disability from development programs
default 
defaultD
defaultue to cluster munitions and other UXO 
defaultthere were 
defaultat least 50
default,
default525 mi
defaultne/
defaultERW
default casualties, including 29,506 people killed and 21,
default019 injured since 1964
default. Knowing those figures, it is obvious any initiative taken now
default,
default to 
defaultcreate 
default a society which is inclusive of PWD and where a broad range of services are accessible to all
default,
default will benefit  future generations and will have long lasting effects for themselves but also for their communities since they are, on 
defaultan 
defaultequal basis to others, actors of change.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 Besides, I am myself a person with disability and I have met the barriers I am trying, as the executive director of QLA, to break. I was lucky to find support and to be able to continue my education and then get a job as it is sadly not the case for all PWD, including survivors who remain the poorest amongst the poor because they often do not have access to such services and opportunities. For instance in my own province there is right now only one Rehabilitation centre in Xiengkhouang city which provide
defaults
default such services like rehabilitation, prosthetic and orthotic to survivors and PWD by the CMR and COPE. It is far from most villages where survivors and PWD live and therefore very difficult to access it. For instance my friendwas injured in the 
default1970s 
default when she was sixteen. And she finally received 
defaulther prosthesis on 4
defaultth
default April 2010 with the support of Handicap International and COPE. I would wish 
defaultthat 
defaultall survivors and PWD 
defaultquickly 
defaultaccess quickly 
defaultthe 
defaultsupports we need
default,
default because it means we can survive as human being. I am also part of a survivor initiative called the Lao Ban Advocates and this experience, thanks to a close collaboration with the Lao Government, including with the NRA, has proved to be efficient. We have been working hand in hand with various stakeholders to raise the voice of survivors and their affected communities
default,
default and to help the government in elaborating a framework for addressing their needs. Such 
defaultan 
defaultexample demonstrates that the motto “Nothing about us without us” is a meaningful one and that joint efforts lead to great results.
default&#xa0;default4. Quality of Life recommendationsdefault&#xa0;defaultSo, to ensure that people with di
defaultsabilities including UXO survivors are included in development wok, here are a few recommendations that QLA would like to share:
default&#xa0;
default4.1 Policy and programme development sh
defaultould
default be inspired by lived experiences and therefore
default PWD, including UXO survivors, shall be given the possibility to  participatedefault activelydefault defaultin defaultthe discussions and contribute fully to the elaboration of those policies and programs. Indeed defaultUXO survivors and PWD are often left behind, so to ensure an inclusive development, UXO survivors and PWD we should be included in the first planning, discussing and decision making processes related to development framework
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default Disabled Peoples Organizations (DPOs) should play a prominent role in the implementation of policies and programsdefault,default and need to be supporteddefault 
defaulti
defaultn order to be able to take the lead in implementing, 
defaultmonitoring and evaluati
defaultng 
default development policies and programs for PWD 
defaultand UXO survivor
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default A twin track approach should be reflected:default On 
defaultthe 
defaultone hand
default so
default as to ensure that the approach taken, when developing systems, strategies and projects for the general public, is inclusive of PWD, including survivors, be
default it
default in areas like health care services, employment programs, education programs, etc. On the other  specific measures
default,
default sh
defaultould 
default also be taken to support the development and the empowerment of PWD, including survivors. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default All defaultmainstream services default shdefaultould default also be designed as to be fully accessible to PWD.default Many PWD and survivors are unable to access public buildings
default and
default health care services because th
defaulte
defaultse are not accessible. Sometimes, they will not benefit from available services in their communities due to problems 
defaultof 
default transportation or the fact they did not get access to information related to such services.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 Along with other factors such as gender and age, policy and program development should make sure that
default data are defaultalso defaultdisaggregated by disability defaultto ensure PWD, including survivors, benefit from 
defaultprograms 
defaulton an equal basis with others. 
defaultThis 
default will also help 
defaultin 
defaultmeasuring the impact of those efforts made to tackle poverty and improve people’s li
defaultves
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 Any step taken also implies action to 
defaultsupport and strengthen defaultDisabled Peoples Organizations (DPOs)default so they can advocate for the rights of PWD and thus collaborate 
defaultin 
default the elaboration of policies that affect them with all the relevant stakeholders.
