[normal]&#xa0;[bold] Written evidence submitted by
[normal] Save the Children UK 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Save the Children is the world’s independent children’s rights organisation, working in more than 120 countries. We save children's lives. We fight for their rights. We help them fulfil their potential.
[normal]We have been operating in Burma since 1995
[normal], and we 
[normal]work 
[normal]on the ground 
[normal]with DFID. Our work there spans multiple sectors, including education, protection, child rights governance, health, nutrition and humanitarian response. 
[normal]In 2012, we
[normal] reached 3.9m beneficiaries through programmes worth £22m. 
[normal]We currently deploy 
[normal]staff in 31 sub-offices spanning six regions and four states. 
[normal]Save the Children
[normal] can offer field-based evidence from our research, programme ex
[normal]perience and local partners to inform the IDC’s inquiry.
[normal]We have focused our submission on the following four issues:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Poverty, discrimination and child rights violations[bold]: 
[normal]Insufficient government investments in health, education, social welfare and social protection compound family poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services which lead to daily violations of children’s rights to survival, development, protection and participation. Discrimination based on ethnicity, language, religion, income, location, gender, disability and other diversity factors further contribute to child rights violations. 
[normal]Each year, around 56,000 children under five die from preventable diseases in 
[normal]Burma
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Governance[bold]: 
[normal]Constitutional and legal framework -
[normal] The Government of 
[normal]Burma (GoB
[normal]) has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), CEDAW, CRPD, the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2008. However, the CRC does not have constitutional status in 
[normal]Burma
[normal], thus national laws and regulations override the CRC in court. This is elaborated further under Section 4, below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Education[bold]: At the global level, DFID has committed to the education MDGs. Studies demonstrate that education underpins progress in all aspects of development. Yet 
[normal]in 
[normal]Burma
[normal], d
[normal]ecades of chronic under-funding of education have resulted in poor infrastructure and facilities, lack of effective teacher training and learning materials and teaching methods that do not enable 
[normal]children to engage actively in learning. 
[normal]The primary school completion rate is 54% overall and only 31% from the poorest households.
[normal]Education is a minor priority in DFID-B’s Operational Plan, amounting to just 5.4% of the progr
[normal]amme spend forecast for 2011-15.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Education
[normal] is also a powerful driver of 
[normal]social cohesion[bold]. 
[normal]Within the education sector, the issue of language of instruction raises questions about the relationship between education and national identity. By developing curricula and teaching materials in the refugee camps, international donors have supported the development of a Karen education regime very different to that in government schools, and increased the isolation 
[normal]of 
[normal]these populations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal].5
[normal] [bold]Social Protection: [bold]Articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) define the rights of men and women to social protection. With an estimated 29% of the rural population living in poverty
[normal], there are many 
[normal]Burmese
[normal] people whose rights are not being met. 
[normal]Studies show that by enabling poor people to invest in and develop their own production and access a nutritious diet, social transfers can lead to sustainable reductions in poverty and hunger, as well as boosting economic growth
[normal]. 
[normal]Social protection has the potential to accelerate national growth and development by increasing productive potential and demand in local markets.
[normal]1
[normal].6
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Nutrition[bold]: 
[normal]In Burma, the nationwide prevalence of stunting is 35.1% and wasting is 7.9%
[normal],
[normal] indicative of a serious public health problem by WHO classification. Burma
[normal] is among the “24 high-burden countries” with the largest number of children under 5 years old who are moderately or severely stunted
[normal]. Approximately 22.6% of all children under five are underweight. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal].7
[normal]              
[normal]The protracted rates of under-nutrition in 
[normal]Burma
[normal] are the consequence of chronic food and nutrition insecurity, under-investment in rural development, poor health and public infrastructure, remoteness and extreme weather events. The situation is compounded in border areas by conflict and complex issues surrounding minority groups. This limits the ability of many households to access sufficient levels of nutritious food and income as 
[normal]well as basic services such as clean water, health and education. 
[normal]Social protection policies, and in particular cash transfers, allow families to meet the direct and indirect costs of a nutritious diet, healthcare and education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal].8  The main sectoral aid programmes on health (3MDG), education (MDEF/MEC) and livelihoods (LIFT) currently ignore nutrition. DFID is currently the largest contributor to the multi-
[normal]donor fund, 
[normal]Livelihoods and Food Security Trust (
[normal]LIFT), which is the most significant ODA initiati
[normal]ve on 
[normal]livelihoods 
[normal]in 
[normal]Burma
[normal]. However, this fund doesn’t currently support nutrition or social protection, despite this being articulated in the LIFT strategy
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold].9 Recommendation[bold]s[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since the Cyclone Nargis disaster in 2008, international assistance has gradually evolved away from largely humanitarian interventions to focus on longer-term development work. 
[normal]With the lifting of sanctions, t
[normal]he number of sectors in which donors engage has expanded and there is more engagement with the administration. 
[normal]Every aid agency in the world is planning to initiate or
[normal] 
[normal]expand operations in 
[normal]Burma
[normal] and the 
[normal]GoB
[normal]’s capacity to engage meaningfully is drastically overstretched.
[normal] This undermines effective coordination and sustainability of the 
[normal]development investments. However, DFID’s Operational Plan indicates that 
[normal]no bilateral aid will be provided through central government systems, other than at the township level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Partnership Group for Aid Effectiveness of around 20 bilateral development partners offers a mechanism for promoting principles of aid effectiveness. Other mechanisms exist, such as the 
[normal]humanitarian clusters, 
[normal]Country Coordination Mechanism (CCM) for health, the joint-programming between EuropeAid &amp; EU bilaterals, etc. INGOs and local civil society play relatively modest roles in these and Government even less. However, t
[normal]he Government-led Framework on Economic and Social Reforms (FESR, December 2012) and
[normal] National Comprehensive Development Plan (NCDP) 
[normal]processes 
[normal]have established a structure for 
[normal]GoB
[normal] and development partners to harmonise efforts through Sector Working Groups. The value of civil society, private sector and other non-state actors’ perspectives w
[normal]ithin this framework is recognis
[normal]ed in the Government rhetoric, but has been deferred until the structure has bedded down. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]DFID has invested significantly in multi-donor trust funds such as 3MDG, LIFT, MEC. These seem to have been effec
[normal]tive mechanisms for harmonis
[normal]ing donor investments and now offer overstretched Ministries an efficient platform for engagement with the multitude of development partners. However, the MDTFs currently operate outside the 
[normal]GoB
[normal]’s new coordination structure. 
[normal]Furthermore, by outsourcing fund management of these multi-donor funds, DFID and their partners have reduced speed &amp; flexibility in decision-making and increased transaction costs. 
[normal]2.4 [bold]Recommendations [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.  [bold]How effectively is DFID addressing governance and public financial management issues in its sectoral programmes (eg on health, education &amp; livelihoods)? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lack of political will and insufficient investments in children: [bold] 
[normal]While 
[normal]Burma
[normal] has had a Child Law since 1993 and a National Plan of Action for Children 2006-15, political commitment and resources to effectively implement and monitor the law and National Plan of Action have been lacking. The Department of Social Welfare (DSW) is a focal point for child rights but is significantly under-resourced, is relatively weak in relation to other ministries and thus has struggled to activate the National Child Rights Committee (designated in the Child Law) which would enable inter-ministerial co-ordination for improved planning and budgeting for child rights. Spending in the social sector is very low: health and education combined for 1.5 per cent of GDP between 2000 and 2007. DSW received less than 0.02% of the budget
[normal]. DSW officials/ social workers are not available within townships
[normal] and Township Child Rights Committees have no budget. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].2 
[normal]Quality of governance, planning and budgeting processes[bold]: 
[normal]The Framework on Economic and Social Reforms (2012) and
[normal] National Comprehensive Development Plan 
[normal]processes provide crucial opportunities to influence budget allocations for children and support for civil society and children’s participation in planning and budgeting processes.  However, while rhetoric for a ‘people centred development’ is articulated at the central level, hesitancy remains among many officials at state and regional levels. Moreover, 90% of the budget remains centralised. 
[normal]The election and existence of parliamentarians from diverse constituencies provides a real change to the political environment in 
[normal]Burma
[normal], and a genuine opportunity for engagement with parliamentarians to lobby for law reform, plans and budgets to increase child rights. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations [bold]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold].  What role should DFID play in helping to resolve ethnic tensions?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite progress
[normal] towards peace, conflict in Kachin and elsewhere continues, and the ethnic and religious violence in Rakhine State underscores the fragility of peace. A
[normal]pproximately 400,000 people are displaced inside 
[normal]Burma
[normal] and another 130,000 refugees are in camps and 2 million low-skilled 
[normal]Burma
[normal] migrants in Thailand. Recent estimates indicate that 59% of IDPs and surrounding communities are impoverished.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The scenarios for the displaced Rohingya are unclear and seem likely to become medium-long term challenges, in need of mediation from neutral actors. 
[normal]Recent studies 
[normal]conducted by Oxfam and Save the Children in conflict-affected areas of Rakhine State indicate asset depletion and growing needs for livelihood support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3 The coordination of potential (non-refugee) migrant return and resettlement is
[normal] recognis
[normal]ed but has been inconsistently coordinated. Population mobility for work both inside 
[normal]Burma
[normal] and within the region may possibly increase unless the economy improves, particularly in historically under-served rural and ethnic areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4 Within the education sector, the issue of language of instruction raises questions about the relationship between education and national identity. By developing curricula and teaching materials in the refugee camps, international donors have supported the development of a Karen nationalist education regime very different to that in government schools. By contrast, ASEAN has set
[normal] a goal of a regionally recognis
[normal]ed education accreditation and integration of the economic community in 2015.
