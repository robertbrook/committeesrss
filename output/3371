defaultSave the Children is the world’s independent children’s rights organisation, working in more than 120 countries. We save children's lives. We fight for their rights. We help them fulfil their potential.
defaultWe have been operating in Burma since 1995
default, and we 
defaultwork 
defaulton the ground 
defaultwith DFID. Our work there spans multiple sectors, including education, protection, child rights governance, health, nutrition and humanitarian response. 
defaultIn 2012, we
default reached 3.9m beneficiaries through programmes worth £22m. 
defaultWe currently deploy 
defaultstaff in 31 sub-offices spanning six regions and four states. 
defaultSave the Children
default can offer field-based evidence from our research, programme ex
defaultperience and local partners to inform the IDC’s inquiry.
defaultWe have focused our submission on the following four issues:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoverty, discrimination and child rights violationsdefault: 
defaultInsufficient government investments in health, education, social welfare and social protection compound family poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services which lead to daily violations of children’s rights to survival, development, protection and participation. Discrimination based on ethnicity, language, religion, income, location, gender, disability and other diversity factors further contribute to child rights violations. 
defaultEach year, around 56,000 children under five die from preventable diseases in 
defaultBurma
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernancedefault: 
defaultConstitutional and legal framework -
default The Government of 
defaultBurma (GoB
default) has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), CEDAW, CRPD, the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2008. However, the CRC does not have constitutional status in 
defaultBurma
default, thus national laws and regulations override the CRC in court. This is elaborated further under Section 4, below.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEducationdefault: At the global level, DFID has committed to the education MDGs. Studies demonstrate that education underpins progress in all aspects of development. Yet 
defaultin 
defaultBurma
default, d
defaultecades of chronic under-funding of education have resulted in poor infrastructure and facilities, lack of effective teacher training and learning materials and teaching methods that do not enable 
defaultchildren to engage actively in learning. 
defaultThe primary school completion rate is 54% overall and only 31% from the poorest households.
defaultEducation is a minor priority in DFID-B’s Operational Plan, amounting to just 5.4% of the progr
defaultamme spend forecast for 2011-15.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEducation
default is also a powerful driver of 
defaultsocial cohesiondefault. 
defaultWithin the education sector, the issue of language of instruction raises questions about the relationship between education and national identity. By developing curricula and teaching materials in the refugee camps, international donors have supported the development of a Karen education regime very different to that in government schools, and increased the isolation 
defaultof 
defaultthese populations.
default&#xa0;
default1
default.5
default defaultSocial Protection: defaultArticles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) define the rights of men and women to social protection. With an estimated 29% of the rural population living in poverty
default, there are many 
defaultBurmese
default people whose rights are not being met. 
defaultStudies show that by enabling poor people to invest in and develop their own production and access a nutritious diet, social transfers can lead to sustainable reductions in poverty and hunger, as well as boosting economic growth
default. 
defaultSocial protection has the potential to accelerate national growth and development by increasing productive potential and demand in local markets.
default1
default.6
default default              defaultNutritiondefault: 
defaultIn Burma, the nationwide prevalence of stunting is 35.1% and wasting is 7.9%
default,
default indicative of a serious public health problem by WHO classification. Burma
default is among the “24 high-burden countries” with the largest number of children under 5 years old who are moderately or severely stunted
default. Approximately 22.6% of all children under five are underweight. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default.7
default              
defaultThe protracted rates of under-nutrition in 
defaultBurma
default are the consequence of chronic food and nutrition insecurity, under-investment in rural development, poor health and public infrastructure, remoteness and extreme weather events. The situation is compounded in border areas by conflict and complex issues surrounding minority groups. This limits the ability of many households to access sufficient levels of nutritious food and income as 
defaultwell as basic services such as clean water, health and education. 
defaultSocial protection policies, and in particular cash transfers, allow families to meet the direct and indirect costs of a nutritious diet, healthcare and education.
default&#xa0;
default1
default.8  The main sectoral aid programmes on health (3MDG), education (MDEF/MEC) and livelihoods (LIFT) currently ignore nutrition. DFID is currently the largest contributor to the multi-
defaultdonor fund, 
defaultLivelihoods and Food Security Trust (
defaultLIFT), which is the most significant ODA initiati
defaultve on 
defaultlivelihoods 
defaultin 
defaultBurma
default. However, this fund doesn’t currently support nutrition or social protection, despite this being articulated in the LIFT strategy
default.

default1default.9 Recommendationdefaultsdefault default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the Cyclone Nargis disaster in 2008, international assistance has gradually evolved away from largely humanitarian interventions to focus on longer-term development work. 
defaultWith the lifting of sanctions, t
defaulthe number of sectors in which donors engage has expanded and there is more engagement with the administration. 
defaultEvery aid agency in the world is planning to initiate or
default 
defaultexpand operations in 
defaultBurma
default and the 
defaultGoB
default’s capacity to engage meaningfully is drastically overstretched.
default This undermines effective coordination and sustainability of the 
defaultdevelopment investments. However, DFID’s Operational Plan indicates that 
defaultno bilateral aid will be provided through central government systems, other than at the township level. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Partnership Group for Aid Effectiveness of around 20 bilateral development partners offers a mechanism for promoting principles of aid effectiveness. Other mechanisms exist, such as the 
defaulthumanitarian clusters, 
defaultCountry Coordination Mechanism (CCM) for health, the joint-programming between EuropeAid &amp; EU bilaterals, etc. INGOs and local civil society play relatively modest roles in these and Government even less. However, t
defaulthe Government-led Framework on Economic and Social Reforms (FESR, December 2012) and
default National Comprehensive Development Plan (NCDP) 
defaultprocesses 
defaulthave established a structure for 
defaultGoB
default and development partners to harmonise efforts through Sector Working Groups. The value of civil society, private sector and other non-state actors’ perspectives w
defaultithin this framework is recognis
defaulted in the Government rhetoric, but has been deferred until the structure has bedded down. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultDFID has invested significantly in multi-donor trust funds such as 3MDG, LIFT, MEC. These seem to have been effec
defaulttive mechanisms for harmonis
defaulting donor investments and now offer overstretched Ministries an efficient platform for engagement with the multitude of development partners. However, the MDTFs currently operate outside the 
defaultGoB
default’s new coordination structure. 
defaultFurthermore, by outsourcing fund management of these multi-donor funds, DFID and their partners have reduced speed &amp; flexibility in decision-making and increased transaction costs. 
default2.4 defaultRecommendations default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default3.  defaultHow effectively is DFID addressing governance and public financial management issues in its sectoral programmes (eg on health, education &amp; livelihoods)? default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of political will and insufficient investments in children: default 
defaultWhile 
defaultBurma
default has had a Child Law since 1993 and a National Plan of Action for Children 2006-15, political commitment and resources to effectively implement and monitor the law and National Plan of Action have been lacking. The Department of Social Welfare (DSW) is a focal point for child rights but is significantly under-resourced, is relatively weak in relation to other ministries and thus has struggled to activate the National Child Rights Committee (designated in the Child Law) which would enable inter-ministerial co-ordination for improved planning and budgeting for child rights. Spending in the social sector is very low: health and education combined for 1.5 per cent of GDP between 2000 and 2007. DSW received less than 0.02% of the budget
default. DSW officials/ social workers are not available within townships
default and Township Child Rights Committees have no budget. 
default&#xa0;
default3
default.2 
defaultQuality of governance, planning and budgeting processesdefault: 
defaultThe Framework on Economic and Social Reforms (2012) and
default National Comprehensive Development Plan 
defaultprocesses provide crucial opportunities to influence budget allocations for children and support for civil society and children’s participation in planning and budgeting processes.  However, while rhetoric for a ‘people centred development’ is articulated at the central level, hesitancy remains among many officials at state and regional levels. Moreover, 90% of the budget remains centralised. 
defaultThe election and existence of parliamentarians from diverse constituencies provides a real change to the political environment in 
defaultBurma
default, and a genuine opportunity for engagement with parliamentarians to lobby for law reform, plans and budgets to increase child rights. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3default&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations default&#xa0;default4default.  What role should DFID play in helping to resolve ethnic tensions?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite progress
default towards peace, conflict in Kachin and elsewhere continues, and the ethnic and religious violence in Rakhine State underscores the fragility of peace. A
defaultpproximately 400,000 people are displaced inside 
defaultBurma
default and another 130,000 refugees are in camps and 2 million low-skilled 
defaultBurma
default migrants in Thailand. Recent estimates indicate that 59% of IDPs and surrounding communities are impoverished.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe scenarios for the displaced Rohingya are unclear and seem likely to become medium-long term challenges, in need of mediation from neutral actors. 
defaultRecent studies 
defaultconducted by Oxfam and Save the Children in conflict-affected areas of Rakhine State indicate asset depletion and growing needs for livelihood support.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.3 The coordination of potential (non-refugee) migrant return and resettlement is
default recognis
defaulted but has been inconsistently coordinated. Population mobility for work both inside 
defaultBurma
default and within the region may possibly increase unless the economy improves, particularly in historically under-served rural and ethnic areas. 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.4 Within the education sector, the issue of language of instruction raises questions about the relationship between education and national identity. By developing curricula and teaching materials in the refugee camps, international donors have supported the development of a Karen nationalist education regime very different to that in government schools. By contrast, ASEAN has set
default a goal of a regionally recognis
defaulted education accreditation and integration of the economic community in 2015.
