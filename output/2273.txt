[[[National Federation of Gypsy Liaison Groups]]]

[[[ – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;The National Federation is a Company Limited by Guarantee registered in England and Wales. Company No: 69 83027. Registered Charity No: 1136730. The National Federation undertakes capacity building for our communities but our main work within the office is in relation to planning consultation, local, regional and national. We have Gypsy and Traveller groups affiliated with us from across all the regions and Wales.&#xa0;We are extremely concerned in regard to the Deregulation Bill and especially in respect to clause 21 of the Bill which proposes to remove the power of ministers to require local authorities in England to prepare local housing strategies under Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (including the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers).&#xa0; &#xa0;(1) Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (which confers powers on the Secretary of State, in relation to England and the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, to require local housing authorities to have housing strategies and to prepare housing statements) ceases to have effect in relation to England.&#xa0;Historically the needs of Gypsy and Traveller people have not been assessed until relatively recently, when it became law that all Gypsy and Traveller accommodation needs should be assessed. (Brought about by the Housing Act 2004 s225). We think it is very important to build on the information that we now have (The first assessments took place around 07/08). &#xa0;We have a Planning Policy officer based here at the offices who undertakes consultation on district and borough council policies across the East and West Midlands in relation to their planning policy for Gypsy and Traveller communities including Showmen. The Government’s current planning policy, Planning policy for traveller sites, states that every local authority should already have in place a five year deliverable supply of sites.  However, virtually no local authorities have such a policy in place within their Local Plan.&#xa0;When we have resources, we also look at other areas and it is plain to see that without the five year supply, and assessment of need we are not going to eat into the 14% of families who do not have a legal home without positive promotion for accommodation.&#xa0;There has been allot of hard work undertaken across the country to tackle the under provision of sites by Gypsy and Traveller groups including Showmen, agencies and authorities and we do consider that this would be a very retrograde step and not a useful one. It does nothing to assist longterm good community relations and accommodation for all. We consider that it would be in contradiction to a useful overall future Romany Gypsy Traveller strategy, which Member States should have in place. &#xa0;We would also like to highlight how are we going to assist need within other areas such as social need as a whole for the whole population if you do not assess?&#xa0;We hope that this proposal will be withdrawn in full and we are in full agreement with CLP, ITMb &amp; FFT submissions also made to you on this subject.&#xa0;22 September 2013&#xa0; DCLG Caravan Count January 2013 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/199237/Statistical_release_Gypsy_and_Traveller_caravan_count_-_Jan_2013.pdf&#xa0;  5.4.2011 The European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020.There have been numerous  calls for Member States to implement strategies to improve social , economic and living conditions of the Roma (including Gypsies and Travellers) European  Commission Brussels 23rd May 2012
