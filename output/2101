[normal]Gambling Commission[bold] – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]The Gambling Commission (the Commission) welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Deregulation Bill. The Commission’s submission is solely in relation to the sections relating to non-economic regulators and the exercise of their functions.

[normal]The conditions for economic growth (in the gambling industry) require public confidence in our role as an independent regulator. Fundamental to public confidence, and therefore growth, is that the regulator is, and is seen to be, wholly independent, impartial and objective. While we do not believe the current wording of the draft legislation should impair our objectivity, there is a risk that the concept of the desirability of economic growth becomes confused or 
[normal]conflated with the promotion of the commercial interests of specific economic sectors. If it appears to the public that it is any part of the Commission’s role to promote the industry - as opposed to permitting the industry to promote itself and grow so far as is compatible with consumer protection, the likely outcome is a reduction in public confidence and a consequent reduction in the public acceptance of gambling as a main stream leisure

[normal]Should the manner in which economic growth is supported under section 58 be prescribed any further there is a risk that this would constrain flexibility to modify our approach according to the size and type of business, resulting in the stated objectives not being met. Any attempt to be prescriptive about how to implement section 58 would seem to require quite complex guidance which would need to address size, scale, 
[normal]geography
[normal] and business type.

[normal]Specification could also inhibit our ability to ‘nip in the bud’ or move rapidly to deter operators from introducing products or behaving in ways that could harm consumers. In other words attempting to enshrine the principles in section 58 in process risks reducing our ability to act flexibly when we identify novel and contentious regulatory issues.   In turn this risks both the continued prosperity of compliant responsible operators undercut by sharp practice and also undermining public confidence in the industry

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Any accompanying guidance to the growth duty will be important. It is absolutely right, and helps develop better policy, for the industry to have a real input into determining the economic impact of any regulatory change; to be clear how that should be done; and to have some assurance their views are taken into account. But the reform measure designed to reduce burdens on industry and foster economic growth may have the unintended consequence of regulator and parts of industry expending time and money on unproductive and costly delaying tactics if the guidance does not encourage speedy and transparent decision making with the least possible procedural overhead. Otherwise the less responsible or competing 
[normal]sectoral
[normal] interests may be tempted to use it as a tool to block or delay changes in regulation which is essential to protect the public, for example blocking a loophole or dealing with an emerging problem. 
[normal](e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In our view transparent decision making following genuine consultation to expose the issues involved, combined with the improved impact assessment for major changes proposed in the parallel ARI proposals and a better understanding of how growth is best fostered are sufficient to achieve the objectives Government has set.
