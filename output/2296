[normal]              
[normal]We do not agree with the introduction of a residence test for foreign national prisoners or immigration detainees. Immigration detainees should be funded to challenge the lawfulness of their detention regardless of their ties to the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. In our immigration 
[normal]removal centre
[normal] (IRC)
[normal] inspections we 
[normal]repeatedly
[normal] 
[normal]find detainees held for years at a time.
[normal] S
[normal]everal have successfully challenged the lawfulness of their 
[normal]detention
[normal] using
[normal] legal aid. Removing the right to legal aid for such individuals 
[normal]may 
[normal]increase the likelihood
[normal] that
[normal] these cases will remain unresolved
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The 2011 Independent Monitoring Board annual report of 
[normal]Harmondsworth
[normal] 
[normal]raised significant concerns relating to the treatment of detainees suffering from mental health issues. Since 2011
[normal],
[normal] the High Court has fou
[normal]nd in favour of four individuals who have brought cases against the 
[normal]UK Border Agency
[normal]. The court found 
[normal]inter alia
[normal] that the defendants had been falsely imprisoned and subject to inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of their Article 3 rights under the
[normal] European Convention on Human Rights. The introduction of a residency test makes it le
[normal]ss likely that this type of ill-
[normal]treatment will come to the attention of the courts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]6
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Taking all this evidence into consideration, we 
[normal]consider
[normal] that the residence test
[normal] should not be introduced in civil legal aid cases
[normal] to individuals who are detained
[normal]. While the test would apply to 
[normal]UK
[normal] residents, its impact would disproportionately affect foreign nationals and therefore be discriminatory. 
[normal]In 
[normal]this way, the proposals undermi
[normal]ne the principle of equity in 
[normal]access to legal aid, 
[normal]which requires special measures to be taken to 
[normal]ensure meaningful access to legal aid for “
[normal]stateless persons, asylum seekers, foreign citizens, migrants and migrant workers, refugees and internally displace
[normal]d persons
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal] We are concerned at the proposed changes which 
[normal]will: restrict access to justice for vulnerable immigration detainees; 
[normal]remove funds for 
[normal]mentally ill detainees to challenge the lawfulness of their detention; and 
[normal]not assist 
[normal]failed asylum seekers 
[normal]with further representations
[normal].

[normal]              [bold]The [bold]G[bold]overnment’s response[bold]              [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]27. 
[normal]              
[normal]In its reply to our response the government argued
[normal] that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]‘HMIP’s annual report contains a comparison of survey scores of prisoners who consider themselves to have a disability and those who do not; these data include prisoners with a physical disability as well as those with mental health issues and/or learning 
[normal]disabilities. HMIP’s 2011-12 Annual Report (latest available) indicates the following: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q. Is it easy to get a complaints [bold]form[bold]? [bold]Disabled – 82% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 83% Yes 
[normal]Q. Have you made a complaint? [bold]Disabled – 55% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 46% Yes 
[normal]Q. Is t[bold]here a member of staff in this prison that you can turn to for help if you have a problem? [bold]Disabled – 76% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 75% Yes 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]We acknowledge that HMIP’s response to the consultation contained data indicating that prisoners with mental health is
[normal]sues and/or learning disabilities (as well as prisoners generally) did not have confidence in the complaints system and that outcomes were poor. However, the information from the 2011-12 Annual Report referred to above suggests a different picture in terms
[normal] of accessibility, willingness to use the system and the potential for reasonable adjustments to be made when comparing disabled and non-disabled prisoners. Although respondents had concerns around potential impacts on these prisoners we consider the proce
[normal]sses set out in PSI 02/2012 (Prisoner complaints), PSI 32/2011 (Ensuring equality) and 75/2011 (Residential services) are sufficient to 
[normal]ensure they are able to make effective use of the complaints system and access the other alternative means of redress.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28. 
[normal]The figures quoted by the 
[normal]Government
[normal] are 
[normal]incorrect
[normal].  The actual 
[normal]figures
[normal] used in the 
[normal]2011/12 
[normal]annual report can be found below:
[normal]              
[normal]Q. Is it easy to get a complaints [bold]form[bold]? [bold]Disabled – 
[normal]79
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 81
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Q. Have you made a complaint? [bold]Disabled – 54
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 46% Yes 
[normal]Q. Is there a member of staff in this prison that you can turn to for help if you have a problem? [bold]Disabled – 71
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 7
[normal]2
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29. 
[normal]In the first and second questions 
[normal]those who 
[normal]consider 
[normal]themselves 
[normal]as disabled found it significantly
[normal] 
[normal]more difficult to get a complaints form and make a complaint, than
[normal] prisoners who do not consider themselves disabled. 
[normal]The third 
[normal]question shows
[normal] 
[normal]that there is 
[normal]no significant
[normal] d
[normal]ifference
[normal] between those that consider themselve
[normal]s to have a disability and those that do not.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal]              
[normal]O
[normal]ur inspection 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]continually indicates
[normal] that these groups of 
[normal]prisoners (as well as prisoners more generally)
[normal] do not have 
[normal]confidence
[normal] in the complaints system. Data in our 13/14 annual report, which is
[normal] unpublished, found that
[normal] responses from prisoners that considered themselves to have a disability were significantly worse than responses from their non-disabled counterparts. . 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal].
[normal] [bold]Q. [bold]For those [bold]who have made a complaint, do you feel complaints are [bold]dealt [bold]with[bold] fairly?[bold]Disabled – 
[normal]32
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 40
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Q. [bold]For those[bold] who have made a complaint, do you feel complaints are [bold]dealt with[bold] [bold]promptly? [bold] [bold]Disabled – 38
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Non-disab
[normal]led – 42
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Q. [bold]Have you ever been prevented from making a complaint when you [bold]wanted to[bold]? [bold]Disabled – 21
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]Non-disabled – 15
[normal]% Yes 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31. 
[normal]The
[normal] government’s reply also raised the possibility of this inspectorate conducting a thematic inspection of the prison complaints system.  We would be open to discussing whether and how this sho
[normal]uld be progressed.

[normal] Statistical significance is a way of estimating the likelihood that a difference between two samples indicates a rea
[normal]l difference between populations from which the samples are taken, rather than being due to chance. 
[normal]The significance level is set at 0.05, which means that there is only a 5% chance that the difference in results is due to chance.
