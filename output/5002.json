"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Rabbis for Human Rights&#xa0;&#xa0;One Page \nSummary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAbout Rabbis for Human Rights Founded in 1988, Rabbis for Human Rights is the only rabbinic voice in Israel that is explicitly dedicated to human rights.  Representing 100 Israeli rabbis and rabbinical students from different streams of Judaism, we \nderive our authority from our Jewish \ntradition and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   Our mission is to inform the Israeli public about human rights violations, and to pressure the State institutions to redress these injustices.  In a time in which a nationalist and isolationist und\nerstanding of Jewish tradition is heard frequently and loudly, Rabbis for Human Rights give expression to the traditional Jewish responsibility for the safety and welfare of the stranger, the different and the weak, the convert, the widow and the orphan.\n RHR works primarily in fields where we think our rabbinic voice will be most effective: \n&#xa0;Human Rights Work in the Occupied Territories&#xa0;Olive Tree Campaign: RHR \nworks year round with Palestinian farmers from several dozen villages in the Occupied Territor\nies, to ensure that they can regularly access their agricultural lands, often denied to them because of their proximity to Israeli settlements.  We negotiate and coordinate with the army to ensure the High Court mandate military protection during the olive\n harvest, and to ensure access to lands when denied.  We also bring hundreds of Israeli and international volunteers to work side by side and in solidarity with Palestinians during the olive harvest, who help provide protection against possible settler int\nimidation.  We also track Israeli settler acts of damage of Palestinian trees and property, and monitor the state response.  During Tu B’shvat\n (the Israeli New Year for trees)\n, we purchase and bring hundreds of Israeli and international volunteers together\n with Palestinians to plant some \n3,000\n olive trees in areas where settlers have cut, uprooted and/or burned trees in acts of vandalism and arson.  \n&#xa0;Challenging Land Confiscation in the Occupied Territories: RHR works to legally prevent or reverse the take\nover of Palestinian lands in Area C, and ensure that Palestinian farmers can safely access those lands.  We started working in villages in the South Hebron Hills\n in 2005\n, and in the past year, we have expanded to the villages around Bethlehem as well as to\n a few villages in the Northern West Bank. In the coming year, we will continue to monitor the implementation of previous rulings on land access issues, and currently are working on 20\n3\n open cases relating to land confiscation and criminal charges and comp\nlaints lodged by Palestinian farmers against settlement security personnel.  \n&#xa0;\nProtecting and Promoting Human Rights in the Occupied Territories:  Faith and Interfaith Initiatives through Legal and Field work.&#xa0;&#xa0;1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRabbis for Human Rights \nwork\ns\n in the Occupied Territories \nin two major areas:\n \nL\negal work against land takeovers and land encroachment in the West Bank and South Hebron Hills\n and\n \nfield w\nork in the Occupied Territories\n. \nOur strategy of direct protection, accompanied by legal advocacy, grass roots mobilization and powerful media campaigns allow\ns\n us to help defend and protect universal human rights. It is RHR’s goal to promote peace and contribute to reduced levels of dest\nr\nuctive and violent conflict\n. \n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRHR’s legal project, field work and advocacy \nwork \nwill focus\nes\n on two clearly defined goals:\n&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legal department, currently comprised of four full-time lawye\nrs, three field workers and an expert consultant, has grown to become among the most important tools in RHR’s struggle against land takeovers in the Occupied Territories. The last few years have seen \nsuccesses\n in precedent setting cases in which we have ma\nnaged\n \nto \nreturn lands to Palestinian owners\n. We are still \nadjudicating several potentially precedent-setting cases dealing with settler land takeovers and discriminatory planning leading to \nthe ongoing threat of \nhome demolitions.  \nDespite these successes, \nRHR is \nstill\n deal\ning\n with\n the \ndaily \nstruggle\n of the Occupation - creeping annexation, displacement, settler violence, and State-backed restrictions withholding basic living conditions from many Palestinians. RHR's lawyers work to thwart displacement of Pal\nestinians by preventing encroachment and expropriation of privately owned Palestinian lands, protecting farmers’ rights to access their lands, supporting the field work of our partner organizations and our own field department, and demanding better enforce\nment of existing laws that do protect Palestinians’ rights.\n \nMost of legal work is concentrated in the South Hebron Hills, but we do \nwork \non specific cases \nthroughout the Occupied Territories\n. \nIt is RHR’s goal to\n continue to\n expand our work\n geographically\n and apply our successes to all of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. \nExpansion of legal cases will continue into the Hebron district and Bethlehem regions, where, in the last two years, we have taken on several cases of land encroachment and takeovers\n \nwith much \nsuccess\n. \nRHR is currently the only organization working in the Bethlehem / Hebron district in representing land owners. \n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRHR’s legal department focuses on cases at three strategic levels:\n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile working on the \n208\n open cases, our lawyers continue to s\nubmit formal appeals to the Civil Administration\n as well as s\nubmit administrative appeals to the Israeli High Court \nof Justice.\n \nThe legal team has begun \nto focus increased effort\ns\n on \nnew cases dealing the actions of security personnel funded by settlement communities. In many instances of land access prevention, these security personnel violate both civil law and the ri\nghts of the Palestinian landowners by operating as private security guards, threatening farmers and using violence to forcibly remove Palestinians who come to farm their agricultural lands. RHR \nbelieves \nthat deal\ning\n with this issue w\nill\n increase awareness \nas to the violations taking place on the ground\n and highlight the cooperation taking place between these security personnel and the army. \n  \n&#xa0;\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur legal team works to\n:\n&#xa0;\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur Media team work\ns\n to ensure that \nour\n legal success stories are published in the \nlocal and international press\n. We plan \nto\n continue using\n \nnew media forums \nto \nincrease the level of dialogue on human rights issues amongst the Israeli public. \nThis \ns\nerve\ns\n to highlight the human rights violations taking place and increase pressure on the Government to redress them. \n&#xa0;\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitoring progress and evidence in each case is critical to our work in the Israeli courts and in submitting complaints and appeals to the Civil Administration, the army and the police. \nTo this end, t\nhe legal department puts great emphasis on tabulation o\nf cases of human rights violations, actions taken in each case, and follow up actions required.  Detailed tables are kept by RHR lawyers of the successes (or progress) and impact of each and every case.  Two critical components are used to support this wor\nk and assist in monitoring the progress with each case:\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur best tool for the evaluation of the legal work is the success \nin guaranteeing farmers access to their lands, \nreturning lands to their owners and the halting of land encroachment. \nThe number of \nnew \nand ongoing \ncases \nmeasures our effectiveness and success. More and more land owners approach us based on these success\nes\n.\n \nOver the last decade, RHR has succeeded in cha\nnging the status quo\n. We have \nguaranteed Palestinian farmers safe access to their agricultural lands and water sources by \nbuilding and maintaining grassroots contacts with local Palestinian villagers, \nrefining our coordination efforts with the Israeli Defe\nnse forces and relying on the contingent of Israeli and international volunteers who accompany farmers to their lands throughout the year. \n&#xa0;\n10)\n&#xa0; \nOur \nlandmark High Court victory in 2006\n \nstated that \nthe Israeli security forces are obliged to ensure that farmers are able to access their lands without harassment and intimidation. \nIn reality, Palestinian landowners in Area C are still intimidated, harassed and prevented from accessing their lands. Radica\nl settlers use violence and provocation to prevent farmers from being able to reach their lands. \nIt is \nRHR’s presence in the field \nwhich \nensures that the security forces are indeed fulfilling their responsibilities to protect farmers.  \nR\nadical settlers are\n often discouraged from attacking small groups of farmers and their families\n when we are there to protect them\n. Documenting incidents of harassment and violence and using the media to publicize these events\n puts increasing pressure on the security forces t\no carry out their court mandated job. \n&#xa0;\n11)\n&#xa0; \nIt is essential that RHR continues its work of guaranteeing Palestinian farmers access to their property\n. \nLetting lands lie fallow leads to their takeover\n either by settlers from settlements adjacent to these lands o\nr by the State\n. Ottoman law, still \napplicable\n in Area C, states that uninterrupted cultivation of land for a period of ten years, without objections from any party, grants the farmer rights to the land. In absence of such rights, the land reverts to the \nS\nt\nate. \nIt is critical, therefore, that l\nandowners continue \nto \nwork their lands not only to allow them to continue to subsist from their produce, but to ensure its ongoing ownership. \n&#xa0;\n12)\n&#xa0; \nIn addition to the importance of our presence in the field, RHR plant\ns\n \nabout \n3\n,000 \nsaplings \nduring the planting season in the fall/winter on lands in danger of being taken over or where trees have been destroyed \nin “price tag” attacks \nor on lands our legal team is fighting to return to its owners. These endangered lands are a\nlmost always located near politically radical settlements or illegal outposts or fall between the Green Line and the Separation Barrier throughout areas of the West Bank. Our legal staff and field staff work hand in hand in enabling \nthese planting activiti\nes to go ahead. \n&#xa0;\n13)\n&#xa0; \nThe highlight of our annual activities is the Olive Tree Campaign which takes place \nin the fall each year. RHR OT and field staff and tens of volunteers accompany farmers to their lands to assist in picking olives. \nDuring the Olive Tree C\nampaign, w\ne coordinate with security forces throughout the West Bank in order to allow the farmers to access their lands. We have seen increased willingness of security forces to coordinate olive harvest days with us\n, but w\ne need to be vigilant in ensuring\n that sufficient days are provided for harvesting, planting and plowing. Our presence in the field facilitates constant monitoring and immediate reaction on the part of our legal team, particularly when violence erupts. \n&#xa0;\n14)\n&#xa0; \nWe put a great deal of effort into\n document\ning\n and report\ning\n the incidents of vandalism, violence and inaction by local military and police units, sharing this information with the DCO, police national command, army legal advisors office, regional commanders, the media, concerned foreign d\nelegations and international organizations in an effort to advocate for change. We demand increased efforts on the part of the responsible Israeli authorities to enforce the right to security of person and property for all civilians in the areas of continu\ning Israeli military rule until there is a political solution to the situation, not only during the Palestinian olive harvest season but throughout the year\n. \nOur media team work\ns\n to draw media attention to the violations taking place\n and publish\nes\n stories \nof attacks on farmers. \n&#xa0;\n15)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProject \nevaluation\n methods are designed into all of RHR’s projects. \nDepartment heads are tasked with evaluating their projects on an ongoing basis, getting feedback from staff, project participants and the target populations \nthemselves. W\nhen necessary we adjust programs midstream in order to sharpen the focus of our work, ultimately making the program more effective. \n&#xa0;\n16)\n&#xa0; \nOur senior managerial staff, legal staff, field team and media team work hand in hand and support each other's work through transfer of information, joint cooperation and monitoring and documenting the impact of our work. \nRHR is expanding its capacity in t\nhe traditional media as well as in online new-media. \nO\nur public education efforts through traditional media and new media \nare\n essential to change perspectives and many basic assumptions within Israeli society. \nOur media team \na\nssess\nes\n the degree of success \nin quantity and effectiveness of media coverage of the legal work, agricultural work and\n Jahalin\n project in general and framing of the issue among the Israeli public and political leaders specifically as one of Jewish and democratic legal values.\n \n&#xa0;\n17)\n&#xa0; \nDue to \nthe volatile nature of the context of RHR’s work, there are inherent challenges in ensuring successes are permanent and sustainable. Even where legal precedents are set, often counter legal advocacy overturns successful outcomes\n and the\n implementation of rulings \nneeds to be monitored\n. \nOur work on land issues addresses the most intractable and challenging issue at the source of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thereby, new challenges will always have to be addressed as they appear. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhile dealing with issues of land takeovers, demolitions and expulsions RHR’s focus is changing the status quo – challenging the\n root causes of human rights violations\n.\n \nT\nhere is a risk that some forms of legal assistance only combat the symptoms of violat\nions rather than their causes. \nIn order to address this challenge, \nRHR’s legal department \nattempts to \nchallenge the underlying system\n \nthrough strategic litigation\n,\n focusing on precedent settin\ng cases that if successful, could\n impact the lives of landowners\n,\n if not throughout the OPT, at least in Area C. \n&#xa0;\n"
