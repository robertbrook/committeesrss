"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCS27)Executive Summary\nThe CCSA\n welcomes this inquiry. The development of \na vibrant \nCCS\n industry \nis\n critically important\n \nfor \nUK\n climate\n, energy and industrial policy\n. However, the deployment of CCS in the UK is \nfacing \na number of challenges. This\n submission sets out the \nCCSA’s views on the \ncurrent status of the technology\n,\n the challenges impacting on de\nployment and makes a number of recommendations on how CCS can be\n progressed\n. The CCSA would like to emphasise the following points;  \nIntroduction \n&#xa0;\nCCS \nTechnology\n&#xa0;\nThe CCS Cost Reduction Task Force \n“\nUK gas and coal power stations equipped with carbon capture, transport and storage have clear potential to be cost competitive with other forms of low-carbon power generation, \ndelivering electricity at a levelised cost approaching £100/MWh by the early 2020s, and at a cost significantly below £100/MWh soon thereafter.”\nThe Task Force found that there are multiple opportunities to reduce the costs of UK CCS projects based on \ncurrent technologies.\n \nThese cost reductions largel\ny occur as a result of local effects, e.g. shared infrastructure, and are not \nsolely \ndependent on global market developments. \nCCS \ncost reduction opportunities can be grouped into four key \nareas \n(Figure 1);\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1, C\nos\nt \nR\neduction \nT\nask \nF\norce CCS cost reduction trajectory\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Task Force identified a number of actions that are needed in order to deliver these cost reductions\n. The \nelectricity \nmarket alone cannot deliver these cost reductions and a number of interventions are required by Government if \na cost competitive CCS industry is \nto \nbe \ndelivered \nin \nthe UK.   \n&#xa0;\nS\ntatus of CCS worldwide\n \n&#xa0;\nCCS in the UK\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProgressing CCS in the UK \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInternational CCS\n&#xa0;\nThe view expressed in this paper cannot be taken to represent the views of all members of the CCSA. However, they do reflect a general consensus within the Association.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/201021/CCS_Cost_Reduction_Taskforce_-_Final_Report_-_May_2013.pdf\n \nhttp://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/sites/default/files/publications/85741/global-status-ccs-january-2013-update.pdf\n \nhttp://www.globalccsinstitute.com/location/ccs-china\n&#xa0;\n"
