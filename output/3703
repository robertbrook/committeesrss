default5)  defaultHow will HS2 bridge the north-south divide and defaultdrive growth?default&#xa0;
default51m understands that to truly narrow the north-south divide requires significant growth and job creation in the north that not only matches but surpasses that experienced in the south.  HS2 Ltd has done nothing to date to narrow that divide 
defaultwith more than 98% of jobs created in London, and the remaining 1.3% in Birmingham.  Of the 557 jobs at HS2 Ltd, 550 are based in London and just 
defaultseven
default in Birmingham.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe figures were disclosed by Transport Minister Robert Goodwill, in response to a quest
defaultion from Perry Barr MP Khalid Mahmood.  Mr Mahmood commented that these figures were “absolutely disgraceful” and that the 
default“The government needs to get its act together. Rather than blaming everyone else for not supporting it, they need to ensure the jobs 
defaultare distributed across the country and particularly in Birmingham and Manchester.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government’s appointment of Sir David Higgins to replicate the success of the Olympics is also a concern to 51m, since one legacy aspect that is rarely shared is the f
defaulturther widening of the north-south divide.  A BBC report
default 
defaultidentified that the economic benefits of the Games were far from fairly distributed with a large 
defaultgeographic disparity across the UK
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment figures state that £2.5

defaultn of addition
defaultal foreign
default direct investment has
default been secured since the Games, 
defaultleading to the creation of 
default31,000 new jobs.
default  London 
defaultand the south-east of England 
defaultgained 
defaultnearly 15,000 additional jobs, 
defaultbut only 
defaultseven were created in the North East.
default  Both examples seem to further reinf
defaultorce John Tomaney’s research, that the biggest winner from HS2 will be London and the south-east.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6)  defaultWhat is our track record in infrastructure delivery?default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment claims that HS2 will be built on time and within budget are also worthy of detailed 
defaultscrutiny.  The consultants and engineers employed by HS2 Ltd are already £11 million over budget
default and with Royal Assent given to the Paving Bill, what assurances can Sir 
defaultDavid Higgins, the Department for Transport, or the Secretary of State give that the p
defaultroject will be completed at a cost of no more than £50 billion?  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
default51m recognises that the country needs 
defaultinvestment in infrastructure, but 
defaultcontinues to believe
default 
defaultthere are better projects that can be delivered quickly, at less cost, and with 
defaultbetter returns.
default  It is not against growth and jobs but believes in a more balanced
default investment strategy, where every part of the country reap
defaults
default the rewards.  
default&#xa0;
default51m trusts that this 
defaultsupplementary 
defaultsubmission will help 
defaultfurther 
defaultinform the Select Committee and wo
defaultuld be happy 
defaultto provide any further information in support of its case.
