"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Mining Association of the United KingdomThe Mining Association of the United Kingdom welcomes this opportunity to submit written evidence to the enquiry.\nThe Mining Association of the United Kingdom, which was founded in 1946, represents the non-energy underground mining sector.  Its members extract Potash, Gypsum, Rock Salt, \nBarytes\n and Fluorspar.  The last of these, Fluorspar is on the EU critical minerals list and \nBarytes\n should be included in the next list.\nIt should be made clear from the outset that there are two distinct extractive industry sectors in the UK.  Firstly there are the companies, which extract minerals in the UK and unfortunately most of these are foreign owned and not UK listed.  This group also includes small private companies. These will be referred to below as ‘The UK Minerals Industry’. The other sector is commonly referred to as the major mining houses.  These companies only have corporate offices in the UK and do not have any extractive operations in the UK or the EU.  In the majority of cases, they are not British companies.  These companies have UK offices and are listed on the stock exchange &amp; AIM because London is seen as the mining investment centre of the world as well as the commodity centre.  In addition there are a number of consultancies which specialise in the extractive sector and have a global reputation.\n1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? The UK Minerals Industry typically produces about 350 million tonnes of minerals per annum, directly contributes over £10 billion a year to the economy\n.\nThe Government publication ‘Resource Security Action Plan’ stated ‘It is essential that there is an adequate and steady supply of raw materials for infrastructure, buildings and goods that society, industry and the economy need’.\nIt is not just the contribution to the total UK economy that is important.  Minerals occur where they occur.  Invariably these are rural areas and sometimes in areas of natural beauty.  Therefore extractive industries are important for rural economies and employment.  Two examples of this are Cleveland Potash and York Potash in North Yorkshire.  Potash is an important fertiliser for agriculture.  As the global population grows so will agriculture.  In addition it is used in glass-making, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore there is an increasing demand for potash which is seen as becoming the industrial mineral equivalent of gold and become a globally traded mineral.  Other major sources of the mineral are Canada, Germany &amp; Russia.  However both Cleveland Potash and the proposed York Potash mine are sources of \npolyhalite\n, which is seen as having benefits over potash.  Cleveland Potash contributes to the UK economy by selling a large proportion of its production overseas and thereby bringing in foreign income, whilst the proposed York Potash operation is expected to sell most of its product overseas.  Cleveland Potash supports the local rural economy by using many local small suppliers and service companies.  York Potash mission statement is to do the same.\nAnother example is the \nHemerdon\n Mine development in Devon.  This mine will produce 4% of the world’s tungsten.  Again bring economic benefits and employment to the South West. \n2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow does the UK based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDoes UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive industries i.e. In sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?It\n is not clear whether sales of machinery benefit from the UK as a centre for extractive industries or if it is due to the sales and design effort and its trade organisation.  For support services and education see 2(b) above.\n4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHas the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?No.  It will have strengthened the position of the UK mining finance sector.\n5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?No comment as this question is not relevant to the UK Minerals Industry.\n6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIs there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?The UK Minerals Industry works with the NGO sector in several ways.  Through the CBI Minerals Group it has set up the UK Minerals Forum which comprises of Government representatives, Devolved Assemblies, Planners, Industry and NGOs. The process for submitting planning and environmental permit applications requires involvement with NGOs.  Many operators have site liaison committees.  The UK Minerals Industry is involved with NGO projects such as ‘Nature after Minerals’. \n7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDoes the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas? As referred to in 2(b) above, for over a decade there has been no encouragement from Government or the education system for students to take degrees in engineering, particularly mining.  During the early part of the 21\nst\n century it was said that the UK was going to be a knowledge based society and therefore the promotion was to subjects in those areas.  There has been for more than a decade a global shortage for mining engineers.  The result is that the number of Universities offering mining degrees has reduced to one or two.  \nUnder these circumstances it is difficult to see that the UK has the skill base required.  Although the UK Minerals Industry has shrunk due to the recession, it still has difficulty in find good young mining engineers as these are most likely to go oversees where the rewards are higher.  Others with the appropriate expertise who join the industry in the 60s and 70s are now retiring and are lost to the industry.\n8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is the impact of the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?There is concern that EITI will introduce a further level of red tape to already over regulated sector for what benefit.  It is obvious that the original intention of EITI was aimed at the large multi-national operators that able to minimise their tax liability in various countries etc.  It is therefore hoped that the impact will be reduced by introducing minimum thresholds or exemptions for the small or private companies.\n9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWould increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?Not relevant to the UK Minerals Industry.\n10)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?Whilst the EU is concerned about the security of supply and critical minerals and has launched a raw materials initiative, the UK government does not have minerals extraction high on its agenda.\nThe UK Government need a UK minerals strategy at the centre of an industrial strategy.  It has already been seen that being reliant on imports can destroy industry, because the exporter of the mineral will move up the production chain until it exports to us what our industry used to make.  There is no encouragement for exploration in the UK compared with the rest of the world including some European countries.\nCurrently there is too much focus on the short term, but there are long lead times in bringing new mineral resources on stream.  For example the \nBoulby\n potash mine took 4 years to construct after being granted planning permission. In the 1980’s it took 10 years from proving the reserve to open a gypsum mine and associated manufacturing plant. With today’s planning and regulatory system, the consensus is that it takes at least 15 years from proving a reserve to production, if at all with the environmental regulations.  It is probably longer for an underground mine requiring a shaft to be sunk.  These planning / regulatory systems are cumbersome, time consuming and expensive.  As already stated the UK Minerals Industry is in the hands of foreign owners and faced with the UK regulatory systems and public opposition, the owners will look to invest in other countries.  Result is that will lose its status as a global centre.\nRather than having a security of supply, we will be reliant on imports bought at disadvantageous prices on the global market or to import goods further down the production stream.  An example of this is that we used to bring in the ore for aluminium smelting, but we no longer produce aluminium, because energy prices and environmental regulations have closed the smelters.\nOur minerals will not be totally replaced in the 21\nst\n Century by recycling.  Some minerals such as potash in farming and rock salt for road de-icing are lost during usage.  Others are physically and chemically changed in the manufacturing process, such as fluorspar.\nThe security of supply of our own indigenous minerals is being put in danger by pressure from environmentalists who are bringing pressure to stop extraction in National Parks and AONBs.  Many minerals are not in abundant supply and occur where they occur which in many cases is in such areas.  In fact these areas owe their attraction as an AONB because of the mineral or its extraction in the past.  The footprint of a mineral extraction, particularly underground mining, is minimal in the total area of a national park.  \nR A Fenton\nSecretary \nThe Mining Association of the United Kingdom\n&#xa0;\n"
