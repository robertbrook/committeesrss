"&#xa0;\nAFS0020&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the socialist Educational Association&#xa0;1              Summary&#xa0;1.1\n              \nIn this submission we argue that there is no evidence that sponsored academies have proved more effective than maintained schools in raising standards. \nAnecdotes about individual schools do not constitute evidence. \nWe further argue that there is evidence to suggest that sponsored academies have not contributed to closing attainment gaps \nbut\n that by \nmaking possible (as own admission authority schools)\n \nmore\n socio-economic selection they are\n likely to make this situation worse.\n We agree with the recent statement by \nAndreas Schleicher that \n“The UK demonstrates that increasing school choice and competition does not improve standards”&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nWe maintain that the p\nrocess of academy conversion and the es\ntablishment of free schools has\n been characterised by a serious democratic deficit, by a substantial waste of public money and by entirely unproductive levels of conflict within local communities.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nWe consider tha\nt \nthe Secretary of State’s approach to intervention is wholly inadequate and demonstrates a failure to understand how the process of school improvement actually works. We consider that there is much more to be learned from the success of collaborative prog\nrammes such as \nthe \nLondon and City Challenge\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nThe Committee’s terms of reference assume the continuation and the further expansion of the academy programme. SEA argues that this is not a sustainable position and \nthat a new settlement is required whic\nh addresses the confusion and fragmentation that now characterises the English school system.\n&#xa0;\nEvidence&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Socialist Educational Association is the educational affiliate of the Labour Party. SEA members include MPs, school governors, local Councillors, teachers, students\n and \nparents. More information about the SEA can be found at \nhttp://www.socialisteducation.org.uk\n. We \nwould be \nhappy to pr\novide further detail to the Committee either in writing or orally on any of the issues raised in this statement.

The work of Henry Stewart\n \n demonstrate\ns\n this very clearly.\n It has also been demonstrated that improveme\nnt in a significant number of sponsored academies has been achieved \nonly t\nhrough the use o\nf\n non GCSE qualifications (\ne.g.\n \nby \nthe recent NFER/LGA analysis of academy school performance)\n3\n.2 \n              \nRecent research by \nStephen Machin and Olmo Silva\n \nhas demonstrated\n that academies have not contributed to “closing the gap”, arguing that \n“\nS\nchools that converted to academies between 2002 and 2007 improved their overall GCSEs results by further raising the attainments of students in the top half of the ability distributi\non, and in particular pupils in the top 20%. Conversely, we find little evidence that academies helped pupils in the bottom 10% and 20% of the ability distribution. Finally, we find little evidence that late converters (2008 and 2009) had any beneficial ef\nfects on pupils of any \nability.”\n3\n.3\n              \nIn SEA’s view, one important reason for the failure of the school system to close the gap between the lowest achievers and the rest has been the level of socio-economic segregation that persists in the English school sy\nstem. \nThere has never been a genuinely level playing field for schools in England. Subtle (or not so subtle) variations \nin governance, admissions policies\n, specialism\ns\n, religious affiliation etc. have helped to create a local pecking order of schools.  The\n advent of academies and free schools has made this situation worse. Too many schools manipulate their admissions to gain a more favoured intake to the advantage of “sharp-elbowed” parents who know how to work the system. The scale of this problem has just\n been confirmed by the research of Stephen Gorand at Durham University\n who concluded that:\n“any differentiated type of school - including faith-based, foundation, and fee-paying - tends to be linked to higher local levels of segregation. On the other hand, maintained, non-selective, 'bog-standard' schools are strongly and unambiguously linked to\n both lower segregation and a further decline in segregation of all types over time. If you want less segregation, do not have \ndifferent types of school”\n.\n3\n.4\n              \nWe know that a key issue for English schools is the tail of underachievement\n.\n In 2012 OECD \nidenti\nfied a number of system level issues that contribute to this kind of underachievement. Of particular relevance here are the recommendations to “a\nvoid early tracking (i.e selection, setting and streaming) and defer student selection to upper secondary” \nand \nto \n“manage school choice to avoid segregation and increased inequities”. \nAlthough in theory there is equal access to schools for all, in practice we are seeing more selection and social segregation in the English school system. In OECD’s view this will lea\nd to lower levels of achievement in the system as a whole. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEstablishing Academy and Free Schools&#xa0;4\n.1\n              \nSEA argues that the\n process of establishing academies\n and free \nschools has\n been \ncharacterised by a very serious democratic deficit\n, \nby a substantial \nwaste of public money\n and by entirely unproductive levels of conflict within local communities\n. \n4.2              The Democratic DeficitOpportunities for local communities to have any meaningful say in how schools are planned and run have been substantially and unacce\nptably reduced. Decisions on opening, closing and changing the nature of schools are now taken largely by central government\n.\n It is sometimes forgotten that education is of concern to the whole of society and is not just a matter for those directly involve\nd.\n \nThe process is often secretive and is open to the charge of cronyism. It seems to be geared primarily to meeting political targets – i\n.\ne\n.\n the number of academy conversions and the number of free schools regardless of quality. It is very clear that some \npromoters/ sponsors of schools have been inadequate and driven by inappropriate ideological or commercial considerations.\nThe proposals of particular interest groups (often a minority group) are \noften \naccepted regardless of their effect on others – as long\n as they are politically acceptable\n. The presumption is that market forces will decide which schools succeed and which do not. \nHowever it is not possible to run an education system as a market without having a damaging impact on some schools and pupils. Th\nis is why school systems need to be planned through a democratic process in which all views can be heard.\nThere is also a growing democratic deficit within schools. In many academy chains, schools are subject to the central management of the chain in ways\n that would be entirely unacceptable in local authority schools. They are not always \npermitted\n to have their own governing body and consequently the role of \nparents\n \nand\n local communities\n in governance is significantly diminished. This downgrading of the place of parent governors can be found in other academies and free schools.\n4.3              WasteThe most obvious example of wasting resources is the opening of free schools where there is already a\n surplus of places. At a time when there is a growing shortage of primary places in parts of the country, this is inexcusable.\nThe Public Accounts Committee has clearly documented the waste of public money by the Academies programme amounting to about £1 billion. A significant part of this was in effect bribes to schools to convert. It also arose from the creation of duplicate man\nagement systems – for example much of the funding work of the EFA could be done by local authorities at little extra cost. There have \nalso\n been notorious examples of inappropriate extravagance by some academy chains and indeed by some individual schools wh\nere there is no longer any real oversight in place.\n&#xa0;\n4.4              ConflictArguments over school status have distracted schools, parents and teachers in many areas from their core business. Relationships have been damaged and time and energy has been wasted in unpr\noductive arguments, leading in some cases to industrial action. At times it can feel that such conflict is welcomed by government because it enables it to denigrate those who disagree – the “enemies of progress” argument. The deliberate provoking of confli\nct across the country seems however an \nin\nappropriate way for a government to carry on.\n&#xa0;\n5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntervention by the Secretary of State5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe secretary of state is now directly responsible for the performance of about three thousand academies and free schools across \nthe country. This includes responsibility for not just their academic performance but their financial probity, a range of issues relating to individual pupils and families and their adherence to a wide range of regulations. \n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll this is widely accepted as \nunsustainable in both practical terms and in terms of the unacceptable centralisation of power in a single person’s hands. It means that there is no way for the voice of parents and local communities to be heard – as can be seen in the way opposition to fo\nrced academisation and to particular sponsors has been consistently ignored\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is now the situation that many schools are effectively accountable to no one but themselves. They are formally accountable to the Secretary of State but it is clear that the DfE\n does not have the capacity to identify issues at an early stage – this takes local knowledge drawn not just from data but from regular contact with local communities and agencies. Nor is it in a position to provide what David Wolfe \nQC \ndescribes as “\na more\n subtle and supportive regime of external intervention to encourage school improvement.\n” \nOfsted and the DfE can only offer intervention of a very crude and high level kind\n as has been demonstrated by the recent issue of warning notices to failing academie\ns. These show no capacity to engage with schools at any detailed level nor any desire to understand their issues in detail. DfE intervention seems to be confined \nto a threat to enforce a change of governance and/ or sponsor. \n \n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe recent proposals by the S\necretary of State to establish 8 regional \ncommissioners\n to be responsible for monitoring academies and free schools will be in no way adequate. With an average of 400 schools each (a figure that is presumably expected to rise\n they\n will be no more effective than the DfE is now. \nIt seems \nremarkable, at this time of\n financial stringency, to establish a whole parallel bureaucracy working only with some schools.\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn the ground, t\nhe provision of support for school improvement has been ser\niously undermined in recent years. Partly this has been a result of cuts in funding. But it has also been based on a belief that schools can and should manage their own improvement, if necessary in collaboration with other schools. \n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no doubt that \nteachers can and do learn a lot from one another. But it is not realistic to expect schools to keep up with both \nall \ncurrent research and debate and with best practice across the country. There is therefore a need for people and institutions that are in a \nposition to take a broad view based on research and experience of a wide range of schools. This could traditionally be found in local authority services and in higher education. Both of these are now under sustained attack.\n5.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also clear that school to \nschool initiatives are patchy. The RSA Academies Commission found that many outstanding schools are not making the contribution to school improvement that is expected of them. \nThe distribution of teaching schools is also patchy with no certainty that a sc\nhool in need of support \ncan\n access it.\n              6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Middle Tier6\n.1\n              \nWe would argue that \nmanaging \nthe establishment and monitoring of \nall schools\n requires a democratically accountable local tier of governance. This needs to be responsible not for running schools b\nut for the key functions of planning, commissioning and monitoring. None of these are now being done effectively by central government. Privatising these functions to unaccountable chains and sponsors\n has been shown to be \ninimical to the concept of public \nservice\n and open to abuse\n. The purpose of this\n middle tier should be to take functions away from Whitehall and exercise them at a local level\n and\n not\n to reduce\n levels of school autonomy that have been in place now for many years.\n6\n.2\n \n              \nThe key purpose of a \ndemocratically accountable middle tier is to provide broad educational leadership across an area. It should champion the interests of children and families and should ensure that the vested interests of schools do not obstruct the delivery of an educationa\nl entitlement for all children and young people.\n It should:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nidentify and plan to meet changing demand for school places \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nensure that their areas have the range of schools that will meet the needs and aspirations of all local people.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncommission post 16 pr\novision across both school and college sectors working with and through school/college partnerships \n. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nensure that a common admissions system pro\nvides fair access for all\n.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nmonitor the performance of schools including academic performance, financial systems\n and adherence to national standards including equalities duties.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nwith schools, establish and implement a fair funding formula covering all state funded schools in their area.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nintervene where there is clear evidence of inadequate performance including requ\niring changes in the governance and leadership of schools if other interventions have been unsuccessful.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npromote school improvement in collaboration with School Partnerships.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nidentify pup\nils with additional needs and\n ensure that these are met by schools. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nprovide for all pupils independent specialist careers advice and guidance. \n6\n.3\n              \nAcademy chains cannot themselves \nbe\n a middle tier authority. They cover only a minority of schools, range from just a couple of schools to well over 50, have no geographical un\nity and are wholly unaccountable to either parents or voters.\n We would argue that \nall schools should be independent legal entities (which is not the case for sponsored academies) and \nthat \nall \nschools should be free to identify external support from any app\nropriate source\n. A\nn academy chain could\n \nthen\n be one of these options. But we doubt that chains working with only a very small number of schools actually have much to offer.\n7              Alternatives to Sponsored Academy Status7\n.1\n              \nA\ns at \npresent 44% of secondary and \n46% of primary sponsored academies are either inadequate or require improvement, it is difficult to maintain the view that sponsored academy status is a uniquely effective route to improvement. There have clearly been successful sponsored academies but to \nargue purely by anecdote is not enough.\n7\n.2\n              \nSEA would argue that the most effective path to school improvement is through the support of \nsuccessful\n local schools that are facing similar challenges. We would also argue that the engagement of an experienced \nadviser with both the time and the ability to work with the school in depth can make an important contribution. This is the message of the London and City Challenges which had a huge effect on standards in important parts of the country. \nIt was also the me\nssage of the Select Committee’s recent report on school partnerships.\n We suggest that there is much in that report which is relevant to this inquiry as well.\n7\n.3.\n              \nThere are also examples of tighter school partnerships and federations which have been effect\nive in raising standards. W\ne are not opposed to external partners making a contribution to school improvement\n either with individual schools or with partnerships. \n \nBut we do not think that schools and their local communities are best served by being requir\ned to adopt the status of sponsored academy, with the loss of\n democracy\n and autonomy that this involves.\n8              Fragmentation 8\n.1\n              \nWe would also ask the select committee to consider how the English school system is being fragmented in a number of damaging ways.\n \nA significant proportion \nof schools are now governed by funding agreements with the secretary of state. The exact arrangements vary and are “\nbased on the particular circumstances and political climate at the time and the reasons for the school’s creation”\n. \nThe consequence is that anyone seeking to raise an issue with a school (e.g.  admission appeals, SEN places, exclusions etc.) needs to identify exactly what provisions apply to the school in question. It has become more difficult for parents and childre\nn to get issues addressed local\nly. They may have to go to the S\necretary of \nS\ntate for a decision.\n8\n.2\n              \nIn addition local collaborative arrangements between schools are breaking down in many    areas\n. In practice this means that arrangements for the placemen\nt and support for disadvantaged and at risk pupils are no longer working properly. It also means that local planning designed to secure a broad 14 to 19 offer across an area is being undermined.\n9              Conclusions9\n.1\n              \nSEA believes that \nthe experiment with \nunplanned marketization and privatisation of the school system has r\nun its course and that it is\n necessary to:\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Notes and References \n \nsee a number of contributions to \nhttp://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk\n \n \nMachin and Silva, \nSchool Structure, School Autonomy and the Tail – at \nhttp://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/special/cepsp29.pdf\n \n http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/09/04/pupils-segregation-class-race-sc\nhools_n_3864512.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\n  “\nEquity and Quality in Education: Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools” (OECD 2012) \n&#xa0;\n Two examples of the impact of uncontrolled free school developments: \nhttp://www.northtyneside.gov.uk/browse.shtml?p_subjectCategory=1567\n  sets out the local authority view of the free school controversy in North Tyneside.\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/09/free-schools-academies-opposition\n discusses the decision making over free schools in Suffolk\n These issues \nwere documented in the National College report “\nThe growth of academy chains: implications for leaders and leadership” available at http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/14536/1/the-growth-of-academy-chains%5B1%5D.pdf\n  \nDavid Wolfe QC\n \nat\n \nhttp://davidwolfe.org.uk/\nw\nordpress/archives/1434\n)\n \n   \nRSA Academies Commission Report “Unleashing Greatness\n ch 2.\n \nDavid Wolfe QC\n \nat\n \nhttp://davidwolfe.org.\nu\nk/wo\nr\nd\npress/archives/1434\n)\n RSA Academies Commission Report “Unleashing Greatness ch 4.\n"
