[[[ written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Further to my letter of 23 January in which, on behalf of KPMG in the UK, I responded to Part 2 of the above call for evidence, I now set out our comments on part 1 below. As you have previously been informed, I shall be attending in person at 3.30pm on 5 February to give oral evidence on behalf of KPMG.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is our understanding that the changes proposed in Finance Bill 2014 have arisen for two reasons:■&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The significant difference in tax rates between companies (20% from 1 April 2015) and individuals (45% for additional rate taxpayers plus National Insurance Contributions (NIC) where appropriate) has caused some LLPs to distribute profits to corporate members owned by individual members rather than to individual members themselves; and■&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The different NIC treatment between self employed individuals, including partners in a partnership, and employees related to employers’ contributions of 13.8% has caused some LLPs to appoint individuals as members who HMRC believe should more properly be taxed as employees.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The stated policy objective is to prevent the avoidance described above and we have been advised by HMRC that it is not intended to impact upon the taxation of genuine equity partners. We support the policy objective.  We have also been advised that the approach taken in drafting the legislation has been to base it on case law principles with the intention of creating a relatively straightforward, forward looking test which can be applied year on year.  We support this approach and believe that the three factors used in the draft legislation of profit sharing, management and capital are, on balance, those most prominently featured in previous case law. 4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, as currently drafted we do not believe that the legislation achieves its aim.  It is too vague and is not capable of being interpreted without the use of the supporting guidance.  The guidance itself expands rather than merely clarifies the scope of the legislation.  This is bad law and we believe that it will result in the legislation having far wider scope than its stated intent.  In effect it does have the capacity to impact significant numbers of genuine equity partners. 5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  The individuals from HMRC who have been tasked with this job appear to welcome input and to be willing to make amendments where they will improve both the legislation and the guidance.  However, we believe that the current proposed timetable of an effective date of 6 April 2014 means that insufficient changes will be feasible and that only solution is to defer the introduction of the legislation, ideally until Finance Bill 2015, while this further work is carried out.I set out our concerns in more detail below.

[[[Legislation]]]6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The draft legislation is very broadly drafted and has few defined terms.  For example ,a key phrase upon which much of the discussion lies is the phrase “substantially wholly” in s863B(1)(b).  This is not defined in the legislation but is stated unequivocally in the guidance to mean 80%.   In addition, during discussions, HMRC have clarified that a factor which will determine whether condition A applies or not (s863B(1)-(3)) is whether an individual is paid in priority to his fellow members.  This is not mentioned in the legislation but could be included relatively easily. 7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The legislation includes a capital test (Condition C).  Broadly a member requires capital in excess of 25% of any disguised remuneration in order to fail the condition and avoid becoming a salaried member.  We believe that the level of capital required in this test discriminates unfairly against non capital-intensive businesses and those firms which manage cash flow efficiently.  There is a risk that including this test will drive firms to adopt uncommercial behaviour as it may encourage firms to require members to inject capital, notwithstanding that this may not be needed by the business.  8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The capital test also only allows formal capital to be included in the calculation. We disagree that only fixed capital is relevant. Large amounts of funding for working capital and investment come not from capital subscriptions made by partners, but from the retention of internally generated funds otherwise payable to partners, such that at any point in time the total investment by the partner group significantly exceeds the formal capital which they inject. This deferral of payment is a feature which distinguishes partners from employees (employees would expect to receive the vast majority of their remuneration during the year rather than after the year-end).  For example, the Statement of Financial Position at page 48 of KPMG’s Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 shows that while the formal capital contributed by members was £50m, the total members’ interests were £354m.  The balance of £304m represents the net of unallocated or undrawn profits.  We believe that any capital test should allow all of these interests to be classed as capital. 9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The legislation is drafted by reference to tax years.  The tax basis period for LLPs is the accounting period.  This is also the period for which many LLPs agree member remuneration structures and capital.  We believe that the legislation will be easier to apply for both taxpayers and HMRC if it were redrafted by reference to accounting periods and therefore recommend that this is done.10 Some firms, including KPMG, award retiring partners fixed profit shares or priority payments in their final year of membership or agree the profits of that final year at the time of retirement rather than following the end of the year when profits are known.  While in some instances it will be the case that no further services will be performed by the member following the agreement (see s862B(1)(a)), this is not always the case as a notice period may be worked.    The current legislation will therefore give rise to the anomalous situation that individuals may be genuine equity partners and taxed as such for many years, but that they are taxed as employees in their final year of membership.  We strongly recommend an exemption from the provisions for anyone in their final 12 months of membership provided they have not been a salaried member in any of the previous three (say) years.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The introduction of specific rules taxing individual members on profits allocated to a non individual member of a partnership is anticipated to cause difficulties for many mixed partnerships because the legislation is intentionally aimed at taxing commercial arrangements, as well as structures specifically designed for tax avoidance.  Examples of commercial arrangements caught by the new rules include allocations of profits to corporates for working capital purposes, investments, or deferred profit arrangements.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the legislation has been drafted with anti-avoidance mainly in mind, as the legislation requires the taxpayer to consider whether it would be reasonable to conclude that the reason some or all of the excess profits have been allocated to the corporate is attributable to the relationship between the corporate and the individual member.  Then, only a just and reasonable allocation of the excess profits is taxable on the individual member.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This style of drafting is appropriate for tax avoidance legislation, where a degree of flexibility is required.  However, where the legislation has a purpose of raising additional tax from commercial arrangements it is not appropriate to have such subjective tests.  Such subjective concepts give rise to a high level of uncertainty as to how the legislation applies to a commercial situation.  We believe that these should be removed as they do not make good legislation.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In summary we believe that, while the approach taken is drafting the legislation has the potential to achieve clarity and restrict application to the stated policy group, it does not do so as currently drafted.

[[[Guidance]]]&#xa0;15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The guidance supporting the draft legislation is 56 pages long.  While we welcome the principle of HMRC issuing guidance (and acknowledge that we would have raised concerns about lack of clarity if none had been issued) we do not believe that the guidance as currently drafted performs its correct purpose.  This should be to clarify the legislation rather than to extend it.  As the guidance is not regulated by Parliament there is a risk of interpretation by HMRC which is not in accordance with Parliament’s wish.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite its length the guidance itself does not clarify certain key points.  We have submitted several additional examples and questions to HMRC in an attempt to obtain certainty on our own position and that of many of our clients.  We attach as an appendix a copy of some additional examples we have submitted to HMRC to date.  We do not believe that the guidance takes account of the wide variety of different commercial arrangements many firms have agreed within their partner group.  In addition, the guidance does not cover any of the practical issues which will arise for LLPs in applying the new legislation such as the amounts upon which PAYE and NIC must be paid or the interaction with for example the overlap rules for members who are now treated as salaried members.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe that, once changes and improvements have been made to the legislation, the guidance should be rewritten to reflect the revised legislation, taking account of a far wider range of commercial arrangements.

[[[Timi]]]

[[[g]]]18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the consultation in the summer of 2013 HMRC initially proposed that there should be a series of tests based on the case law definition of an employee but, following representations, the test published on 10 December solely looks at three factors, profit sharing, management and capital. We are pleased that some representations have been listened to and agree that the three factors selected do represent the most appropriate elements of existing case law. However, the introduction of these new tests without an extension of the timetable for introduction  allows insufficient time for further consultation to be carried out, necessary amendments to be made to improve the application of the legislation and for taxpayers to understand and act on the implications. The new rules were published on 10 December 2013 and are due to be effective from 6 April 2014 although the legislation will not become law until Royal Assent in July 2014.  We understand that following the current consultation process which ends on 4 February, revised legislation or guidance will be issued by mid-February.  We do not consider that this will provide HMRC with long enough to consider the various representations being made. If revisions are delayed until the time of the budget on 19 March there will be less than three weeks before the legislation will become effective. 19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This timing is unsatisfactory for two reasons.  The first is that it is retrospective both because it applies from a date before it is fully enacted but also because it applies to arrangements already in place before it will be enacted (or, in some cases, published).  The second is that HMRC are unable to provide clearances for firms until after Royal Assent (although HMRC have agreed to provide informal guidance) meaning that firms will be required to operate the legislation with uncertainty. We believe that this places an unnecessary administrative burden on all LLPs, which would be substantially reduced if the legislation were deferred.  While we understand the need for anti-avoidance legislation to be enacted quickly to prevent avoidance, this legislation goes far further than an anti-avoidance provision would normally go and affects many businesses who are not engaged in avoidance.  We therefore believe that any deferral should be to Finance Bill 2015 as this would allow sufficient time for further consultation, redrafting and clarification.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Conclusion]]] 20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In summary therefore we believe that:■&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; significant further work needs to be done to refine the legislative approach and draft focussed legislation which meets the policy objective (but does not go wider);■&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the non-statutory guidance should be redrafted to ensure that it simply clarifies rather than extends the legislation; and■&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; time must be made to do this by postponing the introduction of any legislation until these improvements are made. 21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; KPMG has found the individuals responsible for this legislation at HMRC (Richard Rogers and Brian Stokes) to be open and to welcome discussions of our concerns.   I would like to reaffirm our willingness to continue working with them and their colleagues to achieve this objective.Yours faithfully&#xa0;Jane McCormickPartner, Head of Tax and Pensions

[[[ Appendix]]]

[[[Example 1a: basic example]]]A, B and C are members of ABC LLP.  A is allocated 2 points and B and C are each allocated 4 points.  Regardless of the level of profit A will receive 20%, while B and C will receive 40% each.  All three members receive no disguised remuneration, they each have a variable interest in the overall profits of the partnership.

[[[Example 1b: ‘benchmark’ and variable amounts]]]A, B and C award themselves ’salaries’ of £20,000, £40,000 and £40,000 respectively and agree that the total profit will be shared in proportion to those salaries. If the overall profits of the partnership are more or less than £100,000 then each partner will share in the deficit or surplus in proportion to their agreed salary.  This arrangement is in substance identical to example 1a: each partner has an interest in the profits of the partnership which is variable by reference to the overall profits of the partnership.  It is not relevant that the partnership has chosen to describe this arrangement by reference to a salary.

[[[Example 1c: guaranteed amounts]]]Continuing example 1b, individual D joins the LLP.  He is also awarded a ‘salary’.  His total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the same way as A, B and C but in his first year he is guaranteed a total profit share of no less than £30,000.  If his allocated share of the profits is less than this it will be borne by the other members; D will receive his profit share in priority to A, B and C.D’s guaranteed profit share of £30,000 is disguised salary as it is fixed.  Accordingly, unless it is reasonable to expect that ultimately D’s share for the period will exceed £37,500, such that his overall return is not substantially wholly fixed, he will meet Condition A.

[[[Example 1d: capped variable interests]]]E joins the LLP described in 1b above. Like D, she is awarded a ‘salary’. Her total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the same way as A, B and C but her total profit share cannot exceed £25,000.  As E is sharing directly in the overall profits of the partnership up to a certain point and her profit share is not paid in priority to the other members she will not meet Condition A unless, in practice, the overall profits of the partnership are expected to be such that she will realistically always receive £25,000.  If this were so, it would imply that her total received was not in practice a variable share of total profit equal to her ‘salary’ as a fraction of all salaries, but was simply a fixed sum meeting Condition A.

[[[Example 1e: businesses with stable or reliable profits]]]Same as example 1b above, but the profit forecast is reliable or the nature of the business is such that profits are not significantly variable from year to year such that it is unlikely that profits will be materially greater or less than £100,000.The fact that the overall profits of the business may be accurately forecasted and/or are stable from year to year does not mean that Condition A is necessarily met: each of the partners has an interest in the partnership which will vary with the overall profits of the partnership, even if those overall profits are predictable or are not significantly variable.

[[[Example 1]]]

[[[f]]]

[[[: timing differen]]]

[[[ces between cash and profit]]]Facts as 1b above. However, the ‘salaries’ are distributed in-year.  It is agreed that to the extent there are insufficient profits, excess drawings will only be satisfied out of future profits of the firm (meaning the drawings in the following years would be less than the affected members’ profit allocations). The distribution to members of drawings representing advances against allocations of  profit share does not of itself change the position from that in 1b.

[[[Example 2: disc]]]

[[[retionary awards]]]Please see attached marked-up versions of Examples 1A and 14 from HMRC’s 10 December Guidance.

[[[Example ]]]

[[[3a: sharing in divisional profits only]]]AB LLP has four members A, B, C and D.  A and B work in division X and C and D work in division Y.  Division X generates profits of £10,000 and Y of £90,000.  The LLP deed provides that A and B will share the profits of division X and that C and D will share the profits of division Y.  All four members meet condition A as none of them receive a share of the overall profits of the firm.

[[[Example ]]]

[[[3]]]

[[[b]]]

[[[: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (i)]]]The facts are the same as example 3a except that the LLP deed provides that profit allocation is at the discretion of the members.  The four members meet and, as per their terms of reference, they consider a range of factors including the financial performance of each division, the need for the divisions to work together and support each other, and the overall strategic direction of the firm. They agree that A and B will share profits of £15,000, leaving C and D to share £85,000.Assuming the members have properly exercised their discretion under terms of reference based on more than just divisional profit sharing, they will not meet condition A as their profit shares are each partly dependent on the overall profits of the whole firm.

[[[Example 3c: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (ii)]]]The facts are the same as example 3b except that the four members agree that A and B will share profits of £10,000 while C and D will share £90,000.The four members will not meet condition A as their profit shares are still partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm, notwithstanding that the resulting shares are the same as if profits were shared on a purely divisional basis.

[[[Example ]]]

[[[3d: part divisional, part pro-rata split]]]The facts the same as above example 3a except that the four members agree in advance that half of each division’s profits will be split between the partners in that division, and half will be pooled and split equally between all the partners. Using the example above, A and B are therefore allocated £17.50. C and D are allocated £32.50.We see two possible interpretations of the legislation, either:The four members will now not meet condition A as their profit shares are partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm.Or:The firm’s total profit should be treated as two amounts.  The first, divisionally allocated amount then meets Condition A while the second, equally split amount does not.  The relative proportions of the two amounts for a member will determine whether that member meets Condition A.

[[[Example ]]]

[[[4]]]

[[[a]]]

[[[: bonus pool for high performers]]]A is a member of XY LLP. A receives a fixed share of £90,000 the terms of which result in it being considered to be disguised salary. XY sets aside a proportion of profits each year as a bonus pool to reward high performing members.  Whilst the overall pool will vary with profits, the share of that pool allocated to an individual member will depend on their individual personal performance.  All members are eligible to receive a share of this profit pool and A typically receives a bonus ranging from £25,000 to £35,000 each year. A will not meet condition A as less than 80% of her expected profit share is fixed.  

[[[Example ]]]

[[[4]]]

[[[b]]]

[[[: infrequent bonuses]]]The same conditions as in 3a but A only occasionally receives a bonus allocation.A will meet condition A as her expected profit share is just her fixed share.January 2014&#xa0;1&#xa0;
