"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Paul Burnett (AMR0028)In response to the global rise of superbugs caused not least, we are told, by ‘over-use of antibiotics’, calls have been made in some quarters for development of more powerful antibiotics. Is it not highly probable that more powerful drugs would but spread the problem all the more powerfully? Or that ‘different’ antibiotics would just spread the problem ‘differently’? Is there any evidence to the contrary?\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the success of homeopathic treatment of epidemic diseases in the past, Cholera, Typhus, Yellow Fever and the Influenza Pandemic of 1918 included [\ni\n], enormous success has been seen in homeopathic treatment of \nLeptospirosis\n in Cuba, spear-headed by Dr \nBraco\n of the WHO [ii]. Within two weeks of beginning homeopathic treatment in 2007 in a high-risk area of Cuba, a 90% decrease of \nLeptospirosis\n was observed in the homeopathic intervention area (over 2 million people), whereas in other low-risk areas which did not receive any treatment the disease rates continued to rise. Homeopathic prophylaxis has since then been extended to the entire Cuban population (11 million plus), and \nLeptospirosis\n is reported to be now almost eradicated. \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the light of this and a myriad of other evidence positive for homeopathic treatment, homeopathy provision is spreading more and more widely around the world, most recently in Arab countries. \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA previous UK Science &amp; Technology committee found homeopathy to be but a ‘placebo treatment’, apparently omitting in the process large amounts of conclusive evidence to the contrary (including effects of homeopathy not only on humans, but also on animals, plants and live cells in test tubes). As David \nTredinnick\n MP is aware, an enormous and ever-expanding body of pro-homeopathy evidence has in any case come out since the S&amp;T Committee meeting in 2010.\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo online polls on the future of the Glasgow homeopathic hospital stand currently at just over 2,000 votes to close it, over 18,000 votes to save it [iii]. The public understands the value of homeopathy.\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRECOMMENDATION.  In the light of potentially catastrophic effects on the whole human race, the present S&amp;T committee has an obligation to ignore homeopathy nay-\nsayers\n and denigrators and to recommend others to do likewise; instead to demand implementation of existing homeopathic research and to encourage still more. \nREFERENCES\n[\ni\n]  \nhttp://hpathy.com/homeopathy-papers/some-history-of-the-treatment-of-epidemics-with-homeopathy/\n \n[ii] \nhttp://hpathy.com/homeopathy-papers/homoeopathic-immunisation-against-leptospirosis-in-cuba/\n \n[iii]  \nhttps://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/nhs-greater-glasgow-and-clyde-save-the-glasgow-homoeopathic-hospital#description\n \nNovember 2013\n \n&#xa0;\n"
