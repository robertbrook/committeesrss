[[[The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners]]]&#xa0;“Treatment By Staff – help where a prisoner allegedly has cause to complain about HMPS staff from general bullying to abuse. Discrimination – help about discrimination in relation to rights &amp; privileges issues. Communications &amp; Visits – help with issues surrounding correspondence which, on occasion, may be withheld or visits being barred from family members, friends etc. Mother &amp; Baby Issues – help to mothers who are refused places on the units (and therefore the ability to be with their babies). Compassionate Release – this is where a prisoner seeks release on severe health grounds.Other treatment issues – for cases that do not fit neatly into either of the above categories.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

See Fatally Flawed via: http://inquest.gn.apc.org/pdf/reports/Fatally_Flawed.pdf  The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman found that 20% of their fatal incident investigations into self-inflicted deaths in custody had found evidence that the person who died was subject to bullying or intimidation by other prisoners in the three months prior to their death. PPPO (2011) Learning from PPO investigations: violence reduction, bullying and safety The only other avenue of “appeal” available to bereaved families is by persuading the Attorney General to exercise his or her power of fiat under s.13 of the Coroners Act 1988. This sets a high threshold to be met for an inquest verdict (inquisition) to be quashed and for ordering a new inquest into a death. It involves a complex and lengthy process which requires the Attorney-General’s consent. The Attorney General can only exercise his fiat if there is new evidence to be considered. As a result, this remedy has only been granted to bereaved families in rare cases – the most recent example being the quashing of the original inquests into the 96 deaths at Hillsborough Stadium in 1989.
