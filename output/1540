defaultspecific
default points:
default&#xa0;
default1) How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?
default&#xa0;
defaultP
defaultopulation density may be lower but there would seem to be a good
default&#xa0;
defaultdea
defaultl of suppressed demand both from residents and visitors; 
defaultmost have
default a car 
defaultbecause public transport is not available at all times so often the marginal cost of an additional car journey is accepted rather than public transport. Any basic shopping or work bas
defaulted trips from stations along the line such as 
defaultWennington
default, Bentham, Clapham, 
defaultGiggleswick
default, Long Preston, 
defaultHellfiield
default and 
defaultGargrave
default  are often not straight forward and often are constrained by the timings of the last journeys in the early evening, the last serv
defaultice from Leeds leaves at 16.47
default. 
default 
defaultThose without a car are reliant on family or friends for when public transport is lacking. We feel that there
default is no doubt that a substantial degree of exclusion from public transport services exists in rural areas
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is r
defaulteally a case of until the public service is available that is suitable
default,
default people will not use the current less than helpful partial service; but as even this
default restricted service 
defaultis not used the planners see no need to increase the service. Proper analysis nee
defaultds to be made of what is required. However the service has seen continual year on year growth despite the current timetable shortcomings.
default&#xa0;
defaultTAS found that it was almost impossible to 
defaultus
defaulte the line for commuting to and from work because of the very early last
default train from 
defaultLeeds
default (currently 
default16
default:
default47
default). It also felt that travelling for leisure 
defaulttrips
default especially when returning from 
defaultLeeds
default were poor. 
defaultYet they noted a 49% increase in patronage from 1998 to 2007 and yearly reports by Northern Rail indicate that the usage con
defaulttinues to grow.
default&#xa0;
defaultBetween 
defaultSkipton
default and Morecambe 42,437 people lived within one kilometre of a station (2001 census data) with over 150,00
default0
default within five kilometres. TAS felt that there was a potential target market of 12,000 
defaultpeople
default for stations along the cent
defaultral part of the 
defaultroute. 
defaultThe population is ageing, especially at the Western end but up to 43
default% of
default the population in some areas is
default 
defaulta potential commuter market if the service was geared to working patterns.
default&#xa0;
default2) To what extent are the needs of different groups 
defaultof passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?
default&#xa0;
defaultS
defaultchool runs and specialist services for pensioners and walkers apart there would often a
defaultppear to be an assumption that rural people only require a basic daytime
default weekday service
default; the existing rural public transport network in some areas is a patchwork of 
defaultaccidental survivals. 
default Those who rely on public transport for work need 
defaulta service that is 
defaultconsistent seven days a week as many industries are no longer confined to a traditional Monday – Friday working week.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIntegration
default of all forms of public transport services could be better de
defaultveloped - rail, stage carriage bus, community transport 
defaultbus, dem
defaultand responsive 
defaultservices 
defaultso that all groups have a chance to access the public transport network; for those without pass
defaultes, fares can also be expensive.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3) What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail serv
defaultices to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?
default&#xa0;
defaultP
defaultroviding services in sparsely populated areas is expensive and government does not necessarily recognise this in its funding settlements to non-metro transport authorities; cross county 
defaultboundary services can also be a source of problems as different counties can have different priorities in terms of providing 'optional' services; because of vastly varying traffic flows, different types of solutions are necessary for different routes/commu
defaultnities; there should however be core rail and stage carriage routes giving a full regular interval service 
defaultseven days a week.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe timetables for rural 
defaultrail stations 
defaulta
defaultre rarely co-ordinated with bus services from 
defaultsurrounding
default villages and often the bus does not even stop near the station.
default TAS
default commented that 
defaultbus services should complement rather than compete with the railway.
default&#xa0;
defaultHistoric rail timetables 
defaultare perpetuated in the PSR requirements, and the 
defaultoperators who are now shorn 
defaultof their powers to adjust services themselves and are merely contractors providing 
defaultthese 
defaultspecified services. 
defaultSuch services are often 
defaulttotally out of focus of modern needs (comm
defaultuting, shopping, leisure). 
default&#xa0;
defaultCounty Council
defaults who are the area transport 
defaultauthorities seem to be remote from the local parish and town councils
default;

defaultistrict 
defaultC
defaultouncils
default in some cases with minimal, if any, consultation. There needs to be liaison between 
defaultall levels of Local Government and the Rail and Bus industry together with Use
defaultr Groups and CRPs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CRP for Leeds-Morecambe already comprises representatives from various levels of authorities as well as Northern Rail, Network Rail and voluntary groups thus making it a useful existing body for this detailed work to be played out.
defaultBut there is a need 
defaultfor all 
defaultparticipants to 
defaultbe flexible where changes can be made without much cost and a local usable service provided.
default&#xa0;
defaultCar parking at many rural stations is small or 
defaultnon existent
default (mainly due to land sell off) provision should be encourag
defaulted as this allows access from 
defaultsurrounding
default villages to public transport instead of the need to drive into town for work, shopping etc with the traffic and parking problems involved.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4) How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of p
defaultassengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?
default&#xa0;
defaultA
default lot of good work has been done in this area but lack of long term core funding, and of coordinated integration and marketing strategies has not helped in fulfilling the full p
defaultotential of
default this mode. Three year funding, for example, is too short to allow investment in capital projects which may take longer to achieve payback. This argument has also been a criticism of short duration Rail franchises. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere needs to be funding fo
defaultr at least seven years, or ten to allow more imaginative solutions to be tried with the chance of being able to become revenue neutral over the full period.
default&#xa0;
default5) To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other
default demand-responsive transport services?
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthese forms of transport need to play their part and may be the only solution in some isolated areas but should not replace regular core services as in rural areas they wil
defaultl restrict travel opportunities. Even commun
defaultity based demand-responsive ser
defaultvic
defaultes can be 
defaultexpensive
default 
defaultcompared
default with scheduled 
defaultservices and thus this disadvantages people living in such areas compared to those in urban areas who have much lower transport costs.
default&#xa0;
default6) What are the main challenges associated
default with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?
default&#xa0;
defaultC
defaultommunity r
defaultail partnerships and community 
defaultbus services have proved their worth in reducing the costs of rural transport even where their activities h
defaultave been largely directed towards increasing revenue - marketing and community involvement strategies have paid dividends in tapping into the suppressed demand mentioned above; the value of improved rural services feeding into national trunk/cross country 
defaultservices needs also to be recognised; for rail, Network Rail have been examining ways of providing cheaper alternative traction options for rural lines. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTAS noted that the pricing of tickets offered good value compared to car and bus.
default&#xa0;
defaultBoth TPE and 
defaultVirgin offer heavily discounted advance tickets while Northern Rail do not do so on this line. This has the effect of diverting customers from this cross-country rural route which has capacity onto overcrowded longer distance services operated via Preston 
default&amp; Manchester. With better promotion the demand could rise and thus lead to improved services in the longer term.
default&#xa0;
defaultTAS did notice that some of the utilisation of rolling stock was inefficient and felt that with better diagramming the service could be enhanc
defaulted without needing additional stock, although this would need a change of practices in the 
defaultstaffing
default. At present it is staffed 
defaultonly 
defaultby crews from 
defaultSkipton
default which partly explain the 
defaultpresent 
defaultnature of the service.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis illustrates that more creative thinking i
defaults required bringing together all parties and accepting that changes may be needed in order to achi
defaulteve the maximum utility for 
defaultthose in isolated 
defaultcommunities
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe local market 
defaultof itself may be 
defaulttoo small to justify a higher frequency service 
defaultso needs 
defaultto be 
defaultlinked to developing the route as a
defaultn alternative
default Trans Pennine service.
default Question1 also referred to suburban areas. This is becoming a serious problem, especially in the 
defaultAire
default 
defaultValley
default, and nearer to 
defaultLancaster
default. R
defaultoads are jammed and old suburban stations 
defaultwere
default s
defaultwept aside 
defaultfrom the 1960s onwards 
defaultas main line services grew; replacement 
defaultof such 
defaultnow 
defaultbeing difficult as lines have been reduced 
defaultwhile
default paths and speed of Intercity routes have grown in importance. 
defaultPossible
default areas to explore should include restoring these st
defaultations (as has happened in the 
defaultAire
default 
defaultValley
default) nearer 
defaultLancaster
default perhaps by the provision of loops, as used on the continent. It may be more four line tracks need to be restored where lifted. The use of Tram/Trains should be encouraged which can use the road a
defaultrea to skirt blockages and to serve town centres and use track adjacent to the railway or disused lines where space exists to install this.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also of interest that one of the questionable approaches adopted in the 
defaultBeeching
default report was to ignore the eff
defaultect of feeder services into the wider rail network. While taken on its own a service such as the Leeds-Lancaster-Morecambe may have questions about economic benefits it needs to be seen in the context of a supporting route to the more principal East and We
defaultst Coast routes – linking both of these main arterial rail trunks.
