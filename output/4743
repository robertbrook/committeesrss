[normal]Written evidence submitted by John Christy (IPC0055)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am John R. Christy, 
[normal]Distinguished 
[normal]Professor of Atmospheric Science, Alabama’s State Climatologist and Director of the Earth System Science Center at The University of Alabama in Huntsville.  I h
[normal]ave served as a Lead Author, 
[normal]Contributing Author
[normal] and Reviewer
[normal] of IPCC assessments,
[normal] have been awarded NASA’s Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and in 2002 
[normal]was 
[normal]elected a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is a privil
[normal]ege for me to offer my views on the relationship between climate and weather 
[normal]based on my exper
[normal]ience as a climate scientist.  My research area might be best described as building datasets from scratch to advance our understanding of what the climate is doing and why. I have used traditional surface observations as well as measurements from balloons 
[normal]and satellites to document the climate story.  Many of my datasets are used to test hypotheses of climate variability and change.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Extreme[bold] Event[bold]s[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As the glob
[normal]al temperature failed to warm over
[normal] the past 15 years, it became popular to 
[normal]draw
[normal] attention to the
[normal] occurrence of 
[normal]extreme weather 
[normal]events
[normal] as worrisome 
[normal]consequences
[normal] of 
[normal]postulated climate change due to 
[normal]increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases
[normal].  For example, m
[normal]any claims have been made that 
[normal]weather
[normal] events of the past 50 years are 
[normal]“
[normal]unprecedented
[normal]”
[normal], theref
[normal]ore must be caused by human influences
[normal].  However, o
[normal]ne can only
[normal] establish 
[normal]such events as 
[normal]statistically 
[normal]unusual
[normal], a lower standard than 
[normal]“
[normal]unprecedented,
[normal]”
[normal] if 
[normal]a minimum of
[normal] 30 or more
[normal] such periods with consistent data
[normal] are available
[normal].  This means
[normal] we need 1500 to 2000 years
[normal] of information
[normal] 
[normal]with which to compare our recent 50-years 
[normal]of history 
[normal]to determine whether any characteristic is 
[normal]truly 
[normal]unusual
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For a few parameters we have such data.  Severe drought leaves a clear 
[normal]mark
[normal] on the 
[normal]landscape so th
[normal]at
[normal] we know our nation experienced droughts in the 12
[normal]th
[normal] century, the so-called mega
[normal]-
[normal]droughts, which were much worse than any we’ve seen in the past century.
[normal]  Thus, droughts of the past 50 years are not unusual 
[normal]and obviously not 
[normal]“
[normal]unprecedented
[normal]”
[normal] as shown next
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]California[bold]At right are photos from Lindstrom (1990) 
[normal]of divers examining 
[normal]trees 
[normal]which 
[normal]grew on dry ground around 900 years ago in what is now a Sierra Nevada alpine lake.  This indicates that a drastic but natural change to a much drier climate 
[normal]occurred a
[normal]nd must
[normal] have lasted for at least 
[normal]50 years
[normal] for trees to have grown to these sizes
[normal] on dry ground.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Rocky Mountains[bold]A 500-year history of moisture in the upper Colorado River basin (
[normal]below
[normal]) indicates the past century was quite moist while major multi-decadal droughts occurred in all four prior centuries (Piechota et al. 2004.)  Indeed, the conclusion of Piechota et al. states that after examining the paleo-record, the present-day droughts “
[normal]could be worse.” These and other evidences point to the real probability that water supply in the West will 
[normal]see declines simply as a matter of the natural variability of climate
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Great Plains[bold]In the Great Plains, the period from 3000 to 1500 
[normal]years ago
[normal] saw a drier and warmer climate during which a significant parabolic sand dune ecosystem developed, especially in western Nebraska and NE Colorado (Muhs 1985).
[normal]  In other words, 
[normal]parts of 
[normal]the Great Plains resembled a desert.
[normal]  Many of these areas experienced 
[normal]dune “reactivation” during Medieval times (900-1300 AD).  The
[normal]n, the
[normal] climate moistened and cooled 
[normal]beginning around
[normal] 1300 AD to support the short-grass prairie seen today, though “reactivation” is possible at any time (Schmeisser, 2009).  Indeed, Muhs and Hol
[normal]liday (1995) found that dune reactivation can occur within decadal time scales from extended drought by examining the Great Plains environmen
[normal]t of only the past 150 years. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With the massive use of ground water for irrigation, the High Plains Aquifer has d
[normal]eclined an average of 12.8 ft, with some areas in the Texas panhandle down over 150 ft.   The key point here is that the Plains is subject to 
[normal]natural (and sobering) 
[normal]long-term droughts that would very likely tax the current water management system (ground-w
[normal]ater withdrawals) while not replenishing the aquifer, producing a situation of reduced agricultural productivity, especially in its southern reaches.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]U.S. [bold]Daily High Temperature Records[bold]Are daily high temperature extremes becoming more frequent?  To answe
[normal]r such a question, one must obviously consider datasets that span an appropriate length of time.  If one 
[normal]does
[normal] the analysis 
[normal]with
[normal] stations 
[normal]of
[normal] at least 80 years of data, and determines the number of daily temperature records by year that stand as of 31 Dec 20
[normal]12, the answer to the question is 
[normal]“
[normal]no.
[normal]”
[normal]  It is true that the number of records in 2012 was quite high, thanks to a very warm March and a hot Mid-Western summer.  However in comparison to the heat waves of the 1930s, the summer was not the “worst” for heat.
[normal]  
[normal]2012 finished in 8
[normal]th
[normal] place on the list, just below 
[normal]6
[normal]th
[normal] and 7
[normal]th
[normal] places
[normal] by a few days.
[normal]  Imagine what this diagram would show if we had 1000 years of climate data in which it 
[normal]would be 
[normal]certainly likely that many years experienced more record warmth than even
[normal] the 1930s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recent [bold]Tornadoes[bold]The image to the right from NOAA indicates we are in a very low
[normal] 
[normal]tornado period in our count
[normal]r
[normal]y – in fact the current year (
[normal]right, 
[normal]black line) is the lowest year-to-date (
[normal]Nov
[normal].) value in the 60-year history.  This of course is 
[normal]not a prediction that tornadoes will decline in the future nor that there will be few tornadoes the rest of this year.  It is simply a recognition that the number of tornadoes can vary significantly from year to year and there is no long term trend (
[normal]http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/adj.html
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recent Wildfires[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Wildfires are a natural 
[normal]consequence
[normal] of the U.S. climate
[normal] variability
[normal] and a feature to which many components of the natural ecosystem have found ways 
[normal]for
[normal] advantage-
[normal]taking
[normal].  Nowadays however, our fire su
[normal]ppression activities that allow
[normal] 
[normal]e
[normal]xcessive buildup of fuel combined with the careless or premeditated human character of some folks, gives greater opportunity for wildfires to 
[normal]be started
[normal] and to destroy.  The 
[normal]current year has included the 
[normal]huge
[normal] Rim Fire in the central Sierra Nevada of California, but
[normal],
[normal] on the whole
[normal],
[normal] the year is well below average
[normal] as shown in the graphic to the 
[normal]above
[normal] (data from the National Interagency Fire Center 
[normal]http://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_totalFires.html
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]  A related metric is total snowfall in the Sierra
[normal] of California
[normal] which has 
[normal]also 
[normal]shown no trend since the Southern Pacific Railroad Company began measuri
[normal]ng snowfall in 1878 (Christy 2012).
[normal]West [bold]Antarctica [bold]Coastal[bold] Temperatures[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Temperatures over the vast expanse of the Antarctic continent have not shown significant warming in the past several decades.  Indeed satellite-based observations of the 
[normal]atmospheric temperature above Antarctica show a slight decline since 1979.  However, m
[normal]easurements along the coast of West Antarctic 
[normal]and its 
[normal]Peninsula have warmed in recent years.  Thomas et al. (2013) have reconstructed 308 years of temperature variations (1702-2009) through stable isotopes and confirmed the recent warming.  They found that
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]… this warming trend is not unique.  More dramatic isotopic warming (and cooling) trends occurred in the mid-nineteenth and eighteenth centuries suggesting that at present, the effect of anthropogenic climate drivers at this location has not exceeded 
[normal]the natural range of climate variability in the context of the past ~300 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Here we have another example that indicates we must have hundreds of years of
[normal] climate records 
[normal]before 
[normal]trying to assess 
[normal]whether 
[normal]recent changes
[normal] are unusual
[normal].  In this case, the te
[normal]mperatures of West Antarc
[normal]tica have experienced similar and likely 
[normal]greater changes
[normal] than recently observed
[normal] in merely the las
[normal]t 300 years, a period before which humans could have affected the climate.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What does Extreme Weather [bold]really tell us[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The point about
[normal] our 
[normal]lack of 
[normal]understanding 
[normal]of t
[normal]he causes of ext
[normal]reme weather was summed up in
[normal] an
[normal] article in 
[normal]Nature
[normal] magazine with the title “Extreme Weather – Better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming” (
[normal]Nature
[normal], 20 September 
[normal]2012, vol 489, pg 335-6.) The emphasis in the article agrees with my statement that our level of understanding about the climate system is so low that we cannot predict nor attribute unusual events to human emissions of greenhouse gases
[normal] using models and/or
[normal] limited data records
[normal].  The article discusses the problem that current climate models are not “fit to inform legal and societal decisions” without further “enormous research” because at present they are not ready for such tasks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The article notes that ext
[normal]reme events “have complex causes, involving anomalies in atmospheric circulation, levels of soil moisture and the like.”  The comments of one scientist at a recent workshop on the topic indicated “the coarse and mathematically far-from-perfect climate mode
[normal]ls used to generate attribution claims … are unjustifiably speculative, basically unverifiable and better not made at all.”  Not all participants felt this way, however 
[normal]Nature
[normal] reported that, “None of the industry and government experts at the workshop coul
[normal]d think of any concrete example in which an attribution might inform business or political decision-making.”  In other words, industry and government would prefer an accurate forecast over the notion of attributing that forecast to a particular cause.  Unf
[normal]ortunately, the ability to make accurate
[normal] long-range forecasts is not here yet
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the examples above, we don’t see increases in extreme events (which is also true for tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, etc. - see my House testimony of 31 March 2011) but we mu
[normal]st certainly be ready for more to come as part of nature’s variability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am not using 
[normal]the examples above
[normal] to prove the weather in the US is becoming less extreme.  My point is that extreme events are poor metrics to use for detecting climate 
[normal]change.  In
[normal]deed, because of their rarity (by definition) using extreme events to bolster a claim about any type of climate change (warming or cooling) runs the risk of setting up the classic “non-falsifiable hypothesis.”    For example, we were told by the IPCC that 
[normal]“milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms” (TAR WG2, 15.2.4.1.2.4).  After the winters of 2009-10 and 2010-11, we are told the opposite by advocates of the IPCC position, “Climate Change Makes Major Snowstorms More Likely” (
[normal]http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/climate-change-makes-snowstorms-more-likely-0506.html
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The non-falsifiable hypotheses can be stated this way, 
[normal]“whatever happens is consistent with my hypothesis.”  In other words, there is no event that would “falsify” the hypothesis.  As such, these assertions cannot be considered science
[normal],
[normal] or in anyway informative
[normal],
[normal] since the hypothesis’ fundamental prediction is 
[normal]“anything 
[normal]can
[normal] happen.”  In the example above if winters become milder or they become snowier, the non-falsifiable hypothesis stands.  This is not science.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are innumerable types of events that can be defined as extreme events – so for the enterprisin
[normal]g individual (unencumbered by the scientific method), weather statistics can supply an unlimited, target-rich environment in which to discover a “useful” extreme event. Thus, when the enterprising individual observes an unusual weather event, it may be tem
[normal]pting to define it as a once-for-all extreme metric to “prove” a point about climate change – even if the event was measured at a station with only 30 years of record. Extreme events happen, and their causes are intricately tied to the semi-unstable dynami
[normal]cal situations that can occur out of an environment of natural, unforced variability.
[normal]  In other words, Mother Nature ha
[normal]s within her all the necessary tools
[normal] to generate extreme events that exceed what we’ve seen in the past 50 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Science checks hypothe
[normal]ses (assertions) by testing specific, falsifiable predictions implied by those hypotheses.  The predictions are to be made in a manner that, as much as possible, is blind to the data against which they are evaluated.  It is the testable predictions from
[normal] a 
[normal]specific set of
[normal] hypotheses, 
[normal]otherwise known as
[normal] 
[normal]climate model
[normal] simulation
[normal]s
[normal], that run into trouble as shown 
[normal]below
[normal].  Before going on to that test, the main point here is that extreme events do not lend themselves as being rigorous metrics for 
[normal]convicting
[normal] human 
[normal]CO2 emissions of being guilty of causing them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Utility of Climate Models[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In the f
[normal]igure
[normal] below
[normal] 
[normal]I provide the 35-
[normal]year record 
[normal](1979-2013) 
[normal]of 
[normal]atmospheric temperature in the tropics – the key region in which climate models respond to greenhouse gas warming wit
[normal]h a large and distinct signal. 
[normal] The focus on the tropics is important because 
[normal]of the consistent and significant warming that climate models indicate should have already occurred as a result of the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases w
[normal]e have put i
[normal]nto the atmosphere. 
[normal]  
[normal]It also represents a part of the global atmosphere in which the critical water vapor and cloud feedbacks have major influences.
[normal]  In addition, changes in this region were determined by the EPA to be a 
[normal]key line of evidence of
[normal] greenhouse-gas caused climate change.  Finally, t
[normal]he tropical atmosphere is also a huge and easy target for modeling projects to hit if the physics are well represented.  
[normal]Since this warming should have taken place already, this provides for us a way to tes
[normal]t the model simulations.
[normal] There are 102 model runs represented in the figure, but I have organized them by the 
[normal]24 types of models
[normal].  The thick red line is the average of the 24 groups.  Thin, solid lines are the six model groupings created by U.S. institutio
[normal]ns and the dotted 
[normal]lines 
[normal]by those 
[normal]from 
[normal]outside the U.S.  The observations are provided by six independent 
[normal]sources
[normal], 
[normal]with “balloons” being the average of the 
[normal]four balloon-borne 
[normal]datasets
[normal] and 
[normal]“satellites” the average of the two 
[normal]groups which utilize satellite in
[normal]strumentation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The comparison
[normal] shows 
[normal]t
[normal]hat the very latest climate model simulations 
[normal]used in the IPCC Assessment released two 
[normal]months
[normal] ago 
[normal]indicate that their response to CO2 on average is 2 to 
[normal]5
[normal] times greater than reality. 
[normal]  In strict statistical testing, we can say that the m
[normal]odels on average failed a simple
[normal] hypothesis test 
[normal]to check whether they could represent
[normal] the path the real world took on tropical 
[normal]atmospheric 
[normal]temperatures
[normal] (see Douglass et
[normal] al. 2007, McKitrick et al. 2010,
[normal] 2011
[normal], Douglass and Christy 2013)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]An 
[normal]extremely important
[normal] paper was published in 
[normal]Nature Climate Change
[normal] this past spring as one of the first 
[normal]studies 
[normal]to actually perform a test of model capabilities 
[normal]in a controlled experiment to
[normal] understand the impacts on the critical processes that affect the way 
[normal]the temperature will change
[normal] (Stephens and Bony, 2013)
[normal].  They simply ran 
[normal]four major climate models
[normal] 
[normal]over
[normal] an ocean-covered earth (i.e. a very simple earth) with the current ocean temperatur
[normal]es, then again with elevated ocean temperatures.  The experiment would then reveal the impact of the extra warmth on the way the climate system operates
[normal], especially, clouds and rain because they have significant impacts on the warming processes. So, gettin
[normal]g 
[normal]clouds and rain
[normal] correct is necessary for long-term integrations. 
[normal]To their surprise, the four major models gave quite different results
[normal] (figure above)
[normal], both in terms of
[normal] the
[normal] magnitude 
[normal]and of the sign
[normal] of the change in clouds 
[normal]and
[normal] rain as shown in the figure.
[normal] 
[normal]This is exactly the type of fundamental, rigorous evaluation that must be encouraged for other parts of the modeling enterprise.  One can only conclude that at least three of the four models fail (if on the
[normal] odd
[normal] ch
[normal]ance o
[normal]ne is correct) to depict
[normal] the
[normal] fundame
[normal]ntal 
[normal]process
[normal]es
[normal] of the Earth system.  This result supports the comments in the paragraphs above which demonstrate the climate modeling enterprise must go “
[normal]back to the
[normal] basics” as stated in Stephens and Bony.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In a paper published last week
[normal], 
[normal]Swanson (2013) ex
[normal]amined the previous generation of climate models used in the IPCC AR4 (
[normal]2007, 
[normal]known as CMIP3) in comparison with the latest generation of models employed in the current IPCC AR5 (known as CMIP5 models as I used earlier).  Swanson found that the newer CMIP5 
[normal]models were worse at depicting actual climate 
[normal]variations 
[normal]than the older CMIP3 versions.  He suggests that the modelers have a “selection bias based on warming rate” that attempts to replicate the rapid warming of the Arctic (a small region) while becoming 
[normal]worse (too warm) in the much more vast tropics and southern hemisphere.
[normal]  He argues for a “healthy dose
[normal] of diversity” to be reintroduced into the climate simulation enterprise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Basing scientific conclusions about climate change 
[normal](
[normal]or 
[normal]basing 
[normal]policy decisions 
[normal]about energy
[normal])
[normal] on 
[normal]climate 
[normal]model output is risky given the 
[normal]inability of
[normal] model simulations 
[normal]to reproduce the real
[normal] world – and their results are not getting better.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The IPCC Summary for Policy Makers[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Regarding the IPCC, please note that the IPCC was written by IPCC-selected scientists and that the document represents their opinions.  Many of the conclusions are fine but some of the key ones do not represent the views of 
[normal]many in 
[normal]the broader climate comm
[normal]unity.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The head
[normal]line statement from the
[normal] 2013
[normal] 
[normal]Summary for Policy Makers
[normal] baffles me.  It reads,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20
[normal]th
[normal] century.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]First, the IPCC 
[normal]relies on
[normal] climate 
[normal]models to distinguish “natural” from “human” caused climate change because instruments can’t.  However, as demonstrated, these same models on average fail 
[normal]by a significant amount 
[normal]to reproduce the climate of the past 35 years
[normal] (the years most directly impact
[normal]ed by rising greenhouse gas emissions
[normal].
[normal])
[normal]  But in conclusion, the IPCC now has
[normal] even
[normal] more confidence that the models can distinguish “natural” from 
[normal]“human” change
[normal] 
[normal]over a period the models clearly fail to simulate well
[normal].  It doesn’t make sense to me.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now, i
[normal]t
[normal] is true that 
[normal]in the models
[normal], most of the warming in the past 50 years is due to greenhouse gases, but since the model-based warming did not occur in reality (by a significant amount), how can one claim that reality was driven by greenhouse gas warming?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I 
[normal]see two things here, (1) 
[normal]the
[normal] need to go back to the drawing board on climate modeling 
[normal]with special attention to the causes of natural variations and 
[normal]with a rigorously independent 
[normal]validation
[normal] program
[normal] (i.e. a
[normal] set of relatively inexpensive but
[normal] true “
[normal]Red Team[bold]s[bold]”)
[normal], and (2) the world community needs to be exposed to the real debates in climate science rather than statements amounting to a consensus of those who already agree with a
[normal] certain
[normal] consensus.
[normal]  These are sentiments I have been advocating for years
[normal] in congre
[normal]ssional testimony
[normal] and
[normal] which
[normal] appear in an article published in 
[normal]Nature
[normal] magazine (Christy, 
[normal]2010
[normal] see after references
[normal]).
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]I direct 
[normal]the reader
[normal] to 
[normal]a supplement attached
[normal] to 
[normal]this
[normal] written testimony by Professor Judith Curry of Georgia Tech entitled, “IPCC Diagnosis – Permanent Paradigm Paralysis.”
[normal]  The title is an apt description of where the IPCC process has gone.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Seventeen Years Ago – House Committee on Science[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Seventeen years 
[normal]ago, in March 1996, I testified before this committee 
[normal]regarding
[normal] climate change. In that testimony I reported on the development of the deep layer 
[normal]atmospheric 
[normal]temperature datasets 
[normal]from satellites 
[normal]that Roy Spencer, then of NASA
[normal] now of UAHuntsville
[normal], and I had
[normal] pioneered.  Using these data
[normal],
[normal] Richard McNider, also of UAHuntsville, and I wrote a paper in 
[normal]Nature
[normal] magazine that indicated climate model simulations were warming the planet about 4 times faster than in reality (Christy and McNider 1994).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Further analysis
[normal] confirmed a
[normal] rate in models
[normal] 2 to 4 times 
[normal]faster than the
[normal] real world
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It was clear at the time, and agreed to by 
[normal]nearly everyone
[normal], that our understanding
[normal] of how the climate system worked
[normal] was poor and much more research was needed on observing the climate and on understanding its natural variations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I also noted that we should expect weather extremes 
[normal]to continue 
[normal]because that has been the nature of climate from the beginning. 
[normal]One of my c
[normal]oncludin
[normal]g statements was, and I quote, 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Without a continuing program of research that places climate variations in proper perspective
[normal] 
[normal][i.e. 
[normal]natural climate variations
[normal]]
[normal] and reports with improving confidence on their causes, we will be vulnerable to calls f
[normal]or knee-jerk remedies to combat "climate change," which likely will be unproduc
[normal]tive and economically damaging.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now here we are, over 17 years later.  It appears the nation has indeed enacted “knee-jerk” remedies to 
[normal]“combat climate change”
[normal] through regulat
[normal]ions on carbon dioxide.  I warned
[normal] this committee
[normal] in 1996 that these would be “unproductive and economically damaging.” I have since provided testimony that demonstrates that these regulations will be “unproductive” regarding their impact on climate.  I wil
[normal]l leave it to economists to determine whether the regulations
[normal] which result in higher energy prices
[normal] are also “economically damaging”, especially for the poorest among us.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The nation did 
[normal]indeed 
[normal]support
[normal] some
[normal] efforts to 
[normal]improve the
[normal] 
[normal]climate 
[normal]observ
[normal]ing
[normal] system, e
[normal]specially from space, 
[normal]to help in determining
[normal] 
[normal]what 
[normal]was happening with the climate, and then begin to understand 
[normal]why
[normal] changes are taking place.  Other efforts seem to be falling by the wayside
[normal],
[normal] including attention to the network of high quality surface monito
[normal]ring stations
[normal] such as NOAA’s Regional Climate Reference Network
[normal].  Simply put, we need to know 
[normal]what
[normal] the climate 
[normal]i
[normal]s doing before claiming to know 
[normal]why
[normal] it 
[normal]is doing what it i
[normal]s doing
[normal].  W
[normal]ithout 
[normal]accurate 
[normal]observations we 
[normal]can
[normal] not know 
[normal]what
[normal] the climate is doing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is 
[normal]enlightening
[normal] to examine the
[normal] 35-
[normal]year comparison of models and observations of atmospheric temperature in the tropics – the key region in which climate models respond to greenhouse gas warming with a large and distinct signal
[normal] and a region promoted by t
[normal]he EPA as a fingerprint of human-induced climate change
[normal].
[normal]  This is an exceptionally large target for climate models to aim at, and it incorporates the critical water vapor and cloud feedbacks about which we know so little.   The current
[normal] record is now twice 
[normal]as long as was available when I testified in 1996 and the models are more complicate
[normal]d, expensive and numerous
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]representing
[normal] an industry unto itself
[normal].  The comparison
[normal] 
[normal]shows that the very latest climate models’
[normal] 
[normal]tropical 
[normal]response to CO2
[normal],
[normal] on average
[normal],
[normal] is still 2
[normal] to 
[normal]5
[normal] times greater than reality
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]just 
[normal]as 
[normal]it was
[normal] in 1996. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe we missed a tremendous opportunity 
[normal]17 years ago
[normal] to develop a better understanding 
[normal]of the climate system 
[normal]because
[normal] research dollars
[normal] were directed
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]establish
[normal] a climate
[normal] modeling industry
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]To 
[normal]compound the problem
[normal] as it developed
[normal], I believe
[normal] we
[normal] failed to
[normal] fund substantial projects to
[normal] examine the output of climate models in an independent, objective and method
[normal]ological
[normal] 
[normal]way, i.e. 
[normal]we did not establish “red teams”
[normal] to rigorously study the output of m
[normal]odels on which the most expensive of regulations 
[normal]now 
[normal]rely.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]has left us 
[normal]17 years later 
[normal]still wondering
[normal] 
[normal]what porti
[normal]on of th
[normal]e 
[normal]recent modest 
[normal]change
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] natural and what portion might be
[normal] human-caused.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In this testimony,
[normal] evidence is presented to demonstrate that recent weather events are not outside the extremes that have occurred in the past 
[normal]when human influences were negligible
[normal].  Therefore
[normal] in my view
[normal] one cannot
[normal] 
[normal]attribute 
[normal]these recent events
[normal] 
[normal]with any confidence 
[normal]to
[normal] someth
[normal]ing 
[normal]beyond nature.  Climate models are 
[normal]promoted as tools that are able
[normal] to discriminate 
[normal]natural climate events
[normal] versus 
[normal]those that
[normal] might happen as a result of the increases in greenhouse gases due to human activities
[normal] and have been used by EPA for regulatory a
[normal]ction
[normal].  Unfortunately, as demonstrated here
[normal] and discussed in the literature
[normal], climate models have not demonstrated acceptable skill in terms of depicting
[normal] even
[normal] 
[normal]very 
[normal]fundamental, large-scale climate variations, and thus are unable to identify natural versus human-influenced events on regional scales.  Indeed, the lack of modeling skill regarding very basic processes such as tropical tropospheric variations, indica
[normal]tes that the modeling enterprise has not been subject to rigorous, independent “Red Team” oversight during its expensive growth 
[normal]period.  In addition,
[normal] significant advancements are needed in observing and understanding the natural processes of climate before
[normal] reliable, though basic, forecasts are forthcoming.   
[normal]It is unfortunate
[normal], in my opinion,
[normal] that recent policy has been made based on the projections of these faulty models.  
[normal]Climate science has a long way to go.

[normal]Diagnosis: paradigm paralysis, caused by motivated reasoning, oversimplification, and consensus seeking; worsened and made permane
[normal]nt by a vicious positive feedback effect at the climate science-policy interface.
[normal]In a previous 
[normal]post
[normal], I discussed the IPCC’s diagnosis of a planetary 
[normal]fever and their prescription for planet Earth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this post, I provide a diagnosis and prescription for the IPCC.
[normal]In the 1990’s, the world’s nations embarked on a path to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change by stabilization of the concentration
[normal]s of atmospheric greenhouse gases, which was codified by the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) treaty. The IPCC scientific assessments play a primary role in legitimizing national and international policies aimed at reducing greenhous
[normal]e gas emissions. This objective has led to the IPCC assessments being framed around identifying anthropogenic influences on climate, dangerous environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and stabilization of CO
[normal]2
[normal] concentrations in the atmosp
[normal]here.
[normal]At the time of establishment of the UNFCCC, there was as yet no clear signal of anthropogenic warming in the observations, as per the IPCC First Assessment Report (FAR) in 1990. It wasn’t until the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report in 1995 that a 
[normal]‘disc
[normal]ernible’
[normal] human influence on global climate was identified. The scientific support for the UNFCCC treaty was not based on observations, but rather on our theoretical understanding of the greenhouse effect and simulations from global climate models.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In the 
[normal]early 1990’s there was the belief in the feasibility of reducing uncertainties in climate science and climate models, and a consensus seeking approach was formalized by the IPCC. General circulation climate models became elevated to the central role by pol
[normal]icy actors and scientists from other fields investigating climate change impacts and applications – this has in turn has elevated the role and position of these climate models in climate change research. Very substantial investments have been made in furth
[normal]er developing climate models, with the expectations that these models will provide actionable information for policy makers.
[normal]In 2006/2007, climate change had soared to the top of the international political agenda, as a result of Hurricane Katrina, Al Gore
[normal]’s 
[normal]An Inconvenient Truth
[normal], publication of the IPCC AR4 in 2007, and award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Al Gore and the IPCC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It was claimed that the science was settled, and that it clearly demanded radical policy and governmental action to substantially cu
[normal]t CO2 emissions.
[normal]Symptoms of the disease[bold]Seven years later, with the release of the IPCC AR5, we find ourselves between the metaphorical rock and a hard place with regards to climate science and policy:
[normal]And finally:
[normal]Diagnosis of the cause of the disease[bold]How and why did we land between a rock and a hard place on the climate change issu
[normal]e?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There are probably many contributing reasons, but the most fundamental and profound reason is arguably that both the problem and solution were vastly oversimplified back in 1990 by the UNFCCC/IPCC, where the framed both the problem and the solution as 
[normal]irreducibly global. This framing was locked in by a self-reinforcing consensus-seeking approach to the science and a ‘speaking consensus to power’ approach for decision making that pointed to only one possible course of policy action – radical emissions re
[normal]ductions. The climate community has worked for more than 20 years to establish a scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC consensus building process played a useful role in the early synthesis of the scientific knowledge. However, the
[normal] ongoing scientific consensus seeking process has had the unintended consequence of oversimplifying both the problem and its solution and hyper-politicizing both, introducing biases into the both the science and related decision making processes.
[normal]In their 
[normal]Wrong Trousers
[normal] essay, Prins and Rayner
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]argue that we have made the wrong cognitive choices in our attempts to define the problem of climate change,
[normal] by relying on strategies that worked previously with ozone, sulphur emissions and nuclear bombs. While these issues may share some superficial similarities with the climate change problems, they are ‘tame’ problems (complicated, but with defined and achie
[normal]vable end-states), whereas climate change is ‘wicked’ (comprising open, complex and imperfectly understood systems). For wicked problems, effective policy requires profound integration of technical knowledge with understanding of social and natural systems
[normal]. In a wicked problem, there is no end to causal chains in interacting open systems, and every wicked problem can be considered as a symptom of another problem; if we attempt to simplify the problem, we become risk becoming prisoners of our own assumptions
[normal].
[normal]The framing of the climate change problem by the UNFCCC/IPCC and the early articulation of a preferred policy option by the UNFCCC has arguably marginalized research on broader issues surrounding climate variability and change, resulting in an overconfid
[normal]ent assessment of the importance of greenhouse gases in future climate change and stifling the development of a broader range of policy options.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The result of this simplified framing of a wicked problem is that we lack the kinds of information to more bro
[normal]adly understand climate change and societal vulnerability.
[normal]Paradigm paralysis is the inability or refusal to see beyond the current models of thinking. The vast amount of scientific and political capital invested in the IPCC has become self-reinforcing, so
[normal] it is not clear how move past this paralysis as long as the IPCC remains in existence. The wickedness of the climate change problem makes if difficult to identify points of irrefutable failure in either the science or the policies, although the IPCC’s ins
[normal]istence that the pause is irrelevant and temporary could provide just such a refutation if the pause continues. In any event, there is a growing realization of that neither the science or policy efforts are making much progress, and particularly in view of
[normal] the failure climate models to predict the stagnation in warming, and that perhaps it is time to step back and see if we can do a better job of understanding and predicting climate variability and change and reducing societal and ecosystem vulnerabilities.
[normal]Broader implications of the disease[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Specifically with regards to climate research, for the past decade most of the resources have been expended on providing projections of future climate change using complex Earth system models, assessing and interpretin
[normal]g the output of climate models, and application of the output of climate models by the climate impacts community.
[normal]The large investment in climate modeling, both in the U.S. and internationally, has been made with the expectation that climate models will su
[normal]pport decision making on both mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So, are these complex global climate models especially useful for decision makers?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The hope, and the potential, of climate models for providing credible regional climate
[normal] change scenarios have not been realized.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]With the failure of climate models to simulate the pause and regional climate variability, we have arguably reached the point of diminishing returns from this particular path of climate modeling – not just for de
[normal]cision support but also for scientific understanding of the climate system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In pursuit of this climate modeling path, the climate modeling community — and the funding agencies and the policy makers — have locked themselves into a single climate modeling f
[normal]ramework with a focus on production runs for the IPCC, which has been very expensive in terms of funding and personnel. An unintended consequence of this strategy is that there has been very little left over for true climate modeling innovations and fundam
[normal]ental research into climate dynamics and theory — such research would not only support amelioration of deficiencies and failures in the current climate modeling systems, but would also lay the foundations for disruptive advances in our understanding of the
[normal] climate system and our ability to predict emergent phenomena such as abrupt climate change.
[normal]As a result, we’ve lost a generation of climate dynamicists, who have been focused on climate models rather than on
[normal] 
[normal]climate dynamics and theory that is needed to 
[normal]understand the effects of the sun on climate, the network of natural internal variability on multiple time scales, the mathematics of extreme events, and predictability of a complex system characterized by spatio-temporal chaos. New structural forms are ne
[normal]eded for climate models that are capable of simulating the natural internal variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system on timescales from days to millennia and that can accurately account for the fast thermodynamic feedback processes associated wit
[normal]h clouds and water vapor.
[normal]Hoping and expecting to rely on information from climate models about projected regional climate change to guide adaptation response has diverted attention from using observational, historical and paleoclimate data from the region
[normal] to more usefully develop the basis for future scenarios. Further, increased scientific focus on subseasonal (weeks) and seasonal (months) weather/climate forecasts could produce the basis for tactical adaptation practices with substantial societal benefit
[normal]s.
[normal]Securing the common interest on local and regional scales (referred to by Brunner and Lynch as “
[normal]adaptive governance
[normal]”) provides the rationale for effective
[normal] climate adaptation strategies. This requires abandoning the irreducibly global consensus seeking approach in favor of open debate and discussion of a broad range of policy options that stimulate local and regional solutions to the multifaceted and interre
[normal]lated issues surrounding climate change.
[normal]The IPCC needs to get out of the way so that scientists and policy makers can better do their jobs.
[normal]Conclusion[bold]The diagnosis of paradigm paralysis seems fatal in the case of the IPCC, given the widespread nature of 
[normal]the infection and intrinsic motivated reasoning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We need to put down the IPCC as soon as possible – not to protect the patient who seems to be thriving in its own little cocoon, but for the sake of the rest of us whom it is trying to infect with its disea
[normal]se.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Fortunately much of the population seems to be immune, but some governments seem highly susceptible to the disease. However, the precautionary principle demands that we not take any risks here, and hence the IPCC should be put down.
