                                                        Written evidence submitted by Human Rights Watch Human Rights Watch is an independent, international human rights organisation. We work to document human rights abuses in some 90 countries around the world. We expose these abuses through media work and other forms of communication. Through advocacy, we press for changes in policy and practice to better respect, protect and fulfil internationally recognised human rights.  We also work to hold the perpetrators of human rights abuses accountable for their crimes.  Human Rights Watch has been working on Burma for 25 years.  Further material on Burma is available here www.hrw.org/Burma&#xa0;Summary While significant political changes have occurred in Burma in the last two years, parts of the international community, including the UK government, have sometimes overstated the extent of reform already achieved there and understated the scale of the reform challenge that still remains.  We should acknowledge and welcome progress but be wary of premature euphoria. A large proportion of Burma’s population lives in deep poverty, there continues to be very serious human rights abuses, violence against minorities has increased in some parts of the country (especially against Muslims), there is effective impunity for these rights abuses, and the Burmese military still dominates the government and the economy.  If Burma is to transition from a military-dominated autocracy to a rights-respecting democracy, it will require sustained and principled engagement, including pressure, encouragement and practical support from the international community.  The Department for International Development (DFID) and the UK government have an important role to play in this.Consistent with Human Rights Watch’s mandate, we have focused in this submission on the human rights dimensions of the Inquiry’s terms of reference. On these issues, Human Rights Watch recommends that DFID and the UK government press for and support:

[[[do differently? How should it relate to civil society?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1              DFID’s programme in Burma will obviously be developed, to some extent, through cooperation with the Burmese government, which, despite recent reforms, lacks democratic legitimacy, proper accountability to the people of Burma, and retains an authoritarian grip over large parts of Burmese society.  Given this, it is essential that DFID should ensure that its engagement with the Burmese government is principled and underpinned by a clear commitment to the advancement of human rights, good governance, the rule of law, transparency and inclusive development. &#xa0;1.2              It is important that DFID’s programme should involve close consultation with Burmese civil society. Many donors in Burma have a very ‘Rangoon-centric’ view of the reform process that has skewed their work. It is important that DFID’s programmes and its engagement with civil society should go beyond this and include local women’s groups, environmental organisations, and human rights and research groups, which have extensive networks in the more outlying areas. DFID engagement with them could serve an important protection role, especially for groups working on human rights issues, many of whom are still viewed with suspicion by the government and military.  &#xa0;

[[[’s parliament adequate? Should DFID be doing more in this area?]]]              2.1              It is not at all clear whether Burma’s current rulers and the Burmese military are really prepared for the country to transition to genuine democracy in the 2015 elections and to relinquish power, if that is the will of the Burmese people in a free election. A key issue is whether they will agree to remove the military’s quota in the Burmese Parliament, which allocates to them 25 percent of the seats. DFID, the UK government and the wider international community should be pressing the Burmese government strongly on this. The issue of democratic transition also needs to be viewed alongside the political and legislative reform process, opportunities for individuals and groups to associate with others and protest peacefully, and the issue of media freedom. The legal reform process remains opaque and there has been limited consultation with civil society over the drafting of new laws. Moreover, many older laws used to repress the population have not been repealed and some are still used to target community and rights activists.  For example, the Law on Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Processions has been inconsistently used over the last year, with the authorities permitting some demonstrations while denying permission for others.&#xa0;  2.2    In 2013, despite some important legislative reform, basic freedoms of assembly and association remain restrictive, as evidenced by a series of arrests of activists who have demonstrated without prior approval from the authorities.  Over the last year, there have been an increasing number of public protests over land issues. Long-time activist Naw Ohn Lah was sentenced in August to two years in prison for leading a demonstration against the Letpadaung mine project in Monywa, and 11 Arakanese protesters arrested for a demonstration against a Chinese pipeline project were sentenced to six months in prison. &#xa0;2.3   A draft Association Law released in July contained numerous provisions that would have severely restricted the establishment and activities of Burmese and international nongovernmental organizations.  Following coordinated pressure from Burmese civil society, including consultations with the parliament and government, and public letters by over 500 Burmese groups, a new draft was released in August that was much improved, albeit still with the potential to restrict freedom of association. DFID and the UK government should watch this closely and encourage further steps by the Burmese government to uphold the right to freedom of association.&#xa0;2.4   There have been some important steps forward in respect of media freedom over the last year, but these steps have been undermined by proposed new legislation, like the government’s draft Printers and Publishers Act, that has the potential to significantly curtail critical comment in the media by containing provisions for retroactive punishment if published stories are deemed critical of the government

[[[.]]]   The draft telecommunications law, released in 2013, also contains numerous provisions that could limit media freedom

[[[. ]]]But this

[[[ ]]]law was

[[[ ]]]not revised prior to the awarding of two major international contracts to expand Burma’s telecoms sector. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5   Progress on these issues – relating to freedom of association and expression – and Burma’s adherence to international standards is critical to the country’s prospects of democratic transition.   DFID and the UK government should press these issues. They should also press strongly for the establishment of an Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) field presence in Burma, including a number of sites across the country. Burma’s president, Thein Sein, promised to facilitate the establishment of the field presence in a meeting with US President Barack Obama in October 2012, but there has been no progress since.  The OHCHR field presence would strengthen international capacity to monitor human rights conditions across the country and, at least to some extent, help to deter further abuses.&#xa0;2.6              The Burmese Parliament has developed a surprisingly robust culture of debate, but is constrained by limited capacity to scrutinise bills and formulate legislation. DFID’s support for the Parliament should address these issues, enhancing capacity for meaningful legislative scrutiny but also support stronger links between MPs and their constituents, so that grievances from a local level make their way into the national and state/region assemblies. As noted above, a very high priority should be the withdrawal of the military quota in Parliament, as this is the starkest example of the shortcomings of the 2008 constitution. &#xa0;

[[[DFID has initiated significant economic governance work over the last 2 years, including on extractive industries transparency, natural resource management more widely, and public financial management.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ How effective is this work and what should DFID do in future?]]]&#xa0;3.1               Human Rights Watch has serious concerns about the climate for effective management of the country’s vast natural resource wealth for the benefit of Burma’s people. Burma’s government has publicly committed to apply to join the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) by the end of 2013, despite concerns that it is not ready to meet the criteria. If Burma’s government wants to make EITI membership a hallmark of reform, it should make the reforms necessary to facilitate full civil society engagement. DFID could play a useful role in pressing this issue. &#xa0;3.2              Burma’s proceeds from petroleum are set to soar even higher as new oil and gas projects come on-line. Despite some notable improvements, including accounting for petroleum revenues in the country’s budget, reforms remain inadequate. The military retains a disproportionately large budget, as well as access to off-budget income from a network of businesses and an unknown amount in a special slush fund established in 2011. There are credible allegations that, prior to recent reforms, the state oil and gas company’s earnings were kept in secret offshore bank accounts controlled by well-placed individuals. But there has been no indication that the Thein Sein government is seeking to identify or recover stolen assets. This represents another area for potential DFID engagement and pressure.&#xa0;3.3              DFID should further press the Burmese government over abuses linked to the extractive industries, controversies over the allocation of resource revenues in ethnic areas in particular, serious concerns about the quality of public financial management and levels of corruption, and the weakness of existing oversight mechanisms.  This is essential if Burma’s natural resource wealth is to be used to tackle poverty and promote inclusive development.&#xa0;

[[[What role should DFID play in helping to resolve ethnic tensions?]]]&#xa0;4.1              Human Rights Watch is gravely concerned by the levels of ethnic violence in Burma, Communal violence against minority Muslim communities in central Burma spread during 2013, with a series of apparently coordinated attacks against Muslim communities and property. In late March, for example, Buddhist mobs attacked Muslim communities in the central Burmese town of Meiktila resulting in over 44 deaths and 1,400 mostly Muslim owned businesses and houses destroyed. Burmese police forces failed to intervene during much of the violence and in most cases failed to protect Muslim lives or property, and in some instances actively participated in attacks on Muslims. More than 12,000 people were displaced by the violence.4.2              Similar outbreaks of violence were reported in Pegu and Okkan north of Rangoon, and Lashio in Shan State during the year. In October, attacks against Kaman Muslims in the southern part of Arakan State near the town of Thandwe resulted in nearly 100 houses destroyed and at least 6 people killed,  coinciding with a visit by President Thein Sein. 4.3     Legal proceedings against the perpetrators of violence were initially focused on the victim community, with more Muslims being tried and sentenced than Burman Buddhist instigators. However, in June 2013, 25 Buddhists involved in violence in Meiktila were sentenced for murder and arson, and 6 suspects were arrested in July over the killing of Muslim pilgrims in 2012. Forty-four people, including senior members of an Arakanese political party, were arrested days after the violence in Thandwe. To date, however, no members of the security forces have been publicly punished for their involvement in violence. DFID and the UK government should press much more strongly for action on accountability for these killings.4.4              A report published by Human Rights Watch in April 2013 documented crimes against humanity and “ethnic cleansing” against Rohingya Muslims in June and October 2012. A Burmese government-formed commission of inquiry released its report on the violence soon afterwards. But this had serious shortcomings, including a failure to investigate and assign responsibility for the violence, and the failure to make recommendations for prosecution of security forces involved in the violence. In July 2013, President Thein Sein ordered the disbanding of the notoriously abusive and corrupt Na Sa Ka paramilitary border security force, although doubts remain over whether all personnel have been withdrawn from Arakan State or reassigned to other agencies.  4.5              The condition of the displaced Rohingya in northern Arakan State remains dire. An estimated 140,000 mostly Muslims remain in over 40 internally displaced person camps throughout Arakan State, many living in deplorable conditions. These conditions marginally improved with international assistance during 2013, but there are remaining concerns over restricted movement, lack of livelihoods, inadequate basic services, and continued security threats by hostile Arakanese. DFID should be pressing these issues very strongly with the Burmese government. 4.6               Discrimination against the Rohingya and other Muslims also remains systematic. The government repeatedly stated that Rohingya were not eligible for citizenship and reiterated that there was no need to repeal or amend the draconian 1982 Citizenship Law, which effectively denies Rohingya citizenship.  DFID, along with other international donors, is proposing to fund a census in Burma in 2014. While such a census is needed and could allow for a better assessment of the country’s development needs, it should be completely unacceptable for this census to exclude the Rohingya or other minorities, including the hill tribes in the country’s north and east, or to reinforce their non-citizenship. 

[[[What can DFID do to support the peace processes?]]]5.1              A raft of ceasefire agreements between the Burmese government and ethnic minority groups should not obscure continuing tensions and fragility in these areas. In fact, conditions on the ground have not markedly improved for many communities in ceasefire areas, and there are increasing problems with land grabs, displacement, and business deals being reached between the government and ethnic insurgent leaders.  This is an important issue for DFID and the UK government.  DFID should use its influence to encourage an approach to peace that goes beyond the elites on all sides, and involves close community involvement and consultation. 5.2      It is important that DFID should promote the rights of women in the context of the various peace processes underway. Many women in Burma feel that they have been marginalised so far. For example, the government-established Myanmar Peace Center (MPC) has not a single woman working there, and many insurgent groups have little or any women amongst their leadership. &#xa0;5.3    DFID should continue to provide support for displaced communities along the Thailand-Burma border, and prepare for the eventual return of refugees and internally displaced persons in genuine safety and dignity. The same should apply in relation to Kachin State, where an estimated 80,000 people remain displaced as a result of the 2011-2013 conflict&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
