"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Colin TalbotProfessor of Government, University of Manchester (FTF 07)&#xa0;\nSPENDING REVIEWS, BUDGETS AND\n FIXED-\nTERM PARLIAMENTS\n&#xa0;\nThis submission will address one specific aspect of the Inquiry\n terms of reference\n: \n&#xa0;\n“The Spending Review announced in June 2013 covers the 2015/16 financial year only. What discussions can take place in the final year of the current Parliament to prepare\n for the next Spending Review?\n \nWhat scope is there for future Spending Reviews to more closely mirror the term of a Parliament?”\n&#xa0;\nThe submission will widen the scope slightly of this question, to include how Spending Reviews and the whole Finance and Suppl\ny system might be impacted by the changes introduced by the FTP Act.\n&#xa0;\nSPENDING REVIEWS AND BUDGETS\n&#xa0;\nIt is \nvery \nimportant to be clear about the status of Spending Reviews. They are simply ‘statements of intent’ by the government, in effect \nthey have\n the sam\ne status as a White Paper. They are not authorised by Parliament and, apart from the short-lived Fiscal Responsibility Act of Feb 2010\n, Spending Reviews had no legal basis or force.\n&#xa0;\nEach SR only attains real force when it is implemented through subsequen\nt annual Budgets\n. One problematic issue has been that Budgets – and subsequent Supply motions – do not always follow what was set out in the Spending Review for the relevant year. Moreover Governments do not make it clear when they are deviating from the p\nlan set out in the preceding Spending Review.\n&#xa0;\nIn the latter years of the Labour government, and under the Coalition, this situation has become even more complicated as governments have increasingly used the Pre Budget Report (or ‘Autumn Statement’) to mak\ne changes to both tax and spending policies\n, increasingly looking like a mini-budget\n.\n \nAs \nAlistair Darling, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2007 to 2010, remarks that “during my time as Chancellor I had to deliver what were in effect six Budgets”\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSPENDING REVIEWS – THE STORY SO FAR\n&#xa0;\nOn its election in 1997 the New Labour Government announced it was introducing multi-year ‘Spending Reviews’, the first of which would be published \nin the following year\n (1998)\n. These would provide the public spending \nframework for a 3-year period ahead.\n&#xa0;\nThe aims of this innovation were several:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe idea of Governments adopting a medium-term expenditure framework \nis not \nespecially \nnew –\n the World Bank and IMF had\n been promoting this idea to developing countries for many years before the UK decided to experiment with \nit. However few OECD countries had adopted such a reform at the time and there was therefore a great\n deal of interest in the British experiment.\n&#xa0;\nAs promised, Labour duly published its first “Comprehensive Spending Review”\n in J\nuly 1998, setting out departmental budgets for the next three fiscal years (1999-2000 to 2001-02).\n Since then there have been si\nx further Spending Reviews, four under Labour and two under the Coalition. These are set out in \nFigure \n1\n).\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1 The History of Spending ReviewsSpending review – \nyear\n of publication\nPeriod covered (fiscal years\n*\n)\nNumber of years - proposed\nNumber of years - actual\n1998\n1999-2001\n3\n2\n2000\n2001-2003\n3\n2\n2002\n2003-2005\n3\n2\n2004\n2005-200\n7\n3\n3\n2007\n2008-2010\n3\n3\n2010\n2011-2014\n4\n3\n2013\n2014-2015\n2\n2\n*\nThe f\niscal year being April (\nFY\n) to March the following year. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPartly because there is no legislative basis to Spending Reviews, it has been very easy for successive governments to change the process to suit their needs. So far only two S\npending Reviews (2004 and 2007) have \nactually lasted for the period \noriginally specified. In four cases (1998, 2000, 2002, and 2010) the first year of the next Spending Review has \nsuperseded\n the \nlast year of the previous Review, cutting them short. A new g\novernment in May 2015 could overturn most of the final fiscal year of SR2013 if it wished.\n&#xa0;\nHow far this ‘flexibility’ has proved useful or \nundermined the purpose of Spending Reviews is obviously a matter of judgement. During the period of rising public \nexpenditure\n between 1999 and 2004 the procedural irregularities \nreceived scant attention and few complaints. Unsurprisingly those on the receiving end of public expenditure decisions didn’t complain about a little inconsistency as long as budgets were inc\nreasing.\n \nThe period of the two Spending Reviews that did run to full term (2004 and 2007) saw spending stabilise and once the Global Financial Crisis started in 2008 the decision not have a Spending Review in 2009 was widely welcomed.\n&#xa0;\nPerhaps to some surp\nrise the incoming Coalition government of 2010 opted to keep – and even in some ways extend – the use of Spending Reviews. SR2010 sought to plan public spending for an ambitious 4 years ahead (FY2011-2014).\n In the event, these plans only lasted 3 FYs, with the final year (2014) being revised in SR2013.\n \n&#xa0;\nIt could be argued that SRs were and are little more than aspirational, but that is not how they have been ‘sold’ by successive governments. Right from the \nstart we were told that they fundamentally change the way in which Government’s could be held to account by Parliament and the public. \n&#xa0;\nThe Coalition government has been, if anything, even more insistent that it is “sticking to the Plan”. \nBut\n if SRs are m\nerely aspirational guidance\n,\n with no s\nerious intent to implement them, t\nhey would be no different from the ‘forward look’ years in the Public Expenditure Survey (PES) that preceded SRs from the early 1960s to 1997.\n&#xa0;\nThe aim of the Coalition \nin\n using Spendi\nng Reviews was in some ways quite different from the previous government. In a period of austerity, and as they saw it potential fiscal crisis, they sought to use SR2010 as a way of reassuring bond markets that Britain had a credible plan for deficit reduc\ntion. \n&#xa0;\nOf course, having a four-year spending plan would also allow public sector managers to more effectively plan necessary reductions in spending and services, but the over-riding concern seems to have been to have a credible deficit reduction plan.\n&#xa0;\nS\nR2013 \nis an interesting example – it \nillustrates very well some of the issues the Committee is interested in exploring. It clearly became necessary\n a year ‘early’ for two\n reasons. \n&#xa0;\nFirst, the economic and fiscal assumptions that underpinned SR2010 turned \nout to be substantially wrong. The economy more or less flat-lined between 2010 and 2013, with predictable consequences for the public finances. \n&#xa0;\nSecondly, the Coalition government almost certainly came to the conclusion that a Spending Review published i\nn July 2014 (when it would have logically been due) would be far too close to the General Election for the two-Party Coalition to be able to reach agreement on detailed spending plans stretchin\ng well into the next Parliament. A three-year SR in 2014 would \nhave covered FYs 2015-2017, meaning the two parties entering the GE on an agreed public spending platform. This seems highly implausible politically.\n&#xa0;\nThis latter consideration would apply to any future Coalition government in the final stages of a Parliam\nent and make the formulation of an agreed multi-year Spending Review highly unlikely – unless \nwe move to a position where Coalitions continue into and through the GE process, which presently seems unlikely.\n&#xa0;\nOf course there will always be the need for some\n flexibility – events can always derail the best of plans. \nBut any reformed SR system needs to discourage playing political football with the whole SR process and content or it will simply become a meaningless ‘spin’ operation.\n&#xa0;\nBefore turning to the issue\n of SRs in the context of the FTP Act, it is useful to look at the impact of the Act on the Finance and Suppl\ny process – in short the Budget.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBUDGETS AND THE FTP ACT\n&#xa0;\nAt first sight it might seem that the advent of Fixed-term Parliaments would have \nlittle impact on the annual Budget process, except perhaps in Election year (assuming GEs continue to occur in May).\n&#xa0;\nHowever, I would argue that the FTP Act has, inadvertently\n perhaps, introduced a possibly \nprofound constitutional change into the Budget p\nrocess.\n&#xa0;\nStanding Order 48 of the House of Commons states that:\n&#xa0;\n“48. This House will receive no petition for any sum relating to public service or proceed upon any motion for a grant or charge upon public revenue, wh\ne\nther payable out of the Consolidated F\nund or the National Loans fund or out of money to be provided by Parliament, or for releasing or compounding any sum of money owing to the Crown, unless recommended by the Crown.”\n&#xa0;\nThis is basis of a pervasive myth that any vote against the government on a\n finance or supply motion is tantamount to a ‘vote of confidence’. This myth is so powerful that it regularly appears in accounts of UK budget processes in academic texts \n– e.g. \n“The last government defeat over estimates was in 1921 ….. nowadays any amendm\nent would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence.”\n \n(Whener\n p8). P\nerhaps much more importantly – \nthe ‘confidence’ myth\n \nhas been\n \ntaken as accepted wisdom amongst many Parliamentarians over the years.\n&#xa0;\nIn fact, what SO\n48 says is simply that only the Government – the Crown – can propose motions to Parliament to spend money. Technically it does not cover motions to raise taxes, although it has generally been assumed it does. \n&#xa0;\nAs a consequence it is generally accepted tha\nt the only motions that can be moved from the floor of the House on Finance or Supply are amendments to either reduce or remove proposals for taxes or spending.\n But it is also often thought (an idea encouraged by government’s of all stripes) that any such \namendment would be an issue of confidence. And indeed, prior to the FTP Act, what constituted an issue of confidence was essentially flexible and open to the government of the day to decide.\n&#xa0;\nDespite the prevalent myth there have been some attempts to amen\nd spending or tax proposals \n– there have been about 20 Government defeats on such amendments over the past hundred years or so, none leading to the fall of a government or even been seen as a ‘confidence’ issue. An unknown number of other amendments have b\neen put forward but accepted by the government, or withdrawn before a vote.\n&#xa0;\nWhatever the veracity or prevalence of the myth of amendments to Finance or Supply being a ‘confidence’ issue before the FTP Act, it should now be firmly dead and buried. The FTP \nAct lays out in precise terms what a vote of (no) confidence in the government of the day should look like, even s\ntipulating the words to be used and the exact consequences.\n&#xa0;\nAt the moment therefore, any vote to amend Finance or Supply to reduce or remove \na tax or spending proposal would definitely \nnot\n be a confidence issue.\n&#xa0;\nThis opens up the definite possibility that the Opposition, or any party in a Coalition that wishes to embarrass its allies, \nor indeed any individual MP, \ncan move amendments to Finance\n or Supply without any fear of causing the fall of the government or triggering a General Election.\n Whilst such moves would still be constrained by SO48 in relation to spending, it is also entirely possible motions to amend Finance (tax) proposals could be\n moved to increase or raise new taxes.\n&#xa0;\nIt has always been unclear how or why the executive’s essential monopoly over tax and spending decisions emerged – there is no real constitutional justification for not allowing Parliament to revise or advise on thes\ne issues, as it does on legislation. It appears to be simply another example of how lop-sided our constitutional conventions have become, in favour of the executive.\n&#xa0;\nThis raises the spectre of Budget debates becoming much more contentious and even the pro\nspect \nthat\n a sitting government could see its plans amended or overturned by majorities in the Commons.\n More positively, it could create a much more\n systematic role for Parliament, as will be discussed below.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSPENDING REVIEWS AND THE FTP ACT – THE \nFUTURE\n&#xa0;\nThe principle behind Spending Reviews – that medium term planning of public expenditure programs brings many benefits – is a good one. It has potential also for providing for a more structured political debate and decision making processes that wou\nld present electors, parliamentarians and governments with more transparent and \nclear choices. Spending Reviews cannot, and should not, take politics out of public spending decisions, but they can, in conjunction with changes implicit in fixed term parliam\nents, make for a better political process.\n&#xa0;\nAligning Spending cycles with Parliamentary cycles.&#xa0;\nThe first and most obvious reform would be to align the public spending process with the electoral cycle.\n&#xa0;\nAssuming elections continue to be held in May, an in\ncoming government could first introduce a Budget in June/July to am\nend plans for the existing year. It could\n then\n \npublish a proposed Spending Review in \nOctober to cover the following 3\n fiscal years.\n During the third year of this Review period, it could pub\nlish a new Spending review covering the next two-years, as illustrated\n in \nFigure \n2\n below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure 2 Possible Spending Review Cycle alignment with Parliamentary cycle.Year 1May GEYear 2Year 3Year 4Year 5Year 6May GE2015-162016-172017-182018-192019-202020-21June Budget\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOct SR\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJune SR\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJune Budget\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOct SR\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis is of course what has more or less happened in the current Parliament. The 3 or 2-year period is also what has happened in practice in the 7 Spending Reviews since 1998. So in a sense, this would be nothing new - it would simply codi\nfy \nand regularise \nwhat has evolved in practice\n and seems to work\n.\n&#xa0;\nSpending Reviews could be published in draft form and subjected to Parliamentary scrutiny via the Select Committee system.&#xa0;One of the issues not discussed so far is the degree to which SRs have, in practice\n, concentrated even more power in the hands of HM Treasury. Few observers would dissent from the view that they have given HMT and the Chancellor much greater control over departmental budgets. Even devices like the much vaunted ‘end-year-flexibility’ have\n been operated within tight Treasury reins. Moreover the whole spending process has been just as – if not more –secretive than before, and with less justification. \n&#xa0;\nIn past Budget day announcements could move markets, because \nthe overall fiscal stance of \nthe Government was announced alongside detailed spending and tax plans. This was at least some justification for Budget ‘purdah’. However, since SRs were introduced the Government sets out its broad fiscal position in the Autumn Statement preceding the SR \n– announcing the size of the public spending cake to be fought over in the SR. The SR announcement simply says how the cake is to be divided up after an almost completely hidden decision process. It has no effect on markets.\n&#xa0;\nAs I have been arguing since t\nhe early 2000s, \nthe \ninnovation\n of Spending Reviews should have provided the opportunity\n to open this whole process up and\n for improved Parliamentary scrutiny of spending plans.\n The process should be fairly \nstraightforward\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe government publishes a draf\nt Spending Review\n,\n within the parameters \nfor a public spending envelope set out in the\n preceding Autumn Statement. Each departmental Select Committee looks in detail at proposals for spending in its area. They invite evidence and opinion from interested pa\nrties.\n Each\n can then\n \nreport\n, \nbased on the evidence presented, \nmaking recommendations to amend, or not, proposed spending plans.\n&#xa0;\nThis would go\n a long way\n towards alleviating what King and Crewe\n recently called the “deficit of deliberation” i\nn public \npolicy decision-making – of which public spending decisions are arguably one of the most important.\n&#xa0;\nAll main Parties Spending and Finance proposals could be subject to scrutiny by the OBR before General Elections&#xa0;\nLabour has recently proposed that the OBR\n be involved in auditing the spending plans of all the main Parties in the run up to the next GE. This idea was welcomed by the Chair of the OBR and Public Accounts Committee \nwhen they spoke recently in \nManchester.\n&#xa0;\nAgain, there se\nems to be a fairly obvious time-\ntable for this. At the time of the Pre-Budget report (usually November) before the year of a GE, the main opposition Party or Parties should be invited to outline their approach to the first SR of the next parliament\n, includ\ning spending and fiscal policies. In the event of there being a Coalition government \nin office\n, this would also be the time when the Coalition partners could – if they wised – set out their independent tax and spend policies.\n&#xa0;\nThe OBR should then be tasked\n with assessing the policy statement and producing a report on each at the time of the March Budget, shortly before the formal GE process begins.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAligning Government financial statements.&#xa0;\nAn important technical change would be helpful alongside these pr\nocedural changes. \n&#xa0;\nDespite HM Treasury’s so-called ‘alignment project’ it is still difficul\nt for Parliamentarians and members\n of the public to “follow the money” \nthrough the various stages of public spending decisions: Spending Reviews; Budgets; Finance a\nnd Supply; and finally departmental (and whole of government) accounts. If we are to have a more integrated and predictable public spending decision-making process it is essential more progress is made on this front.\n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSION\n&#xa0;\nThe benefits of a Fixed-Te\nrm Parliament should not be limited to the political realm – it should also help to improve government. Fundamental to this would be to have a more ordered, predictable and open decision making process for public spending and fiscal policy. The fact that s\nuccessive Governments, of different complexions and in very different circumstances have found the idea of some form of medium\n-term framework helpful suggests it is useful. Fixed term Parliaments opens an opportunity to make it even more so.\n \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n \nThe 2010 Act was repealed by the incoming Coalition government in the \nBudget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011\n.\n \nA Darling (2011) Back from the Brink, \nAtlantic Books, London. p38.\n \nTwo of the seven Spending Reviews published so far have had the prefix “Comprehensive” attached to them (1998 and 2007).
