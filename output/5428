default&#xa0;defaultThe policy imperativedefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“The original tax policy aim was to place members of LLPs in the same position for tax purposes as partners in a traditional partnership.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“There is evidence that the current rules are not producing the desired policy outcome across a range of sectors and income groups. At one end of the scale, groups of low paid workers who would normally be regarded as employees are being taken on as LLP members as a condition for their obtaining work. Unlike becoming a 
defaultmember of a traditional partnership, accession to membership of an LLP is not likely to be seen as a career aspiration or sign of status. This may instead have downsides such as the loss of certain benefits and protections associated with employment. In some cases, employees of a company are being transferred wholesale to the LLP as members.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default“At the other end of the scale, individuals who would normally be regarded as employees in high-salaried professional areas such as the legal and financial services sectors are benefitting from self-employed status for tax purposes as a consequence of the arrangements in place, which then leads to a loss of employment taxes payable.” 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“Fundamentally, this consultation is about levelling the playing field. It will have no impact on those partnerships or LLP members that use partnership structures as Parliament originally intended.”

default&#xa0;
default“A member of an LLP shall not be regarded for any purpose as employed by the LLP unless, 
defaultif he and the other members were partners in a partnership, he would be regarded for that purpose as employed by the partnership.

defaultOur response concentrates on the disguised remuneration parts of the consultation rather than the hybrid LLP aspects of the new regime.  We have concerns about some
default 
defaultof the rules relating to the latter and we will be taking these up directly with HMRC.  We do not propose to deal with them in this document.
