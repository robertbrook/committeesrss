[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]. 
[normal]This further inquiry is timely. We’re in the pre-election phase of the political cycle at Westminster. Partisanship strengthens, commitment to parliament’s corporate goals may weaken and ministers’ and whips’ sensitivity to criticism grows more acute. Now is a moment to anticipate the expansion of scrutiny of the executive in the next parliament by embedding the Wright reforms, and using the post-2010 performance of select committees to push for more.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Thanks, to the work of the Public Accounts, Treasury and Public Administration committees, we know much more about strains within the executive, particularly yawning gaps in civil service capacity, deficits in the conventional model of ministerial performance and dysfunctions both in policy making and securing effectiveness, efficiency and economy in central government operations. Add to those the pending effects on Whitehall and Westminster of further devolution within the United Kingdom, let alone Scottish independence and the prospect of large-scale revision of the relationship of the UK and the European Union. Select committee examination of executive performance is both a cause of the widespread sense of crisis for Whitehall’s old verities and a source of remedies and reforms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] But that prospect depends on select committee behaviour and capacity.

[normal] This submission rests on my regular commentary and reportage on Whitehall and public management. I have not included specific references. Much material is available at

[normal]Committee capacity[bold].
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The post-2010 performance of select committees is commendable. They are now a ‘power in the land’, attracting more attention and not just for showcase hearings. Select committee chairs have become a new class of political personality, enjoying positive reputations and autonomous standing; they generate trust in the system and, as important, the system’s capacity to police itself through scrutiny.

[normal]Conclusion.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The fate of select committees for the rest of this decade and perhaps beyond is to help deal with financial stringency by reshaping and refitting government – by scrutinising what government does with vigour and the practical knowledge that comes from seeing how policies affect members’ constituents day in, day out. 
[normal] That implies much of the business of select committees will be financial. From that follows the salience of committees and inquiries that specialise in the financial function and the necessity of joining up scrutiny of the effectiveness and efficiency of spending with examinations of policy intentions and delivery. It may also imply the need for all select committee members to be more financial literate – for the NAO to offer basic instruction in accounting and the UK Statistics Authority basic grounding in statistics and data analysis. 
[normal] Another conclusion is about parliament seeing itself both as unique, which of course it is as the fountainhead of democratic participation and procedure, and as part of a conjoint effort to improve governance. Select committees are – ought to be – umbilically linked to the specialists in the NAO, OBR and UK Statistics Authority. Parliament might at some stage want to rationalise that architecture. One day MPs might, like in other countries, want to establish a performance and budget office inside the legislature. For the time being, much more could be done to link together the energy and political acumen displayed by select committees and the professional knowledge and disinterestedness of these external scrutineers.
