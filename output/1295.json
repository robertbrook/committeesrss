"&#xa0;\nHastoe is a rural specialist housing association and has developed affordable homes for local people in more than 200 villages across the south of England.  Most of these schemes are on rural exception sites.\nLocal transport is a significant factor in determining our residents’ quality of life.  Poor transport links can limit their ability to work, to access training, health care, quality food and their ability to maintain social networks.\n  \nOur experience is that rural public transport where we build homes is often irregular and inconvenient.  \nThrough our social media channels, we asked residents how effectively Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities and how they could be improved.\n2.1              \nWe have one bus that runs on a Tuesday from the village however I'm not sure it's times, Spreyton is located \n four \nmiles from the main bus route and is about as rural as you can get! \n \nFour roads into the village \n- \nall single track. Hastoe own\ns\n \nnine\n houses here with only \ntwo\n households unable to drive but with family members that help. \n \nWhilst \nW\nhiddon \nD\nown is our closest bus route with buses every hour, getting there is the real issue especially in the winter months when cycling or walking isn't an option. \n2.2              \nThe answer here in Upottery is very badly.  O\nne bus once a day.... it only gives you approx\nimately one and a half \nh\nou\nrs in the local town before you have to catch it again to come back. There is also a bus which takes you in to the local \nc\nity\n…\n that is once a week. Transport provision in our rural area is abominable.\n  The\n nearest town is \nsix\n miles away!\n  Y\nou need to be able to drive to work and to enable you to get about.\n2.3              \n Community transport services only partially meet my needs - they never run in the evenings, Sundays or public holidays. They also only run to certain places on certain days. They are not actually that 'flexible'. \n \nStandard bus services were good but expensive here before the cuts\n.\nThey could be improved by\n re-introducing bus subsidies (scrapped by Somerset County Council in 2011) so standard/community services can run to cover these times. For example, last year, on the Queen's jubilee weekend, there were no services for \nfour\n days because of the public holidays.\nDespite the current vogue for 'community transport' it's definitely not the cure-all for rural isolation - people need regular, reasonable services for essential trips - like getting to work - and community transport just can't meet that need\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.4              \nThe bus service is unreliable, well what \nSunday\n service\n?\n When it snowed they were unable to travel through the village.\n3.1              Hastoe gives serious consideration to the transport implications for residents when assessing potential development sites\n to ensure new residents are not isolated from the community.\n3.2              Some rural communities have established community-owned and based rural transport which provides such key transport services where the public and private sectors have failed. \nIn our experience these range from share a car services to more sophisticated transport services based on timetables.\nAn alternative to investing in transport services is to support the development of community based services and facilities.\n4.1              \nHastoe’s rural housing management model is based on taking our services to the communities we serve rather than relying on them coming to us.  We have a mobile housing management team who tour our rural schemes and we operate a multi-function ‘Hastoe to you’ bus.  This brings a wide range of services to our rural communities including roadshows on specific subjects such as welfare reform or money management (promotion of credit unions over moneylenders and pay day loan companies).\n4.2              \nSupporting the burgeoning network of community owned shops through working alongside the Plunkett Foundation.  Community based shops not only provide local people with food and goods that they would otherwise need to travel to purchase, but also act as a social space while keeping volunteers active within their community.\n4.3              \nSupporting the development of Village Agents.  This is \nan innovative response to a recognised need that many people living in our rural communities are unable to connect with the key services that help maintain well-being and support their quality of life. \nThe Somerset Village Agents Project was launched in January 2012 and builds on a tried and tested concept originating in Gloucestershire. \nIssues dealt with include: \ntransport needs, \naccess to benefits, consumer advice, debt advice, health and social care, housing issues, safety concerns, services such as libraries and relationship issues\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1              \nTax incentives (vehicle licence) for \nthose \nproviding share a lift services and, potentially, rural taxi firms.\n5.2              \nGreater use of the internet to promote and support car pooling.\n5.3              \nBusiness rates relief for rural food shops and post offices.\n5.4              \nGreater co-ordination of regional services (particularly employment, benefit advice etc) so that they access existing mobile facilities such as the Hastoe to you bus.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
