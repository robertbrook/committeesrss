&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; June 2011 was when the Commission wrote to Departments inviting them to submit candidates for the next cycle of SLR work starting in 2012. &#xa0;There has been no further request made since then. &#xa0;Departments are, however, free to submit candidates at any time. &#xa0;Indeed the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 2013 contained a number of repeals submitted by Departments and others after the work leading up to that Act had started. &#xa0;In other words, there is a rolling programme of SLR work carried out at the Commission, which Departments and others can contribute to at any time. &#xa0;Obviously, if it is left too late in the run up to a Bill, it will be impossible to process it in time for that Bill and instead it would be picked up as part of our next cycle of work.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are not aware that the Better Regulation Executive has ever sent the Commission any suggestions for repealing obsolete legislation.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our research shows that 20 Legislative Reform Orders have been made pursuant to the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. &#xa0;With three exceptions we have found no evidence that the Commission was consulted on any of them. &#xa0;The exceptions are the Legislative Reform (Limited Partnerships) Order 2009 (which implemented a Law Commission proposal and so involved input from the Commission), the Legislative Reform (Health and Safety Executive) Order 2008 and the Legislative Reform (Local Government) (Animal Health Functions) Order 2009.  The Commission did not respond to the latter two consultations. 1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our research also examined the position under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, which was superseded by the 2006 Act. &#xa0;Of the 30 Regulatory Reform Orders made under the 2001 Act, the only evidence that we have found that the Commission was consulted on any of them relates to two orders that implemented Law Commission proposals. &#xa0;In conducting our research we used information provided by the LexisNexis website.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Law Commission has been reviewed a number of times over the years. Each time it has been reviewed all of its functions have been retained. The most recent review is a Triennial Review. Stage 1 of the review has been completed and the outcome reported to Parliament (to which you have referred in your footnote). &#xa0;The characteristics enjoyed by the Commission in terms of its independence, impartiality and expertise apply to its SLR function as they do to the Commission’s more general law reform functions.  Respondents to the Triennial Review who commented on the Commission’s SLR function were overwhelmingly in support of this area of the Commission’s work. The following is an extract from the report by the Ministry of Justice on Stage 1 in relation to the Statute Law Repeal function (paras 50-52):This function has an important role in reducing regulation and red tape, helping to remove unnecessary law and making the statute book more accessible for individuals and businesses applying it. For example, as noted above, the most recent Statute Law (Repeals) Bill included tax law provisions from 2010 that had been overtaken by subsequent changes but were still technically in force and therefore a potential source of confusion. This function of removing obsolete and unnecessary legislation complements the Government’s Red Tape Challenge process, which aims to identify and remove legislation that, while still in active use, is deemed unnecessary and unhelpful.There was some limited discussion of the value of the repeals function among a few respondents to the call for evidence. This minority felt that the function was not perhaps the best use of limited resources, as obsolete law has no practical effect and therefore does no harm. However, as with other functions, most respondents were in favour of its retention. This was not only based on the principle of rule of law and the benefits of an accessible statute book but also reflected the fact that the function remains in regular use, an argument borne out by the function’s links to Government priorities. As the volume of statute law passed in 2009 alone stood at 23 Acts and 2247 pages, the need for repeal is likely to remain in future.1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In relation to the Law Commission’s functions as a whole the report concluded (para 55):The overwhelming weight of evidence from respondents to the call for evidence is in favour of retaining all of the Commission’s substantive functions. The Government agrees with this conclusion, in view of the clear contribution these functions make to the development of better and more effective law.1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is important to grasp that the SLR work carried out by the Commission relates solely to the repeal of laws that are obsolete or otherwise no longer of practical utility. &#xa0;For that reason, the Commission's evidence on the draft Deregulation Bill relates solely to the provisions in the Bill (clauses 50 to 57 and Schedule 16) that are concerned with the repeal of laws of this kind. &#xa0;Most of the Bill appears to relate to the freeing of businesses and individuals from "red tape" and unnecessary burdens. &#xa0;That amounts to the repeal of laws that are actually having an effect whereas the Commission's SLR work is concerned with the repeal of laws that have no effect even though they remain in force as a matter of law.1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As to how long it might take the Commission to run a project to repeal the sort of obsolete laws that appear in Schedule 16, our SLR Bills typically contain around 10 topics or projects and we estimate that these take between 4 and 12 months to complete, depending on the size and complexity of the topic.&#xa0;A topic can cover very many individual pieces of legislation. For example, the tax legislation topic in the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 2013 repealed 56 Acts in whole or part. The railways topic in the same Act repealed 297 Acts1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Each SLR project starts with research, moves onto consultation on the research, and finishes in the form of a report and draft Bill to the Justice Secretary. &#xa0;The research tests each repeal candidate (there may be well over a hundred in any repeals project) to check whether it is of any practical utility. &#xa0;This will include checking Parliamentary records including the original debates on the candidate, examining other public records, and studying a range of legal and historical works to provide context and background information. &#xa0;The research is then written up and issued as a consultation paper to persons in central or local government, in industry or elsewhere who may be in a position to examine and comment on the repeal proposals. Typically we will consult for up to 3 months, dealing with enquiries and responses during that time. After the consultation period has closed we move into producing the draft Bill and report which is sent to the Justice Secretary for introduction into the legislative process. The Law Commission’s written evidence provides more information on the special legislative procedure that applies to its Statute Law (Repeals) Bills.1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposals referred to are those set out in the Law Commission's evidence to the Committee in paragraphs 37 to 41. &#xa0;They relate to (1) improved communications between Government and the Commission, (2) the possibility of more frequent SLR Bills, and (3) using SLR Bills to revoke secondary legislation where this is appropriate.1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To the best of our knowledge, Departments have not asked us to consider the revocation&#xa0;of the Grey Squirrels (Prohibition of Importation and Keeping) Order 1937.&#xa0; However, both that order and the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932 are under review as part of the Commission's Wildlife law reform project.&#xa0;&#xa0;The Commission is not concerned with any other provision in Schedule 11 to the Bill.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 2010 the Law Commission has engaged with Members of the House of Commons on a number of levels. 1.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In June 2010 the Chairman, Law Commissioners and Chief Executive were present at an event held in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to welcome the new intake of MPs to Parliament. We have since hosted a consultation event of our own in Parliament in October 2013, to which we invited over 100 Parliamentarians.1.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have twice staged exhibitions in the Houses of Parliament (February 2011, October 2013, providing opportunities for MPs and Peers to find out about the work we do and meet the Chairman, Commissioners and Chief Executive of the Commission.1.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Law Commissioners have given evidence at a number of Select and Special Public Bill Committees:(1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2010 January: Special Public Bill Committee, Third Party (Rights against Insurers) Bill(2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2011 November: Health Select Committee, Adult Social Care(3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2011 October: Special Public Bill Committee, Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Bill(4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2011 November: Justice Select Committee, Joint Enterprise(5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2012 November: Special Public Bill Committee, Trusts (Capital and Income) Bill(6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2012 December: Consolidation Bills Joint Committee, Statute Law (Repeals) Bill(7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2013 October: Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, inquiry into ensuring the standards in the quality of legislation(8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2013 January: Joint Committee on Draft Care and Support Bill (9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2013 October: BIS Select Committee, Consumer Rights Bill(10)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2013 October: Joint Committee, Draft Deregulation Bill(11)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2013 October: Transport Select Committee, Level Crossings Report&#xa0;1.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our engagement with All Party Parliamentary Groups has included meetings with the APPGs for Insurance and Financial Services, and for Consumer Affairs.1.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commissioners engage with Ministers responsible for the policy areas within which our projects fall. 1.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have also had contact with Parliamentarians taking forward our recommendations in Private Members Bills, notably The Rt Hon Sir Greg Knight MP regarding the Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011. In May 2010, September 2012 and October 2013, we wrote to the Ministers whose new portfolios included areas of law under review by the Law Commission. 1.19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In summer 2010 the Chairman invited all Parliamentarians to take part in the consultation for our 11th Programme of law reform. 1.20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Other engagement takes place on an individual level. 1.21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Members of Parliament were invited to the Leslie Scarman Lecture in January 2012 and to a stakeholder event we held in November 2011. 1.22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Chairman and Commissioners attend various events at which Parliamentarians are represented, for example, the annual&#xa0;British Insurance Brokers parliamentary reception, which members of the IFS APPG attend together with Treasury Ministers.1.23&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also have an ongoing presence on www.politicshome.com, the “most read, commercial, political news website in Parliament”.1.24&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The projects most directly concerned with land use in England and Wales that the Commission has been involved in since 2010 are the following.(1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Easements, covenants and profits a prendre. The Law Commission published its report on 8th June 2011 and is waiting for the Government’s response.(2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Electronic Communications Code. The Law Commission published its report on 28th February 2013 and is waiting for the Government’s response.(3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Rights to light. This is a current project. We expect to report by the end of 2014.(4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Conservation covenants. This is a current project. We expect to report by the end of May 2014.1.25&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Further details on all these projects can be found on the Law Commission’s website.
