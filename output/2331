[normal]Written evidence from the National Pensioners Convention[bold] (TIC 108)[bold]1. INTRODUCTION
[normal]1.1 The National Pensioners Convention (NPC) is Britain's largest pensioner organisation 
[normal]representing around 1.5m older people, active in over 1000 affiliated groups. The NPC is run by 
[normal]and for pensioners and campaigns for improvements to their income, health and welfare.
[normal]1.2 This outline submission by P.G.Rayner FCILT and Vice President of NPC
[normal] is not detailed as NPC 
[normal]is not resourced for a detailed submission of this complexity.
[normal]1.3. Whilst recognising the Inquiry is not focused solely on older people it must be recognised 
[normal]that older people make up a substantial user of Rural Transport.
[normal]2 
[normal]SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. (Bullet points 1 to 6)
[normal]2.1. As stated in 1.2 above it is not possible to answer the specifics without considerable 
[normal]research. That research NPC is trying to commission if funds (3k) can be found. The need is to 
[normal]establish the position nat
[normal]ionwide because the provision varies location by location with regard 
[normal]to what is loosely described as "Community Transport". In some places this is free, in others a 
[normal]charge is made, albeit to cover costs of volunteer people et al. Nevertheless it means in 
[normal]effect 
[normal]that a disabled or PRM (Person of reduced Mobility) older citizen is disadvantaged as the use of 
[normal]the Bus Pass is not permitted on many community transport schemes.
[normal]2.2 Local Bus and sometimes Train Services are reduced and this is happening at the s
[normal]ame time as Post Offices are closing along with other previously provide facilities, drop in centres, local 
[normal]group meetings, all of which funds are being withdrawn from.
[normal]2.3 With the cessation of Taxi card, Dial a Ride, Post Bus etc. which co
[normal]mpounds many of the 
[normal]problems it means the most vulnerable in society are disadvantaged.
[normal]2.4 The summation of the questions posed by the Committee lead inexorably to one question, 
[normal]that of cost. Setting aside clich√©s like "Main Challenges" and " Identify Demand" the real 
[normal]question is Bullet Point 6 which comes down simply to how do you fund transport in isolated 
[normal]communities.
[normal]2.5 The simple answer is that society has to accept that giv
[normal]e older people Inclusion and the 
[normal]provision of adequate transport is part of that Inclusion, they are able to contribute.
[normal]2.6 Not all older people are without some disposable income which they will spend in the Towns 
[normal]and villages, if they can get there. Older person's health and well-being is better which is a cost 
[normal]benefit to NHS. Car usage is reduced which has environmental advantages.
[normal]2.7 Most importantly by the mobility Inclusion brings older people do much voluntee
[normal]r work of 
[normal]great financial benefit to the wider society.
[normal]2.8 Attached is some research solely directed at assessing that value. It is acknowledged that 
[normal]the example is not of a rural nature but the principle is the same. There are also other erudite 
[normal]examples
[normal] of research which are available to illustrate this point.
[normal]2.9 It is essential adequate Rural Transport is provide for if by that Inclusion older people are 
[normal]able to leave their homes they will not be seen as tomorrows problem but part of tomorrows 
[normal]solution
[normal].
