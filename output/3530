defaultHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the 
defaultPublic Administration
default Select Committee inquiry 
defaultinto 
defaultcrime statistics.
default&#xa0;
defaultHMIC is an independent body which inspects 
defaultand reports on 
defaultthe efficiency and effectiveness of policing in England and Wales on behalf of the public. We conduct inspections on a range of issues 
default–
default both on our
default own, and 
defaultjointly 
defaultwith other inspectorates in the criminal justice system.

defaultA
defaultn inspection of the 
defaultintegrity of police recorded crime is an important part of HMIC’s current inspection programme. The inspection will answer
default the question
default 
default’
defaultto what extent can police recorded crime information be trusted
default’
default and 
defaultwe 
defaultwill publish a full report 
defaultin autumn 2014.

default 
defaultThis ensures:
default&#xa0;
defaultHMIC
default has therefore undertaken a programme of work over a number of years to test 
defaultaspects of whether crimes are being recorded by the police when they should be, and categorised correctly. 
defaultSome of this work 
defaultassessed
default accuracy in recording particular crimes, and some 
defaultwas concerned with
default particular aspects of the crime and incident reportin

default&#xa0;
default1.
default4
default 
defaultBased on examination of a small sample of crime and incident records in each of the 43 Home Office-funded forces, 
defaultHMIC
default 
defaultfound
default 
defaultthat the majority of forces 
defaultwere correctly
default recording crimes based on the information available within an incident record
default. However,
default 
defaultthis conclusion mask

defaultin 
defaultthe 
defaultaccuracy

default: 
default18 forces correctly recorded crime
defaults in 95% or more of cases; 15 forces did so in between 90 and 94% 
defaultof 
defaultcases; and 11 forces in between 86 and 89% of cases.
default 
defaultThis
default 
defaultcould mean 
defaultforces that made poorer decisions

defaultould have

defaulton the ac
defaultcuracy of published crime statistics
default (although 
defaultit should be noted that 
defaultthe size of the sample used in this inspection was too small to make any definite statements on this – it was used instead as an indicator of where there might be issues)

default)
default was found to be subject to a marked

default6
default In
default February 2013, the Pol
defaultice and 
defaultCrime Commissioner for Kent co
defaultmmissioned HMIC to conduct an inspection to determine whether the people of Kent can have confidence in the force’s crime figures. 
defaultThis inspection resulted in the publication of the HMIC report 
defaultCrime recording in Kent – A repo
defaultrt commissioned by the Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent
default 
default in June 201
default3
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default7
default This inspection found that appreciably more need
defaulted
default to be done before the people of Kent c
defaultould
default be confident that the crime and resolution figures published by the force 
defaultwe
defaultre 
defaultas accurate as they should be. HMIC found that the force had under-recorded approximately one in every ten crimes
default,
default and that 
defaultit
default d
defaultid
default not interpret the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) correctly, 
defaultmeaning
default crimes 
defaultwe
defaultre not correctly recorded
default. 
defaultI
defaultt is important to
default note that the findings for Kent cannot be extrapolated to make judgments regarding the accuracy of crime recording in other forces
default, as the methodology was specific to th
defaulte force area
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.
default8
default While Kent Police had made improvements to the way it dealt with t
defaulthe declassification of recorded crimes (
defaultno
default-
defaultcriming)
default,
default and had reduced the total number of occasions 
defaultwhere
default 
defaultthis occurred, we found that the decision to do so was 
defaultstill 
defaultincorrect in more than 25% of the cases reviewed. 
defaultIt 
defaultwas of particular concern 
default– 
defaultand unacc
defaulteptable 
default–
default that this inaccuracy was evident in cases of rape, robber
defaulty and violence
default.

default. It

default 
default2.3 
defaultOther
default aspects 
defaultwhich HMIC reported as being the most 
defaultinfluential in maintaining standards in recording crime were: good governance and supervision; and knowledgeable staff – in particular, an objective force crime registrar with strong influence over local crime recording decisions, to ensure these were not 
defaultunduly influenced by the pressure to achieve certain outcomes.
default We concluded that: “The final responsibility for HOCR compliance should not, therefore, be vested in the same individuals as are accountable for crime reduction and detection” (para 5.6).
defaultForgdefaulting the Links – Rape investigation and prosecution (2012)default2.4 In this report (which was conducted jointly with HM Inspectorate of the Crown Prosecution Service), HMIC found that there were wide variations across forces in the number of rapes that remained on the system (and so were investigated) compared to those
default that were ‘no crimed’ (i.e. removed from the crime recording system because the police decide that a crime has not been committed). We 
defaultstated
default that 
default“
defaulti
defaultn the past performance pressures may have influenced forces
default’
default approaches to either the initial recording or
default subsequent levels 
defaultof ‘no crimes’ for rape offending” (para 1.29), and advocated instead a regime that places equal emphasis on
default 
defaultan analysis of rape crimes and associated intelligence
default as on low offending levels
default, 
defaultwhich would act
default as an encouragement to retain
default crime records on the system.

defaultThis role is a requirement detailed in the

default,
default which states
default (in section 4.2)
default:
defaultTo ensure the NCRS is maintained within the force, and to provide greater consistency within and across forces, each force should appoint an FCR to act as final arbiter for the audit process; the interpretation of the counting rules; and for ensuring the o
defaultutcome from investigations into those crimes is correctly recorded. The FCR must be outside operational line command and answerable to the chief officer with overall responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of crime recording processes. To ensure that
default the responsibilities of the post are effectively met, a deputy or other identified person should be appointed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultkey
default tasks of an FCR are: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is full recognition
default 
defaultthat the FCR role and responsibilities continue to evolve over time.

default Our 2012

defaultd
default a strong FCR, who act
defaulted
default as the final arbiter for disputes 
defaultin respect of 
defaultthe interpretation of the counting rules and enjoy
defaulted
default clear, unequivocal chief officer support. Indeed, evidence from the review indicated that 34 of the 44 forces reviewed claimed to
default have sufficiently strong, independent FCRs, with clear chief officer support.
default 
defaultHowever, 
defaultHMIC 
defaultfound limited evidence of forces directly assessing whether their own crime quality audits provided confidence that their crime figures gave an accurate account o

default 
defaultI
defaultn 2012
default,
default 
defaultHMIC also reported 
defaultthat 
defaultevidence strongly supports the notion that leadership, supervision and oversight help attain good crime and incident data quality. Strong and effective leadership is therefore a critical component in raising standards. 
defaultEqually, where there is the slightest
default doubt as to the chief officer’s expectation 
defaultin relation to
default crime and incident data quality, standards will inevitably slip.

defaultpolice

defaultT
defaulthe work of the Crime Statistics Advisory Committee (CSAC)
default,
default as an independent advisor on matters related to the measurement of crime

default and the collection and presentation of crime data
default,
default is welcomed.
default The rest of this answer focuses on what HMIC has done (and is doing) to ensure the integrity of this data. 
default4.2 
defaultCrime data and crime recording are 
defaultcomplex areas of policing,
default and there continues to be a need for greater clarity and understandi
defaultng. Therefore, 
defaultHMIC has 
defaultinspected police crime data integrity for a number of years
default. 
defaultThis has included inspections dedicated
default specifically
default 
defaultto crime data
default,
default as well as integrating consideration of crime data accuracy within other formal inspection activity

defaultch as HMIC inspections of the approach taken by police forces to deal

default In addition to the formal crime data integrity programme
default,
default 
defaultHer Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary (HMIs) routinely monitor the performance of police forces

defaultas regards
default 
defaultthe integrity of data

default This 
defaulthelps to

default Routine monitoring identifies 
defaultpotential

defaultissues for closer scrutiny. Some of these will be out

default When a crime has been recorded, it can only be declassified (which is referred to as ‘no-crimed’) if the strict criteria set out in the HOCR apply. No-crimes account for approximately 3-4% of overall recorded crime. No-criming is an important part of the 
defaultHOCR as it caters for situations where the original decision to record a crime clearly turns out to be wrong (for example, where someone reports to the police that their car has been stolen from a multi-storey car park, only to find it later on a different
default floor). While it is appropriate for some cases to be no-crimed, when this is done incorrectly it can mean that suspects may not be brought to justice and the force’s published crime figures will be inaccurate.
