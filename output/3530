[normal]Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the 
[normal]Public Administration
[normal] Select Committee inquiry 
[normal]into 
[normal]crime statistics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HMIC is an independent body which inspects 
[normal]and reports on 
[normal]the efficiency and effectiveness of policing in England and Wales on behalf of the public. We conduct inspections on a range of issues 
[normal]–
[normal] both on our
[normal] own, and 
[normal]jointly 
[normal]with other inspectorates in the criminal justice system. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]n inspection of the 
[normal]integrity of police recorded crime is an important part of HMIC’s current inspection programme. The inspection will answer
[normal] the question
[normal] 
[normal]’
[normal]to what extent can police recorded crime information be trusted
[normal]’
[normal] and 
[normal]we 
[normal]will publish a full report 
[normal]in autumn 2014. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 
[normal]HMIC 
[normal]considers
[normal] 
[normal]it of the utmost
[normal] importan
[normal]ce
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]police forces have 
[normal]high
[normal]-
[normal]quality data t
[normal]hat allows them to 
[normal]establish where, when
[normal],
[normal] and how often crime and anti-social behaviour (ASB) is happening
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This ensures:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HMIC
[normal] has therefore undertaken a programme of work over a number of years to test 
[normal]aspects of whether crimes are being recorded by the police when they should be, and categorised correctly. 
[normal]Some of this work 
[normal]assessed
[normal] accuracy in recording particular crimes, and some 
[normal]was concerned with
[normal] particular aspects of the crime and incident reportin
[normal]g process
[normal]. T
[normal]he number of forces inspected ranged from all 43 Home Office forces, to just one. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Crime Counts [bold](2009)[bold] [bold]and[bold] The Crime Scene [bold](2012)[bold]1.2 HMIC’s first report 
[normal]on
[normal] crime data integrity
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Crime Counts – 
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]review of data quality for offences of the most
[normal] serious violence
[normal],
[normal] was published in October 2009
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his 
[normal]was followed by 
[normal]The Crime Scene 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]A review of police crime and incident reports
[normal], which was published in January 2012
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]While the first of these focused solely on the data recorded in relation to serious violence, 
[normal]and
[normal] the latter was much wider in scope, b
[normal]oth
[normal] 
[normal]examined
[normal] how effective forces 
[normal]w
[normal]ere in ensuring incident records which contained details of a recordable crime resulte
[normal]d in the 
[normal]correct 
[normal]creation of crime record
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]The Crime Scene
[normal] considered the quality of crime and incident data, and the arrangements in place to ensure 
[normal]it
[normal] 
[normal]was
[normal] recorded 
[normal]and managed appropriately (i.e. in a way that complies
[normal] with national guidelines)
[normal]. T
[normal]h
[normal]e inspection 
[normal]focus
[normal]ed
[normal] on 
[normal]the 
[normal]standards of incident 
[normal]report 
[normal]closure
[normal],
[normal] and whether crimes were 
[normal]correctly 
[normal]recorded or not.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]Based on examination of a small sample of crime and incident records in each of the 43 Home Office-funded forces, 
[normal]HMIC
[normal] 
[normal]found
[normal] 
[normal]that the majority of forces 
[normal]were correctly
[normal] recording crimes based on the information available within an incident record
[normal]. However,
[normal] 
[normal]this conclusion mask
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]wide variation 
[normal]in 
[normal]the 
[normal]accuracy 
[normal]of force decisions in this regard
[normal]: 
[normal]18 forces correctly recorded crime
[normal]s in 95% or more of cases; 15 forces did so in between 90 and 94% 
[normal]of 
[normal]cases; and 11 forces in between 86 and 89% of cases.
[normal] 
[normal]This
[normal] 
[normal]could mean 
[normal]forces that made poorer decisions 
[normal]were unde
[normal]r-recording some crimes, which c
[normal]ould have 
[normal]a corresponding impact 
[normal]on the ac
[normal]curacy of published crime statistics
[normal] (although 
[normal]it should be noted that 
[normal]the size of the sample used in this inspection was too small to make any definite statements on this – it was used instead as an indicator of where there might be issues)
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]The su
[normal]pervision and justification for making a decision to 
[normal]declassify a recorded crime 
[normal]after it has been recorded as such 
[normal](referred to as ‘
[normal]no
[normal]-
[normal]crim
[normal]ing
[normal]’
[normal])
[normal] was found to be subject to a marked 
[normal]overall improvement since this area was 
[normal]last 
[normal]examined
[normal]. Perhaps as a result, 
[normal]the national average of correct decisions for violent offences was 84% – 
[normal]an
[normal] improve
[normal]ment
[normal] from 2009, when the average was 64% for the most serious violent offences.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Crime Recording in Kent (2013)[bold]1.
[normal]6
[normal] In
[normal] February 2013, the Pol
[normal]ice and 
[normal]Crime Commissioner for Kent co
[normal]mmissioned HMIC to conduct an inspection to determine whether the people of Kent can have confidence in the force’s crime figures. 
[normal]This inspection resulted in the publication of the HMIC report 
[normal]Crime recording in Kent – A repo
[normal]rt commissioned by the Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent
[normal] 
[normal] in June 201
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]7
[normal] This inspection found that appreciably more need
[normal]ed
[normal] to be done before the people of Kent c
[normal]ould
[normal] be confident that the crime and resolution figures published by the force 
[normal]we
[normal]re 
[normal]as accurate as they should be. HMIC found that the force had under-recorded approximately one in every ten crimes
[normal],
[normal] and that 
[normal]it
[normal] d
[normal]id
[normal] not interpret the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) correctly, 
[normal]meaning
[normal] crimes 
[normal]we
[normal]re not correctly recorded
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is important to
[normal] note that the findings for Kent cannot be extrapolated to make judgments regarding the accuracy of crime recording in other forces
[normal], as the methodology was specific to th
[normal]e force area
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]8
[normal] While Kent Police had made improvements to the way it dealt with t
[normal]he declassification of recorded crimes (
[normal]no
[normal]-
[normal]criming)
[normal],
[normal] and had reduced the total number of occasions 
[normal]where
[normal] 
[normal]this occurred, we found that the decision to do so was 
[normal]still 
[normal]incorrect in more than 25% of the cases reviewed. 
[normal]It 
[normal]was of particular concern 
[normal]– 
[normal]and unacc
[normal]eptable 
[normal]–
[normal] that this inaccuracy was evident in cases of rape, robber
[normal]y and violence
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]9
[normal] HMIC is due to 
[normal]publish 
[normal]a report in
[normal] 
[normal]January 2014 
[normal]on
[normal] the progress that has been made by Kent Police since 
[normal]publication of the 2013 report
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HMIC’s 2013/14 crime data integ[bold]rity programme[bold]1.1
[normal]0
[normal] 
[normal]Crime Counts 
[normal]and 
[normal]The Crime Scene 
[normal]both 
[normal]examined
[normal] only crime and incident records created as the result of a call made by a member of the public into force call centres. However, 
[normal]crimes are 
[normal]also 
[normal]reported to police forces through a number of 
[normal]other 
[normal]route
[normal]s
[normal] (
[normal]such as through calls to control rooms, referrals to specialist investigation departments from other public bodies
[normal],
[normal] or directly to officers
[normal])
[normal]. Therefore our crime data integrity programme for 2013/
[normal]14 will review the integrity of 
[normal]the data recorded via each of these other routes, to give a more complete overview of crime recording
[normal]. The outcome of this work 
[normal](which is explained in more detail in paras 4.3-4.6 below) 
[normal]is expected to be published during au
[normal]tumn 2014
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 None of HMIC
[normal]’s
[normal] re
[normal]views of crime data integrity 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]specifically 
[normal]examined
[normal] the influences which may lead to the mis-recording of crime
[normal] by the police
[normal]. The
[normal] reviews 
[normal]have
[normal],
[normal] however
[normal],
[normal] considered those influences 
[normal]which may positively contribute to the integrity of 
[normal]crime recording. 
[normal]The Crime Scene [bold](2012)[bold]2.
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]The 2012 HMIC report
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]The Crime Scene
[normal] – 
[normal]A review of police crime and incident reports
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]found
[normal] 
[normal]that forces which 
[normal]demonstrate
[normal]d
[normal] good standards of data quality all 
[normal]had
[normal] 
[normal]a clearly identified 
[normal]chief officer
[normal] lead who act
[normal]ed 
[normal]as the force champion for such issues
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]who 
[normal]actively promote
[normal]d
[normal] good crime and incident re
[normal]cording standards. 
[normal]HMIC found that t
[normal]he message 
[normal]such chief offic
[normal]ers
[normal] 
[normal]sen
[normal]t
[normal] to their force
[normal]s
[normal] about the importance of maintaining high standards 
[normal]in this regard 
[normal]need
[normal]ed
[normal] to be consistent, unequivocal
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]practi
[normal]s
[normal]ed
[normal]. It 
[normal]also needed to be
[normal] clearly understood by staff.
[normal] 
[normal]2.3 
[normal]Other
[normal] aspects 
[normal]which HMIC reported as being the most 
[normal]influential in maintaining standards in recording crime were: good governance and supervision; and knowledgeable staff – in particular, an objective force crime registrar with strong influence over local crime recording decisions, to ensure these were not 
[normal]unduly influenced by the pressure to achieve certain outcomes.
[normal] We concluded that: “The final responsibility for HOCR compliance should not, therefore, be vested in the same individuals as are accountable for crime reduction and detection” (para 5.6).
[normal]Forg[bold]ing the Links – Rape investigation and prosecution (2012)[bold]2.4 In this report (which was conducted jointly with HM Inspectorate of the Crown Prosecution Service), HMIC found that there were wide variations across forces in the number of rapes that remained on the system (and so were investigated) compared to those
[normal] that were ‘no crimed’ (i.e. removed from the crime recording system because the police decide that a crime has not been committed). We 
[normal]stated
[normal] that 
[normal]“
[normal]i
[normal]n the past performance pressures may have influenced forces
[normal]’
[normal] approaches to either the initial recording or
[normal] subsequent levels 
[normal]of ‘no crimes’ for rape offending” (para 1.29), and advocated instead a regime that places equal emphasis on
[normal] 
[normal]an analysis of rape crimes and associated intelligence
[normal] as on low offending levels
[normal], 
[normal]which would act
[normal] as an encouragement to retain
[normal] crime records on the system.
[normal] 
[normal]HMIC’s 2013/14 crime data integrity programme[bold]2.5 Our programme for 2013/14 will 
[normal]consider
[normal] more widely the influences that may result in the mis-recording of crime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]HMIC 
[normal]considers
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]role of the 
[normal]f
[normal]orce 
[normal]c
[normal]rime 
[normal]r
[normal]egistrar 
[normal](FCR) 
[normal]to be
[normal] 
[normal]central to ensuring 
[normal]force systems for recording crime 
[normal]are 
[normal]effective and accurate
[normal]. 
[normal]This role is a requirement detailed in the 
[normal]National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS)
[normal],
[normal] which states
[normal] (in section 4.2)
[normal]:
[normal]To ensure the NCRS is maintained within the force, and to provide greater consistency within and across forces, each force should appoint an FCR to act as final arbiter for the audit process; the interpretation of the counting rules; and for ensuring the o
[normal]utcome from investigations into those crimes is correctly recorded. The FCR must be outside operational line command and answerable to the chief officer with overall responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of crime recording processes. To ensure that
[normal] the responsibilities of the post are effectively met, a deputy or other identified person should be appointed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]key
[normal] tasks of an FCR are: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is full recognition
[normal] 
[normal]that the FCR role and responsibilities continue to evolve over time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Crime Scene [bold](2012)[bold]3.
[normal]2
[normal] Our 2012 
[normal]review found forces that finalised incidents well ha
[normal]d
[normal] a strong FCR, who act
[normal]ed
[normal] as the final arbiter for disputes 
[normal]in respect of 
[normal]the interpretation of the counting rules and enjoy
[normal]ed
[normal] clear, unequivocal chief officer support. Indeed, evidence from the review indicated that 34 of the 44 forces reviewed claimed to
[normal] have sufficiently strong, independent FCRs, with clear chief officer support.
[normal] 
[normal]However, 
[normal]HMIC 
[normal]found limited evidence of forces directly assessing whether their own crime quality audits provided confidence that their crime figures gave an accurate account o
[normal]f their 
[normal]performance
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] f
[normal]ew forces compare crime audits with crime performance in any meaningful way
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n 2012
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]HMIC also reported 
[normal]that 
[normal]evidence strongly supports the notion that leadership, supervision and oversight help attain good crime and incident data quality. Strong and effective leadership is therefore a critical component in raising standards. 
[normal]Equally, where there is the slightest
[normal] doubt as to the chief officer’s expectation 
[normal]in relation to
[normal] crime and incident data quality, standards will inevitably slip.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1 HMIC recognises that there is still mor
[normal]e to be done to secure the integrity of 
[normal]police
[normal]-
[normal]recorded crime data
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he work of the Crime Statistics Advisory Committee (CSAC)
[normal],
[normal] as an independent advisor on matters related to the measurement of crime
[normal],
[normal] and the collection and presentation of crime data
[normal],
[normal] is welcomed.
[normal] The rest of this answer focuses on what HMIC has done (and is doing) to ensure the integrity of this data. 
[normal]4.2 
[normal]Crime data and crime recording are 
[normal]complex areas of policing,
[normal] and there continues to be a need for greater clarity and understandi
[normal]ng. Therefore, 
[normal]HMIC has 
[normal]inspected police crime data integrity for a number of years
[normal]. 
[normal]This has included inspections dedicated
[normal] specifically
[normal] 
[normal]to crime data
[normal],
[normal] as well as integrating consideration of crime data accuracy within other formal inspection activity
[normal], su
[normal]ch as HMIC inspections of the approach taken by police forces to deal
[normal]ing
[normal] with anti-social behaviour
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]HMIC’s 2013/14[bold] crime data integrity programme[bold]4.3 
[normal]HMIC 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]committed to inspect
[normal]ing
[normal] crime data integrity 
[normal]again 
[normal]during 2013/14. Her Majesty’s Chief 
[normal]Inspector of Constabulary confirmed this commitment to the Home Affairs Select Committee
[normal] in May 2013
[normal],
[normal] and agreed to report on the issue in 
[normal]autumn
[normal] 2014. 
[normal]4.
[normal]4
[normal] This inspection will include 
[normal]our
[normal] assessment of the accuracy of crime recording through the various routes that crimes can be reported to the police
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]such as through calls to control rooms, referrals to specialist 
[normal]investigation
[normal] departments from other public bodies or directly to officers
[normal])
[normal]. Our initial findings will be 
[normal]provid
[normal]ed 
[normal]in an interim report 
[normal](as
[normal] requested by the Home Secretary
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] which will be published in spring 2014
[normal].
[normal]4.
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]Th
[normal]e 
[normal]principal
[normal] test for the inspection is 
[normal]to de
[normal]termine
[normal]: 
[normal]T
[normal]o what extent can police recorded crime information be 
[normal]trusted?
[normal] 
[normal]4.
[normal]6
[normal] The specific objectives of the inspection involve establishing:
[normal]Monitoring of force performance[bold]4.
[normal]7
[normal] In addition to the formal crime data integrity programme
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary (HMIs) routinely monitor the performance of police forces
[normal], including 
[normal]as regards
[normal] 
[normal]the integrity of data
[normal].
[normal] This 
[normal]helps to 
[normal]ensure that:
[normal]•    
[normal]emerging problems 
[normal]with the efficiency or effectiveness of individual forces are spotted quickly, and Chief Constables and local policing bodies
[normal] 
[normal]are aware of those problems and are taking corrective action; and
[normal]•    
[normal]if problems with the efficiency or effectiveness of a forc
[normal]e are enduring and there is a low prospect of 
[normal]their
[normal] 
[normal]being resolved, those problems are raised formally with the local policing body, so that they can respond.
[normal]4.
[normal]8
[normal] Routine monitoring identifies 
[normal]potential
[normal] 
[normal]issues for closer scrutiny. Some of these will be out
[normal]side the control of the force and local policing body, or will already have been tackled; but some may be indicators of systemic or management failings in the force. The decision 
[normal]as to
[normal] 
[normal]whether to follow up with the force and local policing body over any co
[normal]ncerns rests with the HMI who leads on HMIC’s relationship with that force area. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 
[normal]All 
[normal]HMIC’s work 
[normal]on crime data integrity
[normal] is undertaken so that the level of confidence
[normal] policy-makers, the police and the public should have
[normal] in police crime data can be understood. 
[normal]5.2 
[normal]Our work in Kent, described earlier, 
[normal]sets out 
[normal]the extent to which confidence can be placed in 
[normal]the force’s
[normal] 
[normal]crime
[normal] data. The approach
[normal] used to determine this
[normal] 
[normal]will 
[normal]also 
[normal]be used
[normal] in our 2013/14 
[normal]inspection, which is due to be published
[normal] in 
[normal]autumn
[normal] 2014.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 This is not a
[normal]n issue on which 
[normal]HMIC 
[normal]has published or indeed 
[normal]hold
[normal]s
[normal] a view
[normal]. Our focus is instead on the effectiveness and efficiency of the systems and processes forces use to record crimes and ASB.

[normal] When a crime has been recorded, it can only be declassified (which is referred to as ‘no-crimed’) if the strict criteria set out in the HOCR apply. No-crimes account for approximately 3-4% of overall recorded crime. No-criming is an important part of the 
[normal]HOCR as it caters for situations where the original decision to record a crime clearly turns out to be wrong (for example, where someone reports to the police that their car has been stolen from a multi-storey car park, only to find it later on a different
[normal] floor). While it is appropriate for some cases to be no-crimed, when this is done incorrectly it can mean that suspects may not be brought to justice and the force’s published crime figures will be inaccurate.
