[normal]Written Evidence Submitted by Lisa Riley (PhD, MSc, MRes, MSc, BSc (Hons))[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Personal Background[bold]I am a primatologist currently working as an independent consultant in an
[normal]imal welfare and as a part-time lecturer in Higher Education Animal Management at Sparsholt College Hampshire (UK).
[normal]Previously (2011-2012) I held the position Senior Scientific Officer (Captive Wild Animals), Wildlife Department, RSPCA where I set up a reh
[normal]oming project in association with Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre (Dorset, UK) to rehome the increasing number of UK pet primates rescued by the RSPCA.  
[normal]I have worked as a Primate Keeper at Colchester Zoo (Essex, UK)
[normal], and as an independent consultant have 
[normal]worked with zoos and sanctuaries in the UK and Europe advising on education, enrichment and campaigns relating to the keeping of primates. 
[normal]The opinions expressed in
[normal] this submission are my
[normal] own and should not be considered as the opinion of any establishmen
[normal]t for/with which I have 
[normal]worked. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence[bold]The exotic pet industry in the UK is a 
[normal]growing
[normal] industry that involves the trade and private keeping of a wide range of both wild-caught and captive
[normal]-bred
[normal] mammals, marsupials, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians and i
[normal]nvertebrates. 
[normal]The UK
[normal] pet 
[normal]primate 
[normal]industry is one facet of this
[normal] wider exotics
[normal] industry. 
[normal]The number and species of primates kept in the UK is unknown, partly due to a lack of regulation and partly due to a lack of enforcement of exi
[normal]sting legislation
[normal]. Common
[normal]ly kept sp
[normal]ecies (like common marmosets
[normal], pygmy marmosets and numerous tamarin species) are excluded from the Dangerous Wild Animals 
[normal]Act 1976 (and associated (Modification) (No. 2) Order
[normal] 2007
[normal])
[normal]. This Act is ineffectively e
[normal]nforced, with non-compliance reported
[normal] to be 85-
[normal]95%
[normal]. Thus frequently kept species like capuchin monkeys
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the keeping of which requires a licence,
[normal] are often kept without a licence.  
[normal] 
[normal]Without a national survey of pet keeping numbers will only ever be 
[normal]estimates 
[normal]and thus
[normal] the proportion of pet primates being kept well and those who are neglected or abused
[normal] remains unquantifiable
[normal]. 
[normal]However, i
[normal]t is clear that
[normal] the
[normal] total number of pet primates
[normal] in the UK
[normal] requiring rescue and rehoming has increased. The 
[normal]amount of resource (money, h
[normal]ours of work, projects ini
[normal]tiated and research undertaken)
[normal] animal welfare charities
[normal] and professionals are 
[normal]inves
[normal]t
[normal]ing
[normal] into rehoming pet primates and prosecuting unknowledgeable
[normal], neglectful
[normal] owners is escalating. 
[normal]I believe that this increase is due
[normal] in part
[normal] to 
[normal]internet trade. 
[normal]Evidence of both
[normal] private sales (through classified sites) and 
[normal]commercial sales from specialist online pet shops is abundant. Simply Google search “marmoset for sale”
[normal]. These sales raise concern about current legislation
[normal]. The Pet Animals Act 
[normal]1951 refer
[normal]s to a 
[normal]pet shop premises 
[normal]and when I have 
[normal]dealt
[normal] with local authorities in the past some have express
[normal]ed confusion as to whether
[normal] online pet shops require a licence because they do not sell from a physical premises. Private sales are of course exempt
[normal] from licensing currently. 
[normal]Internet trade not only increases the accessibility of owning a pet primate, making such ownership easily attainable for many, but it fuels the spread of erroneous information and poor practice. 
[normal]The industry is currently 
[normal]peppered with owners who do not understand the complex needs of their pet primate
[normal](s)
[normal]. Primates require complex physical and social environments, specialist veterinary care and 
[normal]many
[normal],
[normal] like marmosets
[normal],
[normal] have specific dietary requirements (both in terms of the t
[normal]ype of food and the presentation). They are susceptible 
[normal]to physical and psychological abnormality and have the cognitive capacity to suffer profoundly when their needs are not met. 
[normal]Concerning
[normal] the rescues in which I have been involved even basic requirement
[normal]s are not understood by owners. For example, owners have failed to provide vit
[normal]amin D3 supplement. C
[normal]onsequently 
[normal]their pet primate has 
[normal]developed metabolic bone disease
[normal] leading to permanent bone deformity
[normal]. Owners also misunderstand 
[normal]the need for company, even 
[normal]those who reference the 
[normal]DEFRA Code of Practice fo
[normal]r the Welfare of Privately Kept
[normal] 
[normal]Non-Human 
[normal]Primates. Primates must have company of their own kind, humans and traditional companion a
[normal]nimals like dogs and cats are no
[normal] substitute. 
[normal]Most primates are sold individually on the internet, are advertised as “easy to look after” and are intended to be kept individually. 
[normal]I believe that internet trade in primates, both commercial and private should be banned. 
[normal]A seller has a duty of care to t
[normal]he primate they are selling (according to the Animal Welfare Act 2006) and a prospective owner should be given care information specific to that primate, including medical history. Internet trade does not support this and any 
[normal]attempt to regulate
[normal] would be e
[normal]xtremely difficult to enforce. 
[normal]I further believe that the practice of keeping primates as pets should be banned
[normal],
[normal] that only specialist keepers should keep a primate for welfare or conservation reasons (e.g. in a sanctuary)
[normal]. 
[normal]A primate’s needs cannot be met 
[normal]in a domestic situation. Zoo and laboratory housed primates have extensive legislation protecting the
[normal]ir welfare. The only reason why zoo and laboratory
[normal] legislation is effective is that the location of the primates is known to 
[normal]the inspectorate. This cannot 
[normal]be achie
[normal]ved regarding pet keeping, t
[normal]he DWA demonstrates this clearly. 
[normal]It would be a huge benefit if the Government would define pet ownership
[normal] (keeping as a companion in a domestic situation)
[normal] and specialist keeping (keeping by academically trained and tech
[normal]nically experienced individuals
[normal] in specialist facilities
[normal])
[normal] so that the two can be differentiated
[normal]. T
[normal]he keeping of primates as pets
[normal] should be banned, while s
[normal]pecialist keepers should 
[normal]be
[normal] subject to rigorous licensing conditions. 
[normal] 
[normal]The burden of licensing should 
[normal]not fall to the local authority
[normal] which is under-
[normal]resourced and unable to effectively enforce existing animal related 
[normal]legislation,
[normal] but should be centrally administered by the Government. The cost of licensing should be 
[normal]funded by sp
[normal]ecialist keepers
[normal]. The standa
[normal]rd of licensing conditions should equal 
[normal]those of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. 
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] prohibition of 
[normal]pet 
[normal]primate 
[normal]keeping
[normal], internet trade in primates and the
[normal] licensing of specialist keeping
[normal] should be achieved using secondary legislation created under the Anima
[normal]l Welfare Act 2006. I believe the Act is sufficient
[normal]ly broad and that prohibition of internet trade and pet primate keeping is
[normal] proportionate given the level of suffering primates can 
[normal]experience 
[normal]when their 
[normal]needs are not met, while licensing of specialist kee
[normal]ping permits rescue and rehoming as a ban in pet keeping is phased in and would provide life-long sanctuary to ex-pet primates.
