"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from Health and Care Professions Council (HCP0012)&#xa0;Regulation of further groups&#xa0;\nThe Health and Social Work \nProfessions Order 2001, states under Article 17 and 17A:\n&#xa0;\n(17) The Council may—\n&#xa0;\n(a) make recommendations to the Secretary of State and the Scottish Ministers\n \nconcerning any profession which in its\n opinion should be regulated pursuant to\nsection 60(1)(b) of the Health Act 1999; and\n&#xa0;\n(b) give such guidance as it sees fit, to such persons as seem to it to have an interest\nin such regulation, on the criteria to be taken into account in determining whet\nher a\nprofession should be so regulated.\n&#xa0;\n(17A) The Council may—\n&#xa0;\n(a) make recommendations to the Secretary of State concerning social care workers in\nEngland who in its opinion should be regulated pursuant to section 60(1)(bc) of the\nHealth Act 1999; and\n&#xa0;\nThe HCPC has made \nsix\n recommendation\ns\n about the statutory regulation of \naspirant groups.  They are as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn \nFebruary \n2007 the Govern\nment published \na \nwhite paper\n, \nTrust Assurance and Safety – The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century.\n&#xa0;\nChapter 7 addressed the issue of \nNew roles and emerging professions:  In particular it stated:\n&#xa0;\n7.2  \nThe Government is planning to introduce statutory regulation for\n \napplied psychologists, healthcare \nscientists, psychotherapists and\n \ncounsellors and other psychological therapists. These are the priorities\n \nfor the introduction of statutory regulation, because their practice is well\n \nestablished and widespread in the delivery of services, and what they do \ncarries\n \nsignificant risk to patients and the public if poorly done. Further work is needed\n \non these areas and the Government intends to continue with it.\n&#xa0;\n7.3 \n \nThere are other professions, currently unregulated, that aspire to statutory\n \nregulation. Some ha\nve developed over time but have not yet been regulated,\n \nsuch as play therapists; others have been recently established in response to\n \ndeveloping Government policy, such as health trainers. We have established a\n \nworking group chaired by Professor Mike Pitti\nlo to look at the practicalities of\n \nregulation of acupuncturists, herbal medicine practitioners and traditional\n \nChinese medicine practitioners. We are awaiting the working group’s report\n \nand in the light of that we will consider next steps for the way forw\nard.\n&#xa0;\n7.4 \n \nIn Scotland, the regulation of these new professions is a matter for the\n \nDevolved Administration.\n&#xa0;\nThe white paper then addressed\n other groups including \nof anaesthesia practitioner\n and\n surgical care \np\nractitioner\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;On 16\n February 2011, the Government published a \ncommand paper\n, \nEnabling Excellence Autonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers, which set out the \ncoalition government\n's pol\nicy on professional regulation.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n11 Rather than a single statutory approach regardless of local needs and local approaches, quality assured voluntary registration will provide greater flexibility and give the public and local employers greater control and responsibility for how they assur\ne themselves about the quality of staff. For the overwhelming majority of occupational and professional groups which are not currently subject to statutory regulation and which are generally not considered to present a high level of risk to the public, but\n where recommendations that regulation should be introduced have been made (including those groups recommended by the HPC for statutory regulation in the past, but not yet registered), the assumption will be that assured voluntary registration would be the\n preferred option\n&#xa0;\n4.12 The extension of statutory regulation to currently unregulated professional or occupational groups, such as some groups in the healthcare science workforce, will only be considered where there is a compelling case on the basis of a \npublic safety risk and where assured voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk.\n&#xa0;\n4.13 The exception to this is practitioners of herbal medicine, including Chinese herbal medicine. Under European law, manufactured medicines place\nd on the market require a suitable product licence, and from April 2011 this also applies to manufactured herbal medicines. However, Member States have the power to operate national arrangements permitting appropriately authorised healthcare professionals \nto commission an unlicensed medicine to meet a patient's special needs and the UK already does so for doctors and certain other appropriately regulated prescribers. While there is evidence of public health risk where unlicensed herbal medicines are supplie\nd by unskilled practitioners, the impact on practitioners and on consumer choice of preventing the supply of all such herbal medicines would be disproportionate. We therefore propose to introduce regulation for these practitioners by the HPC, to ensure tha\nt the public are able to access these products if they should choose to do so and to provide improved assurance of the competence of\n practitioners. The focus of regulation will be solely on minimising risk to the public.\n&#xa0;\n6.11 In chapter 4, we set out our \nproposals to put in place a system of assured voluntary registration for professionals and occupational groups which are currently not subject to statutory professional regulation. It is our view that this model should apply to the adult social care \nworkfo\nrce and we will explore scope for the HPC to establish a voluntary register of social care workers by 2013. We envisage that in future local authority commissioners would be able to give preference to adult social care providers using workers on voluntary \nregisters and that this could be a factor taken into account in the CQC's proposals for an excellence scheme which it will be consulting on.\n&#xa0;\nHerbal practitioners&#xa0;\nThe Government has proposed that we regulate herbal practitioners and non-medical public health specialists on a \nstatutory\n basis.\n&#xa0;\nThe late Professor Michael Pittilo published his Report to Ministers from the Department of Health Steering Group on the Stat\nutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practiced in the UK in 2008.  It concluded: “We are firmly of the view that, in the interest of public safety, statutory \nregulation should now proceed with all possible speed” (p.10).  The Government published a public consultation in 2009.  On February 16 2011, the Secretary of State for Health, announced that the Government would introduce statutory regulation, and that th\nis would be in place by April 2012.\n&#xa0;\nOn \n9 \nJuly 2013, in a Westminster Hall\n debate on herbal medicine, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Health announced the intention to set up a working group.  The first meeting of the Herbal Practitioners an\nd Medi\ncines Working Group is scheduled\n to meet in early 2014.\n&#xa0;\nNon-medical public health specialists&#xa0;On 23\nrd\n January 2012 \nthe \nSecretary of State for Health\n announced plans to ensure that non-medically qualified public health specialists are appropriately regulated. \n \nThe planned regulation of this group by the HCPC was confirmed in the Department of Health’s \n‘Transforming Public Health’\n bulletin. \n \nThe regulation of this group was previously the subject of a Department of Health \nreview\n and also featured in the recommendations of the \nNHS Future Forum's second report\n.\n&#xa0;\nPublic health specialists from non-medical backgrounds (not medicine, not dentistry) are voluntary registered at the moment with the UK Public Health Register (UKPHR). The Government has announced their statutory regulation in recognition that specialists \nfrom medical and dental backgrounds are required to register with a statutory regulator (the GMC and GDC), but those from other backgrounds are not. \n&#xa0;\nWe have been working with the Department of Health on their project to deliver this policy. \nOur\n understanding is that the Department of Health currently intends to legislate in this parliament to regulate this group (as part of wider reforms arising from the Law Commissions' review of the regulators' legislation), with a register opening in autumn/ \nwinter 2015. However, these timescales are out of our control and may change. \n&#xa0;\nYou can find more information about the background here: \nhttp://www.hcpc-uk.org/ab\noutregistration/aspirantgroups/publichealthspecialists/\n \n&#xa0;\nAt the moment, there are not any other professions / groups that it has been suggested we should regulate in the future (above those mentioned in our submission).\n \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
