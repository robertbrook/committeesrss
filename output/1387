defaultBackground of the Organisation
defaultPortia
default is a not-for-profit organisation
default (
defaulthttp://www.portiaweeb.org.uk
default)
default based in the UK, originally established in 1997 by a group of 
defaultwomen 
defaultscientists at Imperial College
default 
defaultto advance 
defaultgender equalit
defaulty in STEM.  M
defaultost recently
default, Portia led 
defaultthe 
defaultinfluential European 
defaultFP7-funded project
default genSET (
defaulthttp://www.genderinscience.org
default).  genSET asked science leaders to
default 
defaultexamine
default the research evidence 
defaulton gender
default issues in science and produce a
default 
defaultconsensus 
defaultreport with recommendations for action at institutional level. 
default This resulted in a report with 13 specific and achievable recommendations. In 2011, genSET 
defaultcreated the Gender Summit platform
default,
default 
defaulthttp://www.gender-summit.com
default to continue the 
defaultdialogue between the 
defaultscientists, policy makers
default and gender scholars, to 
defaultjointly consider 
defaultthe 
defaultresearch evidence and agree on the actions
default needed to address gender problems and improve 
defaultquality
default of research. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInformation for the Committee
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1. 
defaultTaking the EU as a whole, 
default80% of 
defaultA-Grade (full professor) academic positions are 
defaulttaken by men. This is 
defaulta little lower
default th
defaultan 10 years ago, down from 85%. 
default The average 
defaultfemale professor figure for the UK is
default 
default20.8%
default (taking all universities together)
default; a
defaultmong the top 10 universities it ranges between 14% (Imperial College) and 33.8% (University of Bristol).
default2
default. The 
defaulthistorical 
defaultabsence of women in
default research – as participants, 
defaultas 
defaultsubjects, and 
defaultas 
defaultbeneficiaries – has resulted in science 
defaulthaving 
defaultmore
default evidence for men than f
defaultor w
defaultomen
default,
default and 
defaultin the ‘male’ 
defaultbeing 
defaultaccepted as
default the norm in
default study design, and in 
defaultthe 
defaultapplication and communication 
defaultof research. 
defaultThe efficacy of research, therefore, is not the same for women and 
defaultfor 
defaultmen. 
defaultFor example, nearly all that is known about the effects of environmental pollution is
default based on studies involving men, but overwhelmingly, pollutants affect women and m
defaulten differently. 
default 
default3. 
defaultWhen researchers 
defaultdo 
defaultpay
default attention to 
defaultbiological and social 
defaultdi
defaultfferences between women and men, 
defaultstunning discoveries
default follow
default.  For example, 
defaultmuscle-derived 
defaultfemale stem cells have 
defaultbetter
default regenerative properties than equivalent male cells
default, and 
defaultthe 
defaultmetabolic profiles of women and men 
defaultare 
defaultdistinctly different
default. 
defaultF
defaultindings 
defaultsuch as these 
defaulthave huge implications for diagnosis and therapy, and for health economics. 
defaultA brief overview 
defaultof when and why sex and gender matter in science
default can be found in 
defaulta 2
default-page “A-Z Guide Why Gender Matters in R&amp;D”
default produced by Portia
default, 
defaultwhich is 
defaultavailable at 
defaulthttp://www.portiaweb.org.uk/index.php/publications
default. 
defaultIt
default is not only health where it matters what is female and what is male
default.
default4. P
defaultromotion to professorial po
defaultsitions requires
default sound record of research grant applications and performance as Principal Investigator (PI). 
default But
default 
defaultfewer women than
default men apply for research g
defaultrants - 
defaultin numbers that correlate to how many women are pre
defaultsent at professorial levels
default. 
defaultC
defaultritically, 
defaultwhen women d
defaulto apply, they are 
defaultminimal
defaultly but systematically
default less successful than men
default in being awarded a grant
default, even in fields where they are well 
defaultrepresented, such as Life Sciences
default and Social Science, as shown in Figure 1 below.
default 
default5. 
default W
defaultomen apply for smaller grants, 
defaultreceiving on
default an average of £44,735 less per grant than men
default.  This means that they have 
defaultless money to engage additional researches 
defaultin the
defaultir
default project
defaults (e.g. 
defaultto provide statistical or data analysis support
default) than the better funded male PIs
default. 
default 
default6. 
defaultI
defaultt is important to demonstrate intellectual independence during the early career stage and establish
default 
defaulta sufficient 
defaultauthor status by being the primary 
defaultauthor and publishing papers in
default high impact journals.  But even
default at
default this stage
default, men tend to hold higher status pos
defaultitions and have bigger labs whilst 
defaultwomen have greater teaching loads, as well as the main 
defaultburden of family responsibilities
default, so 
defaulthave fewer hour
defaults for research compared to men and 
defaultproduce fewer r
defaultesearch papers, which 
defaultputs them at a
default clear
default disadvantage
default in
default selection process
defaultes that
default 
defaultuse men’s productivity as the norm.
default7. 
defaultFigure 1

defaultcompares
default the success rates for women and men across the three a

defaultfunded by E
defaulturopean 
defaultR
defaultesearch 
defaultC
defaultouncil
default (ERC)
default:
default 
defaultPhysical and Engineering Sciences, Life Science, and Social Sciences
default.  A
defaultcross all three areas men received more grants than women.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8. 
default Furthermore, 
defaultT
defaultable 1 below compares 
defaultthe 
defaultgender balance 
defaultfound among ERC project teams with
default the gender balance 
defaultfound among the complimentary groups of researchers based 
defaultin universities.  This Table
default show that men
default are routinely favoured in the
default appointments
default to ERC research teams, starting from
default PhD level and continuing at eac
defaulth next career development step, and this adv
defaultantage is greater than could be justified by how many women and men are available in the system at each level. So, for example, at PhD level, ERC grants engaged 38% of women and 62% of men, which compares to 49% of female PhDs and 51% of male PhDs across E
defaultU universities.

defaultEach 
defaultERC grant
default creates an 
defaultopportunity to engage between 5-
default7 additional researchers to suppo
defaultrt the PI.  T
defaulthe 3
default400 
defaultgrants awarded to-date 
defaultwould create opportunities for involving an additional 
default20,000 researchers
default, in total.  Around 20% of ERC 
defaultgrants 
defaultare 
defaulthosted in the UK
default and they represent a very important channel for promotin
defaultg the advancement of talented j
defaultunior researchers
default by placing them among the PI’s peers and providing opportunities to gain valuable experience
default as collaborators, co-auth
defaultors, and members of influential academic
default networks. If women are overlooked when project teams are established, they are left out from research career pathways that can lead them to 
defaultthe 
defaulttop-level positions in STEM.
default10
default. 
defaultAs employers, 
defaultUK 
defaultunivers
defaultities 
defaulthave been increasingly adopting the
default 
defaultHay System of Job Evaluation.  This
default methodology originated
default in the 1950’s in the USA
default as a way to measure work and 
defaultthe 
defaultpayment levels for different types of work
default in manufacturing
default. It is 
defaultn
defaultot we
defaultll suited to the collegial and team-based
default nature of academic world
default. 
defaultIndividuals are recruited to the specific pathway
default (e.g. teaching,
default teaching plus research, or primarily
default resea
defaultrch) and can progress along the
default pathway
default but cannot 
defaultmove between pathways
default, e.g. 
defaultfrom teaching to research.
default  This can create 
defaultgender bias 
defaultin recruitment, which cannot be corrected later, 
defaultif men are recruited primarily to the research focused 
defaultcareer 
defaultpathway
defaults
default and women to the teaching-oriented ones
default, which they may acce
defaultpt not knowing the c
defaultonsequences
default as a way of managing 
defaultthe pressure of 
defaultcareer-life 
defaultrespons
defaultibilities during 
defaultearly career stages
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in
default different employment sectors?
default&#xa0;
default11
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultexperience of the 
defaultDaphne Jackson Trust (
defaulthttp://www.daphnejackson.org
default), whose mission 
defaultis 
defaultto return women trained in STEM
default back to STEM
default after a family related career break
default would be an excellent source of this information.
default 
default 
defaultThe Trust was established almost 30 years ago by Prof Daphne Jackson, the first female physics professor in the UK, who observe
defaultd that it would 
defaultbe 
defaultinconceivable if
default society allowed Marie Curie stack shelves
default in the supermarket just because she had two children, and so it should not be right that talented women scientists are stopped from pursuing their career aspirations because they become mothers. 
default The Trust’s experience suggests that when women leave scien
defaultce they 
defaultwork
default as librarians, 
defaultteachers, 
defaultassistant 
defaulteditors, 
defaultproject 
defaultmanagers
default, charity workers
default, in media, accountancy, and in admin-oriented jobs, i.e. mainly in roles where science training has no benefit.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat should universities and the higher education 
defaultsector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
default&#xa0;
default12
default.
default  
default27% of women but only
default 
default9% 
defaultof men worry that a career in science will make it impossible for them to have a family. 
default 
defaultSupporting women during 
defaultthe critical stage between PhD
default, the post-doc training,
default and early group leader is crucial
default. 
default For this, u
defaultniversities
default must recognise the negative influence of the societal 
defaultamb
defaultivalence in attitudes to 
defaultgender equality.  On the one hand, women are encouraged to p
defaultursue higher education and on the other they are 
defaultdiscouraged 
defaultfrom 
defaultpursuing
default 
defaultcareer aspirations 
defaulton the same terms as men.
default 
default13
default. 
defaultScience believes itself to be ‘gender neutral’ but this is an illusion that hides a whole range of gender bias effects. 
defaultUniversities 
defaultneed to 
defaultbe pro-active in encouraging 
defaultwomen to apply for research grants, by making sure that women’s teaching loads are not bigger than those of men
default, and that they are mentored appropriately.  When project teams are formed, they should be guid
defaulted to ensure gender balance.  When 
defaultincluded as 
defaultpart of the team, women should not be overlooked
default when there are opportunities for
default collaboration, co-au
defaultthorship or
default 
defaultco-supervision of students, and 
defaultin the 
defaultengagement in 
defaultacademic 
defaultnetworks (not just women’s 
defaultnetworks)
default.
default14. U
defaultniversities must recognise the pernicious natur
defaulte of gender stereotypes and of the
default 
defaultgender bias 
defaulteffects 
defaultin recruitment and promotion
default.  
defaultA 
defaultstudy 
defaultreported in 2012, 
defaultled by Yale university
default,
default in which 127 science faculty from research-intensive univ
defaultersities were asked to rate the application materials of a student – who was randomly assigned either a male or female name – fo
defaultr a laboratory manager position, showed that b
defaultoth male and female professors rated the male applicant as significantly more comp
defaultetent and preferable to hire than the (identical) female applicant. They also offered the male applicant a higher starting salary and additional career mentoring support
default.  
defaultS
defaultcientists may be rigorously trained to be objective, but just like the society at large, 
defaulthold 
defaultgender beliefs that tend to valorise men
default’s progress
default. 
default15
default. 
defaultIn 2010, a panel of science leaders from across Europe met to evaluate available research evidence on ge
defaultnder issues in science
default. 
defaultThey agreed on 13 specific recommendations, which they felt could be implemented and would produce important benefits for individuals, their institutions, and t
defaulto science. Their report is 
defaultavailable at 
defaulthttp://www.genderinscience.org
default .
default 
defaultThe recommendations call for integrated
default 
defaultactions
default to improve: 1) science knowledge making, 2) 
defaultinstitutional practices
default and processes, 3) 
defaultcreation 
defaultof human capital, and 4) 
defaultcompliance with regulation.
default16
default. 
defaultIn 
defaultNorway, despite the acceptance of the quota mechanism for women, not one university has as yet achieved even 30% target of women professors.  Universities must examine their processes and practices for sources of gender bias and weed them out. T
defaulthe
default 
defaultUniversi
defaultty 
defaultof Tromso 
defaultimplemented a trial evaluation process designed to simulate the promotion process, thereby ensuring that women candidates can be confident that they are ready for promotion before applying. The Tromso board has also set the conditions that all
default advertised positions will have search committees specifically charged with finding women applicants, requiring that the applicant pool for any particular positi
defaulton has no fewer than 40% women, and has made available 
defaultfunds 
defaultfor department 
defaultchairs and deans 
defaultto
default 
defaultidentify specific support measures 
defaultsuch as 
defaultshort-term buy-outs from teaching duties, statistical support, research assistance, data processing support. 
default17
default. 
defaultIn the UK, 
defaultthe National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)
default has made future 
defaultresearch 
defaultfunding 
defaultcond
defaultitional on the academic partner achieving at least the Silver Award of the Athena SWA
defaultN Charter for Women in Science
default. The SWAN scheme was introduced in the UK ten years ago to promote gender equality in recruitment
default, advancement and promotion of female acade
defaultmics. 
defaultFollowing the NIHR decision
default in 2011
default, a
defaultpplications to the SWAN Charter Award soared, trebling in number during 2012-2013.
default18
default.  
defaultUniversities can also examine their 
defaultapproaches to managing their academic 
defaulthuman resources 
defaultto ensure that during 
defaultrecruit
defaultment women are not channeled into 
defaultcareer pathways that limit opportunities
default to establish intellec
defaulttual independence and assemble the
default solid record of research experience
default that is needed for advancement in STEM
default. 
default1
default9
default.  
defaultWhilst science institutions may differ grea
defaulttly in their overall strategies,
default 
defaultand in 
defaulttheir wish to 
defaultmaintain independence and ability to co
defaultmpete,
default 
defaultthey are
default responsible for 
defaultgender equality in 
defaultthe distribution of 
defaultresearch resources and 
defaultof 
defaultthe associated c
defaultareer 
defaultdevelopment 
defaultopportunities
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat role should
default the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
default&#xa0;
default20
default. 
default The legal framework places 
defaultresponsibility for
default equality and diversity
default on universities as employers but this is a too narrow scope for addressing gender inequalities in science because it overlooks the 
defaultsocial importance
default 
defaultof science institutions and scientists, for example as
default 
defaultpolicy advisers to the Government or guardians of 
defaultt
defaulthe 
defaultethical and social responsibility concerns in 
defaultthe 
defaults
defaultcienc
defaulte governance. The Government could
default insist that the soc
defaultial importance of science is recognised
default by involving both women and men, equally, in science governance and in major policy consultative roles. 
default21
default. The 
defaultNorwegian experience 
defaultshows that
default 
defaultuniversities can easily shrug-off policies promoting positive gender-balancing actions by claiming ‘excellence
default’ to be thei
defaultr main goal.  The Government could
default insist that the distribution of public research resources (to which wom
defaulten contribute as taxpayers) should
default not disadvantage women as researchers, as subjects of research and as beneficiaries of 
defaultthe 
defaultsocietal inv
defaultestment in science and technology.
default22. The Government can also fine-tune the childcare support policies by recognising the special demands placed on women scientists (and men) during early career stage who have childcare responsibilities, such as having to
default attend conferences or work late in the lab to complete experiments.  Their childcare 
defaultissues may be more complex and 
defaultcosts can be higher than those of the parents in other sectors
default,
default 
defaultwith few
default opportunities to increase income without taking time away from res
defaultearch.
