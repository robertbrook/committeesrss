[normal]Written evidence on behalf of Portia, Dr[bold].[bold] Elizabeth Pollitzer, Director[bold], 25 August 2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary
[normal]Background of the Organisation
[normal]Portia
[normal] is a not-for-profit organisation
[normal] (
[normal]http://www.portiaweeb.org.uk
[normal])
[normal] based in the UK, originally established in 1997 by a group of 
[normal]women 
[normal]scientists at Imperial College
[normal] 
[normal]to advance 
[normal]gender equalit
[normal]y in STEM.  M
[normal]ost recently
[normal], Portia led 
[normal]the 
[normal]influential European 
[normal]FP7-funded project
[normal] genSET (
[normal]http://www.genderinscience.org
[normal]).  genSET asked science leaders to
[normal] 
[normal]examine
[normal] the research evidence 
[normal]on gender
[normal] issues in science and produce a
[normal] 
[normal]consensus 
[normal]report with recommendations for action at institutional level. 
[normal] This resulted in a report with 13 specific and achievable recommendations. In 2011, genSET 
[normal]created the Gender Summit platform
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]http://www.gender-summit.com
[normal] to continue the 
[normal]dialogue between the 
[normal]scientists, policy makers
[normal] and gender scholars, to 
[normal]jointly consider 
[normal]the 
[normal]research evidence and agree on the actions
[normal] needed to address gender problems and improve 
[normal]quality
[normal] of research. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Information for the Committee
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1. 
[normal]Taking the EU as a whole, 
[normal]80% of 
[normal]A-Grade (full professor) academic positions are 
[normal]taken by men. This is 
[normal]a little lower
[normal] th
[normal]an 10 years ago, down from 85%. 
[normal] The average 
[normal]female professor figure for the UK is
[normal] 
[normal]20.8%
[normal] (taking all universities together)
[normal]; a
[normal]mong the top 10 universities it ranges between 14% (Imperial College) and 33.8% (University of Bristol).
[normal]2
[normal]. The 
[normal]historical 
[normal]absence of women in
[normal] research – as participants, 
[normal]as 
[normal]subjects, and 
[normal]as 
[normal]beneficiaries – has resulted in science 
[normal]having 
[normal]more
[normal] evidence for men than f
[normal]or w
[normal]omen
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]in the ‘male’ 
[normal]being 
[normal]accepted as
[normal] the norm in
[normal] study design, and in 
[normal]the 
[normal]application and communication 
[normal]of research. 
[normal]The efficacy of research, therefore, is not the same for women and 
[normal]for 
[normal]men. 
[normal]For example, nearly all that is known about the effects of environmental pollution is
[normal] based on studies involving men, but overwhelmingly, pollutants affect women and m
[normal]en differently. 
[normal] 
[normal]3. 
[normal]When researchers 
[normal]do 
[normal]pay
[normal] attention to 
[normal]biological and social 
[normal]di
[normal]fferences between women and men, 
[normal]stunning discoveries
[normal] follow
[normal].  For example, 
[normal]muscle-derived 
[normal]female stem cells have 
[normal]better
[normal] regenerative properties than equivalent male cells
[normal], and 
[normal]the 
[normal]metabolic profiles of women and men 
[normal]are 
[normal]distinctly different
[normal]. 
[normal]F
[normal]indings 
[normal]such as these 
[normal]have huge implications for diagnosis and therapy, and for health economics. 
[normal]A brief overview 
[normal]of when and why sex and gender matter in science
[normal] can be found in 
[normal]a 2
[normal]-page “A-Z Guide Why Gender Matters in R&amp;D”
[normal] produced by Portia
[normal], 
[normal]which is 
[normal]available at 
[normal]http://www.portiaweb.org.uk/index.php/publications
[normal]. 
[normal]It
[normal] is not only health where it matters what is female and what is male
[normal].
[normal]4. P
[normal]romotion to professorial po
[normal]sitions requires
[normal] sound record of research grant applications and performance as Principal Investigator (PI). 
[normal] But
[normal] 
[normal]fewer women than
[normal] men apply for research g
[normal]rants - 
[normal]in numbers that correlate to how many women are pre
[normal]sent at professorial levels
[normal]. 
[normal]C
[normal]ritically, 
[normal]when women d
[normal]o apply, they are 
[normal]minimal
[normal]ly but systematically
[normal] less successful than men
[normal] in being awarded a grant
[normal], even in fields where they are well 
[normal]represented, such as Life Sciences
[normal] and Social Science, as shown in Figure 1 below.
[normal] 
[normal]5. 
[normal] W
[normal]omen apply for smaller grants, 
[normal]receiving on
[normal] an average of £44,735 less per grant than men
[normal].  This means that they have 
[normal]less money to engage additional researches 
[normal]in the
[normal]ir
[normal] project
[normal]s (e.g. 
[normal]to provide statistical or data analysis support
[normal]) than the better funded male PIs
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]6. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is important to demonstrate intellectual independence during the early career stage and establish
[normal] 
[normal]a sufficient 
[normal]author status by being the primary 
[normal]author and publishing papers in
[normal] high impact journals.  But even
[normal] at
[normal] this stage
[normal], men tend to hold higher status pos
[normal]itions and have bigger labs whilst 
[normal]women have greater teaching loads, as well as the main 
[normal]burden of family responsibilities
[normal], so 
[normal]have fewer hour
[normal]s for research compared to men and 
[normal]produce fewer r
[normal]esearch papers, which 
[normal]puts them at a
[normal] clear
[normal] disadvantage
[normal] in
[normal] selection process
[normal]es that
[normal] 
[normal]use men’s productivity as the norm.
[normal]7. 
[normal]Figure 1 
[normal]below 
[normal]compares
[normal] the success rates for women and men across the three a
[normal]reas 
[normal]funded by E
[normal]uropean 
[normal]R
[normal]esearch 
[normal]C
[normal]ouncil
[normal] (ERC)
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]Physical and Engineering Sciences, Life Science, and Social Sciences
[normal].  A
[normal]cross all three areas men received more grants than women.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal] Furthermore, 
[normal]T
[normal]able 1 below compares 
[normal]the 
[normal]gender balance 
[normal]found among ERC project teams with
[normal] the gender balance 
[normal]found among the complimentary groups of researchers based 
[normal]in universities.  This Table
[normal] show that men
[normal] are routinely favoured in the
[normal] appointments
[normal] to ERC research teams, starting from
[normal] PhD level and continuing at eac
[normal]h next career development step, and this adv
[normal]antage is greater than could be justified by how many women and men are available in the system at each level. So, for example, at PhD level, ERC grants engaged 38% of women and 62% of men, which compares to 49% of female PhDs and 51% of male PhDs across E
[normal]U universities.

[normal]. 
[normal]Each 
[normal]ERC grant
[normal] creates an 
[normal]opportunity to engage between 5-
[normal]7 additional researchers to suppo
[normal]rt the PI.  T
[normal]he 3
[normal]400 
[normal]grants awarded to-date 
[normal]would create opportunities for involving an additional 
[normal]20,000 researchers
[normal], in total.  Around 20% of ERC 
[normal]grants 
[normal]are 
[normal]hosted in the UK
[normal] and they represent a very important channel for promotin
[normal]g the advancement of talented j
[normal]unior researchers
[normal] by placing them among the PI’s peers and providing opportunities to gain valuable experience
[normal] as collaborators, co-auth
[normal]ors, and members of influential academic
[normal] networks. If women are overlooked when project teams are established, they are left out from research career pathways that can lead them to 
[normal]the 
[normal]top-level positions in STEM.
[normal]10
[normal]. 
[normal]As employers, 
[normal]UK 
[normal]univers
[normal]ities 
[normal]have been increasingly adopting the
[normal] 
[normal]Hay System of Job Evaluation.  This
[normal] methodology originated
[normal] in the 1950’s in the USA
[normal] as a way to measure work and 
[normal]the 
[normal]payment levels for different types of work
[normal] in manufacturing
[normal]. It is 
[normal]n
[normal]ot we
[normal]ll suited to the collegial and team-based
[normal] nature of academic world
[normal]. 
[normal]Individuals are recruited to the specific pathway
[normal] (e.g. teaching,
[normal] teaching plus research, or primarily
[normal] resea
[normal]rch) and can progress along the
[normal] pathway
[normal] but cannot 
[normal]move between pathways
[normal], e.g. 
[normal]from teaching to research.
[normal]  This can create 
[normal]gender bias 
[normal]in recruitment, which cannot be corrected later, 
[normal]if men are recruited primarily to the research focused 
[normal]career 
[normal]pathway
[normal]s
[normal] and women to the teaching-oriented ones
[normal], which they may acce
[normal]pt not knowing the c
[normal]onsequences
[normal] as a way of managing 
[normal]the pressure of 
[normal]career-life 
[normal]respons
[normal]ibilities during 
[normal]early career stages
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in
[normal] different employment sectors?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]experience of the 
[normal]Daphne Jackson Trust (
[normal]http://www.daphnejackson.org
[normal]), whose mission 
[normal]is 
[normal]to return women trained in STEM
[normal] back to STEM
[normal] after a family related career break
[normal] would be an excellent source of this information.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The Trust was established almost 30 years ago by Prof Daphne Jackson, the first female physics professor in the UK, who observe
[normal]d that it would 
[normal]be 
[normal]inconceivable if
[normal] society allowed Marie Curie stack shelves
[normal] in the supermarket just because she had two children, and so it should not be right that talented women scientists are stopped from pursuing their career aspirations because they become mothers. 
[normal] The Trust’s experience suggests that when women leave scien
[normal]ce they 
[normal]work
[normal] as librarians, 
[normal]teachers, 
[normal]assistant 
[normal]editors, 
[normal]project 
[normal]managers
[normal], charity workers
[normal], in media, accountancy, and in admin-oriented jobs, i.e. mainly in roles where science training has no benefit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should universities and the higher education 
[normal]sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]27% of women but only
[normal] 
[normal]9% 
[normal]of men worry that a career in science will make it impossible for them to have a family. 
[normal] 
[normal]Supporting women during 
[normal]the critical stage between PhD
[normal], the post-doc training,
[normal] and early group leader is crucial
[normal]. 
[normal] For this, u
[normal]niversities
[normal] must recognise the negative influence of the societal 
[normal]amb
[normal]ivalence in attitudes to 
[normal]gender equality.  On the one hand, women are encouraged to p
[normal]ursue higher education and on the other they are 
[normal]discouraged 
[normal]from 
[normal]pursuing
[normal] 
[normal]career aspirations 
[normal]on the same terms as men.
[normal] 
[normal]13
[normal]. 
[normal]Science believes itself to be ‘gender neutral’ but this is an illusion that hides a whole range of gender bias effects. 
[normal]Universities 
[normal]need to 
[normal]be pro-active in encouraging 
[normal]women to apply for research grants, by making sure that women’s teaching loads are not bigger than those of men
[normal], and that they are mentored appropriately.  When project teams are formed, they should be guid
[normal]ed to ensure gender balance.  When 
[normal]included as 
[normal]part of the team, women should not be overlooked
[normal] when there are opportunities for
[normal] collaboration, co-au
[normal]thorship or
[normal] 
[normal]co-supervision of students, and 
[normal]in the 
[normal]engagement in 
[normal]academic 
[normal]networks (not just women’s 
[normal]networks)
[normal].
[normal]14. U
[normal]niversities must recognise the pernicious natur
[normal]e of gender stereotypes and of the
[normal] 
[normal]gender bias 
[normal]effects 
[normal]in recruitment and promotion
[normal].  
[normal]A 
[normal]study 
[normal]reported in 2012, 
[normal]led by Yale university
[normal],
[normal] in which 127 science faculty from research-intensive univ
[normal]ersities were asked to rate the application materials of a student – who was randomly assigned either a male or female name – fo
[normal]r a laboratory manager position, showed that b
[normal]oth male and female professors rated the male applicant as significantly more comp
[normal]etent and preferable to hire than the (identical) female applicant. They also offered the male applicant a higher starting salary and additional career mentoring support
[normal].  
[normal]S
[normal]cientists may be rigorously trained to be objective, but just like the society at large, 
[normal]hold 
[normal]gender beliefs that tend to valorise men
[normal]’s progress
[normal]. 
[normal]15
[normal]. 
[normal]In 2010, a panel of science leaders from across Europe met to evaluate available research evidence on ge
[normal]nder issues in science
[normal]. 
[normal]They agreed on 13 specific recommendations, which they felt could be implemented and would produce important benefits for individuals, their institutions, and t
[normal]o science. Their report is 
[normal]available at 
[normal]http://www.genderinscience.org
[normal] .
[normal] 
[normal]The recommendations call for integrated
[normal] 
[normal]actions
[normal] to improve: 1) science knowledge making, 2) 
[normal]institutional practices
[normal] and processes, 3) 
[normal]creation 
[normal]of human capital, and 4) 
[normal]compliance with regulation.
[normal]16
[normal]. 
[normal]In 
[normal]Norway, despite the acceptance of the quota mechanism for women, not one university has as yet achieved even 30% target of women professors.  Universities must examine their processes and practices for sources of gender bias and weed them out. T
[normal]he
[normal] 
[normal]Universi
[normal]ty 
[normal]of Tromso 
[normal]implemented a trial evaluation process designed to simulate the promotion process, thereby ensuring that women candidates can be confident that they are ready for promotion before applying. The Tromso board has also set the conditions that all
[normal] advertised positions will have search committees specifically charged with finding women applicants, requiring that the applicant pool for any particular positi
[normal]on has no fewer than 40% women, and has made available 
[normal]funds 
[normal]for department 
[normal]chairs and deans 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]identify specific support measures 
[normal]such as 
[normal]short-term buy-outs from teaching duties, statistical support, research assistance, data processing support. 
[normal]17
[normal]. 
[normal]In the UK, 
[normal]the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)
[normal] has made future 
[normal]research 
[normal]funding 
[normal]cond
[normal]itional on the academic partner achieving at least the Silver Award of the Athena SWA
[normal]N Charter for Women in Science
[normal]. The SWAN scheme was introduced in the UK ten years ago to promote gender equality in recruitment
[normal], advancement and promotion of female acade
[normal]mics. 
[normal]Following the NIHR decision
[normal] in 2011
[normal], a
[normal]pplications to the SWAN Charter Award soared, trebling in number during 2012-2013.
[normal]18
[normal].  
[normal]Universities can also examine their 
[normal]approaches to managing their academic 
[normal]human resources 
[normal]to ensure that during 
[normal]recruit
[normal]ment women are not channeled into 
[normal]career pathways that limit opportunities
[normal] to establish intellec
[normal]tual independence and assemble the
[normal] solid record of research experience
[normal] that is needed for advancement in STEM
[normal]. 
[normal]1
[normal]9
[normal].  
[normal]Whilst science institutions may differ grea
[normal]tly in their overall strategies,
[normal] 
[normal]and in 
[normal]their wish to 
[normal]maintain independence and ability to co
[normal]mpete,
[normal] 
[normal]they are
[normal] responsible for 
[normal]gender equality in 
[normal]the distribution of 
[normal]research resources and 
[normal]of 
[normal]the associated c
[normal]areer 
[normal]development 
[normal]opportunities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should
[normal] the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]. 
[normal] The legal framework places 
[normal]responsibility for
[normal] equality and diversity
[normal] on universities as employers but this is a too narrow scope for addressing gender inequalities in science because it overlooks the 
[normal]social importance
[normal] 
[normal]of science institutions and scientists, for example as
[normal] 
[normal]policy advisers to the Government or guardians of 
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]ethical and social responsibility concerns in 
[normal]the 
[normal]s
[normal]cienc
[normal]e governance. The Government could
[normal] insist that the soc
[normal]ial importance of science is recognised
[normal] by involving both women and men, equally, in science governance and in major policy consultative roles. 
[normal]21
[normal]. The 
[normal]Norwegian experience 
[normal]shows that
[normal] 
[normal]universities can easily shrug-off policies promoting positive gender-balancing actions by claiming ‘excellence
[normal]’ to be thei
[normal]r main goal.  The Government could
[normal] insist that the distribution of public research resources (to which wom
[normal]en contribute as taxpayers) should
[normal] not disadvantage women as researchers, as subjects of research and as beneficiaries of 
[normal]the 
[normal]societal inv
[normal]estment in science and technology.
[normal]22. The Government can also fine-tune the childcare support policies by recognising the special demands placed on women scientists (and men) during early career stage who have childcare responsibilities, such as having to
[normal] attend conferences or work late in the lab to complete experiments.  Their childcare 
[normal]issues may be more complex and 
[normal]costs can be higher than those of the parents in other sectors
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with few
[normal] opportunities to increase income without taking time away from res
[normal]earch.
