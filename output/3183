defaultWitnesses:

defaultProfessor Richard Daviesdefault, Durham University, and 
defaultProfessor Kevin Andersondefault, Deputy Director, Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Manchester, gave evidence

defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good morning. Thank you very much for coming along this morning; we appreciate it. I will start by asking how important gas will be for the UK’s energy mix over the coming years.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: You have to say in what context you want to ask that question. If it is in the context of climate change, to which most of my work relates, gas cannot play a very significant part in our energy system going forward, even if you take the DECC or the CCC view on this, because it is a very high-carbon fuel—it is 75% carbon.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But gas is much lower carbon than coal, isn’t it?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: It is 75% carbon, so it is a high-carbon energy source. When you burn gas, you get carbon dioxide. We know what carbon budgets we have both domestically and internationally, so you can do the basic maths on that. If you are serious about climate 
defaultchange, gas cannot be a large part of your future. If you are not serious about climate change, gas can be a very significant part of the—
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are you a supporter of nuclear energy?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: I am agnostic. We wrote a report on it recently, and I remain agnostic about nuclear power. It is a very low-carbon source of energy—much lower than gas. Even gas—
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would you prefer nuclear power stations to gas power stations?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: If I had the choice, in terms of climate change, without a doubt. You have to set the context every time. If it is for climate change reasons, nuclear has about a 10th of the emissions of gas, with carbon capture and storage.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I am not an expert on economics, the supply chain and so on, but my understanding is that we are committed to gas for 30 years. The real issue is how we work out the transition and get to a future beyond that. In terms of the shale gas agenda, it is a question of where we might get our gas from, rather than whether we will have gas for the next 30 years. I understand that that is Westminster Government policy.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: My answer to the question is that the estimates of the amount of gas that is available are quite considerable. You really need to ask how many wells you are willing to drill. We know that the amount of ultimate recovery from a gas well in the 
defaultUnited States
default is anywhere between 1.4 billion cubic feet and 5.9 billion cubic feet. That sounds like a large number, but it is actually a very small number, so you need a lot of wells to produce an amount of gas equivalent to what you would have got from the 
defaultNorth sea
default, for example. The question—to turn it around—is, how many wells can you drill economically or with social acceptability? If you drill thousands, you will produce reasonable volumes of gas.
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It may be quite hard for you to give me this kind of figure, but so that we can compare apples with apples, is it possible to say how much energy one frack-pad could produce compared with one large wind turbine?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I do not have those sorts of statistics.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Does anyone have them? I have been trying to find this out and it has been quite hard.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: There is probably a significant range of answers to that question, depending on where the wind turbine is and where the shale gas well is. What I will say is that our statistics from the southern 
defaultNorth sea
default, from where you get conventional gas, show that those wells produce tens of times more gas than a shale gas well. You therefore need to drill a lot of wells. One of the questions this Committee may ask is, how much gas is there? I would say, how many wells do you want to drill?
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default You have given us some figures. Can you give us a rough idea of how that compares with the 
defaultNorth sea
default? When you say thousands, are you suggesting that you need a certain number even to make it viable—even to consider doing it? People are looking at ones and twos now. If you are talking about hundreds or thousands, presumably you are saying that you need to start with 20 or 30 even to get off the starting blocks. Can you give us a bit of an idea, because honestly I do not think that most of us know how many tunnels will be required
default?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: That is the $64,000 question. Frankly, I do not think anyone knows. At the moment, you have estimates from the BGS for the gas reserve in the Bowland. That is 
defaultone of the 
defaultUK
default’s shale reserves—obviously, it does not cover 
defaultWales
default at all—but they are estimates with a capital E. That is exactly what the BGS would say. They are very dependent on the thickness of the strata that have been selected. I am not saying that the estimates are wrong, but there is a difference between estimates and what we know, and a difference again, when you do know, between the reserves and what is exploitable. So that is absolutely the $64,000 question. In terms of taking everything forward, I would also set the context that we need to look at this in the two phases that would normally apply for gas exploitation—an exploration phase followed by an operational phase.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: The key word is “resource”. The numbers that are being used are for resources—theoretical volumes of gas under the ground. The number for northern 
defaultEngland
default is 1,329 trillion cubic feet of resource. If 10% were recovered, that would be 133 trillion cubic feet. That outstrips the 
defaultNorth sea
default’s supply of gas since it started, which is around 88 trillion cubic feet. These are vast numbers, but to produce 10% of 1,329 trillion cubic feet may require tens of thousands of wells.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default Tens of thousands of wells? So we are not even talking about just 1,000 wells.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: That is right. We are making an assumption that US wells are a good indicator of what UK wells would do, but if the US analogy works, I come back to what I said a few minutes ago—you really have to ask yourself how many wells are economic and can be drilled in the social environment we are in.
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default Can you describe what a well consists of?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: When it is being drilled, a well is a derrick tens of metres high. Eventually—for 10 years—you will have a wellhead that is 2 or 3 metres high and will be difficult to spot. It will sit on a well-pad the size of a cricket pitch.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: But you would have to refracture fairly regularly on some of these wells.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: If the economics were right, you could go back and refracture, yes.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: I want to come back to the point about trying to find some overall scale for this. Unfortunately, I tend to work in cubic metres, whereas Professor Davies talked about cubic feet. Just to give you some handle on it, at the moment the 
defaultUK
default consumes roughly 100 billion cubic metres of gas. Very approximately half of that comes from the North sea, a quarter from 
defaultQatar
default and a quarter from 
defaultNorway
default. The BGS middle estimate for the Bowland shale reserve is about 38,000 billion cubic metres.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So 100 billion cubic metres a year is what we use at the moment.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: Yes—100 billion cubic metres is what we use at the moment. BGS’s mid-estimate, I think, for the Bowland shale is that there is 38,000 billion cubic metres of gas there. However, as Professor Davies quite rightly pointed out, even if that is correct, you cannot get all of it out. If you could get just 10% of it out, that is the equivalent of 38 years of our current gas consumption. That is from one resource—the Bowland shale resource. The BGS mid-estimate is that there are 38 years of current gas consumption in that one alone.
defaultOne other number I would add to that is that, if there were that amount of gas and you took out and burned 10% of it, it would pretty much wipe out the whole of the UK Government’s carbon budget between now and 2050.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I know Stephen wants to get in, but can I ask you one thing? How many wind turbines would we need to build over the next 30 years to meet our carbon emission targets?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: I am sorry about the detail of this, but we have two sets of carbon emission targets—the ones we sign up to internationally and the ones we sign up to domestically. Those are completely different, so you would have to tell me which ones you were talking about. Our international commitments—
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can you give me a rough figure for both?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: You are talking not just about electricity but about the whole energy system—providing fuel for planes—
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Roughly how many would you like to see us build?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: I would like to see us go much further offshore with some of them—the much bigger ones, at 7 MW. We would be talking about tens of thousands of those, but that would not be enough. It would be inappropriate to suggest that you could use just wind to provide all of the UK’s energy needs.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default Do you have very specific figures for 
defaultWales
default for potential reserves and their potential value? We have heard some quite strident figures of something like £70 billion of reserves being available. Personally, I am quite sceptical about such figures, given the uncertainty that all of you have described. What do you make of those types of claims about value and availability of resources in 
defaultWales
default?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I would genuinely like just to keep stressing that these are estimates—they really are. One borehole has been drilled in the 
defaultUK
default so far to give us an idea of how much gas is there—one. Tens of thousands have been drilled in the 
defaultUS
default. There are big dangers in comparing and tracking across. That is not to diminish the possibility, but these are what they are—they are estimates. The Welsh Government have just issued a small contract to BGS to try to get the first handle on demand and reserves in Wales, but these are not cheap figures to come across—you need people out there drilling holes.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default So currently there are no accurate figures specifically for 
defaultWales
default—either for money or for the amount of reserves.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Even those for the Bowland are estimates. I stress once again—as many times as I possibly can without all of you getting fed up with me—that these are estimates. There are dangers in thinking that they are absolutely accurate—they are not.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default The other day, it was suggested to me by an expert in the field that because of all these factors we would not see these resources in Wales exploited in his lifetime—for the next 30 or 40 years.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Again, I think it would be really useful to set the whole context in the normal way in which these extractive industries work. They do not just dive straight in—there has to be an exploration phase first. As you proceed into the exploration phase, you get a better idea of what is below ground. This stuff is 2 km below ground. To know what is actually there, you need to be down there to take samples and to bring them back to the lab and test them. You will get a good indication from the geology, and the geology of 
defaultWales
default is quite rich, in one sense, for potential shale gas; I am sure that Richard can comment on that. However, you still have to define how much organic content there is and how suitable the shale itself is. I do not think that work has been done for Wales yet.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default Can we try to get a practical idea of it? As you are probably aware, some licences have been granted for exploration in the Vale of Glamorgan, which part of my constituency covers. I do not know how much you know about it, but how many frack-pads would you need on a site such as that to exploit the resource that is potentially under there? Can you give us even a finger in the wind?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: You know that it is possible to drill horizontally these days—that is really part of the key to the whole shale gas development. The world record for drilling horizontally these days is 10 miles or something like that—it is really quite substantial. Obviously, that adds to the cost of the whole thing, but I suspect that one of the key issues when it comes to looking at the exploitation phase will be the trade-off on the economic side with regard to how far people need to drill horizontally. I know the discussion in the 
defaultBlackpool
default area at the moment is precisely about how closely spaced the pads will be. The technology will allow you to drill horizontally and frack, so theoretically you can have the pads quite a distance apart, but obviously that adds to the expense. Again, those are all still in the unknown category.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I just wanted to add that you can drill perhaps 10 to 12 wells from one pad—and then multilaterals. Where you have a thick shale such as the Bowland, you can think of doing it in multiple layers, like a multi-storey car park. In the 
defaultUS
default, it is multilaterals in one layer—a thin layer. In the Bowland, they are thinking of doing it in multiple layers. That may decrease the spatial extent of the exploration and production activity because you have thick shale in one place. Each well may produce around 2 billion cubic feet of gas—
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Each well may produce 2 billion cubic feet?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: Something like that. The range I gave earlier was 1.4 to 5.9, but let us just use 2 as a simple—
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can we do it in metres?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I cannot convert to metres on the spot, I am afraid. I am sorry—the industry uses billion cubic feet a lot. We think from the States that each well produces 2. You would have 12 wells on one pad, perhaps, each producing that sort of volume of gas in its lifetime.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So you would get 24 billion cubic feet from one well.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: From one well-pad, potentially—if we can use the US as an analogue.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Earlier someone said that we use 100 billion cubic metres a year, so that is potentially one well supplying a quarter of our gas needs.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: No, it is not. I have done a quick calculation; I am sorry, but I am going to use different units. We import 50% of the total gas that we use. Basically, you would need hundreds of wells—probably in excess of 700—to produce every year half of our gas use in the UK.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default Just to nail this on the head, when people talk about us exploiting these resources in the way that has been done in the US and this being a revolution—big terms like that—essentially, we are talking about an extremely different context here in terms of geology, space, potential implications and the ability to exploit on the same level as the US, Australia and places like that.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: Yes—and we will need a lot of wells. That is why I keep reversing the question. If you say, “How much will we get?”, I will say, “How many wells do you want to drill?”
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default Just so that we are clear about it, the 700 wells would be only seven pads. You just said that 700 wells could supply half of our gas needs.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: No. Based on the 
defaultUS
default analogy, for 1 trillion cubic feet you require between 169 and 714 wells. We use 3.6 trillion cubic feet a year.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default I was coming from the fact that 
defaultSwansea
default 
defaultBay
default city region is on the shortlist to be the 
defaultUK
default city of culture 2017. One of the issues people are interested in is, if we suddenly fully exploit shale gas, what will 
defaultSwansea
default 
defaultBay
default city region look like as a tourist and cultural destination? Will it be a pockmarked landscape? What are we talking about?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: That is a very difficult question to answer. What I will say is that a well-pad can have quite a small visual imprint—it could be difficult to see. We have 2,150 wells in the 
defaultUK
default already. I doubt many people have seen them, so a well-pad can have a small visual imprint. Obviously, if you need thousands of wells—which is the sort of thing we are talking about—that will have an imprint. As I said earlier, a well-pad would occupy approximately the same space as a cricket pitch. Based on the US statistics for gas productivity, you may need hundreds, possibly, or more—a thousand-plus well-pads—to produce a significant volume of gas.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default Before Professor Thomas comes in, can I widen the question to 
defaultWales
default as a whole? 
defaultWales
default is a sparsely populated, very beautiful country at a time when globally we are seeing a massive increase in the amount of tourism coming out of 
defaultChina
default, 
defaultIndia
default and the BRIC countries, so the economic opportunity for 
defaultWales
default is absolutely immense in terms of our natural environment. How much of a threat are all of these cricket-pitch size fracking-pads, if fully exploited, to 
defaultWales
default’s economic opportunity in tourism?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: That is completely outside my sphere of expertise. I will give you some context. There are 250,000 abandoned coal-mine shafts in the 
defaultUK
default, and we do not know where they are. We do have a history of coal mining, which gives you some idea of the legacy of a very significant fossil fuels industry, but I do not know. That is completely outside my area of expertise, so I am afraid I cannot answer the question.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default Does Professor Thomas want to come in on this?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I would find it hard to relate to the vision of a sort of moonscape.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default An aerial view of pockmarked 
defaultWales
default.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I have probably seen the diagram depictions that you have seen. I find it hard to imagine that 
defaultWales
default would look like that. There is one excellent example of best practice. I am not really here just to defend that, but there is a drilling farm in 
defaultDorset
default called Wytch Farm, which has been in operation and producing for quite a long time. I suspect that most of us do not even know it is there, and that if you went to 
defaultDorset
default you would not know it was there. Again, it is not for me to say, because it would require everything that we have recommended in our report—good regulation and best practice—in developing wells. I would just say that right here in the 
defaultUK
default today there is an example that is working.
default              defaultChair:default Thank you. I had better move this on a little bit. Professor Anderson can come back in a minute.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default I think it is another hypothetical question that you probably will not be able to answer. It follows on from Stephen Doughty’s reference to the Vale of Glamorgan. Assuming that an investor could get over the regulatory hurdles that would be in their way and that it was viable to frack in the Vale, have you made any assessment of what the economic benefits—not 
defaultthe economic downsides or the impact on tourism—might be for people who might derive employment from the project and, consequential to that, what the positive impact on manufacturing industry in Wales might be? Has anybody been able to hypothesise, based on a very conservative estimate of what might be possible?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Personally, I am not aware of anyone having done that sort of study. The fact that so little is known about the volume of gas that is potentially in 
defaultWales
default is probably holding people back, but I cannot believe that that cannot be done. I know that studies like that are done for other areas, so I think it is perfectly feasible, but I do not know of anyone having done it.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: To put it in some context, are you talking about local jobs? Previously, I worked for 10 years in the petrochem industry. I worked in north 
defaultWales
default as one of the commissioning engineers for the Point of Ayr gas terminal, which feeds Connah’s Quay power station. Most of the people who worked there were not from 
defaultWales
default. They were brought in, as they normally are for very large petrochem projects, from other parts of the 
defaultUK
default—principally 
defaultScotland
default and the north-east, going by the accents. We did use some local employment for setting the foundations—the groundwork—but above ground most of the people came in for a one or two-year stint and then went back or went to another project elsewhere. I do not know how that would play out, but when you ask the employment question, you need to ask it in the context of the local skill set that is actually there and to ask whether or not the industries that would be doing it would use that local skill set.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default There would be a construction phase, presumably, which would have a measurable impact. The people who might then be responsible for running the installation might not necessarily originate locally, but they might live locally and therefore have some positive effect on the locality. Professor Davies mentioned that there were 2,150 existing wells, so there must be some employment comparison that already exists in the 
defaultUK
default for the number of people who are currently employed in the sector. Do we know how many that is?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I do not have statistics on that. We have drilled 2,152 wells since 1902, so 19 a year on average. For the next four or five years—because, as Professor Thomas pointed out, the UK is in an exploration phase—I would not expect more than the same sort of number of wells to be drilled. I doubt very much at all will happen for the next four or five years. Unlike the 
defaultUnited States
default, which had rigs in 
defaultTexas
default that could be refitted and moved to 
defaultPennsylvania
default and so on, we simply do not have the supply chain for a huge industry right now. It is the exploration phase—half a dozen wells a year. That sort of number is more realistic.
default              defaultChair:default I want to make sure everyone gets a chance, so can I bring in Nia next? I will come back to Geraint in a minute.
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default One discussion that arises time and time again, of course, is that the population is exactly where the coalfield is. When we look at things such as the earthquake frack—we know we are talking about tremors, not tsunamis—we also know villages that have been blighted by subsidence and so forth. It is exactly those areas that will have the fracking, so how much do you see that sort of issue being a problem? Obviously, we are aware of what happened in 2011, with the seismic movements up in the north-west. To what extent is that a real problem?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I do not think there is any evidence to show that it is a big problem. I refer back to the report group of which I was a member. We looked very closely at that; it was one of the terms of reference of our report. At Blackpool, it seems that the fracturing process 
defaultintersected with a fault that was already in the ground. In the main, you will not really feel anything. These are things that are happening 2 km below ground. “Earthquake” does not seem to be the appropriate word to use—these are tremors. You are unlikely to feel the majority of them. However, the report advocates a traffic-light system for any excessive movement that comes about. Again, the key to it all is to make sure that regulations are in place so that these things are managed according to a traffic-light system.
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default I accept that we are not talking about major earthquakes, but we do know that subsidence has long blighted our communities in south 
defaultWales
default.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Yes, but with coal mining you are taking out up to half a metre of space. A void is created there. These are fractures in the shale itself—there is a borehole and fractures. There just isn’t the void displacement to cause that sort of subsidence.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: BGS, which is an independent company that is looking at this, thinks that the seismic problem is very small indeed. If we take the ones you saw around 
defaultBlackpool
default, there are 60 or so of those per year naturally, and they are incredibly small. From my reading of BGS’s outputs on this, its view is that seismic concerns are very much exaggerated in the press.
defaultLeading on from the point that you made about where people are living, I think the other point we have not dealt with—this goes back to one of the earlier points—is the traffic implications. While the well itself might be like Wytch Farm—Wytch Farm does not have to be refractured quite regularly—you may have to go back on a significant number of occasions to refracture some of the wells. That would involve a lot of traffic. While the site can be dealt with by a clever bund around it that is grassed and so forth—that is what they do at Wytch Farm—the traffic side is an element that has not been appropriately addressed. Of course, there are no parallels with the States, because very few people live in those areas. If you are looking at these issues, you have to put all the bits together and then make your judgment.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: What my colleagues have said is very important. At Durham, we have researched some of these classic risks. On contamination of water, I am afraid there is no evidence to support the claim that fracking itself—the cracking of rock—contaminates water. Spilling chemicals or leaking wells—coming back to the well issue—can contaminate water. Earthquakes can occur. The biggest event that has happened was 3.8; it happened in 
defaultCanada
default in 2011. However, we have only three places where felt seismicity has happened, after hundreds of thousands of fracking operations. So it is a small risk, but it is there.
defaultAs Kevin said, in the UK we need to focus on the really big risks—the things that people see. There is no doubt that there would be increased road traffic, which would cause a nuisance—and worse. We need to re-address the conversation to what are clearly the important risks.
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultJonathan Edwards:default What would be the benefit to the Welsh Exchequer of the exploration and extraction of Welsh shale sources?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Jobs would be created. You represent 
defaultWales
default; I live in 
defaultWales
default. I do not need to tell you that energy is not an insignificant issue. In south Wales, we have major employers that are huge consumers of energy. In the world where I live, I often hear about the energy demands of those large employers. If there is a local supplier of gas that is connected to those big energy users, there is a dynamic that might work well. However, I am not an economics expert; somebody would need to study that.
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultJonathan Edwards:default Can I frame it in another way? In your view, if you have a view, who should have the proceeds of Welsh exploration and exploitation of Welsh shale resources—the UK Government or the Welsh Government?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Can I pass on that?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: If I were Welsh, I would say the Welsh Government, but I will not make comment on that. On the employment side, you have to think that any investment brings with it employment. If you have a certain amount of money that you need to spend on energy and you spend it on fracking operations and shale gas, clearly you cannot spend that same amount of money on wind turbines or a 
defaultSwansea
default bay tidal barrage scheme. You will have employment from whatever form of energy you generate. When we look at these issues, you cannot just assume, “Here is this employment that comes with wind turbines, shale gas or whatever else.” You have to look at the portfolio of opportunities that are there, how much money you have to spend—
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But isn’t there a difference, Professor Anderson? Wind farms require a subsidy, which requires taxation, and taxation means less money for those who are taxed, which means less investment. Jobs cannot be created through subsidies, whereas those who want to frack are saying absolutely, “We don’t want any money. All we want is the permission to go ahead.”
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: You may well be right about that, but you would need to have a chat with the Chancellor. He has given tax breaks to shale gas exploration, so the subsidy is happening for shale gas.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Isn’t he simply saying, “I will tax you at only 30% while this gets up and running”? Thirty per cent of a lot of money is better than not having anything at all.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: Talk to National Grid about the onshore wind turbines. Those virtually do not need a subsidy now because the structure is actually in place—we are still using it. The onshore wind turbines, which are much cheaper to build than offshore wind turbines but have a lower output—a lower capacity factor—are now pretty much comparable with a lot of the generation that is on the grid, so I think we have to be careful about how we do the subsidies.
defaultWe also have to be careful about what other subsidies are going into these things. I drive a diesel car. Someone has to pay for asthma inhalers because of the particulates that come out of diesel. We are always paying subsidies, in one way or another. The subsidy argument is often polarised, rather than people standing back and looking at the array of issues you have to take account of.
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Davies, do you want to come in on that?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: No, I have nothing to add on that. My colleagues have done a good job.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default Obviously energy bills are very much at the top of the political agenda in terms of the cost of living crisis. Does anybody have particular views on how energy bills would reduce if fracking were fully exploited? Would it reduce the price of gas, or would that not happen?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: I think it is fair to say—there may be one or two other exceptions to this—that the only person who has come out and said that bills and the price of gas would come down significantly with shale gas is our Prime Minister. The Committee on Climate Change does not agree with that. The DECC report that has come out did not agree with that. It will be part of the European gas network. It may make some very small marginal 
defaultchange to the price of gas within that European gas network, but there is no suggestion that shale gas will significantly reduce energy bills in the UK, because we are part of a gas network.
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Davies, some people would think that the basic rules of supply and demand are that if you introduce a large quantity of something the price falls. Is that not the case with shale gas?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I am afraid that, again, I will have to stick to my area of expertise, which is the geoscience and engineering element. I am not an expert on economics; I think Kevin has more of a background in that. It is not an area I can cover.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: No one—other than the Prime Minister, I think—is suggesting that you would see a significant reduction in the price of gas because we are part of the European gas network, which is partly influenced, of course, by things like the Russian gas supply. The Russian gas supply is also very large, so we would be adding to an already very large gas network.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But in the 
defaultUS
default gas prices have fallen to about a third of the level that they are here, haven’t they?
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: But they are not part of the European gas network. They fell partly because of the tight oil that came with it. Part of the fall in the States is because of the price of the gas, but they are not tied into the European gas network. I suppose you could untie us from the European gas network and the price structures that are there. You could do that, although that would be quite challenging in itself—and risky. If you are prepared to do that, you may be able to make parallels with the States, but you cannot make parallels when we are part of the European gas network. I do not think any economist is coming out and saying at the moment that we would see prices come down because of shale gas.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: The other point I wanted to add is that, for any of this to make a material difference to the UK so that the gas price can change a little bit, there will need to be a lot of wells, and those wells will need to be checked. I am not sure the regulatory system is absolutely razor sharp in terms of well checking. I am basing that on our historical track record on that.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Do you mind if I follow up on the well issue? We as a group were asked to look at two issues: seismicity, the one that you raised, and groundwater contamination. Those were obviously the headline issues everybody was worrying about. Our report addresses those issues and concludes that, frankly, the risks are relatively low, although that is not to dismiss them.
defaultThe area our group was most concerned about was the drilling of the wells and so-called well integrity. It is not rocket science, really, but if you drill a hole in the ground down 2 km to where the shale is, you will create a short circuit. If it is not properly constructed and sealed, that could lead to contamination and things like that. The whole issue of well integrity was placed right at the forefront of concerns, in our report.
defaultA lot of work has been done since then. We advocated that there should be an environmental as well as a regulatory look at it. Through their new office, the Government are addressing those issues. There have been statements recently about the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive working together more closely.
defaultOur group felt—this picks up some of the worries that Richard mentioned—that there should be an independent examination of all of these issues on site. I think it is fair to say that we are still working towards that final agenda. I would like continually to repeat that risk escalation is needed here, because there is still only one hole that has been drilled in the UK—just one—compared with 10,000 in the US. Comparisons with the 
defaultUS
default do not hold water at all. The market is completely different. It is really difficult to say what—
default              
defaultChair:default I suppose we will not know until we drill some more holes.
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default What are the 
defaultUS
default experiences of the risk of contamination?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I am sure you have all seen the “Gasland” video. It seems likely that that is just a manifestation of the very worst practices—
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is it the case that that has been comprehensively disproved?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Yes, it has. It is just an example of the kinds of practices in which we would not engage in the UK.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default And it never happened in the first place. There was already evidence of leaks of methane into the tap water in that area.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I think it has to be said that we have a solid regulatory system. If Richard’s predictions are correct—and that is a big, big if—you would have to scale up the capability to regulate, to manage and to inspect, but we are not there yet. That is part of the risk development and risk escalation phase—whatever the right phrase is.
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default How robust is the American regulation regime now to deal with issues like that?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: I am not too familiar with the 
defaultUS
default system, but I can tell you about ours. The 
defaultUK
default industry has been drilling holes successfully. Our view as a group was that, if there was going to be the sort of exploitation that Richard has talked about, that needed to be developed further to make it fit for purpose. I think the Government’s response is positive and that they are moving in that direction already. As the estimates and everything else become clearer, everything needs to keep pace with that.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default Obviously the process creates large amounts of waste water, significant amounts of which will come back up to the surface, potentially, during the process. Where does that go? How do you see its being dealt with in an environment such as the Vale of Glamorgan or elsewhere in south 
defaultWales
default?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: That is a very good question. If it goes ahead, those are really important areas to focus on. The water treatment issue needs to be addressed. In a sense, it is no different from any other major industrial process—you would have waste water, and that waste water would need to be properly addressed. It would have to be cleaned up before it could be discharged back.
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default So you would need central facilities to be built alongside a fracking area to deal with it.
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: That is one possibility. It would be up to the organisation doing it to decide exactly how it wanted to do it, subject to the regulatory regime. You are absolutely correct to say that it is not clean water; it definitely needs treatment. Those are some of the issues that we put in a wider context. We as a group felt that groundwater contamination and 
defaultseismicity were not at the highest level of those issues and were possibly distracting attention from some of the other issues that needed it.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: 
defaultIn
default the 
defaultUS
default you can do two things with it—you can clean it or you can inject it. You cannot inject waste water in 
defaultPennsylvania
default because they do not have the right geology, so they have to clean it there. 
defaultPennsylvania
default is a good analogy for the 
defaultUK
default because we cannot inject it deep underground, unless it is going into an old oilfield to enhance recovery from that. We do not have enough oilfields to get rid of all the water. In Pennsylvania, what we have seen is the development of a water-cleaning industry and new technology and innovation that are part of the supply chain to handle the flow-back water.
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default So in a place like the Vale you would have to clean it and then discharge it into the 
defaultBristol channel
default or somewhere like that.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: You would have to clean it. That is what happened to the water from the 
defaultLancashire
default borehole. It was cleaned and then the clean water was put into the 
defaultManchester
default ship canal. The analysis of the flow-back water is in the public domain, on the internet, if you want to see it.
default              defaultChair:default We must have some fairly speedy questions now.
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default On this particular point, I know that in the south of 
defaultEngland
default—particularly Hampshire and the Test valley—there is significant concern about the impact fracking would have because there are aquifer-fed rivers that have a huge social and economic impact on the area anyway. It is not just about how you put clean chalk-stream water back into the system—it is about the vast volume of water that would be required in the first place. There are concerns that that would lower the overall level of the aquifers and therefore have a pretty significant effect on the whole ecosystem of the whole of the south of 
defaultEngland
default. Is that a legitimate concern?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I am not an expert on water, but I will say this: you need between two and 16 Olympic swimming pools of water to do a fracking operation in the United States. Where you have low levels of water—as in southern 
defaultEngland
default during a hosepipe ban—of course that sort of water is material and important. Compared with how much water is used in power generation and domestically, it is a very small percentage, but nevertheless, if you have a shortage, it is obviously important.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default Professor Davies mentioned that the regulatory system is not razor sharp. Environment Agency 
defaultWales
default has been separated from the Environment Agency for 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default, and Natural Resources Wales is looking after things. Is that regulatory regime robust and big enough to cope with the emergence of fracking on a
default 
defaultbig scale?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I want to clarify what I said. I was talking about well checking, in particular, not the whole environmental and regulatory regime. On well checking, I think we could do a bit better in the 
defaultUK
default as a whole. About half of the wells that have been drilled in the 
defaultUK
default were owned by companies that do not exist any more.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default The question is about Wales specifically.
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: I suspect that in 
defaultWales
default the same system applies. I doubt that well checking is done quite as well as it is done in 
defaultPennsylvania
default, for example, but if there is any local knowledge I will stand corrected.
defaultProfessor Andersondefault: Going back to regulation, no one has mentioned carbon dioxide, but unfortunately no one is regulating the CO
default2
default at the moment. I do not mean the methane emissions themselves—I mean actually getting this stuff out of the ground. We may be concerned about the local environmental impact, but no one has raised any concerns about the global environmental impact. I find that a little worrying, given that the Welsh Government set up the Climate Change Commission well before the UK Government set up the Committee on Climate Change. They have been one of the leading Governments on climate change, yet there are no significant concerns or questions about—
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default If there were hundreds of wells in 
defaultWales
default, would they be regulated properly?
defaultProfessor Thomasdefault: Like any other place, Wales would need to develop its regulatory capacity if that level of well drilling took place. The primary responsibility for well drilling lies with the Health and Safety Executive. In our report, we advocated that an environmental impact assessment should come in as well. What is happening today is that the Environment Agency—certainly in 
defaultEngland
default—is talking to the Health and Safety Executive about doing that.
defaultI do not know all the details in 
defaultWales
default. I know that Environment Agency Wales is being challenged at the moment on shale gas, along with all the other unconventional gas. From private conversations with people at the agency, I know that they are looking at this and working on it. However, I make the point again that, if this were to develop to this scale, there would need to be a commensurate increase in the capacity to do things. More people would need to be employed and trained. As you know, at the moment the initial approach goes to a local authority. That seems fine at the moment because there are not many of them, but, if Richard’s scenario came to pass and there were hundreds, you do not need me to tell you that you would have to increase the capability to manage that.
default              defaultChair:default Glyn, do you have a last question?
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default I was going to come in on the regulatory regime, but we have covered most of that. There is one question that has been in my mind for quite a while. We covered visual impact very early on in our discussions. That is something that interests me quite a lot. We talked about the site for one well being the size of a cricket pitch. If we have a very deep seam and horizontal drilling, we can put a lot of wells on one particular site. We might find that that happens more in the 
defaultUK
default than in the 
defaultUS
default because the seam may be thicker in the 
defaultUK
default. Are we still talking about each well being the size of a cricket pitch, or could you have 10 or 20 wells on a site not much bigger than for one?
defaultProfessor Daviesdefault: That is right. You have physically to move the rig—if you think how big a rig is—to drill the next one, to shift it again to drill the next one and so on. As close as you can do that will be the spacing of the 10 or 12 wells.
default              defaultGlyn Davies:default That is all I wanted to understand.
default              defaultChair:default Gentlemen, thank you very much for coming in this morning. I would like to call the next panel.
defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultWitnesses: 
defaultTrefor Owendefault, Executive Director for National Services, Natural Resources Wales, 
defaultGareth Clubbdefault, Director, Friends of the Earth Cymru, and 
defaultNick Molhodefault, Head of Policy, Climate and Energy, WWF
default-UK
default, gave evidence.
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good morning. Gentlemen, we know who you are, but would you like to introduce yourselves for the record?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: My name is Gareth Clubb. I am director of Friends of the Earth Cymru. I would like to put on record my disappointment that Welsh-language translation facilities were not made available, despite my request.
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You could have come to 
defaultCardiff
default if you had wanted to and given evidence in Welsh, but we thought that Friends of the Earth believes that defending the environment is more important than any other issue and wanted to welcome you here as soon as possible.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Thank you for your welcome.
defaultNick Molhodefault: I am Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy for WWF 
defaultUK
default.
defaultTrefor Owendefault: Good morning. I am Trefor Owen. I am an executive director with Natural Resources Wales.
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Molho and Mr Clubb, you will have seen that fracking is being widely used in the 
defaultUnited States
default. As a result, its CO
default2
default emissions are about half what they were in 1990. That is probably quite good news, isn’t it? Why aren’t you both supporting fracking?
defaultNick Molhodefault: I find the 
defaultUS
default example very interesting because it has often been portrayed as a great example of cost-effective emission reductions over the last 10 years. What is interesting is that that omits two important things. First, between 2000 and 2005, the share of US coal that was being exported to foreign markets was in the region of 5%. By 2012, and in parallel with the development of shale gas extraction in the 
defaultUS
default, the share of exports had rocketed to 12%—an increase of around 150% just over the last few years. That coal is being shipped to other markets in Asia and parts of 
defaultEurope
default, where it is being burned and adding to global greenhouse gas emissions. That impact is often forgotten in the shale gas arguments.
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What you are saying is that we should encourage companies that are buying 
defaultUS
default coal to switch to other energy sources. If they, too, switched to fracking, that would reduce CO
default2
default emissions quite drastically.
defaultNick Molhodefault: I think this misses one important reality, which Kevin Anderson touched on in his testimony, which is around the overall impacts of fossil fuels and gas on climate change. I want briefly to drill into this. There are two important elements to it.
defaultFirst, at a global level, earlier this year, the International Energy Agency made it clear that in order to have a 50:50 chance of staying under 2°C, which is the level commonly described by climate scientists as the threshold that constitutes dangerous climate change, two thirds of currently proven fossil fuel reserves would have to stay underground. The figure for gas is just under 50%. What the IEA describes as currently proven fossil fuel reserves are reserves that have been technically discovered, are recoverable and can be extracted with a 90% certainty of making a profit, so it is a very small pool of the overall fossil fuel reserves that actually exist globally.
defaultSecondly—bringing this debate back to the UK—one of our big concerns is that we are seeing links showing that the exaggerated hopes that have been pinned on the impacts of shale gas exploitation in the UK risk developing an energy policy that is far too biased 
defaulttowards an excessive reliance on gas or the construction of excessive amounts of gas infrastructure. I think this creates two sets of risks for the 
defaultUK
default. First, it risks busting our carbon budgets. The Committee on Climate Change has been very clear that both on the heating side and on the power sector side our reliance on gas needs to go down significantly during the 2020s. Secondly, it also risks undermining the long-term policies we need to attract a significant amount of investment in low-carbon infrastructure. That investment is key not only for meeting our carbon targets but for keeping the lights on, for accelerating the cost reductions of renewable technologies and other new forms of low-carbon technology and for protecting our energy bills from an over-reliance on fossil fuel price variation.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: There is no example of a fossil fuel having displaced another fossil fuel. Every fossil fuel that is exploited is additional. In the absence of an internationally binding global agreement on carbon emissions, that will continue to be the case. The only exception to that might be peat, and I do not think that is even classed as a fossil fuel. When the US has heavy exploitation of shale gas, that means that the coal is not displaced but used elsewhere, and it is additional.
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So would you be happy if we switched some of our coal-fired power stations to shale gas-fired power stations?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: The problem is that those emissions are all additional. If we do not use the coal, someone else will use it. Without a binding global agreement on limiting greenhouse gas emissions—
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So why don’t you support nuclear? That gives large amounts of base-load electricity with no CO
default2 
defaultemissions.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: It is not without CO
default2
default emissions; it is what is classed as low carbon. We can get to a very low-carbon future without going down the route of highly expensive nuclear power, where there is no solution to the nuclear waste.
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default By using highly expensive offshore wind, for example.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: By using offshore wind, which by the mid-2020s will be cheaper than the nuclear deal that was announced at the start of this week.
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default With all due respect, you were also opposed to the 
defaultSevern
default barrage, which would have produced electricity with no CO
default2
default. You oppose gas, which produces lower amounts than coal. You are opposed to nuclear. It is a bit hard to see how you think we can produce the electricity that we all desperately need.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: You might ask the Welsh Government, because they have a target for double the electricity consumption of 
defaultWales
default to be produced from renewable sources by 2025. That is their target.
defaultNick Molhodefault: May I quickly touch on the question of the relationship between coal and gas in the 
defaultUK
default market? We have to remember that the 
defaultUK
default is not faced with a false choice between a heavy reliance on coal, on the one hand, or a heavy reliance on shale gas, on the other. Not only is the Committee on Climate Change clear that reliance on gas needs to diminish quite substantially in the 2020s—the figure for the power sector is in the region of 10% of electricity demand by then—but a mounting amount of evidence from both the International Energy Agency and from the latest study of electricity market reform by the Committee on Climate Change shows that the move towards a low-carbon power system is not only technically feasible in the UK over the next 20 years but also economically desirable. For instance, using the future gas projections from the International Energy Agency, the CCC 
defaultshowed that, by reducing reliance on gas, UK consumers could save between £25 billion and £45 billion over the lifetime of low-carbon infrastructure, because you are reducing your exposure to long-term rising gas prices.
default              
defaultChair:default I think that is questionable.
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default I am interested in a similar area—relative to cost, and the way it might displace coal or otherwise. I have heard your view that in the States the coal is being exported and used elsewhere. That may happen there, but in 
defaultBritain
default we are currently using a huge amount of coal, which will come to an end fairly soon—in 2015, I think. Irrespective of what anybody thinks, a lot of that will be filled by gas in the short term. Don’t you think it is better that we should access that gas in 
defaultBritain
default rather than import gas, which we are currently doing? Either it will come from overseas or we could, through shale gas development, produce it here.
defaultNick Molhodefault: There are two important dimensions to that. One of them is, what time frame are we talking about when we talk about shale gas exploration and exploitation in the 
defaultUK
default? Separately, what actually sets the gas price that we pay in the 
defaultUK
default? In answer to the first question it is clear that, given the maturity of the UK shale gas sector in terms of the state of the onshore drilling market, the fact that we are at the exploration stage and the fact that we have a lack of mid-stream gas infrastructure such as the gathering pipes that bring the raw gas to processing facilities, in the theoretical case that the UK has large amounts of cheaply exploitable shale gas reserves, those would not come on stream until the early to mid-2020s. Even the work that Pöyry did for Cuadrilla highlights this. So shale gas is not an answer to our short-term issues with respect to security of supply.
defaultThe second point I would make is that the evidence that has been published to date by 
default 
defaultBloomberg, from Ernst and Young and from the International Energy Agency suggests that UK shale gas cannot be extracted cheaply enough, fast enough and in enough volume to take over the price-setting role for gas from imported gas. In other words, in order for the price materially to change in the 
defaultUK
default, the question is not only one of reserves but one of the speed at which you can actually extract the gas to offset the market dynamics. The conclusion that Bloomberg reached in its latest report on shale gas was that the likely price for 
defaultUK
default shale gas would be between $8 and $12 per unit. That is very similar to the price of gas we have seen on the spot market in the 
defaultUK
default over the last two years, precisely when energy bills have been high. Now, the second—
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Molho, I admire your enthusiasm, but I ask you to be a bit shorter with your answers.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I would like to add one thing. Coal does not stop in 2015. The two coal-fired power stations in 
defaultWales
default are not slated for closure under the large combustion plant directive, so there will still be a substantial amount of coal being burned in 2015. Would gas be helpful in terms of supply? There are enough gas supplies around the world to fry the planet. The answer is that it is not of benefit in terms of the global emissions portfolio to be extracting shale gas in Wales.
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default This is a really interesting area. I am thinking in terms of the mid-2020s, when shale gas might come on. We are assuming that shale gas may be accessible and competitive; I would not say that it will be cheap, but it will be competitive. I am talking about 2020, when we will see fantastic growth across the world for gas supplies in places such as the far east. The gas that we have been accessing in Britain, coming in through the Haven, where we were last weekend, and other places, will just come to an end, because the far east will want all of it. They will pay a higher price for it and will take it. We are putting ourselves very much in the 
defaulthands of those who might want to sell us gas at a very high price when we have to reduce our own access to energy supplies in Britain.
defaultNick Molhodefault: I think this overlooks the recent dynamics that we have been observing in the far east, in particular. As the International Energy Agency and the 
defaultPew
default 
defaultCenter
default recently made clear, we have seen nine consecutive years of growth in low-carbon investment in the far east, with 
defaultChina
default now being the biggest investor in renewable energy. Just in 2012, 
defaultChina
default spent $65 billion on the deployment of renewables. The IEA has observed that in 2012 the significant increase in energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment in 
defaultChina
default slowed down the rate of growth of Chinese emissions for the first time. There is a growing appetite for lower-carbon sources of energy in the Asian region that will partially offset that dynamic.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Your point is actually a strong incentive for us to develop our own zero-carbon renewable infrastructure here in 
defaultWales
default and in the 
defaultUK
default. The fuel used for renewables has no cost. We know already that, according to Cuadrilla, the fuel from shale gas will have a basically insignificant impact on fuel prices. Gas prices are volatile and are likely only to increase over time. What we need to do is to focus on zero-fuel-cost renewables.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default I want to move on to some of the local impacts. I am aware of your concerns about the global impacts—the greenhouse gas emissions—but we asked the previous set of witnesses about the process itself, potential contamination of groundwater supplies and the waste water. What are your views on the local environmental impacts and how things such as water contamination and disposal of waste water can be dealt with effectively—or can they not be?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: It is important to recognise at this stage that, as far as 
defaultWales
default is concerned, we are talking about a hypothetical situation because we do not have any wells that have been drilled. We are at that point in the process. If a proposal comes forward, Natural Resources Wales will look at the evidence on groundwater reserves. If that is a source for water companies to draw water for potable water supplies in what we call source protection zone 1—in other words, the highest level of classification—there will be a straight objection to any drilling, with no hesitation.
defaultBeyond that, we expect operators to provide us with details of any liquids or substances they may want to use in this exercise and of their disposal and, indeed, water use subsequently. We would apply a methodology based on the groundwater daughter directive—it is called the groundwater daughter directive; everybody asks about that—to assess whether a substance was hazardous or non-hazardous. If a substance was deemed to be hazardous, again a permit would be refused.
defaultWe would also ask the operators to provide us with a waste management plan. Earlier, one of the professors described how that would be used. We would obviously monitor that through audits, spot checks, site visits—
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default So you would have the clear regulator role if, for example, they were proposing to put waste water into rivers in the Vale, out into the 
defaultBristol channel
default or elsewhere.
defaultTrefor Owendefault: Exactly. They would have to apply for a number of permits under the environmental permitting regulations—up to 11 in total. I have touched on one. The mining waste directive would also require a waste management plan. Again, we would want to see how that water was to be treated.
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default I have one last point. You described it as hypothetical at this stage, but you must be looking at the longer-term horizon—where this may be going, given the intention of some of these companies. Do you feel that the regulatory regime as it stands is ready to cope with this, or would it have to adapt and change to cope with the potential scale the previous set of witnesses talked about?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: The Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010, which we would apply in 
defaultWales
default for all onshore oil and gas, are regarded as robust and well understood. I should also say that the position is consistent with that of England.
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default There has been a bit of concern. Obviously, Natural Resources Wales is a new organisation and its critical mass is quite a lot smaller than that of the Environment Agency in England. You have been criticised for not insisting on certain permits such as a radioactive waste permit for unconventional gas exploration in 
defaultWales
default, unlike the Environment Agency in 
defaultEngland
default. Do you have a response to that particular criticism and to the general case that you are now a small beast in the park at a time of enormous change and environmental exposure through shale gas exploitation?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: Let me clear up any misunderstanding to start with. As I just said, the regulatory approach that we adopt in 
defaultWales
default is based on the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010. That is entirely consistent with 
defaultEngland
default. We have also clarified that position to developers and others in 
defaultWales
default.
defaultYour second point was about our capacity and capability. It is important to say that a number of the staff who transferred across from 1 April to Natural Resources Wales were working before then—as part of a larger team, as you would expect—on developing guidance and methodologies. We have that team in place, but what is very important is that we have maintained clear relationships with colleagues in 
defaultEngland
default, through a knowledge transfer agreement and a project board. In an area as complex as this, it obviously makes good sense for countries to be working together, as we are between the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: We do have concerns about regulation, in relation to both the Welsh Government and National Resources Wales. Other than this one page, the Welsh Government have no planning guidance on onshore oil and gas. Out of all the thousands of pages of planning guidance that the Welsh Government have, that is the sum total of everything to do with shale gas and underground coal gasification.
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I would say it is admirably concise.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: That is one way of looking at it. According to the WLGA, “The view from local planning authorities is that there is a lack of Planning Policy Guidance/Technical Advice Note/Best Practice notes etc with regard to fracking and assessing planning applications for that form of development.” There is no technical advice note and no mention of it in “Planning Policy Wales”.
default              
defaultChair:default I will say for the record that that was one page, so that the transcribers know what it was.
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default What is your understanding of why that is the case? Notwithstanding what Mr Owen said about co-operation between 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default, which is important, why has there been a reluctance to produce a technical advice note?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I can theorise. This dates from December 2000. One theory is that the Welsh Government are quite happy to go along with what Westminster is doing, but do not want 
defaultthe responsibility or accountability or to act in a transparent manner, because that would mean that local communities in Wales that are opposed to these developments in their area would be able to point the finger at the Welsh Government and say, “Why aren’t you doing enough to protect us?”
default              defaultMr Williams:default We have some history of that in other areas.
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I invite Mr Molho to comment. Perhaps Mr Owen can then speak for the Assembly Government.
defaultNick Molhodefault: May I make a brief comment in relation to the Environment Agency and the situation in 
defaultEngland
default? One of our local concerns is to do with well integrity and the potential impact that this may have on groundwater contamination. A recent study by the European Commission suggested that around 5% of fracking wells may be impacted by the issue of well integrity—in other words, that the well is not sufficiently well sealed from the external environment to prevent contamination. In the theoretical example of the 
defaultUK
default sitting on significant reserves of shale gas and having its own shale gas revolution, Bloomberg suggests that this would require at least 1,000 wells per year at the peak of activity. Given the significant staff cuts that the Environment Agency has suffered over the years—further ones were announced last week—I have concerns about whether the Environment Agency will be in a position to provide the robust oversight that this issue requires going forward, especially if this shale gas revolution materialises in the future.
defaultTrefor Owendefault: I will certainly not speak for the Welsh Government. I understand that the Welsh Government have provided the Committee with evidence on their position on shale gas. I understand that they believe that their national planning policies and supporting guidance provide a robust precautionary approach to this particular subject. I think they also said in their written evidence that they would review that in the light of practice and evidence.
defaultIt is important for me to underline that Natural Resources Wales respects the wishes, or the views of both Governments. It is clear that the UK Government and the Welsh Government have different approaches or attitudes to shale gas, but our focus is on ensuring that we base decisions on good evidence and a clear understanding of the uncertainties. We will assess each case on a case-by-case basis, using the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010.
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default I want to pick up the issue of environmental assessment. In the evidence from Friends of the Earth, Gareth Clubb alluded to the fact that there does not seem to be a requirement for an environmental impact assessment, which you would expect with any sizeable development. Why do you think that situation has arisen? Do you think that there ought to be such a requirement? If an environmental impact assessment were made for any suggested fracking development, that would at least be an interim solution before a technical advice note became available.
defaultTrefor Owendefault: In this instance, the environmental impact assessment is part of the planning process. Using the regulations, the local planning authority can initially screen the need for, and then demand the production of, an environmental impact assessment.
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default Do you think there should be a stronger recommendation—not just that the local planning authority can screen, as it does for all applications, and then decide to have one, but that it should be mandatory to have an EIA for any fracking operation?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: That is a matter for the Welsh Government and the planning authorities to discuss. What I can say is that Natural Resources Wales would be invited through the planning process, as a statutory consultee, to provide advice on the screening and on what 
defaultshould be considered within an EIA if one were demanded. We would also be invited to comment on a completed environmental impact assessment, again as a statutory consultee to the local planning authority.
defaultNia Griffith:default If the authority decided to ask for one.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: There may be some confusion here, so let me try to clear it up. There is unlikely to be an environmental impact assessment unless Natural Resources Wales takes the view that there would be an environmental impact worth assessing. When an application for an EIA was requested by the Vale of Glamorgan, Natural Resources Wales said, “Our view is that such developments are unlikely to have significant effects, and we would not ask for an environmental impact assessment to be undertaken.” It is specifically and absolutely ruling out an environmental impact assessment for exploratory drilling.
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default Following on from that, what would you like to see happen?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: There should be a default that environmental impact assessments are required for all of these developments. The reason they are not required is that these developments tend to be 0.99 hectares. If they were 1 hectare, an environmental impact assessment would be required. I do not think that size threshold is a reasonable threshold to use to allow this industry to evade what any other industry would be required to do—an environmental impact assessment for something that could have environmental impacts, which are unlikely to be revealed unless you do that EIA.
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default I want to go back to one point you mentioned earlier, Mr Clubb. You used the expression “zero-fuel-cost renewables”. What does that mean? How is it achieved competitively in 
defaultWales
default?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: For all renewable technologies—wind, solar or tidal—other than biomass burning, which I would consider to be a separate compartment in any case, the fuel costs are nil. They will always be nil because, by its nature, it is provided by the environment. For 
defaultWales
default, that means that the higher the proportion of your energy that you get from renewable sources, the better you can know what your energy costs will be. As Nick mentioned earlier, there are very substantial economic benefits to moving rapidly to renewables, as opposed to a dependency on fossil fuels, which are volatile in terms of price and are likely only to increase in price.
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default If we take 
defaultWales
default specifically, what proportion of current demand, let alone future demand, could be delivered as a result of those technologies?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: The Welsh Government target is for double our electricity demand to be met by renewable sources by 2025. In 2011, the latest year for which statistics are available—
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default Double from what to what?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Double the entire electricity demand of 
defaultWales
default. Electricity demand in 
defaultWales
default has been reducing year on year for about the last five years and is now about 12% less than it was five years ago. Gas use is down by about 26%, so we are reducing our energy consumption.
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default That is the recession.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: It predates the recession, Glyn. However, the 2025 target is a very substantial one. In 2011 we were generating 8% of our electricity from renewable sources, which leaves 192% to be found by the Welsh Government somewhere between now and 2025. There is a 
defaultproblem, which is that the Welsh Government do not have the powers to be able to deliver on that. They may as well have a policy on space exploration as on energy, because they do not have the powers.
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default Can I press you on that? I am trying to get to what proportion of the demand could be met if they had all of these powers devolved to them. You talk about double the demand but, like most people, I do not actually know what the figures are. I am trying to get a rough estimation of the percentages from and to which we are going and, therefore, when you get to the bottom of your equation, of the extent to which 
defaultWales
default will still be dependent on imports or fossil fuel energy production.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Okay. Denmark, for example, has stated that all of its heating, electricity and transport needs—
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default Who has?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Denmark.
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default This is about 
defaultWales
default.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: This is to give you an illustration.
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default I do not want an illustration. I want to know what you think we can do in 
defaultWales
default.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: 
defaultWales
default could do exactly the same.
default              defaultSimon Hart:default I do not care about Denmark.
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You are saying that 
defaultWales
default could do what 
defaultDenmark
default is doing.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Wales could do what Denmark is doing.
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What has it done?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Wales could say exactly the same thing, which is that all our electricity needs will be met from renewable sources by 2025 and that our entire energy needs will be met from renewable sources by 2050, so there would be no need for fossil fuel.
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What has that done to its manufacturing industry?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: The Denmark economy is performing much more strongly than the Welsh economy or the UK economy.
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How much electricity is it buying from the French?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: It exports electricity to 
defaultGermany
default—very competitively.
defaultNick Molhodefault: To answer your question at the 
defaultUK
default level, which I hope will be helpful, in 2011 renewables provided 10% of 
defaultUK
default power, on average. On the projections going forward, a wide range of reports such as the offshore valuation report that was done by Government and industry and the work that Pöyry did for the Committee on Climate Change suggest that renewables could provide 60% or more of 
defaultUK
default electricity demand by 2030. Clearly, there is potential beyond that for the percentage to increase, although a clear challenge for the UK is the importance of increasing its interconnection links with the rest of Europe. In order to maximise its renewable electricity potential, the 
defaultUK
default needs to have export routes to 
defaultEurope
default to enable it to share some of the excess power at times of lower demand. That would bring economic benefits with it. That is why we have been calling for the UK Government, alongside their energy policy, to have a strategic interconnection strategy with their European 
defaultpartners, to make sure that we can guarantee system security and maximise export opportunities in a way that is as beneficial as possible to our economy.
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultJonathan Edwards:default Gareth, you gave a very enlightening answer just now: essentially, the Welsh Government are putting on the blindfolds, sticking on the earmuffs and pretending that the UK Government’s dash for shale gas is not happening. If that is the case, are you saying that the Welsh Government are not protecting Welsh communities from the dash for gas and the potential exploitation of Welsh shale resources?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: What I am saying is that the Welsh Government are depending on the framework that is set by the UK Government for 
defaultEngland
default to protect Welsh communities. If I were living in a community that had the potential for shale gas extraction to take place, I—like every community in Wales where this is proposed—would join a campaign against it, because I am not convinced that the regulatory framework is strong enough. The Welsh Government have been absolutely negligent in terms of the planning framework that they have applied to shale gas and unconventional gas.
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultJonathan Edwards:default So at the very least should the Welsh Government—and the National Assembly, for that matter—be working towards coming up with a technical advice note for unconventional gas?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: Absolutely.
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would you be willing to break the law, if necessary—to commit acts of trespass and so forth?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I am a law-abiding citizen.
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So you would condemn the actions of the Green Member of Parliament who committed an act of trespass.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I am a law-abiding citizen, but I do not pass comment on other people’s activities.
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I want to come back to something you said. With the joys of modern technology, I was able to look on Wikipedia, where I noticed that the Danes pay the highest household electricity prices in the world. Is that the model that you would like to see in 
defaultWales
default?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I would imagine that we are not far off it. I would also say that, if we continue our dependency on fossil fuels, before too long we will overtake Danish prices, because Danish prices are largely, and will increasingly be, predicated on zero-fuel-cost sources.
default              
defaultChair:default Let us hope so, for their sake.
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultJonathan Edwards:default I have a question for Natural Resources Wales. Your evidence states that you are working towards “one voice” guidance for developers, operators and local authority planners. What does that mean? Can you expand on it?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: We are currently using guidance that was developed by two of the predecessor organisations, the Countryside Council for 
defaultWales
default and the Environment Agency Wales. Since 1 April, as one organisation, we have provided a single voice to respond to requests for planning advice. We have now put in place a work plan to develop that guidance further to reflect the purpose and remit of the new organisation. We will be working that up over the next few months.
default              
defaultChair:default Geraint Davies has some further questions.
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default I want to come back to Trefor Owen. In the light of what Gareth Clubb has been saying, do you feel that there is a case to be made for the Welsh Government to come up with new TAN guidance at a lower level than the one at which you normally intervene to protect communities from the sorts of problems of environmental impact we have been talking about today, given that the number of these may be scaled up across Wales?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: That is obviously a question best answered by the Welsh Government. What I can say to you today as an environmental regulator is that the current planning in 
defaultWales
default and the guidance that is issued to planning authorities and others, as well as the energy policy that is reserved here at 
defaultWestminster
default, really have no impact on our ability to act as an independent environmental regulator. We feel confident that we are able to apply the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 across this particular sector, as we do across many other sectors that we regulate.
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default In terms of the integrity of the drilling pipes and the fracking and the release and cleaning of waste water, do you have sufficient powers to intervene, to prevent or to do impact assessments across the range of developments that would be exposed to Welsh communities?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: The Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 mean that developers will have to obtain up to 11 different permits, licences and consents to operate. This is an approach that is used in England and in Wales and that has been in place for some time.
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default Are you saying that the regulatory regime in 
defaultWales
default is as strong and robust as the one in 
defaultEngland
default and will continue to be so in relation to the development of shale gas?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: Yes.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I think there is some conflict between what Trefor has said and what his written evidence said. In its written evidence, Natural Resources Wales said, “
defaultwe would welcome further guidance and a policy framework from the 
defaultUK
default and Welsh Governments” in relation to shale gas. What he said just now seems to contradict that. He seems to be saying that the planning framework would have no bearing on the regulatory side of things, whereas NRW “
defaultwould welcome further guidance and a policy framework
default.” That seems to suggest that there is no policy framework from the Welsh Government—something I would agree with, actually.
defaultTrefor Owendefault: Can I come back on that point? I stand by what I just said in response to Mr Davies. Looking ahead, we are aware that there is now an opportunity to input into the next round of PEDL areas. We said in our evidence that we think that future developments should be directed away from protected areas; we are thinking here of national parks, AONBs and so on. We have commented on a scoping document for a strategic environmental assessment that is part of developing the new round of PEDLs. When that process is completed, we would like to see some feedback on how our evidence has been considered.
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default On that point, you are a new amalgamation of the Environment Agency Wales, the Countryside Council for 
defaultWales
default and the Forestry Commission. If you were the separate bits of that, wouldn’t the Countryside Council, in particular, be talking much more strongly and publicly about the need to protect environmental spaces, not just for their own sake but for tourism and economic benefits?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: The one voice that I mentioned in response to Mr Edwards’s question is about providing one voice on planning advice, in particular. We have a number of duties that we 
defaulthave to take into account, some of which were previously undertaken by separate organisations. We now have to consider our position by bringing together different opinions, against different duties, but ensuring that we provide one voice in doing so.
defaultMy comments on how we would like to influence the new PEDLs are really a signal to the UK Government about energy policy, rather than planning policies back in Wales because, obviously, energy is a reserved matter.
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default I am sorry to say this, but the impression out there is that CCW’s voice is being silenced by the new organisation, in the sense that people have always perceived the EAW as having a less stringent approach, perhaps, than CCW. There is a concern that we may be losing something in having Natural Resources Wales. Is there any way that you can be certain that you are incorporating exactly what Geraint just said about CCW and the possibility that it would have raised more concerns?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: I can assure you that the expertise from different parts of the organisation is working together very closely to ensure that we produce a single voice when giving planning advice.
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default Is the idea that national parks and areas of outstanding beauty should be exempted from fracking activity, possibly?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: That is the advice we have submitted as part of the scoping exercise for an SEA, but that is about developing what is effectively part of an energy policy here at 
defaultWestminster
default.
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I have two final points in relation to regulation. The first is that the spokesperson for the shale gas industry said in evidence to the 
defaultEnergy and Climate Change Committee
default, “Regulation is to be welcomed and will not add any significant costs.” We are in the unusual position that local communities, the industry itself, environmental NGOs and just about everyone else, except for the regulator and the Welsh Government, are in favour of more or better regulation.
defaultThe second point is that Natural Resources Wales is now a large landowner. There may potentially be shale gas resources under that land. It is probably fair to assume that there will be exploration activities. Under a European directive, a separation of functions is required between the part of the organisation that deals with regulation and the part that promotes a plan or programme. Can I find any process that has been set up to ensure that that European requirement is in place? No. Is there any published document showing that that has been put in place? No. Trefor could save me the trouble of a freedom of information request if he were to tell us right now what the status is internally, because it is now a long time after the formation of that body and it should have been in place on 1 April.
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Owen, do you want to come back on that?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: I can assure the Committee that there is a separation of duties between the land management functions, the teams that provide advice to planning authorities and the permitting teams. We would be very happy to share that explanation with Mr Clubb and with the Committee.
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Excellent. Mr Clubb and Mr Molho, we see that somebody from 
defaultWales
default is currently imprisoned in 
defaultRussia
default as the result of a protest against a Gazprom oil platform. Would it be fair for me to assume that neither of you two gentlemen is a great fan of Gazprom?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: It is a large corporation that is involved in fossil fuels. There is a role for fossil fuels in a very rapid transition to a zero-carbon future, but it is a rather subjective—
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The reason I ask is that today 
defaultThe W
defaultall Street 
defaultJournal
default has an article about a statement this week from the board of directors of Gazprom, who are apparently very concerned about the environmental problems that fracking could cause. What do you make of this new-found environmental crusade by Gazprom? Do you think it is genuine or possibly motivated by other concerns? Do you think the directors of Gazprom will be joining you on one of your next protest marches?
defaultGareth Clubbdefault: I find that unlikely. I imagine their new-found enthusiasm for the environmental implications of fracking is largely to do with self-interest.
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Indeed. If you want to get your own back on Gazprom and the Russians, who are imprisoning one of your colleagues, wouldn’t it be quite a good idea to think about supporting a well-regulated, well-run British shale gas industry, rather than increasing our dependence on gas from Gazprom?
defaultNick Molhodefault: Again, I think this runs counter to the economic evidence that we have to date from the likes of Bloomberg, Ernst and Young and the International Energy Agency, all of which suggest that UK shale gas will not be extracted cheaply enough, fast enough and in enough volume to offset the role that imported gas currently plays in setting the price for gas. It is important to remember that the 
defaultUK
default is part of the European gas market. In order to understand the gas price that we as 
defaultUK
default consumers will be paying in the years to come, we have to understand the projections that are being made for future European gas prices. What the International Energy Agency shows—this is highlighted very clearly in its “Golden 
defaultAge of Gas” report—is that, even with a strong expansion of shale gas throughout Europe, the trend for gas prices is up, all the way from here to 2035.
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Yet of the two main companies that are involved in this, one is publicly listed and its share price is going up at the moment. A lot of people are putting their money where their mouth is and think that they are going to make big profits.
defaultNick Molhodefault: I think this is a very dangerous strategy for a lot of investors, especially shareholders in oil and gas companies. Recently, the London School of Economics and an organisation called Carbon Tracker published a report called “Unburnable carbon”. What this report showed was that, if the world is serious about preventing the worst impacts of climate change and, therefore, preventing temperature rises in excess of 2° C, 60% to 80% of the coal, oil and gas reserves of listed companies will have to stay underground.
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That may be so, but you said that these companies were not going to make a profit. All I can say to you is that if you look at the share price of the one that is publicly listed, obviously a lot of people are putting their money into it because they think it will make a profit.
defaultNick Molhodefault: Fundamentally, the point I am making is that economic circumstances and the prospects for fossil fuel exploration are likely to change dramatically if we move towards a binding global agreement in 2015. When we look at the science coming out of the US and out of China, which is considering its own binding emissions cut from 2016 and has already set itself the target of generating 15% of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020 and an energy efficiency target of 40% by 2020, compared with 2005 levels, there are strong signs that the big players internationally want such a deal to happen. They understand that it is not worth risking the economic, international security and environmental consequences of unmitigated climate change.
default              defaultChair:default I have given you a good last word, but Nia Griffith has a further question.
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultNia Griffith:default Mr Owen, could you provide a note for the Committee on the relationship between the two parts of the EA in order that it conforms to the European directive that there should not be a conflict of interest between the planning side and the land ownership side?
defaultTrefor Owendefault: I would be very happy to do so.
default              defaultChair:default Thank you very much.
