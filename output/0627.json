"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Institute of Physics (ESA020)&#xa0;1.    What are the strengths and weaknesses of the funding, organisation, and work of the European Space Agency&#xa0;?&#xa0;1\n.  \nThe European Space Agency (ESA) operates with a clear mission-led focus and a structure that ensures buy-in from nation states and other space-related organisations\n.  \nAs a technical, rather than political, organisation, the ESA is able to concentrate on the issues which are essential to achieving its objectives.\n&#xa0;\n2\n.  \nIts key strengths are its leadership and mode of governance\n.  \nTh\nrough \na \nmember-based structure, \nthe \nESA is able to bring together \ndifferent\n aspects to create a stronger whole\n.  \nFor example, the UK’s strength in small satellite production and space science enables it to contribute to these programmes within the ESA at a high level, and \nto \nbenefit at a similar level\n.  \nWithin this\n arrangement\n, stability and commitment in funding through multi-year plans agreed with member states results in well-defined projects and measurable outcomes of projects and programmes\n.  \nThe dependence \nof the ESA \non the funding decisions of member states could be seen as perhaps a weakness as well as a strength\n.  \nBut this in many ways is mitigated by strong technical leadership within the organisation and the high-level \nagreement of long-term\n arrangements.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.  \nThe ESA’s ability to leverage the strengths of its member agencies allows it to deal as an equal with larger and perhaps better equipped space agencies such as a NASA and the Russian Space Agency\n.  \nThese relationships, along with the ESA arrangements with other national spaces agencies, such as the Canadian, Swiss and Norwegian agencies, also means that ESA is well-placed to offer contract services to other nations.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.  \nOne of t\nhe drivers of the ESA’s\n success is \nits\n geo-return policy (\njuste\n&#xa0;\nretour\n)\n \nwhich enables the nation states to retain a focus \no\nn their \nchosen areas\n –\n \nfor example,\n \nstronger domestic industries, government priorities or academic strengths\n – \nconfident that the ESA will reward \nthem\n with equivalent value in contracts\n.  \nThe ESA also enables member states access to expertise and experience not necessarily available domestically\n.  \nFor example, Belgium has no distinct ‘space agency’, but instead funds the ESA directly and allocates its share of \njuste retour\n monies to companies and sectors it feels are beneficial to its national economy\n.  \nTh\nis method of allocating funding does increase the overall cost of ESA missions but \nhas shown success in connecting with different priorities of national governments over many years\n.  \n&#xa0;\n2.    In light of the European Commission’s recent Communication on relations between ESA and the EU (COM 2012 671), what relationship between ESA, the EU and the UK would provide the most effective governance regime&#xa0;?  Why&#xa0;?&#xa0;5\n.  \nThe relationship between the ESA and the E\nuropean Commission\n is complex and it should be noted that the ESA, and European space science and technology in general, is succeeding under the \ncurrent governance arrangements\n.  \nFor example, programmes such as the Galileo \nNavigation S\nystem have been successfully developed and deployed though a partnership between the ESA and a number of other European and national agencies\n.  \nIndeed, it may be that some of the current tensions could be avoided with a clearer statement on the future management arrangements for Galileo and the roles of the \nEuropean GNSS Agency (GSA)\n.  \n&#xa0;\n6\n.  \nThe ESA is a technical operation\n that operates within a narrow \nscope\n.\n The focus that can result from what is essentially a single-mission agenc\ny should not be lost within an \nunderstandable enthusiasm to centralise the European science landscape\n.  \nWhile closer collaboration with other European science programmes, particularly the Horizon 2020 programme\ns\n, will undoubtedly generate some advantages and efficiencies, this may well \nalso \nhave a cost\n.  \n&#xa0;\n7\n.  \nUnder the current governance arrangements, the space agencies of member states have a clear and direct influence of the direction of the ESA\n.  \nThis model, combined with the recent introduction of the UK Space Agency (UKSA) has benefited the UK\n.  \nThe UK’s strength in telecommunications and small satellite technologies has allowed it to take a lead in this area within the ESA\n.  \nThe recently\n \nsecured funding for the ISIC in Harwell, and the decision to base new telecoms satellite monitoring headquarters in the UK \ni\ns a vindication of this approach\n and an illustration of the advantages to the UK of the current governance structures\n. \n \n3.    How effective is the EU’s support for research and innovation in the space sector?  What effect have changes to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) had on ESA and support for the space sector from the Horizon 2020 programme?&#xa0;8\n.  \nIt is \ntoo \nearly \nin \nthe cycle of the MFF to make a clear judgement on the effect\ns\n of changes \nto the budgets of\n European space science and technology, and it should be noted that the way in which the ESA is funded – though multi-year contributions from member states directly, rather than through central EU budgeting – will insulate it from \nsuch changes\n.  \nAt this stage it is possible that the proposed Horizon 2020 budget may be subject to a significant redu\nction over the spending period\n.  \nB\nut even if this is avoided, it is clear that there will be challenges ahead if European space activities are to maintain their current position\n.  \nAs with other \ninternational\n projects, it should ideally be the case that the\n \nESA \nbudget should have long-term stability as far as possible given the funding pressures on all research budgets. \nIts role in the global space science and technology communities requires that it is seen as a ‘reliable partner’, able to engage confidently on the timescales scales required for launches and their longer term developments that typically take years and in and in some cases decades.\n4.    How effective has the UK Space Agency been and what improvements could be made&#xa0;?  Is the UK effectively exploiting opportunities for growth in the space sector or could more be done ?&#xa0;9\n.  \nSince its establishment in 2010, the \nUKSA\n has been working to bring together many disparate fields and cultures under a single umbrella\n.  \nThe transition of\n some areas of\n administrative and governance functions to the UKSA areas has not been simple\n or smooth\n, and there remains work to be done to ensure that relationship\ns\n between UKSA and closely-related research councils such as STFC and NERC, and their respective academic communities, are maintained and strengthened\n.  \n&#xa0;\n10\n.  \nHowever, the rationale for the creation of a UK \ns\npace \na\ngency has not changed\n.  \nA single focal point, nationally and internationally, will enable a more coherent space science and technology sector within the UK, and allow the UK to punch its weight with international agencies\n,\n particularly within the ESA\n.  \nThe recent announcement from the ESA to locate its tele\n-\ncommunications hub in Harwell is a very positive sign\n.  \n&#xa0;\n11\n.  \nAdditionally, when talking about the ability of the UK to exploit and build on the strength of its space sector across the broader economy, the role of the ESA and the need for a strong, central UK voice should not be neglected\n.  \nJudicious allocation of \njuste retour\n (understanding the roles of SMEs) and other intangible benefits, and more specifically, working to ensure that ESA’s focus is closely aligned with the sectors in which the UK economy has strength, will be essential.\n&#xa0;\n1\n2\n.  \nThe UKSA is still very much a new organisation, building on the work of the previous \nBritish National Space Centre (\nBNSC\n)\n, and the establishment of a steering group that embraces a range of larger companies and stakeholders within the leadership function of \nthe \nUKSA was a welcome development\n.  \n There is a concern that, if the UK economy is to fully benefit from the investment through both the UKSA directly, and also through the ESA programmes, greater use should be made of smaller companies in the supply chains and enabling technology sectors\n such as photonics\n.  \nWhile the space sector is a significant contributor to the UK economy\n, and has been identified as one of the key technologies to bring the UK economy back to growth, \nsuch \nstrategies should take account of \nthese technologies and businesses\n.  \nT\nhe space sector does not exist in a vacuu\nm and a\n strong, broad industrial base is \nessential\n to \nensuring\n that the UK can involve itself in high-value supply chains\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1\n3\n.  \nAs it develops, we would look to the UKSA to bridge some of the gaps that have been apparent in the past between space technology and research\n.  \nIt is currently the case that, broadly, the ESA will undertake technical programmes while the national science agencies will take on the data analysis and research\n.  \nThis differs from the approach taken by, for example, NASA which will typically support both the mission and the exploitation of the data produced\n.  \nThere have been recent cases where UK researchers have been involved at a high level in the design and commissioning of ESA programmes, but were unable to access the results of the missions due to funding not being awarded \nby\n domestic research councils.  \nFor \na \nsplit arrangement to \nbe efficient and functional\n, \nthe \nUKSA and\n the\n ESA must work with domestic agencies\n at an earl\ny\n stage\n, \non the \nunderstand\ning\n that\n any\n UK research council\n funding will be awarded on a \ncompetitive, \npeer reviewed basis.  \n \n5.    Does the UK get good value for money from its membership of ESA&#xa0;?&#xa0;\n1\n4\n.  \nIt is clear that the\n UK\n \nreceives\n a significant proportion of what it invests in science\n back\n through ESA contracts that \nsupport \nhigh-technology companies\n.  \nThis, together with the opportunities that such high\n&#x2011;\nlevel, high\n&#x2011;\ntechnology international collaborations bring suggests in fact that the UK receives a significant return on its investments\n.  \nFor example, investment through the Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES) has been reported to have \nproduced\n \nreturns\n of 7:1.\n&#xa0;\n1\n5\n.  \nAs such, the questions should perhaps instead be : How does the UK’s return on investment compare to \nthat in \nother countries\n \n?  And how well does the UK steer this reciprocal investment to best g\nrow its space-related economy ?\n \n \nThese are\n area\ns\n that the committee might consider.\n&#xa0;\n1\n6\n.  \nThe ability of the UKSA to drive the ESA \ninto areas \nwhere the UK has strength is important, but also important is the strength of the broader UK science and technology base, and the capability of it to ‘absorb’ this investment\n.  \nThe recent strategies for the space sector have been an advantage \nand\n they ar\ne long-term ventures \nrequiring\n a\n long\n-\nterm commitment from government will be required if the UK is to keep pace with European competitors\n.  \n6.    How resilient is the UK’s space-based infrastructure&#xa0;?  Are threats from space debris or solar activity being appropriately mitigated&#xa0;?  What role do, or should, ESA and the UK Space Agency play in addressing these issues&#xa0;?&#xa0;17\n.  \nAt the ESA ministerial council on November 2012 the UK agreed to invest £6 million in the ESA Space Situational Awareness programme which retains a focus on monitoring developments in space debris and space weather, and links closely with other national and international programmes\n.  \nAt the same meeting the programme’s mandate was extended to 2019\n.  \nThis was a welcome \nextension\n of the UK’s role in the programme\n.  \nThe \nUKSA \nSpace Leadership Council includes members from the MOD, DfT and the BIS\n, \nand is well placed to\n \nadvise on all aspects of space weather.\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nwww.heraldseries.co.uk/news/10044791.Space_centre_investment_sees_100_new_jobs\n \nThe Impact of Space Derived Services and Data, Oxford Economics 2009 \nhttp://www.parliamentaryspacecommittee.com/media/publications/The%20Case%20for%20Space.pdf\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmbis/173/173.pdf\n \nhttp://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/UK-secures-1-2-billion-package-of-space-investment-683b9.aspx\n \nwww.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/About_SSA\n&#xa0;\n"
