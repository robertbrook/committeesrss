"&#xa0;\nDirect Line Group – Written evidence&#xa0;Draft Deregulation BillAlan Bint B.Sc. (Hons) ACII Chartered Insurer\n&#xa0;\nDirect Line Group welcomes the opportunity to respond to the above Call for Evidence, published by the Department for Transport in July 2013.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst Direct Line Group has no comment on the specific items mentioned in the Call for Evidence, we believe that there is an unintended consequence over the amendment to s.148 of the RTA.\n&#xa0;\nTo illustrate, the below shows s.148 marked up with the proposed amendments:\n&#xa0;\n148 Avoidance of certain exceptions to policies or securities.(1)Where a \ncertificate of insurance or certificate of\n \npolicy or \nsecurity\n \nhas been delivered under section 147\n \nis issued or given for the purposes of this Part \nof this \nAct\n to the person by whom a policy has been effected or to whom a security has been given, so much of the policy or security\n, \nas purports to restrict— \n(a)the insurance of the persons insured by the policy, or \n(b)the operation of the security, \n(as the case may be) by reference to any of the matters mentioned in subsection (2) below shall, as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under section 145 of this Act, be of no effect. \n(2)Those matters are— \n(a)the age or physical or mental condition of persons driving the vehicle, \n(b)the condition of the vehicle, \n(c)the number of persons that the vehicle carries, \n(d)the weight or physical characteristics of the goods that the vehicle carries, \n(e)the time at which or the areas within which the vehicle is used, \n(f)the horsepower or cylinder capacity or value of the vehicle, \n(g)the carrying on the vehicle of any particular apparatus, or \n(h)the carrying on the vehicle of any particular means of identification other than any means of identification required to be carried by or under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994.\n&#xa0;\nAt present, this part of s.148 means insurers can't put the restrictions from (2)(a) to (2)(h) on the certificate (although they can feature elsewhere in the policy). Our interpretation of the above amendment may restrict our ability to include these restrictions in the policy (incl the schedule) too, although this is not clear. As the purpose of the above change is to remove the 'delivery' reference as opposed to making any other changes, we would suggest the following amendment:\n&#xa0;\n(1)Where a certificate of insurance or certificate of security has been \ndelivered\n \nissued or given for the purposes of this Part \nunder section 147 \nof this Act \nto the person by whom a policy has been effected or to whom a security has been given, so much of the policy or security \nas purports to restrict...\n&#xa0;\nP.64, schedule 3, section 3 of the Draft Deregulation Bill would need to be updated as follows:\n&#xa0;\nIn section 148 (avoidance of certain exceptions to policies or securities), in subsection (1), for the words from \"has been delivered\" to \"policy or security\" substitute \"has been issued or given for the purposes of this Part of this Act\".\n&#xa0;\nPlease let me know if you have any questions with regard to this or need any further information.\n&#xa0;\nGiven the nature of this submission being in respect of what we believe to be an incorrect amendment described in the draft form, we do not believe that it would be necessary to publish this submission.\n&#xa0;16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
