"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from HS2 Action Alliance (HSR 020)\n&#xa0;\nSummary and Conclusions\n&#xa0;\n \nThe hourly rate used to value savings is reduced by a third \nbut this is too little for HS2\nThat the time saved is already productive is ignoredThe proportion of business travel on HS2 increases by over a thirdConclusion: The new treatment of the value time is profoundly unsatisfactory. It neither properly discusses the issue of working on trains, nor provides the evidence to justify the new approach. It defies common sense – why would businesses be willing to pay as much to reduce already productive time as unproductive time? The proportion of business passengers using HS2 has very substantially increased (from about 28% to 38%), more than offsetting the reduction in unit values. Conclusion: The crowding benefits are not realistic. De-crowding benefits are attributed to HS2 when the real alternative (51m OA) is simply no more crowded.Conclusion: While we are pleased that the new rail forecast model is finally being used, we are puzzled that the intermodal competition that is not even recognised in DfT’s model is claimed to negate its effect.  We remain concerned that demand growth is assumed to continue until demand doubles (instead of being capped after a set period related to the properties of the model). Conclusion: Although optimism bias no longer inflates the savings figures, we are surprised at the large unexplained increase in savings since the August 2012 business case. Conclusion: Price competition does not just affect revenues. It affects demand too and in doing so has implications for classic network and re-use of freed up capacity. Conclusion: The KPMG work is not only defective, but its role as estimating benefits not already assessed in the NATA assessment is incorrect.  The use of the value for money classifications intended for the assessment without WEI are misapplied and exaggerate the value for money DfT’s own analysis indicates.Conclusion: It is surprising that despite all the reviews of the business case there is still no provision or discussion about the cost of capital.Conclusion: The inconvenient truth is that the justification for high speed has ceased to exist, but it’s disadvantages remain.Annex&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n \nThe Economic Case for HS2: \nS\nummary of \nK\ney \nC\nhanges to the \nE\nconomic \nC\nase since August 2012\n, \nDfT\n \n‘…\nwe have undertaken a comprehensive review of the \nevidence on values which have been estimated using different academic approaches. This shows that the values we use for business travel time savings lie very comfortably in the middle of the range suggested by other research evidence. The Department has th\nerefore concluded that these values are a suitable representation of businesses’ willingness-to-pay for quicker journeys and take appropriate account of the extent to which people work on trains. ‘\n Strategic Case page 34 section 89\n \nBox 1, Page 6 of draft\n \nwebtag\n 3.5.6, October 2013\n \nThe National \nPassenger Survey gives the proportion of business travellers on Virgin trains to be 29%, page 31 of the Virgin Trains Spring 2013 survey\n \nTable 7 page 20.
