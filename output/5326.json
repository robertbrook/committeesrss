"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n Transition Town Totnes Cycling Group\n (CYS0136)\n&#xa0;\nI am aged 70, have cycled for independence as a child, and for transport, exercise &amp; fun ever since. Recently retired and involved with \nTransition To\nw\nn Totnes\n since \nthe \nstart\n of\n \nwhat is\n now \na \nworld-wide \nmovement, I started the Cycling Group for fun\n,\n and to work on Sustainable Transport for access to the surrounding villages and within the town.\n \nhttp://www.transitiontowntotnes.org/groups/tr\nansport/\n  \n&#xa0;1.\n \nA walking/cycling programme for local transporti\n) \nDelivered nationally &amp; implemented locallyWe are all pedestrians, except for children in push-chairs and the infirm or\n \ndisabled in mobility scooters.\n \nAll of us\n need exactly the same \nfacilities\n i.e.\n safe, convenient, direct, \nhealthier, \npleasant and well maintained.\n \nSo the case for\n \nwalking \nis the one which \nshould\n get \npublic \nsupport, \nif it is promoted \nin all mass media\n,\n nationally &amp; locally\n.\n (\nS\nee\n \nbelow\n:\n \n2. \nA \nChampion, &amp; \n3. A publicity campaign)\nBecause \nin the \nUK\n \nwe have allowed \nour\n number of cycling trips to fall to 2% or less of all trips, support nationally for building cycling infrastructure \nis not likely to be very large\n. \nBut p\nedestrians are at the top of \nthe transport hierarchy\n,\n \nin official documents\n at least\n, and we are all pedestrians at some time,\n \nso pedestrian infrastructure \ncould\n be the \npilot \non \na\n tandem \nwith\n cycling\n provision behind\n.\n \nThe programme must be \ndriven nationally \nbecause it would require \ncentral \nfunding\n from the \nDfT\n, and joint working with other departments such as Health.\n (See\n DNCS \nSection\n.5, and\n below: \nJoined up Departments)\nBut a walking/cycling programme would \nhave to \nbe \ndelivered locally, because each Highway Authority has responsibility for and best knowledge of its own area.\n Local \nA\nuthorit\nies\n \nwere\n the main means of delivery for the National Cycling Strategy\n 1996 \n(See DNCS above Section 4, and especially 7 Weaknesses). It would b\ne important to address these weaknesses in a new strategy, bear\ning in mind also this \nevid\ne\nnce\n (The implementation of walking &amp;\n cycling policies in British Local Authorities p.15 and Conclusions p.20) of the lack of funding \nand high level commitment hampering effective delivery.\nL\nocal delivery \ncan be done\n successful\nly (See \n[\n2\n]\n 199\n8\n Teenage Pregnancy Strategy\n).\n \nThe rate of under-18 conceptions in England \nfell\n by 13 per cent \nfrom the 1998 base line to 2008, and continues to \nfall\n.\n \nii)  \nRing-fencedIf the funds are not ring-fenced, they are likely to be \nraided\n for ‘emergency’ requi\nrements and \nthen\n not replaced.\ni\nii\n)  \nTrainingWe \nseem\n to \nhave \nlost \nin the last \n5\n0 years some of our willingness to walk, and m\nost\n of our cycling culture too\n, except in cities like Cambridge\n.\nTraining in riding \nis \ntherefore \nneeded\n. \nBikeability\n is doing well here, but should be more structured, fuller, for all children, and continue into secondary school.\nBut\n not \njust\n for children\n.\nAdults, especially those with children of school age, should be \nstrongly \nencour\n-\naged to take up free training for riding on the road, arranged for times they find \nconvenient. They will then be able to encourage their children\n’s \nrid\ning\n, especially\n \nto school\n,\n rather than forbidding it as ‘too dangerous’, which often happens now.\n Basic maintenance &amp; repair could with advantage form part of this training.\nEqually \nimportant \nis \ntraining for traffic engineers.\n[\n3\n]\n p.38\nThe overriding objective in Highways Departments during the last 50 years has \nbeen provision for motor traffic. The primary criterion for road schemes \nwas then and \nis still the maximisation of road\n &amp; junction capacity for motors.\nFor example, minor road \nT-\njunction\ns\n \nhave \noften\n \nhad \nthe entrance and exit corners \nwidened out\n, i.e. the radius of the curve increased\n. This gives\n drivers vision further into or out of the junction. \nFine for drivers\n,\n for t\nh\nat\n allows\n the corner \nto\n be taken at higher speed\n.\n \nHowever, not only is this intimidating for pedestrians\n, \nbut \nthe \nwidth of road \nthey have\n \nto cross is increased, often doubled\n.\n This is a\n major worry for the elderly and mothers with young children.\nDesigning m\najor junctions for pedestrian and cyclist safety and convenience \nseems\n not \nyet\n \nto be well developed\n in some Highway\n Authorities.\n \nNeither do \nDfT\n rules\n \nyet \na\nllow some of the designs that \nare well tried &amp; tested\n on the continent\n.\nHence\n the\n need for\n trials at the Transport \nRe\nsearch Laboratory last summer of  low-level cyclists traffic lights and Dutch layout roundabouts.\nI\nn November \nI was \nasked \nto County Hall \nby our senior \nT\nraffic \nE\nngineer\n to\n discuss a \ndrawing for a \nDutch layout roundabout \nthat \nI had prepared \nas a proposal \nfor a major junction \nin the town. \nO\nur engineer admitt\ned\n that he personally had \nnot designed a roundabout before, exc\nept for a small unimportant one. It would have to be done by consultants.\n \nIn addition, \nthere \nwas \nonly one of \nthe engineers in the County’s consu\nltants who might have the skill\n to design this layout\n, and \nthere was no way of ensuring that \nthis engineer\n w\nould be\n entrusted with the job if it was put out to the consultants.\n (See DNCS Annex A, Section 5\n. Research and D\nevelopment. There seems to be little mention of professional development  in this review.)\n \ni\nv)\n  Joined up DepartmentsIt seems axiomatic that the Departments concerned in \nC\nentral Government \nwould have to \nbe persuaded to work together on a major programme \nsuch as this\n:\nThe previous Minister for Cycling, Norman Baker, indicated that he was holding discussions with the Dept. of Hea\nlth\n and others\n, but whether there have been agreements on ways of working and lines of communication is not \nyet clear. \nWithout these agreements \njoined-up working\n \nwould \nseem\n most unlikely.\nIn Local Government, the most obvious join-up would be with Public \nHealth\n, as Bristol appears to be doing.\n[\n4\n]\n \n[\n5\n]\n \nProbably most Local Authority \nPublic Health\n \nService\ns\n recognise the \ncontribution that everyday walking and cycling make to people’s activity levels\n. \nBut a\n look at Public Health Strategy documents on the web does not give confidence that many have yet made agreements on ways of working and lines of communication\n with Highways\n, as mentioned above.\n Without these, \njoined up working with\n,\n and \ncontributions \nfrom\n Public Health \nseem\n unlikely to be forthcoming.\nv)\n \n Constant checkingChecking\n is like a cyclist \ngoing over\n the various ‘systems’ on their bike, e.g. brakes – brake blocks not worn down? blocks not \nloose\n? correctly positioned? cable\ns\n oiled and no broken st\nrands? levers correctly adjusted?  \nR\nesponsible\n cyclists do this constantly.\nEvery link in the \nprogramme \nchain would need to be monitored, from strategic planning through identifying &amp; prioritising schemes with local communities, consulting stakeholders\n,\n especially Public Health, identifying funding &amp; negotiating Section 106 contributions from developers, to informing people of what has been achieved.\nEvaluation of the effectiveness of different parts of the whole programme – infrastructure, training, inf\normation on routes\n, provision of cycle parking \netc\n – are \nhelpful\n \nfor\n the dissemination of good practice. \nBut e\nvaluation is challenging\n,\n because no si\nngle part of the programme on its own will much increase \ncycling\n \nsafety or \nnumbers\n. L\nots of training &amp; e\nncouragement without good infra\nstructure w\nill\n not persuade \nthe general population\n to be on \na bike\n next to large lorries or to \njoin a \n \nmulti-lane roundabout\n with \nmany drivers changing lanes at speed.\n2. A Champion in each localityWithout a Champion embedde\nd in the Highway Authority, the co-ordination of all the different requirements \nneeded to deliver the National Strategy\n \nlocally is unlikely to work well.\nPlanning &amp; design of infrastructure needs input from the District Councils and Public Health; \ndifferen\nt departments will need to put in place agreements to work together, set up clear lines of communication and inform all concerned of the new arrangements; good relations with county/city-wide media will have to be fostered\n; workshops &amp; information \nroadshows to inform \neveryone\n of the benefits to health, the economy, household budgets, wellbeing.\nThis might translate for the Champion to:-\nAnd then when the above is beginning to bed down, \nl\nocal \ncycling \ncampaigns or forums could be asked to monitor the delivery of new schemes and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, so that congratulations\n &amp; thanks\n \nto all concerned \ncan be given\n,\n \nas well as\n support to improve ways of working where needed.\n \nAnd, of co\nurse, more constant checking that no link in the chain has broken.\n3. A centrally commissioned &amp; funded publicity campaignIt seems \nwe took in the \nlate \n’\n6\n0s what has proved to be a wrong turning\n – \nwe promoted the car, and the motor vehicle in general, as \n‘the way to go’.\n \nThe car\n became \nthe \nnormal\n way of getting about\n,\n and cycling \nis\n \nnow \nseen as\n ‘\nodd\n’\n.\n \nI\nn the words of the authors of \nthe \nUnderstanding Walking &amp; Cycling\n \nReport\n,\n a\nn extensive\n three year university research project\n \n[\n6\n]\n:\n \n“The key message that comes from this research is that at present in \nBritain\n using the car for short trips in urban areas is convenient, habitual and normal. It is what people expect to do, what most people expect others to do and what many other people who have yet to benefit from car ownership aspire to do. Alternatives to the c\nar – especially cycling and walking – are perceived to take too much effort, need planning and equipment that causes hassle, and may be risky and uncomfortable.\n They also run the risk of being perceived by others as eccentric or odd. These are all powerful\n reasons for not walking and\n \ncycling and for using the car for most short trips in urban areas.”\n \n \nPolicy implications p.17\nOur cycling numbers \nup to the \n’\n5\n0s were comparable to those on the continent\n.\n \nW\ne had a \nwell regarded\n cycle manufacturing industry, cycling to work was normal, cycle touring was a \nwell established\n recreation. Cycling is not new for the \nUK\n, and some of those people have continued riding well into their 80s\n.\nThe benefits of good walking &amp; cycling facilities have never before\n, to my knowledge,\n been explained via the national media to the general population in a \nsustained Government funded campaign. \nIt will take an imaginative, \nwell funded\n \npromotional campaign, \nas part of a sustained natio\nnal walking &amp; cycling strategy, \nto build the nationwide support needed to \nreach\n \nagain \nwalking &amp; cycling numbers comparable to those of some of our European neighbours.\n&#xa0;\nReferences\n[1]\n \nInfrastructure and cyclist safety\n,\n \nTransport Research Laboratory\n Nov.\n \n2011\n.\n \nhttp://www.trl.co.\nu\nk/online_store/reports_publications/trl_reports/cat_road_user_safety/report_infrastru\ncture_and_cyclist_safety.htm\n \n(Requires \nd\nownload. \nSee\n text \nbelow.\n)\nSummary, Systemic Approaches (\np.iv\n)\n“\nIn \nWestern Europe\n, network-wide segregated facilities supported by traffic calming on the highway network appears to offer an effective system-wide \napproach to increased levels of cycling and lower casualty risk.\n              \n(Continues …)\nPiecemeal implementation of such an approach however is unlikely to be satisfactory and careful consideration needs to be given to the best sequence in which to introduce measur\nes.
