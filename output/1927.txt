[[[&#xa0;]]]This report is primarily based on my findings from 8 funded research projects spanning the last 15 years, but it is also grounded in my personal experience of social mobility as a person who has moved, from a coal mining community, into the upper echelons of academia via nineteen years  of teaching in working class schools.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary points: ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]              We cannot make sense of contemporary white working class underachievement without investigating its historical roots.               Working class underachievement is not just about the attitudes and behaviour of the working classes but also the attitudes and behaviour of the upper and middle classes and the relationships between all three classes – ‘no class is an island’.                Schools reflect wider society’s attitudes and values rather than being able to compensate for them. An effective policy for tackling white working class underachievement would have to address economic and social  conditions as well as focusing on the educational system. Current policies have increased segregation and polarisation, both within schools and between them

[[[. ]]]Social distance between social classes has grown in schools, mirroring the growing social distance in wider society. 

[[[ ]]]As the white working classes are increasingly devalued and residualised within the educational system their learner identities have become more fragile and unconfident. We need an educational system that accords respect to the white working classes; a system that attributes positive value to workingclassness. A range of  strategies focused on curriculum and  school level are listed. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.   The prevalent commonsense view is either that the white working classes are to blame for their relative underachievement, that it is about cultural deficits, lack of ambition,  and the wrong sorts of attitudes,  or that certain schools and their staff are failing the working classes. But white working class educational underachievement is far more complex than either the cultural deficit analysis or failing school thesis allows. First, we need  an historical perspective in order  to understand why schooling has not worked for the working classes. &#xa0;

[[[A brief history of ]]]

[[[working class underachievement ]]]&#xa0;2.  The growing middle-class commitment to working-class education in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was totally different from their ideals for middle-class education but was  rather a means  of ensuring that the lower classes  would acquiesce in middle class aspirations. Adam Smith epitomised this English bourgeois viewpoint regarding working class education in The Wealth of Nations:&#xa0;An instructed and intelligent people besides are always moredecent and orderly than an ignorant one ... less apt to be misledinto any wanton or unnecessary opposition to the measures of thegovernment. (Smith, 1785, p. 305)&#xa0;For Smith, as well as for the vast majority of the  political  and intellectual elite at the time, the schooling of the working classes was always to be subordinate and inferior to that of the middle classes, designed to contain and pacify rather than to educate and liberate.When  state education for all was introduced  a hundred years after the publication of The Wealth of Nations  the provision of education for working-class children was thought of by and large instrumentally, rather than as likely to contribute to the life possibilities of the children themselves. The intention of the dominant classes was still to police and control the working classes rather than to educate them. Any notion of education as a means of working class educational success  has always been tempered by the ruling elites’ instrumental view of education as a form of control of the white working classes. &#xa0;3.   So denial of working class value within schooling has a long and damaging history dating from the inception of state schooling for all. This makes the white working class experience of education qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of their BME counterparts. The white working classes bring to their experience of schooling a collective memory of educational subordination and marginalization that is less the case for BME groups. Children negotiate schooling not only directly through their own experiences but also through the sedimented experiences of parents and even grandparents. White working class families  expectations of social mobility through education are often minimal, conditioned by their own experiences over several generations. Both the historical legacy, and how it is played out in the present, are different for many BME working class groups. Some of these bring histories of educational achievement in their countries of origin. Others, despite a lack of educational credentials, bring a strong conviction that a fresh start in the British educational system will provide crucial opportunities  for their children’s advancement that were denied to them.  &#xa0;

[[[Class is relational and results in a ]]]

[[[ contemporary educational culture of winners and losers]]]&#xa0;4.   The  historical legacy of being  the inferior ‘other’ within education resonates in the present. The same two barriers that were present at the inception of state schooling still exist. The working classes continue to have access to relatively low levels of the kind of material, cultural and psychological resources that aid educational success.  First, most  cannot afford the private tuition and the enriching cultural activities that many middle class parents invest in for their children. Nor do they have the same degree of confidence and sense of entitlement that the middle classes possess  in their interactions with schooling. Second, the negative representations that characterised the past  continue in the present. Now we have skivers and chavs  rather than scum  and dross  but the same processes of class othering are still at work.  And just as class is relational  in that we cannot fully understand working class  attitudes and behaviour  without  contextualizing them in relation to middle class attitudes and behaviour so educational success and failure is relational. Those who succeed do so at the expense of others’ failure. &#xa0;5.   We may have become ‘an aspirational nation’ but we are not a socially mobile one; desires and aspirations cannot compensate for lack of family resources. And as Wilkinson and Pickett point out, educational failure becomes more prevalent as societies become more unequal. The irony is that the rhetoric of social mobility within education has increased in volume and intensity as  it has become less and less possible in practice. We cannot all succeed academically. If we did what counts now as educational success would lose its value. Numerous studies indicate that one of the key lessons middle class children learn is that failure is intolerable, unwanted and belongs somewhere else. We see this in the ESRC project I conducted on white middle class parents sending their children to state comprehensives: &#xa0;I had everything that the working class kids didn't have.  You know everything that my mum and dad had given me and I was more intelligent than they were and there was more going for me than there was for them….being friends with these people made me feel like the one you know who was achieving you know and was superior to them. (Camilla,  year 13 student, white middle class).&#xa0;6.   Evident also is a sense of intrinsic superiority that was even more potent in the  words of the privately educated students I interviewed for a further ESRC project on HE choice: &#xa0;              I just expected to go to a good university. I knew I was a lot more intelligent               and cultured than ordinary kids. (Will, private school student)&#xa0;

[[[Importance of wider social and economic conditions]]]&#xa0;7.   Education reflects wider social and economic conditions. We are at a point in time when the power of the working classes economically and socially is diminishing while the power of the elites has increased,  and the middle classes are struggling to maintain their position in  society. There is also a troubling growth in the social distance between the classes. When I was growing up as a working class child in the 50s and 60s, my educational success rested partly on the empathy and kindness of the parents of my middle class classmates who invited me to complete my homework in houses with space and places to concentrate. Today, the middle class parents I interviewed talk of  mistrust and even fear of the white working classes:               He doesn’t bring these children home but at least he knows where they come from.                I have to admit a great fear was that my son would get in with the scrap metal dealer’s son. &#xa0;I get anxious at the thought of the girls from the council estate coming round because we have so much and they have so little, there is always a nagging fear they might take something.

[[[A judgmental system: ]]]

[[[The impact of educational policies ]]]&#xa0;8.   There is not the space to discuss the impact of the many policies introduced over the last 3 decades but  I will use two examples,  the contemporary assessment and testing regime and the  growth of setting and streaming in schools to show how large numbers of working class children are see to be of low value in our current educational system. While the stated aim is to raise the achievement of all children, one consequence of the increased testing of students’ learning is the fixing of failure in the working classes.  While most of my research is on secondary school students I carried out a research study on the impact  of testing on primary age children. Below are two quotes from white working class girls: Norma: I’m really worried about the SATs.D: Why?Norma: Well it seems like I’ll get no points or I won’t be able todo it, too hard or something.D: What would it mean to get no points?Norma: Well instead of being a level three I’ll be a nothing anddo badly – very badly.And:&#xa0;Sharon: I think I’ll get a two, only Stuart will get a six.D: So if Stuart gets a six, what will that say about him?Sharon: He’s heading for a good job and a good life, and it showshe’s not gonna be living on the streets and stuff like that.D: And if you get a level two, what will that say about you?Sharon: Um, I might not have a good life in front of me, and I mightgrow up and do something naughty.&#xa0;The quotes make visible the system of value that produces the middle classes as valuable academic stars whilst simultaneously generating a working class that is represented within the current testing regimes as ‘incapable’ of having a self with value. This is further revealed in Sharon’s poignant summation of class destinies and how they are tied to academic achievement. As the  children’s quotes illustrate, at the micro-level of the classroom there are regular glimpses of the normalising and regulatory function of testing on children. However, although children expressed anxieties across class differences, it was not the white middle-class boys panicking about being exposed as no good through the assessment procedures. Rather, it was white working-class girls who agonized the most that they would be ‘a nothing’. And the risks of finding they have very little value are disproportionately high for such working class girls. These girls, in the context of schooling, inhabit a psychic economy of class defined by fear, anxiety and unease where failure looms large and success is elusive; a place where too often they are seen and see themselves as lacking value. &#xa0;9.   The increase in setting and streaming compounds and reinforces working class pupils’ sense of  failure, they come to see themselves as ‘bottom set kids’  or in ‘a rubbish group’ but it also leads to class segregation in state schooling as these quotes from middle class pupils at state comprehensives  show: My friends and I were a bit scared of all the chavs there may be in secondary but its fine cos we are in the top set and they are all in the bottom sets so I don’t have to see them (Olivia year 8)&#xa0;It was quite tough in the first year with the chavs  but now I’m in year 8 its fine cos I’ve been moved up to the higher sets and they’ve been moved down so I’m away from them (Jessie year 8)

[[[The consequences for the white working classes]]]&#xa0;10.    The findings from the research projects I have conducted reveal how the educational system works to positively affirm white upper and middle class identities, acting as a means of finding yourself as a successful ‘bright’ learner. In contrast, the educational system is rarely about positive affirmation for the working classes.  They are at far greater risk of losing rather than finding themselves, of both being unable to construct a successful learner identity and feeling  that their working class roots and sense of self have no value in a context where working class culture and identity is constructed as a hindrance to academic achievement. The sense of shame and humiliation was palpable throughout the interviews I carried out with white working class pupils in London schools for an ESCR study on pupils’  perspectives on their teaching and learning: &#xa0;Danny: Some teachers say, ‘That isn’t the way you talk’ – likeputting you down. I think telling you a different way issort of good, but I think the way they do it isn’t goodbecause they make you look stupid.Martin: Those teachers look down on youDanny: Yeah, like they think you’re dumb … we don’t expect themto treat us like their own children. We’re not. But we arestill kids. I’d say to them, You’ve got kids. You treat themwith love but you don’t need to love us. All you need todo is treat us like humans.These commonplace feelings of  shame and humiliation often turned into a sense of futility and pointlessness in relation to academic learning: Diane : If you had a choice what would you choose to learn?  Jason: Nothing George: Nothing Andy: No idea Paul: Definitely nothing we get here&#xa0; 11.    In the project secondary school students were asked  whether they felt that they had the confidence to act within schooling; whether they felt they belonged, as individuals and as groups, within the school community. The vast majority of the working class students talked about a sense of  powerlessness and educational worthlessness,  and feelings that they were not really valued and respected within education. But it was  white working class boys, in particular, who manifested the  greatest sense of alienation.  12.    White working class students are expected to make difficult choices between prioritizing official pedagogic practices on the one hand and local pedagogic practices on the other,  and for boys in particular, between popularity among the peer group  and an elusive successful learner identity. This is especially so for white working class boys  like Shaun quoted below:  Shaun: Like now I am different in the classroom than I am in the playground, I am just different.Diane: Right, so how are you different?Shaun: In the classroom I am not myself. I am hard working and everything. In the playground, yeah, I’m back to my usual self…just being normal.&#xa0;Shaun recognizes that,  unlike their middle class counterparts, working class students need to transform their identity in order to succeed. And transformation is a fraught, risky, and often painful struggle if you and your kind have historically been, and are currently positioned as ‘other’ to the educated, intelligent and cultured subject. For Shaun academic success is not normative and he has to literally think  and enact himself as ‘other’ in order to attempt to do well. Facing an educational competition they cannot win they construct  peer group macho and physically aggressive competitions where some of  them can and do win.

[[[Social Justice for the white working classes]]]13.    I grow up during the early years of the welfare state, the daughter of a coal miner living in a newly built council estate. An expanding welfare state  and a pervasive rhetoric of providing services and homes fit for working- class war heroes raised the sense of pride and entitlement among the working classes. It also softened some of the judgmental superiority of significant numbers of the middle and upper classes towards those they traditionally viewed as inferior. Also, entering the labour market during a period of large-scale expansion of  professional jobs meant gaining a middle-class job was much more likely than it is in the economically austere 2010s. Such economic and social circumstances were far more favourable to working-class upward mobility  than the current situation, and eased what was still a difficult trajectory for many working-class children like myself. 14.    The roots of my social mobility lay in a synergy between a working-class community characterized by  a powerful sense of pride in being working class and a strong and informed political consciousness, and a very particular historical juncture. Without these predisposing factors, my social mobility would not have occurred. I certainly would not have been socially mobile as a child growing up in the early twenty-first century.15.    We need an educational system founded on respect for the white working classes instead of trying to make them all middle class; a system that accords positive value and meaning to workingclassness. While the 3Rs are  important, teaching children to be  caring, respectful,  cooperative, knowledgeable about their own and others’ histories, and well informed about contemporary global issues are equally important. There is a great deal of scope for widening currently narrowly conceived teaching and learning opportunities, and for  developing  pedagogies  that  encourage students to question  as well as develop social and political awareness. Teaching for social justice requires a reflexive focus  on all pupils:  What are their hopes, dreams and aspirations? Their passions and commitments? What skills, abilities, and capacities does each one bring to the classroom? As Ayers (1998) argues ‘teaching for social justice is teaching that arouses students, engages them in a quest to identify obstacles to their full humanity, to their freedom, and then to drive, to move against those obstacles.16.    A revalorizing of vocational  and working class knowledges and a broadening out of what constitutes educational success beyond the narrowly academic is long overdue. There needs to be  not only a focus on, and valuing of, the existing knowledges of working-class young people, but also pedagogies which emphasise collectivist, rather than individualistic approaches to learning.17.    Until we eradicate class contempt schools will continue to be characterized by pervasive and damaging working class educational failure. The political elites and the middle class majority  need to critically analyse, understand and take responsibility for a situation that only they have the power and resources to remedy,  but creating an educational system that works towards decreasing the social , economic and educational distance between the social classes, both within schools and wider society, would be a good place to start. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Practical ways forward in tackling white working class underachievement]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.               Give all pupils achieving below level 4  in English and Maths at  the end of year 5 an entitlement of 1 to 1 tuition with a trained teacher for at least half an hour a day for the first two terms of year 6. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
