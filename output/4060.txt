[[[Written submission from FUSE Services Ltd (BRC 53)]]]&#xa0;We are a 2 man electrical contracting company, registered with NAPIT. We want to undertake a professional installation every time but are up against those who want to do the job as quickly and cheaply as possible for maximum profit, and if that’s dangerous or has a short lifespan so be it.&#xa0;They are using the public’s ignorance to achieve this.&#xa0;The public are completely unaware of a competent person’s scheme.&#xa0;The public have still no idea of what Part-P means, and I have been asked why we don’t have a Full-P instead?&#xa0;No domestic customer has heard of the NICEIC or NAPIT or ECA etc…. they are just letters representing words that they have no idea of.&#xa0;When I’m  trying to offer explanation, they often quote the “GasSafe” scheme for gas which they are very aware of.&#xa0;I think this is because they know gas is dangerous and they cannot go out and buy gas components. There have been many incidents on films and soaps that are part of everyday life that highlight the dangers of competence with gas.&#xa0;This clearly demonstrates that not only the public but film directors and story writers are writing into their soaps what they too are personally aware of. Gas yes, electricity no.&#xa0;There seems nothing about electrical safety and using incompetent persons in this trade. The public are quite happy to employ the cheapest electrician. I often get, “He’s a nice bloke”. They are prepared to let kitchen fitters undertake electrical work and this area is supposed to be controlled being the one place in the property where all the high current appliances are located and in my experience where almost 95% of faults are found. Part-P is now actually encouraging kitchen fitters into the trade which is disgusting.&#xa0;The electricians in my area, particularly two of them ARE Part-P Registered, are members of NICEIC and NAPIT, and they STILL trade to a very dangerous level when the scheme operators are not around.&#xa0;The scheme operators only see the contractor once a year. They collect the member’s money once a year BEFORE the inspection is carried out. It’s all over within half an hour and we carry on regardless!&#xa0;I HAVE reported a bad contractor to the NICEIC and as a competent person myself they will NOT accept my complaint, saying it has to come from the customer. Unfortunately the customer is always fearful of reprisal and not sure if the work really is bad or not, as long as it works they are happy.&#xa0;The likes of B&amp;Q etc are selling items like consumer units to the public who cannot legally install them or test them for safety without the correct test equipment. Even NAPITs telephone menu system prioritises B&amp;Q customers over its own paying members.&#xa0;So the competent persons scheme doesn’t stop rogue traders whatsoever, there are kitchen fitters and the like and their access to electrical components needs cutting off.&#xa0;That would be the first step to stop a lot of bad installations. The second would be a brand such as ElectricSafe to twin up with GasSafe. It’s a no brainer, and lastly, random on the spot inspections need to be carried out, and complaints followed up by the scheme operator whether or not the complaint comes from another contractor or a member of the public. &#xa0;I actually got a customer to complain to the NICEIC and they told him it would cost him £2000 for an inspector to come out to him. He was put off instantly. No wonder complaints are so low, they are not being recorded and the operators are keeping complaints about their members under wraps. After all they are paying their wages.&#xa0;We need to be licenced to be able to obtain components, and complaints need to be taken more seriously, especially within the NICEIC.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
