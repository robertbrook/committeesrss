[[[Written evidence ]]]

[[[submitted by the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law (LAI 0062)]]]&#xa0;

[[[INTRODUCTION]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law submits the following written evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights Inquiry into the implications for access to justice of the government’s proposed legal aid reforms.  This evidence was prepared for the Bingham Centre by Dr Mark Elliott (Reader in Public Law, University of Cambridge and Fellow, Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law), Dr Lawrence McNamara (Deputy Director and Senior Research Fellow, Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law) and Dr Tom Hickman (Barrister, Blackstone Chambers and Fellow, Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law), with contributions from other members of the Centre.  2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law was launched in December 2010 and is an independent research institute devoted to the study and promotion of the rule of law worldwide.  Its focus is on understanding and promoting the rule of law; considering the challenges it faces; providing an intellectual framework within which it can operate; and fashioning the practical tools to support it. The Centre is named after Lord Bingham of Cornhill KG, the pre-eminent judge of his generation and a passionate advocate of the rule of law.  It is part of the British Institute for International and Comparative Law, a registered charity based in London.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our evidence to the JCHR is divided into two sections:(a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our views in relation to the proposed legal aid reforms as they stood when the JCHR inquiry was announced on 18 July 2013 (“the Transforming Legal Aid proposals – April 2013”).  (b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our views in relation to the further proposals which have been outlined since the JCHR inquiry was announced on 18 July 2013. We refer specifically to the Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps consultation announced on 5 September 2013 (“the Next Steps proposals – September 2013”).  In this section we also make some limited observations in relation to the Judicial Review: Further proposals for reform (Cm 8703) consultation, again announced in September. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[THE TRANSFORMING LEGAL AID PROPOSALS – APRIL 2013]]]4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Bingham Centre’s views on the April 2013 proposals are contained in the response we made to the Ministry of Justice consultation on the legal aid reforms in Consultation Paper CP14/2013 Transforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system. That response was framed around access to justice and rule of law concerns, and it directly addresses three of the four specific matters on which the JCHR is seeking evidence.  We have attached that response as an appendix to this document and it should be considered part of our written evidence to the JCHR.  5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The access to justice and rule of law framework issues are addressed in paragraphs 4-7 and 53-54. 6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Of the four points in which the JCHR has expressed particular interest (the residence test, legal aid for prisoners, judicial review, and ‘borderline’ cases) our consultation response addresses the first three of these:&#xa0;

[[[THE “NEXT STEPS” PROPOSALS – SEPTEMBER 2013]]]   7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The “next steps” consultation document indicates that some modifications will be made to the April 2013 proposals. However, regarding the three issues above our view is that our concerns largely still remain as they were.   

[[[The residence test ]]]8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The “next steps” document at 2.11 – 2.17 indicates residence test modifications.  While we welcome these changes, they do not adequately address the substance and scope of the matters we raised in our response on this issue.  

[[[Legal aid for prisoners]]]9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The “next steps” document at 2.5 – 2.7 indicates prison law modifications.  Although there are adjustments (2.5), the original proposals are to be pursued.  Again, the adjustments do not adequately address the substance and scope of the matters we raised in our response on this issue.

[[[Judicial review]]]10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The “next steps” document at 2.18 – 2.20 states that there will be some limited change to the proposals for legal aid for permission work for judicial review. It forecasts a separate consultation, which is the subject of the Judicial Review: Further proposals for reform (Cm 8703) consultation. Chapter seven, in particular, addresses these matters. 11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Time constraints prevent us from, at this point, offering a detailed analysis though we make the following observations.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; First, the essence of the original rationale and the original proposals remains.  As the Judicial Review: Further Proposals paper notes at paragraph 20, the proposals “are intended to act as a disincentive to those considering judicial review whose cases have no merit …”.  In this regard, we point to our consultation response at paragraphs 25-30 where we attempt to compare the progress and success of claims that are legally aided and those that are not.  As we stated there in summary (para 30), “there is nothing to suggest legally aided judicial review claims are pursued in a reckless way that results in a relatively high number of “weak” cases. On the contrary, there is everything to suggest that legally aided cases appear to be handled far more cautiously than those which are unfunded, and lawyers in legally-aided applications are far more likely only to pursue cases with merit.” 13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We welcome the more detailed data and analysis provided in the Impact Assessment attached to the Judicial Review: Further Proposals paper at paras 15-40.  Having said this, we note that there is substantial uncertainty about the impact and effects, including how claimants may choose to respond if legal aid is unavailable, and we note especially the issue of claimants possibly proceeding as litigants in person (para 38 of the Impact Assessment). We also remain concerned that the data is not presented in a way that offers some comparison of how legally aided claims proceed as against non-legally aided claims. Our tentative view is that, even with the further data provided, the methods used to achieve the projected savings are likely to have significant detrimental impacts on access to justice and, in the absence of comparative data, it is unclear that the proposed changes are the best and most appropriate pathway towards achieving the aim of acting as a disincentive to pursue unmeritorious cases.   The numerous other concerns we have raised in our original response to the consultation also remain.     14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On these matters, if it would assist the Committee, the Bingham Centre can provide further written evidence and/or oral evidence that addresses the Judicial Review: Further proposals in more detail, particularly with regard to: (a) the data and analysis in the Impact Assessment, and (b) the position relating to the proposal at paragraphs 118 - 131 of the paper, including the proposal regarding discretionary payments.   15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Should we be able to assist the Committee further in these or any other matters related to its inquiry, please do not hesitate to contact us.&#xa0;

We note that, according to para 3.54 of the Consultation Paper, the power to grant legal aid in exceptional circumstances would apply in cases that failed to satisfy the residence test. We are not, however, satisfied that the Consultation Paper demonstrates that this would constitute an adequate failsafe mechanism.  Walton v Scottish Ministers [2012] UKSC 44, [2013] PTSR 51.

The development of the public sector equality duties in administrative law” [2013] PL 325 at 333.  [2012] EWHC 2144 (Admin).  We proceed cautiously here because of the paucity of data available. We would much prefer to see comprehensive data and analysis from the MoJ (and we have requested that). However, without that, we rely here on the best available data.  Our table is based on two sets of figures that have been made publicly available: (a) the statistics for 2011 -12 legally aided judicial review cases contained in the Transforming legal aid consultation paper (“the LAA statistics”); (b) the statistics for 2011 judicial review cases published in April 2013 (“the MoJ statistics”) (see the tables accompanying Judicial Review Statistics, n 

[[[Error! Bookmark not defined.]]] above). We have presumed that the statistics have been compiled in a comparable way, with the LAA figures being case progression in the same way the MoJ figures are, and it appears from para 3.65 of Transforming Legal Aid that this is so. We have treated each of these sets of figures as a fair approximation of a single one-year period, primarily because there is not a great percentage change in applications terminated prior to permission from 2007 through to 2011 in table 1 of the judicial review statistics, and especially so in 2010 (41%) and 2011 (43%).  As we are concerned with the larger patterns, any difference between the judicial review statistics for 2011 and the legal aid statistics for 2011-12 is unlikely to be significant.  In the absence of more comprehensive data these figures provide a guide. We also note that it is, in any event, dangerous to attempt to draw inferences from bald pre-permission termination figures, given the diversity of reasons for not applying for permission (e.g., a case in which the defendant concedes following a grant of interim relief would fall into this category).  MoJ JR statistics, Table 1: figure stated. Transforming Legal Aid, para 3.65: figure stated. MoJ JR statistics, Table 1: 11,359 total applications less 6,531 applications where permission sought   Transforming Legal Aid, para 3.65: figure stated. MoJ JR statistics, Table 1: 945 granted at first stage plus 5,586 refused at first stage = 6531 applications where permission sought.  Transforming Legal Aid, para 3.66: figure stated. MoJ JR statistics, Table 1: figure stated. Transforming Legal Aid, para 3.66: Estimated. 1,799 sought permission, less 845 that received permission = 954 remaining. Presuming around 90 cases were withdrawn or similar before an an oral renewal decision, that leaves 864.  The estimate of 90 follows the proportions of withdrawals at the oral renewal stage shown in MoJ 2011 statistics, Table 6: where the MoJ was the defendant, 721 refused at first stage, and 79 withdrawn in oral renewal stage; where local authorities were the defendant, 314 refused and 41 withdrawn in oral renewal.   MoJ JR statistics, Table 1: figures stated:  5,586 refused at first stage less 323 granted on renewal less 784 where renewal withdrawn = 4,479.    Transforming Legal Aid, para 3.66: figure stated.
