"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Premiership Rugby [WAS0013]&#xa0;&#xa0;SUMMARY &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPROFESSIONAL RUGBY AND WOMEN  &#xa0;\nPremier\nsh\nip\n Rugby, as a central organization, and its clubs, individually, are actively encouraging women and girls to participate in the sport\n (see \nbox \nbelow)\n. \n&#xa0;\nCore to this is \nPremiership Rugby’s PLAY campaign, launched in May 2013, to support the growth of the game by providing opportunities to Participate, Develop and Excel in Rugby Union. \nI\nn addition to national community based outreach and online \nactivities;\n \nPLAY \nis implemented atthe grassroots level throug\nh curricular, after-school, club and team-based programmes. The \nPLAY \ncampaign will be prominent at Aviva Premiership Rugby club events \nand match days as well as during Premiership Rugby’s key calendar events, including the Aviva Premiership Rugby Final and\n London Double Header. \nOur players and coaches throughout the year support the initiative\n.\nPremiership Rugby with its partners is hoping to create more than 260,000 opportunities to participate, helping grow the game and increasing health and wellness thro\nugh \nPLAY of which we would anticipate that \n40\n% \nwould\n be women or young girls. \nIn addition, professional rugby union clubs are highly active in using their assets to \naddress other social issues \n(crime, truancy, literacy and healthy eating) among disadvantaged communities (some of whom will be female). \n&#xa0;\nOne example, of this would be the highly praised Hitz scheme (see http://www.hitzrugby.com), which is run in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police, where 90% of regular participants reported an improvement in their mental or physical health as a consequence of the scheme. &#xa0;WOMEN AND RUGBY UNION: CASE STUDIES     &#xa0;\nPremier\nship\n Rugby would highlight a number of specific areas where clubs are active in encouraging girls and young women into the sport or using the sport to help women. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSchool Age \nThe \nAviva Premiership Rugby Schools Programme is a £2m investment in using rugby u\nnion as part of the \nschool’s\n sports curriculum in primary schools across England in and around Premiership Clubs. We estimate that 39,000 school children \nparticipate in the scheme. Entry is gender blind and we estimate that approximately 40% of the partici\npants each year are girls.\n \nOver 75% of \nparticipating \nteachers saw an improvement in \ntheir \nstudents\n’\n at\nt\nitudes to exercise after the programme. \n \nCoaching \nThe \nAviva Premiership Rugby Schools \nP\nrogramme is designed to ensure that teachers in participating \nschools are able to coach the sport more effectively.\n1200 female teachers are introduced and coached in delivering rugby union sports programming each year. \nThis is critical because our experience shows that where female teachers or role models are involve\nd programmes generate higher levels of participation and retention. \n \nSomething to Chew on \nThis health\ny\n eating campaign has seen dramatic results among boys and girls with:\n- 60.8% of pupils exercising more frequently post scheme \n- 65.2% of participatin\ng schools have seen children join clubs\nWorcester Warriors \nWomen’s\n Touch League \nWomen in the area who wished to play rugby \n(\nesp.\n Touch) \nwere struggling to find coaches, teams to play and facilities. Warriors, a Premiership Club, help initiate\n meetings between various \nparties, which\n led to the formation of the \nMidland Ladies Touch League (2010/11). \nWith the support of the club a league of 10 teams now exists and these teams are beginning to work in local schools to attract other women into the \ngame. \nBarriers \nsuch as l\nack of childcare, \nfree \ntime\n, \nknowledge of \nthe game and awareness that other women were interested and available to play are beginning to be overcome. In fact, the club is now working with local people to see if a multi-sex Touch Lea\ngue or Tournament might increase local participation (this format is successful in Australia and New Zealand). \n  \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPREMIERSHIP RUGBY BACKGROUND &#xa0;\nCommunity, CSR and \nsports \nparticipation\n \n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
