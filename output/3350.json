"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the Ramblers (SLC 03\n9\n)\n&#xa0;Summary\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nThe Ramblers\n \n(the Ramblers’ Association) \nis a registered charity which seeks (among other things) to promote walking, both as a recreation and as the most sustainable form of transport. We also seek to promote the health, recreation and environmental benefits of walking, especially by protecting \nand extending the network of public paths and access in town and countryside, through lobbying, campaigning and voluntary practical work, and, since April 2012, through our \npartnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, in which we run the Walking for Health p\nroject, delivering strategic guidance for the England-wide health walks programme and providing schemes with such support and free resources as training, insurance, and national promotion. (The local schemes are run by a variety of organisations including \ncouncils, the NHS, charities and voluntary groups.)\n  \nIn addition to supporting Walking for Health walks, we organise 45,000 led walks per year. 12,000 volunteers lead the walks; about 300,000 people take part in them. We have been organising these led walk\ns since our formation in 1935.\n&#xa0;\nImproving the safety of rights of way \nlevel \ncrossings\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nPedestrian safety is of paramount importance to the Ramblers, and we do not under-estimate the potential dangers posed by crossing a railway line on the level.  \nHowever, w\ne are of the view that a great deal could de done to improve the safety \nof rights of way level crossings.  \nFor most public rights of way which cross a railway line on the level, the company’s (usually now Network Rail’s) obligations are set out i\nn section 61 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845.   This reads:\n&#xa0;\n61.              Company to make sufficient approaches and fences to bridleways and footways crossing on the level.&#xa0;If the railway shall cross any highway other than a public carriageway on the\n level, the company shall at their own expense, make and at all times maintain convenient ascents and descents and other convenient approaches, with handrails or other fences, and shall, if such highway be a  bridleway, erect and at all times maintain good\n and sufficient  gates, and if the same shall be a footway, good or sufficient gates or stiles, on each side of the railway, where the railway shall communicate therewith.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nSo, the railway company must make and maintain convenient approaches to the line\n and good and sufficient gates and stiles in the line side fences.\n  \nThe duties can be enforced by application to a magistrates’ court using the procedure set out in section 65 of the same Act. However, they apply only if the 1845 Act was itself applied by \nthe statute authorising the construction of the line. In some such statutes alternative or additional duties may have been imposed on the company.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nThe Ramblers is of the view that this aspect of level crossing legislation is in particular need of refor\nm and simplification so that the obligations to maintain safe crossings are absolute.  There are many practical problems on rights of way level crossings which need addressing—poor visibility because of overgrown vegetation, stiles and gates on the approac\nhes to lines not meeting the British Standard for Gaps, Gates and Stiles, poor surfaces at crossing points, etc.\n  \nIdeally there should be national standards for rights of way where they cross railway lines on the level.\n  \nIn 2010 \nDefra issued guidance on \n“A\nuthorising structures (gaps, gates &amp; stiles) on rights of way\n—\ngood practice guidance for local authorities on compliance with the \nEquality Act 2010”\n and this should be referenced in any new standard.  Such a standard should include a requirement that, on high speed lines (for example, the East and West Coast Main Lines), telephones be provided at non-gated and landowner operated gates so that the appr\noach of trains and safe-crossing times can be ascertained.  Additionally, all crossings should have a reference prominently displayed so that in case of an accident or incident the emergency services and other appropriate persons can be notified of the exa\nct location.  It is our hope that many of these issues can be addressed by the implementation of the Law Commission’\ns\n recommendations, for example, those in respect of level crossing plans.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nThere should also be clear procedures to enable both railway s\ntaff and the public to report obstructions and damaged infrastructure on rights of way which cross railway lines, and the approaches to such crossings (the approach of both the right of way to the crossing point, as well as the approach of trains to that p\noint).  The procedure should make clear the operating companies’ responsibility for rectifying problems, a timescale for doing so, and a clear response chain\n,\n i.e. a statement saying what work has been authorised, when the work is to be carried out, and no\ntification to the complainant when it has been completed.  If it is decided not to act on the report then reasons for that decision should be given.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nAll signage used at footpath and bridleway level crossings should be reviewed to ensure that it can be \nunderstood by all (i.e. by the use of pictograms).  Such signage should be included in the \nHighway Code which does not, at present, offer instruction or information in respect of level crossings other than those which can be used by cars.\n  Signs needed for\n pedestrians include ‘obey flashing signals’ and  ‘do not cross when gates are shut’, ‘stop, look and listen’ and ‘phone to see if safe to cross’\n&#xa0;\nClosing public rights of way which cross railway lines\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nA major part of the work undertaken by \nRamblers\n vo\nlunteers in England and Wales involves dealing with proposed changes to the rights of way network: diversion, extinguishment and, more rarely, creation orders made under the Highways Act and the Town and Country Planning Act, and orders made under the Tran\nsport and Works Act where the creation and extinguishment of rights of way is ancillary to the main purpose of the order (for example, the construction of a transport system).  Parliament has recognised the key role which the Ramblers and other path user g\nroups play in protecting the integrity of the rights of way network by prescribing us to be served notice of orders to alter the public rights of way network made under these provisions.\n&#xa0;\n8\n.\n              \nIn the context of \nlevel crossing safety,\n it should be noted that \nthe Ramblers was highly instrumental in the introduction of Rail Crossing extinguishment and \ndiversion orders under \n(new) \nsections 118\nA\n and 119\nA\n of the Highways Act 1980.  In “Rights of Way: a guide to law and practice”\n, Riddall and Trevelyan explain what\n happened:\n&#xa0;\nIn November 1990 British Rail submitted to Parliament a Private Bill, the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill. If passed, this would have had the effect of closing ten level crossings over the East Coast Main Line, and thereby creating 20 \ncul-de-sac paths. Opposition from the R\namblers’ Association\n and other bodies helped to persuade MPs to block its progress through Parliament.\nMeanwhile the government was preparing its Transport and Works Bill to provide new procedures for authorisation of\n many of the works construction powers hitherto granted through the Private Bill procedure. It was sufficiently persuaded of the need for special powers to close or divert public paths crossing railways on the level to include in the Bill amendments to the\n Highways Act 1980.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nFrom the point of view of the Ramblers, other voluntary groups working for the protection of public rights of way, and ordinary members of the public, the introduction of these provisions was an important reform.  It meant that we d\nid not have to petition Parliament in respect of any Private Bills which sought to close or divert public rights of way which crossed railway lines.  However, as they stand, sections 118A and 119A are weaker in their protection of public rights than the st\nandard provisions for closure and diversion of public rights of way as set out in sections 118 and 119\n of the Highways Act 1980\n.  In respect of section 118A the weakness arises because there is no consideration of the use which the public are making of the\n route in question, either now or in the future.  In respect of section 119A, the tests of the suitability of the alternative rout\ne\n are weaker than under section 119—the point of termination of the alternative path does not have to be substantially as conv\nenient to the public and there are no tests \nrequiring the new route to be not substantially less convenient to the public, or requiring consideration to be given to public enjoyment or to the effect that the new route will have on the interests of those wh\no own or occupy the land it crosses.\n9.\n              \nBecause of this, we welcome the fact that the Law Commission\n is\n recommending a\n list of factors to be taken into account in considering an application for a level crossing closure order\n.  These are\n (as set out in the \nrecently published report)\n:\n&#xa0;\nof accidents at the level crossing);\ninvolved in closing or closing and replacing the \ncrossing;\ncrossings) on the efficiency of the rail and road networks;\nnetwork of non-vehicular public righ\nts of way;\ncommunity;\ncrossing users;\n&#xa0;10.\n              \nS\nuch a list go\nes\n some \nconsiderable \nway towards meeting our concerns about sections 118A and 119A\n, outlined above, which as presently drawn up do not address the effect of the proposed change on users of the highway in question.  We particularly welcome the inclusion of \nthe fourth \npoint\n, \n“the effect (in the case of public level crossings) on the integ\nrity of the network of non-vehicular rights of way”\n,\n although \nwe \nquestion whether the words ‘non-vehicular’ are needed.  The public rights of way network also encompasses restricted byways and byways open to all traffic which are open to vehicles but which\n are used largely by people on foot, horseback and pedal cycle.  It is also the case that users on foot, horseback and pedal cycle make use of the vehicular highway network and any level crossings which it encompasses and that a minor diversion for users o\nf motor vehicles can be a very serious imposition on travel for non-motorised users.  Consideration of the effect of a level crossing closure or diversion must take into account the \nlength and \ntime needed to use any alternative route or routes.  In additio\nn to considering the integrity of the network, \nwe consider that \nthe list should also include reference to the safety of the alternative route: non-motorised users may be no better off if they are forced away from a level crossing and on to a narrow country\n road with no footway.\n&#xa0;\n11.\n              \nThe Ramblers, through its network of local volunteers, is always willing to meet Network Rail and relevant highway authorities to discuss changes to the rights of way network in the context of improving the safety of level \ncrossings, new safety measures and alternative means of crossing such a bridges,\n&#xa0;\nTemporary closure of rights of way level crossings using inappropriate legis\nla\ntion\n1\n2\n.\n              \nIn recent years a problem has arisen, intimately linked to level crossing safety which \nhas caused problems for rights of way users.  \nIn a number of locations around the country (we know of examples in Essex, Kent, Surrey and Greater Manchester), local residents living in the vicinity of railway lines \nhad \ncomplained \nabout the loud noise made \nby the horns which train-drivers \nwere\n required to s\nound when their train approached\n a level crossing.  At such locations there is a track-side sign known as a whistle board which usually says ‘whistle’ or ‘sound horn’ or ‘S.W.’ (= ‘sound whistle’). \n Howeve\nr, an\n ingenious application of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 \nby relevant highway authorities, working with \nNetwork Rail, \nled to the closure of the \npaths in question\n by means of a traffic regulation order. The scenario that gives rise to it seems to \nbe entirely artificial: Network Rail, by arrangement with the highway authority, remove\ns\n the whistle boards, thus making the crossings ‘dangerous’, since users no longer get an audible warning of a train’s approach. So \nthe traffic regulation\n \norder were\n made on grounds of safety; probably as a preliminary measure t\no\n seeking permanent closures or diversions under sections 118A and 119A of the Highways Act 1980.\n1\n3\n.\n              \nThe R\namblers\n is of the view that this is a totally inappropriate view of the powers contain\ned in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. \nT\nhe highway authority has the duty of ensuring that all public rights of way are open and available for public use. Can it ever have been the case that Parliament intended TROs to be imposed where the ‘danger’ ha\ns been deliberately and artificially created by means of an arrangement to which the highway authority is party?\n1\n4\n.\n              \nIt seems to us that \nthis is an entirely wrong approach to the problem.  The answer must be to make the crossings safer by means of the meas\nures we describe in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 above \nor \nby making\n the horns quieter, or if there was no requirement for them to be used: a pedestrian who relied on them instead of looking to see if a train was coming would be cutting it pretty fine, given the s\nlow speed of sound compared with the speed of trains. \nWe find it\n surprising that they still rely on this form of warning, when there could be a system of lights, bleepers and so on triggered in the same way that the automatic barriers on vehicular crossing\ns operate.\nThe Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission Level Crossings project\n1\n5\n.\n              \nThe Ramblers participated fully in this project, attending meetings of the stakeholder advisory group, corresponding with the Commission\n’s\n officers, and submitting a \ndetailed response to the 2010 consultation paper.  We consider the recommendations in the final report to be an important step forward in securing safer level crossings.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n  \nThe Ramblers’ Association is a registered charity (number 1093577) and a company limited by guarantee in England and Wales, founded as a voluntary body in 1935.
