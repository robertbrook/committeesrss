default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is well established that young people require a different approach to enable them to access justice in a meaningful way.

defaultContext of changedefault3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe new changes need to be seen in the wider context of recent changes to legal aid 
defaultthat have already been implemented 
defaultand further 
defaultproposals to change the rules for judicial reviews t
defaulto be brought by interest groups
default.
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Ministry of Justice (MOJ) estimated that 75,000 children and young people (including 6,000 children under 18) would lose entitlement to legal aid each year as a result
default of LASPO.
default Recent research show
defaulting
default a huge fall in the uptake of legal aid since April 2013
default 
defaultsuggests 
defaultthat these figures are likely to be substantial underestimates.
default  We note that the Children’s Commissioner has just issued a tender for an impact assessmen
defaultt of the current changes on children and young people to be carried out
default.
default We recommend that any further changes should be delayed until this work is completed
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals
default, published in September 2013, to restrict the ability of interest groups to bring judicial review proceedings
default will make it harder for landmark cases 
defaultaffecting children and young people’s rights 
defaultto be brought. 
defaultRecent e
defaultxamples 
defaultinclude
default 
defaultthe Children Act case brought by the Howard League for Penal Reform in 2002 which established the applicability of the Children Act 
defaultto children in prison service accommodation and the CRAE case which considered whether or not there was a duty on the state to inform children of their right to compensation following unlawful restraints.

defaultThe Residendefaultcedefault Testdefault4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe ‘residency test’ 
defaultwill have 
defaulta particularly adverse effect on children and young people who may not be lawfully resident and 
defaultwill
default 
defaultresult in
default unlawful discri
defaultmination against non-nationals. 
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government
default’
defaults response to the consultation has 
defaultconceded
default that the residence test will not apply to "categories of case which
default 
defaultbroadly relate to an individual's liberty, where the individual is particularly
default 
defaultvulnerable or where the case relates to the protection of children". 
defaultIt is unclear how the Government will 
defaultbe able to administer the exemption
default.
default 
defaultThe administration of exemptions for domestic violence victims under the changes brought in by LASPO has been fraught with difficulty.
default 
defaultThe experience to date is that the requirements mean that vulnerable women are faili
defaultng to access justice.
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisproportionate impact:default The Government has been unable to provide figures on the number of young people likely to be excluded on account of the residence test. However, new immigrants tend to be disproportionately young and it is clear from reported cases that unaccompanied mino
defaultrs have some of the most pressing 
defaultlegal needs. Even where children and young people would technically qualify under the test, from our experience it is clear that young people are less likely to be able to provide proof of lawful residence.  Young people w
defaultho have the greatest level of legal need often come from the most chaotic backgrounds and will have the greatest difficulty in providing documentary evidence of lawful residence, even if they qualify for it. There appear to be no special considerations as 
defaultto how children who qualify will be assisted to jump through the residence test. The burden of proof will be on the provider. Overstretched legal aid providers are unlikely to have the time and resources to go the extra mile (without payment) to assist you
defaultng people to obtain proof of residence. Those that do not qualify will be without any a
defaultssistance or access to justice.
default It should be noted that children and young people are a protected group and at risk of discrimination
default.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultCase studydefault: GdefaultG aged 6 settled
default 
default(lawfully) in the UK with her mother
default,
default 
defaultwho is married to a mem
defaultber of the Brigade of Gurkhas. 
defaultHer father subjected her mother to a vicious assault (for which he was charged).  She and her mother fled the house and then accessed legal assistance to secure a
defaultn injunction and then divorce. 
defaultThe combination of the rules under LASPO and the residence test would provide two difficult hurdles for G’s mother to overcome in order to protect herself and her
default 6 year old child 
defaultfrom witnessing domestic violence
default.

default&#xa0;
default5.      default  defaultJudicial review default5
default.1
default              
defaultBeing able to challenge decisions by state authorities is crucial for young people – a wrong decision that goes unchallenged by the local authority can have a devastating impact on young people, with consequences that can impact well
default into their adult lives.
default The government proposals would mean that providers would not get paid for work on judicial review cases unless permission is ultimately granted by the High Court. This would transfer all the financial risk of an application for jud
defaulticial review to the provider, so that all the initial work they do on the judicial review case is at risk.
default 
default5
default.2
default              
defaultVery few young people can afford to bring a judicial review claim without the assistance of legal aid. Penalising lawyers who act for legal aid 
defaultclaiman
defaultts if permission is not granted
default will lead to far fewer meritorious and important judicial review cases b
defaulteing brought –
default to the disadvantage of society as a whole and the most vulnerable in particular.  
default5
default.3
default              
defaultLimiting access to judicial review means 
defaultthat homeless young people and care leave
defaultr
defaults will find it harder to challenge the decisions of the local authority.
default It is often in the best interests of the young people that their cases are settled early or before they get to court. The proposals provide 
defaulta perverse incentive for cases not to settle before the permission stage, as otherwise there will be no payment for bringing them.
default  
default5
default.4
default              
defaultThe landmark case of R (G) v London Borough of Southwark had a significant impact on the way local authorities are expe
defaultcted to operate in relation to home
defaultles
defaults 16 and 17 year olds as well as young people leaving custody. However, it is unlikely that this case would have been funded under the new proposals as permission was initially refused and only granted by the Court of 
defaultAppeal who dismissed the claim (2:1). It is unlikely that it would ever have made its way to the House of Lords.
default 
default5
default.5 
default 
default              
defaultThe amended proposals to allow the LAA discretion to pay lawyers in certain circumstances where permission is not granted provide little
default comfort as there remains too much uncertainty for providers to be able to take the risk.
default5.6    
default              
defaultDisproportionate impact:default In response to a Freedom of Information request made by The Children’s Society, the MOJ has confirmed that in 2011/12, 37% of all act
defaultual or prospective judicial review cases, where legal aid was granted, and 39% of cases that ended before applying for permission to the Court or before the Court made a decision, related to children and young people aged 0-25, with 1
default9% relating to 19-25 
defaultyear olds.
default According to the 2011 census, 31% of the population is under 25
default; 
default19-25
default year olds comprise just 9% of the population
default. Thus, the impact of the cuts is likely to be 
defaultfelt 
defaultdisproportionate
defaultly by
default 
defaultyoung adults.
default&#xa0;defaultCase study: defaultE defaultE was kicked out of home 
defaultwhen he was 17 and he was placed in a hostel. Social Services made an assessment but only referred him to a hostel and to benefits. E was ev
defaulticted from his hostel and he had
default been sofa surfing for approximately one year, having at times spent nights on the s
defaulttreet. E contacted the organisation Voice and he was referred as a matter of urgency to a solicitor as he had nowhere to stay that night and negotiations with the local authority had been unsuccessful. The solicitor contacted Social Services and E was prov
defaultided with accommodation by social services on the same day he saw the solicitor. The solicitor also requested that E’s leaving care status was 
defaultrecognis
defaulted and backdated to the time of the assessment, which the Local Authority agreed approximately 10 days af
defaultter the initial meeting. Although E’s solicitor sent pre-action letters to the Local Authority, both when requesting that E was accommodated as a matter of urgency and when asking that his 
defaultleaving care status was recognis
defaulted, both matters were resolved befo
defaultre the case was taken to court.

default6.        defaultPrison Lawdefault6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe changes to legal aid for prison law will virtually cut out almost all the legal help currently provided to young people under criminal legal aid.  Only the young people convicted of the most serious
default crimes will be entitled to legal aid, and only then if they are goi
defaultng through a parole hearing where there is a possibility of release or where they are faced with disciplinary proceedings before an external judge who may add extra days to the sentence.  
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs evidenced by the Howard League for Penal Reform, children in custody are extremely vulnerable and face a wide range of legal problems including the need 
defaultfor a release package and access to offending behaviour courses.   None of this will be available.
default6.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Justice Secretary has explicitly addressed why no exception will be made for children and young people with prison law needs (see page 67 of the Response to Transforming Legal Aid published on 5 S
defaulteptember 2013).
default It is suggested that the complaints syst
defaultems either are or will soon be adequate to deal with any problems fa
defaultced by children. 
defaultThis suggests a deep misunderstanding of the complaints system and the work lawyers currently do for children und
defaulter criminal legal aid.
default Lawyers working for children seek t
defaulto use the law constructively to achieve practical and meaningful results for young people rather than simply insist on an apology or an investigation into what went wrong.  At present, lawyers are not allowed to do cases that could be resolved without lega
defaultl assistance through the complaints system.  
default6.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is suggested 
defaultby the government that 
defaultthe advocacy services available to children in prison mitig
defaultate the need for legal advice, but
default it is well known that these services are very clearly not contracted to be a 
defaultsubstitute for legal advice: rather, where neces
defaultsary, they should facilitate it.
default However, without legal aid, there will b
defaulte nowhere for advocates to sign
defaultpost children to when issues cannot be resolve
defaultd
default without legal intervention.
default6.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also suggested that pr
defaultison law is not necessary because prisoners, including children and young people, will still have access to judicial review in principle.  As noted above, this fails to take into account the drastic restrictions posed by the judicial review changes and the
default residence test.
default6.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisproportionate impact:default it is clear that children and young people will be particularly affected
default by the changes to prison law legal aid
default. First, young people are disproportionately represented in the prison population. Second, the only areas that appear to remain in scope of legal aid rarely affect children, i.e. additional days at prison disciplinary hearings or parole hearings where rele
defaultase is being considered. Therefore, children will simply not encounter prison law specialists or have any cause to contact a lawyer who might be able to identify public law or other forms of unmet legal need arising in the course of their detention.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCdefaultase Study: DdefaultD was sentenced to a long extended sentence for public protection aged 17.  He had been a looked after child and has Asperger’s syndrome. D has never been in custody before.  He will need to address his offending behaviour while in prison so h
defaulte can be safely released.  Courses are identified on this sentence plan but there has been no consideration as to whether he will be able to understand the courses in light of his diagnosis.  Until 
defaulthe
default has addressed the reasons behind his offending, he will
default not be able to progress and he will not achieve release on parole.
default 
defaultUnder the new funding proposals he would not qualify for legal aid for any advice as to this sentence planning or recategorisation as he attempts to progress towards release. 
defaultH
defaulte will not b
defaulte eligible for any legally aided advice or assistance until the eighth year of his sentence when his parole window opens.  Unless 
defaulthe 
defaulthas managed to get himself on the right courses by that time, bearing in mind the needs of his diagnosis, it is unlikely th
defaultat his parole will be successful.  
default&#xa0;
default7.        defaultImpact ondefault access to specialist providersdefault7.1
default              
defaultWorking with young people requires lawyers who are experienced in dealing with their problems, and being able to build their trust. Often young people may initially seek advice but then find it hard to engage with their legal advisor until they have built 
defaultup a relationship of trust. If it is not possible for solicitors specialising in young people’s work to continue to operate, then there will be no way for young people to bring legal challenges in order to get the support and services they need. 
defaultFee cuts a
defaultcross the board are likely to mean that good quality, child-centred providers cannot continue to practice.
default7.2 
default              
defaultIn family law, since the last cuts, at least 23% of experts have already stopped doing publicly funded work. A third of the membership of The Co
defaultnsortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts have withdrawn from publicly funded work altogether
default. Children in care proceedings require specialist legal help as the most monumental decisions about their life are made. The same considerations apply to 
defaultcriminal and prison lawyers who specialise in youth work and face a 17.5% cut in fees. We note with dismay that the only specialist Law Centre for young people in England closed its doors last month.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAny restriction on young people’s access to lega
defaultl advice is highly unlikely to be good value for money for the tax-payer. Robust research has shown that a typical young person with a civil legal problem costs local health services, housing 
defaultservices and social services around £13,000 if they cannot recei
defaultve early advice.
default In addition, clear links have been established between young people’s unresolved civil legal problems and increased criminal offending.
default 
default9.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA recent detailed analysis on behalf of local authorities has shown that the residence test is likel
defaulty to cause a cost shift of at least £26m a year to local councils.
