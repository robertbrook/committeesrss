[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence[bold] from the National Federat[bold]ion of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) (CYS0121)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents 
[normal](NFRN) would like to thank the c
[normal]ommittee for the invitation to 
[normal]make a 
[normal]written submission on
[normal] the issue of
[normal] 
[normal]cycling safety
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Island
[normal]s and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. The NFRN assis
[normal]ts the independent retailer to 
[normal]compete more
[normal] effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, t
[normal]raining, expertise and services. I
[normal]t also represents its members’ interests at governmental and pa
[normal]rliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]General Remarks[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4. Cycling safety is an issue
[normal] that is
[normal] very
[normal] important to the NFRN as a
[normal] 
[normal]majority
[normal] of our members’ 
[normal]news
[normal]paper deliverers use a bicycle to undertake their work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]T
[normal]he NFRN 
[normal]has decided to 
[normal]issue a submission
[normal] to the enquiry on the basis that one of the proposals could impact negatively on the businesses of our members.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]Therefore t
[normal]his submission will focus solely on the following term of reference:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- 
[normal] 
[normal]Whether it would be 
[normal]desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Declaration of Interest[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6. 
[normal]While many
[normal] of the NFRN’s members employ newspaper deliverers who use bicy
[normal]cles to undertake their work, we
[normal] do not have any
[normal] further
[normal] links
[normal] or connections
[normal] with 
[normal]the 
[normal]cycling industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering cit[bold]y centres at peak hours.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]While ensuring the safety of cyclists is of paramount importance, the
[normal] NFRN urges the committee to consider the impact HGV prohibition during 
[normal]‘
[normal]rush hour
[normal]’
[normal] would have on 
[normal]businesses.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Our members 
[normal]and their suppliers may be 
[normal]seriously disadvantaged if deliveries are not able to be made or take longer as smaller vehicles have to be used.
[normal]9. Independent newsagents and convenience stores are already struggling in the difficult financial climate and with the competition from large
[normal] supermarkets. If their suppliers are unable to receive their deliveries on time, or the size of their deliveries is reduced, this will have a knock on effect for small businesses and their product availability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal] While cycling safety is a matter of hi
[normal]gh importance, it is
[normal] doubtful as to whether the proposal would improve cycling safety. The Freight Transport Association raises the point that one HGV will have to be replaced with approximately eight vans. As a consequence, this would actually 
[normal]increase co
[normal]ngestion on the roads and provide a further risk to both the safety of cyclists and the levels of pollution
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. Consequently, the NFRN does not feel that this is a sensible or practical proposal that should be implemented
[normal] as it undermines businesses without improving cycling safety
[normal].
