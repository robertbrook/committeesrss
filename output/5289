default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidencedefault from the National Federatdefaultion of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) (CYS0121)default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents 
default(NFRN) would like to thank the c
defaultommittee for the invitation to 
defaultmake a 
defaultwritten submission on
default the issue of
default 
defaultcycling safety
default.
default&#xa0;default2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Island
defaults and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.
default&#xa0;
default3. The NFRN assis
defaultts the independent retailer to 
defaultcompete more
default effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, t
defaultraining, expertise and services. I
defaultt also represents its members’ interests at governmental and pa
defaultrliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral Remarksdefault&#xa0;default4. Cycling safety is an issue
default that is
default very
default important to the NFRN as a
default 
defaultmajority
default of our members’ 
defaultnews
defaultpaper deliverers use a bicycle to undertake their work.
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultT
defaulthe NFRN 
defaulthas decided to 
defaultissue a submission
default to the enquiry on the basis that one of the proposals could impact negatively on the businesses of our members.
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultTherefore t
defaulthis submission will focus solely on the following term of reference:
default&#xa0;
default- 
default 
defaultWhether it would be 
defaultdesirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.
default&#xa0;
defaultDeclaration of Interestdefault&#xa0;default6. 
defaultWhile many
default of the NFRN’s members employ newspaper deliverers who use bicy
defaultcles to undertake their work, we
default do not have any
default further
default links
default or connections
default with 
defaultthe 
defaultcycling industry. 
default&#xa0;defaultWhether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering citdefaulty centres at peak hours.default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultWhile ensuring the safety of cyclists is of paramount importance, the
default NFRN urges the committee to consider the impact HGV prohibition during 
default‘
defaultrush hour
default’
default would have on 
defaultbusinesses.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8. Our members 
defaultand their suppliers may be 
defaultseriously disadvantaged if deliveries are not able to be made or take longer as smaller vehicles have to be used.
default9. Independent newsagents and convenience stores are already struggling in the difficult financial climate and with the competition from large
default supermarkets. If their suppliers are unable to receive their deliveries on time, or the size of their deliveries is reduced, this will have a knock on effect for small businesses and their product availability. 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default While cycling safety is a matter of hi
defaultgh importance, it is
default doubtful as to whether the proposal would improve cycling safety. The Freight Transport Association raises the point that one HGV will have to be replaced with approximately eight vans. As a consequence, this would actually 
defaultincrease co
defaultngestion on the roads and provide a further risk to both the safety of cyclists and the levels of pollution
default.
default&#xa0;
default11. Consequently, the NFRN does not feel that this is a sensible or practical proposal that should be implemented
default as it undermines businesses without improving cycling safety
default.
