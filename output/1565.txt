[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;The Heating and Hotwater Industry Council (HHIC) and the Hot Water Association (HWA) welcome the opportunity to respond to the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee’s Inquiry into Heat.  HHIC and HWA are trade associations working together under the umbrella of the Energy &amp; Utilities Alliance to provide widespread representation of the domestic heating and hot water industry which is worth £3-4 billion.  &#xa0;HHIC members include manufacturers, merchants and installers of all types of heating products including traditional fossil fuel boilers, microCHP, heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar water heaters. HWA represents manufacturers of hot water storage products. 93-95% of heating and hot water solutions in the UK are covered by HHIC’s and HWA’s membership.&#xa0;We would be happy to discuss any of the issues raised in this response and in the Inquiry with the Select Committee.

[[[UK homes]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1 HHIC and HWA support the need to reduce carbon emissions in order to help combat climate change and to establish longer term energy security. At the same time we recognise the ongoing need to provide affordable and effective heating for UK households along with the implications and needs to alleviate fuel poverty.1.2 Reducing the amount of carbon used for heating UK homes is a significant challenge and progress has been relatively slow. There are a number of factors which are limiting the pace of decarbonisation.&#xa0;1.3 Faced with all of these issues it would be easy to focus the decarbonisation agenda on other market sectors. Heating and hot water are together responsible for over 80 % of the domestic sectors energy consumption and 27% of the UK’s carbon emissions and so cannot be ignored if the 2030 and 2050 ambitions are to be achieved.1.4 The inquiry raises a number of critical questions about the opportunities and challenges to reduce carbon emissions from domestic heating. HHIC has produced a report entitled Pathways to Domestic Heating which provides some new and alternative options to reduce the carbon intensity of domestic heating and in doing so addresses a number of questions raised in the Inquiry.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Pathways to low carbon heating]]]&#xa0;2.1 The DECC Heat Strategy which was published in March 2012 and the subsequent 2013 document ‘The Future of Heating: Meeting the Challenge’ have given a valuable insight into the Government’s ambitions. This has also provided a basis for a more informed debate about the prospects for reducing the carbon intensity of heating. Whilst these documents provide a vision of what might be achieved by 2050, they are very light on the measures by which these ambitions can and will be delivered. Crucially when considered alongside the practical challenges to decarbonise the heating market that we outlined earlier in this response, they do not provide the level of certainty that the heating industry needs to bring the products to market with appropriate cost and performance characteristics and at sufficient scale to deliver the changes envisaged.2.2 Industry want to see more robust short and medium term plans put in place to supplement the long term vision2.3 To address this issue HHIC has embarked on an ambitious project to try to plot out a pathway for decarbonising the domestic heating market. Phase 1 of this project, to establish some short to medium term scenarios has been completed. The findings are detailed in our report ‘Pathways for Domestic Heat’ which can be accessed on the following link: www.centralheating.co.uk/pathways2.4 The objective of this work has been to address the challenges presented by the government's heat strategy and in particular to provide alternatives to the largely all electric scenario. In particular HHIC's view is that in the medium term i.e.at least until 2030, the UK will need a greater mix of fuel and technology choices than those proposed by the heat strategy.2.5 The report is the result of an evidence based study into a range of different pathway options using detailed market and economic analysis together with input on technology, performance and applications from HHIC members from across the supply chain.  2.6 The outcome of this study is a more realistic scenario for the deployment of domestic heating products in 2027 which:2.7 Our scenario does however envisage a major change in product mix and that by 2027 condensing boilers will fall from the dominant position today with annual sales reducing to just over one third of the market. Of these nearly half would have solar thermal or flue gas heat recovery. Electric heat pumps would grow to just over one quarter of the market and about half of these would be hybrid heat pump/hybrid products. Low carbon gas technologies (gas heat pumps, microCHP and fuel cells) would rise to one fifth of the market and district heating would supply about one tenth of the market2.8  The report points out that this ambitious view of how the market could be transformed can only be realised if the government also demonstrates its commitment. This would require the introduction of policies that stimulate demand for low carbon heating and which provide industry with the confidence to develop and bring these products to market. Possible policy options are included in the report and the next stage of the project will start to develop these into more detailed proposals.2.9 The outcome is a scenario which industry believes that with appropriate policy support it would be able to deliver. The acceptance by industry and Government to delivering such a change and the establishment of a credible policy framework will then provide industry with the confidence needed to scale up the technical and market development of these products.&#xa0;

[[[need for an ambitious policy framework]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1 Whilst our pathways report provides some confidence that decarbonisation of the market is a practical reality, Phase 2 will identify policy options that could stimulate the demand needed to deliver the necessary scale of market transformation. We recognise the economic and political constraints but believe that we need an imaginative approach if we are to have any chance of success. 3.2 We think that new market segmentation might allow us to better focus available resources and we are interested in the idea of establishing some low carbon heating communities. There are also opportunities for some limited regulatory levers that could be used. Industry, with its close knowledge and understanding of the market and customers is able to bring ideas to the table.  If we are to stand any chance of meeting the ambitions and potential that exists in this area, we believe a cross government action group should be established to work closely with industry and other stakeholders.

[[[Role of the Domestic RHI]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1 The recent announcements about the RHI are welcome and will provide a much needed stimulus to encourage the uptake of renewable heating. Whilst the tariffs within the scheme have been cautiously set to provide some rate of return on investment, there are still uncertainties about actual costs of installation of products at this early stage and the tariffs may not fully take account of barrier costs. The industry is very aware that the factors involved in replacing a heating system are different and more complex than a decision to install solar PV on a roof. As a result we believe that the domestic RHI will still be a hard sell especially in the owner occupier sector.  4.2 Taking into account the comments above and also the limited scale of the RHI then this scheme alone is unlikely to drive the scale of uptake that would be needed to deliver HHIC’s 2027 scenario. It is however a good start but will quickly need to be supplemented by other policies which will help drive demand for low carbon and renewable heating.

[[[Heat storage]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1 The heat generator is often the single focus of any debate about heating; other components of the heating system are also important and are likely to play an increasingly significant role in the drive to decarbonisation. 5.2 Heat storage will become an increasingly important factor in the decarbonisation of UK homes. Combi boilers were introduced to the market in the 1990’s and since then have grown in popularity mainly because, by eliminating the hot water tank, they free up space in the home and are generally easier and cheaper to install. HHIC boiler sales figures show that in the past year 76% of gas boiler sales are combi and the English House Condition Survey indicates that over 50% of homes now have a combi boiler.  In the vast majority of cases the hot water tank will have been removed and the space used for other purposes.5.3 The characteristics of many alternative low carbon sources of heat leads to a mismatch between heat demand and supply availability. Renewables are intermittent in availability and the inability to store electricity, together with limitations in the supply infrastructure means that it can be more economical to provide heating at times where there is low demand. Another consideration is the cost and performance characteristics of alternative heating products. The higher costs mean that it can be more attractive to install a lower capacity product to provide continuous heating rather than one sized to deliver on demand fast heat up times. Some products such as heat pumps are also more energy efficient when delivering a steady heat load rather than peaks  5.4 Consideration needs to be given to reversing this trend away from hot water storage and a sector based approach would be most appropriate for this.   New homes provide a clear but limited opportunity to re-introduce hot water storage. There would also be value in identifying and targeting those types of property where space is less of an issue, and to engineer innovative heat storage options which can make use of unused spaces.

[[[Heat distribution]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1 The design of heating circuits can also have an impact on heating performance and efficiency in the UK, heat in the form of hot water generated in a boiler has traditionally been distributed around homes at relatively high temperatures of typically 80 deg. C.  The heating circuits and particularly the radiators have been sized for this high temperature operation. By contrast the performance heat pumps can fall off rapidly when they are required to generate such high temperatures, typically above 50 deg. C. The design and sizing of the system therefore becomes much more critical when a heat pump is being installed. This characteristic does not necessarily mean that every new heat pump installation requires an expensive new heat distribution system. There may however be benefits in identifying opportunities to encourage the installation of low temperature heating circuits in new homes or when major refurbishment work is being undertaken. Boilers can be used equally well with low temperature heating circuits and a small improvement (typically 1-2%) in efficiency would result. However the main benefit of such a move would be to future proof some homes for heat pumps as the conditions for the use of these products improves. &#xa0;
