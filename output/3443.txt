[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Reports&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Committees should keep their reports short and accessible, and avoid too many recommendations (para 79).]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Committees should clearly indicate which recommendations are most important (which will help the committee achieve impact and make follow-up easier) and to whom each recommendation is addressed (para 79).]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Follow-up&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Committees should appoint a member of staff, or an adviser, or an outside body, who will monitor follow-up to recommendations in respect of each report and should report to the House at least once in each parliamentary Session upon how many of its recommendations  the Government has acted, and what follow-up is proposed on outstanding recommendations (para 83).]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Committee behaviour&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Witnesses should always be treated with respect and given a fair hearing, and that criticisms of individuals should be based on evidence and individuals should be made aware of them prior to publication (paras 102-103).]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
