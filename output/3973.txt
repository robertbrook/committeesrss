[[[Written evidence from Doctors4justice (GMC0023)]]]&#xa0;

[[[POLICE WORK]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We had reports that after many years of refusing to do anything in some cases, recently, police have commenced investigations where patients’ abuse was alleged (for example, such as alleged theft of narcotics from patient by staff). It was felt by carers that The General Medical Council (GMC) could do more when inadequate prescribing occurred in terminal cancer. There were no conditions put on doctor’s practice where it was felt inadequacies existed in prescribing. It was reported to us that a patient died in agony.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Another case is in the opposite direction: a patient was prescribed narcotics for terminal cancer he did not have. Police have agreed to investigate it and GMC have not been involved yet. There are Memoranda of Understanding between police and GMC and we wonder how it works and even if it can work because of the seriousness of some alleged wrongdoing and GMC not being a criminal court.

[[[               MEDICAL HIGH COURT]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Their experience is not of the kind required by the case before them, and it is not possible to predict all the legal issues that would arise during the hearing.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some people that GMC accept to judge doctors are not fit to judge anyone. For example, exorcists, religious extremists, those who fail to declare their conflict of interests contrary to GMC’s policy on declaration of interests. D4J sent extensive evidence to GMC and MPTS on corrupt Fitness to Practise Panellists. GMC refused to take any action at all. We had very high hopes in judge Pearl when he was appointed to chair MPTS. When it was pointed to MPTS (Judge Pearl) and GMC that relevant interests were not declared by FTP panellists GMC’s response was that not all interests need to be declared. Yes, amazing, but that is sooooooo GMC. They remain fiercely protective of their own. The best place for a doctor to hide (someone who has done something wrong and could fear disciplinary proceedings against him/her by GMC) is to become Fitness to Practise Panellist. It would be illegal to provide written certification of protection but it is not something GMC needs to do: It is as if there has been unspoken agreement between parties: you look after us and we shall look after you. It is immensely frustrating for doctors, patients, relatives, carers and friends when they hit the GMC wall of obstruction. Judge Pearl never responded if he read the submissions which included evidence of fraud by panellist.  Amazingly, both GMC and MPTS have been so defiant that they went on to extend the contract of one panellists well beyond all the rules and regulations and of course, the law which is against corruption and fraud. One allegation of fraud was that of use of NHS facilities for private practise without the permission of Secretary of State for Health and contrary to NHS Act(s). We calculated that just in one case it was about £50,000 lost to NHS and if this has been done by a number of doctors then NHS is losing millions every year because of this failure to apply the law.

[[[  TWENTY TIMES INCREASED MORTALITY IN DOCTORS INVESTIGATED BY THE GMC  COMPARED TO THE NORMAL WORKING POPULATION]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Are male doctors more likely to suffer prejudice when it comes to their health and receive poorer care from other healthcare professionals? We do know that some social expectations of men can have negative impact on their health (such as being used as a workhorse or a walking wallet or failure to recognize the depression in male doctors, for example).b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Do some male doctors have attitudinal problems themselves towards their own health? c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is there rivalry issue going on between male doctors fighting “turf (private practise) wars” which GMC was not aware of or even doctors themselves because GMC does not disclose all complaints to the doctors? In addition, GMC formulated illegal policy of targeting those in private practise. Mediation should be used at times rather than GMC regulatory process.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Are some doctors suffering another prejudice because they are men and of certain age? For example, are people of a certain age more likely to be irritable with inadequacies of others and could this lead to conflict and referral to the regulator? Is there a sub-population of male doctors who suffer undiagnosed andropause with consequent irritability, depression, decreased energy as well as more easily admitted consequences of andropause such as cardio-vascular and bone problems?e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Stress of investigations by GMC can be overwhelming mentally and physically for some doctors and it is necessary to find out why men do have worse outcomes.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We do realize other questions could be asked and answered by the inquiry.&#xa0;

[[[      COMPULSORY HEALTH MOT]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]GMC have told PHSC (Parliamentary Health Select Committee) that when GMC’s Fitness to Practice Panel makes a decision regarding a doctor’s fitness to practise they have no right to appeal that decision but doctor could. D4J has been alerted to a case of a doctor who complained about racial/ethnic discrimination and took an NHS Trust to the Employment Tribunal where he lost having represented himself badly. In retaliation, NHS Trust made false allegations to GMC who promptly instructed psychiatrists to examine him. Paranoia was diagnosed without any reference to diagnostic criteria or the facts of the case. Doctor suffered with anxiety. Interim Order Panel hearing put conditions on his practise making the decision not to publish the conditions relating to health. However, the panel secretary decided she did not like those health conditions not being published and organized a different panel within a week or so. One can imagine the stress on the doctor who just had one hearing and who is also in full time NHS employment. D4J was able to help this doctor by using human rights arguments. However, we do not know to what extent IOP hearings are used in abusive manner. We do know that some doctors seem to have an amazing number of IOP hearings. One report was 14 IOP hearings for one doctor.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Whistle-blowers have been persecuted by the GMC with collusion of medical defence bodies. There are some issues that matter to patients and public that have remained not addressed despite GMC publishing a little something on whistleblowing and government making the effort to change the legislation somewhat to improve the matters for whistleblowers. It is a fact that there are positive obligations on the state with respect to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This includes the right to receive information as well as the right to free speech.Despite the fact that GMC received the petition signed by doctors of many faiths and patients that there should be no religious uniforms worn by mental health workers when working with mentally ill patients, GMC refused to respond to the petition at first, then organised the consultation on faith issue by omitting the uniforms issue.The next thing GMC did was to blame external consultants who were employed by them to conduct the survey on doctors and personal belief. Despite the deficiencies in the survey questions the relevant issues were raised in the survey answers and with GMC and once again they ignored it completely. Now, it is fourteen years how GMC have essentially colluded in what amounts to breech of Article 10 of European Convention on Human Rights. Psychiatrists do not wear white coats and nurses do not wear uniforms because it creates a barrier to communication and trust. GMC do know that but they would do everything they can to abuse their power by failing to set up proper ethical guidance and also by persecuting doctor(s) who put patients interests first. Men raped by clergy, for example, do not fit the male macho image GMC have of themselves. They do not want to acknowledge male rape or the psychological/social/financial/occupational consequences these criminal activities have on men long-term, how hard it is for male victims of rape to open up on these issues to health workers and that having mental health workers dressed in nun’s habit or as a priest has negative effect on the reporting of the crimes. D4J has contacted network of victims of abuse by clergy and they fully agreed that uniforms are detrimental in mental health. Research on patients’ opinion was conducted in UK about the issue of religious uniforms and it found patients thought of religious uniforms as off-putting. The research was condemned by GMC as serious professional misconduct! It is very easy for GMC to eliminate any doctor, any time, because they appear to have an army of religious fanatics ready to step in and judge the “deviant” doctors. Doctors, members of Fitness to Practise Panel who fail to declare their religious affiliations when they should (Dr Gwen Adshead is just one such example, who is the lay preacher), escape without any action from GMC. Even when it is certain that appointment of a religious professional would lead to bias, wrong judgement and many deaths by the removal of good doctors GMC continue to protect those doctors and expect that somehow we should trust them in the regulation of the medical profession.&#xa0;Doctors4Justice have come across some cases of foreign doctors who have very poor English language skills. In fact, we were amazed just how bad it was. GMC have asked the Parliament to be given more powers to test these doctors, as far as we can remember. They do not need the powers to test as they already have the power to ask for the certificates in proficiency to be presented to them as a condition for registration. GMC like other equivalent European institutions can make sure they do not expose the public to any risk due to poor language ability of registered doctors. D4J have noticed that now GMC’s  case investigators are asking foreign doctors when did they plan to take the test in language proficiency (appropriately, so) but these doctors are already registered (through GMC’s own lack of interest to do things properly in the first place) and have complaints against them. We think that GMC as an institution with allegations of ethnic/racial bias have deliberately set up foreign doctors to fail by not demanding they meet the certification on English language first, and before registering them.GMC have continued to hoard the complaints against doctors without disclosing them to doctors when they decide not to investigate the complaints further and sometimes even when they do decide to investigate the complaints if complainant does not wish the complaint to be disclosed.
