[normal]John E. Warren – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]First let me say I agree with a large amount of the proposed changes. I do however have concerns with some parts which I explain below
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 27 (1) (F)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Targets, reports 
[normal]ect
[normal]. 
[normal]Are important for judging progress so I think reports should still be issued.
[normal] Informal objectives are often not open to scrutiny by 3
[normal]rd
[normal] parties which is wrong in my view.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 29
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each step in process to giving fine increases the cost of the process. I think issuing a warning is enough.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 47 (I)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From personal experience I know councils need to 
[normal]required
[normal] to use local people in decision making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I was a tenant representative for 5 ½ years and struggled to get copies of policies before they were implementation for review. My council was using me to rubber stamp decisions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I was also a trustee of a self advocacy group for people with learning difficulties. Trying to get easy to read version of proposed policies was difficult and at least 2 times we had to force an extension to consultation period as easy read not available
