&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Defence Committee’s work during the period since Easter 2012 has continued to focus strongly on continuing operations in Afghanistan and preparations for the drawdown of the UK military commitment in 2014. We published a major report on Securing the Future of Afghanistan  in March 2013; during the course of this inquiry we travelled to Afghanistan in November 2012, visiting Kabul and Helmand. We are also conducting another visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the autumn of this year. &#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to focussing on ongoing operations, we have also been looking ahead to the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), continuing to assess the success and effects of implementation of the 2010 SDSR and assessing emerging threats such as cyber, which will form an important part of the next Review. We have also focussed on the operation of the Armed Forces Covenant and how the Ministry of Defence is managing within its financial settlement, in particular scrutinising steps taken to improve the efficiency of its equipment acquisition. We visited Washington in May this year in the context of our work on preparing for the next SDSR and our work on Afghanistan.&#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also completed a major report on the defence implications of Scottish independence with the intention of helping to inform debate in the run-up to the referendum next year. We visited Scotland during the course of this inquiry.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Defence Committee has on a number of occasions in the past held seminars to discuss its future programme. The last of these sessions was held at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in October 2012, and provided an opportunity for us, our staff and specialist advisers, to engage with academics and others including the Chief of the Defence Staff to identify a programme for the remainder of the Parliament.  We took the unusual step of publishing this programme in a press release on 10 December 2012 with the intention of stimulating comment and engagement with outside bodies and commentators. &#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have not had occasion to commission specific pieces of research, but we continue to receive tremendous support from RUSI. In the context of ongoing work on Towards the next Defence and Security Review, the Committee has been extremely grateful for work undertaken by RUSI to encourage academics to engage with the inquiry and contribute material, some of which may be used as evidence.  In approaching this work we decided to pursue four different strands of inquiry that will feed into a major piece of work next year on the SDSR. Each of these strands – which are initially “paper-based” inquiries -  is being led by different Members of the Committee who will act as “rapporteurs”. The reports on these strands will be drawn together with other material to inform a major report next year. This represents a new long-term strategic approach for the Committee.&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have for some time adopted the practice of holding formal planning meetings prior to the commencement of each inquiry with the intention of identifying from whom we want to take evidence, what we are seeking to achieve and ensuring that proper consideration has been given to the timing of publication of reports. As part of our development of a long-term communications plan, we held a briefing for Defence editors to accompany the launch of our forward programme in December 2012.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Committee has taken a number of steps to explore different ways of taking evidence as well as engaging with a wider audience. In the context of our inquiry into Future Army 2020,  the Army Rumour Service (ARSSE) is hosting a web forum seeking views on the Government’s plans for the future of the Army, with the intention of informing questions for our evidence sessions. It is often difficult for us to obtain the views of Service personnel on matters that affect them and the forum provided an invaluable opportunity to do so. We are extremely grateful to the House of Commons Digital Outreach Team for their help in setting up the forum and using it to provide ongoing help in engaging Service personnel with wider parliamentary activities.  &#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We took oral evidence from children, parents and teachers at Wellington Academy, Tidworth, as part of our inquiry into the Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Educating the children of Service Personnel.  We would like to put on record again our gratitude firstly to the children, parents and teachers we met and also to the school authorities for facilitating this session. We also made use of web fora hosted by the NAO to solicit evidence from Service personnel and their families directly in relation to this inquiry and also our inquiry into the Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Education of Service Personnel.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We undertook professional training on improving questioning techniques. We held two sessions with a trainer, analysing some of our past performances in questioning high profile witnesses, and working to identify which approaches to questioning worked best. This was a challenging and worthwhile exercise which we hope has had a positive impact on our work. It has also inspired us to hold regular private “wash-up” sessions after each evidence session to discuss the effectiveness of the session and identify what needs to be followed up in future sessions or in writing.10.&#xa0;&#xa0; We have taken a number of steps to contribute to the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill (further details are provided in paragraphs 22-23 below). We note that four Members of this Committee were appointed to the Public Bill Committee examining the Bill. This undoubtedly contributed to the expertise of the Committee scrutinising this important piece of legislation and, indeed, provided valuable insights for the Members involved. However, we do note that the burden placed on the Members concerned was considerable and allowances had to be made in scheduling our programme.11.&#xa0;&#xa0; We agreed to appoint Gisela Stuart as an informal rapporteur on the FCO Balance of Competences Review: Foreign Policy Report. She maintained a watching brief for the Committee on this work.12.&#xa0;&#xa0; We have been mindful of the Liaison Committee’s recommendations on keeping reports short and accessible without too many recommendations. However, we have otherwise decided against altering the general style of our reports, including the manner in which recommendations are highlighted.13.&#xa0;&#xa0; There have been a number of occasions on which we have taken further action pursuant to Government responses to our reports. We criticised the Government response to our report on the Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Military Casualties, specifically in the areas of Service family support and the long term needs associated with brain injury. We issued a press notice highlighting these deficiencies and followed up these matters with Ministers via correspondence and a progress review after six months. Similarly, following receipt of the Government response to our reports on Future Maritime Surveillance, Defence and Cyber- security and Operations in Afghanistan, we wrote to the MoD to highlight areas where the responses failed to address particular conclusions and recommendations.14.&#xa0;&#xa0; We have for some time adopted the practice of holding a regular follow-up of our reports, six months after publication of the Government response. We wish to place on record the MoD’s readiness to assist us in this work, including its submission of a follow-up paper on our report on Future Maritime Surveillance before it had actually been commissioned (as noted above, we had been critical of the initial Government response). We also note the very full and constructive follow-up paper that was provided by the MoD on our report on The Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Accommodation.&#xa0;15.&#xa0;&#xa0; In the process of following up our report from February 2012 into Developing threats: Electro-magnetic pulses, the Committee initiated a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the threats posed by a possible space weather event or an attack causing an electro-magnetic pulse event. We were concerned that analysis of this emerging threat should be given a high priority within Government; we have published correspondence arising from our meeting with the Prime Minister, detailing actions that he has taken in response to the session, on our website. 16.&#xa0;&#xa0; We have taken steps to apply for debates in backbench time, securing a debate in the House on Armed Forces Personnel on 6 December 2012. This debate was centred around a number of the Committee’s publications, including its reports on The Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Military Casualties; The Armed Forces Covenant in Action?: Accommodation; and  the Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2010-11 and evidence taken on the work of the Service Complaints Commissioner of the Armed Forces. Further details of our contribution to informing debate in the House and in Westminster Hall is provided at paragraph 28.&#xa0;17.&#xa0;&#xa0; We are currently engaged in a series of strands of activity building towards a major report in 2014 to inform the next Strategic Defence and Security Review. Whilst this document is now produced within the Cabinet Office, its significance for the identification of threats to the UK and decisions relating to the allocation of resources within Government will be fundamental. It will therefore have a key role in determining the future of the Armed Forces after 2015, and we hope to have a significant input into the process.&#xa0;18.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our report on Defence and Cyber-Security has formed part of our important analysis of the emerging threats to UK security. The inquiry explored whether the high profile given to the cyber-threat in the UK is matched by a coherent plan and chain of command in the event of a major cyber-attack on our national infrastructure or our national interests.19.&#xa0;&#xa0; We undertook a major report into Future Maritime Surveillance in response to the decision announced in the SDSR 2010 to cancel the Nimrod MRA4 programme. Rather than revisit the cancellation of Nimrod, we  examined the implications of the decision for future maritime surveillance capabilities and assessed how the resultant capability gap would be managed. This included an assessment of the strategic requirements for military and non-military maritime surveillance capabilities, the various ways they are provided currently and in the future and how this would be incorporated into work on the next National Security Strategy and next Strategic Defence and Security Review. A particular area of focus was cross-government cooperation, including the work of the Maritime Security Oversight Group and the National Maritime Information Centre.    20.&#xa0;&#xa0; We continue to place a high priority on our work in scrutinising the Ministry of Defence’s Annual Report and Accounts, and the Department’s Estimates. The Report on the Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2011-12 highlighted the repeated qualification of the MoD Accounts; weak financial management information and the paucity of information provided in the Annual Report.&#xa0;21.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our reports on the MoD’s supplementary estimate for 2012-13 and its main estimate for 2013-14 noted the importance of the Treasury continuing to fund the additional costs of operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere and welcomed the use of the Budget Exchange Mechanism.&#xa0;22.&#xa0;&#xa0; We have not had any draft Bills to consider during the period covered by this memorandum.&#xa0;23.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our work has contributed to informing the House’s consideration of the Defence Reform Bill. The Committee’s report on Defence Acquisition was tagged on the Order Paper to the Second Reading debate on the Bill which provides for a legislative framework for the establishment of a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GoCo) body to manage defence acquisition. Our inquiry raised a number of important questions around the proposals, particularly relating to future governance; whether problems would arise if a non-UK company were given responsibility for UK defence acquisition; and whether sufficient consultation with allies had taken place.&#xa0;24.&#xa0;&#xa0;  The Bill also provides for reforms of the UK Reserve Forces. The Committee is currently undertaking an inquiry into Future Army 2020, and the Government’s plans to increase its reliance on Reserve Forces. Whilst the Committee is unlikely to have reported before this Bill leaves the Commons, we anticipate that the evidence that it has so far taken will help to inform debate, and we will be asking for this to be tagged to the Order Paper for the report stage and third reading debates. 25.&#xa0;&#xa0; The Armed Forces Act 2011 placed a requirement on the Secretary of State for Defence to make an annual statement to Parliament on the operation of the military covenant. This was the first legislative commitment pertaining to services provided to support service personnel. We have undertaken a series of inquiries on the theme of The Armed Forces Covenant in action?, examining military casualties, accommodation, education of Service personnel and the education of children of Service personnel. &#xa0;26.&#xa0;&#xa0; Defence Committees have taken a keen interest for many years in the operation and effectiveness of the Service complaints process and the work of the Service Complaints Commissioner for the Armed Forces which was established under the Armed Forces Act 2006. We conducted an  inquiry into the work of the Commissioner, concluding that there was a lack of confidence among Service personnel in the complaints system and that the system was not working effectively or efficiently. We also examined the role of the Commissioner and recommended that the role should change to that of an Armed Forces Ombudsman. As a consequence of our report and the Commissioner’s annual report, discussions are ongoing between the MoD and the Commissioner to revise her role and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Service complaints system.27.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have been asked for a formal opinion by the European Scrutiny Committee on a Commission Communication on Towards a more competitive and efficient defence and security sector. We have undertaken to provide this opinion by the end of October.28.&#xa0;&#xa0; We have not been required to undertake a formal pre-appointment hearing during the period covered by this paper, although we are expecting to hold a pre-appointment hearing with the proposed new Service Complaints Commissioner in the near future. We have also held evidence sessions with the new Chief of the Defence Staff and the new Permanent Under Secretary at the Ministry of Defence. 29.&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to the debates and tags mentioned above, our report on Future Maritime Surveillance was the subject of a debate in Westminster Hall in February this year. Evidence taken by the Committee during its inquiry on Future Army 2020 was tagged to the debate on Defence Reforms allocated by the Backbench Business Committee, initiated by John Baron MP.October 2013&#xa0;
