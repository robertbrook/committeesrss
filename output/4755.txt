[[[Written evidence from Bob Jones, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner [CST0036]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for the further opportunity to contribute to your inquiry into crime statistics. Unfortunately I was unable to provide feedback during November due to the incredibly tight timescales.&#xa0;You pose two specific questions in your request:&#xa0;&#xa0;In relation to these can I point you in the direction of the recent blog that I have published in relation to this subject matter: http://www.westmidlands-pcc.gov.uk/your-commissioner/blogs/posts/2013/november-2013/missing-the-target-and-the-point/&#xa0;I hope that this satisfies your request but should you have any further queries please do not hesitate in contacting me. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013
