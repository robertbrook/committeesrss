[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;In many countries, physical activity is disappearing from daily life. Our physical, emotional and economic well-being has become increasingly compromised as a result. This is a situation that health infrastructures, social services and national economies cannot possibly endure. Physical inactivity is now an epidemic and we must act urgently to break its deadly cycle. If we reach children when they are young enough, before the age of 10, they can learn to love physical activity and sports for life. They’ll reap the rewards and pass them on to the next generation.&#xa0;We must also find ways to integrate the physical activity we’ve already lost back into our daily lives. Amongst many things, this relates to the way our cities are designed, schools are run, workplaces are structured, and how community environments are shaped.&#xa0;No single organisation or institution can fix this alone. It will take global, national, state and local governing bodies, and their leaders, corporations and their employees, civil society, individuals and communities. All of us need to be part of the solution and it is imperative that we focus and align our agendas to move forward quickly. Designed to Move is a framework to get everyone headed in the same direction. It focuses the work into one vision and two “asks” that can change the future. Nike, Inc, Sustrans, Young Foundation, British Heart Foundation and many others are pleased to present this Framework for Action on behalf of the many experts and organisations that have uniquely shaped this way forward.&#xa0;With combined expertise, diverse resources and collective commitment, we can create a new way of life for all - one that unleashes our extraordinary human potential. We thereby welcome the inquiry announced by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee concerning women &amp; sport. Whilst our work and body of research does not look into gender specifically, we feel that we can provide some useful input. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]A recent UK-wide study by Griffiths et. Al  (2013) describes levels of physical activity, sedentary time and adherence to Chief  Medical officers Physical Activity Guidelines among primary school-aged children. The guidelines suggest that all young people should engage in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) for at least 60 min every day while reducing sedentary time. Moderate activities include bike riding and playground activities whilst vigorous activities include sports such as running and swimming. The study concludes that only 51% of the total 6497 children who took part in the study achieve recommended level of physical activity. An important observation in relationship to female participation in sports is that gender turned out to be the most significant variation to influence physical activity levels. While over half of the boys (63%) achieved met every day CMO (Chief Medical Officers) guidelines, this counted for only 38% of the girls. Additionally, the study confirmed that girls were consistently less active than boys across all ethnic groups. The article calls for effort to boost Physical Activity levels among young people to the level appropriate for good health.Physical inactivity is quietly threatening the social and economic prosperity of the United Kingdom. Economists estimate the annual combined cost of inactivity-related health problems and lost economic output to be approximately UK £20 billion annually.  While this is unsustainable, the human cost is far greater. For example, a study published in the Lancet estimates that nine percent of all premature deaths worldwide are attributed to physical inactivity.  &#xa0;Knowledge of the consequences of physical inactivity has been emerging for years. For example, between 1994 and 2008 in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of obesity increased by 79 percent in men and 47 percent in women.  Among British children ages 2-10, obesity increased by 56 percent.  &#xa0;Designed to Move is a call-to-action supported by a community of more than 70 public, private and civil sector organizations dedicated to ending the physical inactivity epidemic. It brings together an extensive body of research on the benefits of physical activity, sport and play, and it puts forth a Framework for Action to completely alter the physical activity levels of whole populations. &#xa0;2012 Move It report.&#xa0;The physical inactivity crisis is certainly not unique to Britain - it is taking hold around the world. However, we now know that the epidemic is pervasive here and it is projected to worsen. In fewer than two generations (1961-2005), Britons have reduced their levels of physical activity by 20%. If no action is taken, the drop will be on the order of 35% (from 1961 levels) by 2030.  

[[[The time for action is now.]]]&#xa0;The research is compelling and frightening. This year, physical inactivity will kill more people than smoking.  Today’s children are the first generation to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.  If we look at the other end of the spectrum,

[[[ ]]]a physically active young person is less likely to smoke, become pregnant or use drugs. 

[[[ ]]]And their prospects for future income and educational attainment can improve dramatically.  Something needs to change – and quickly.&#xa0;At this point, the issue of physical inactivity is so deeply entrenched in our daily lives that no one entity will be able to fix it alone. The issue will require cross-party support and transcend politics. Everyone—from government and civil society to corporations and individuals—has a vested interested in solving this problem. As such, everyone has a role to play. It will require multi-sector collaboration including new public-private approaches that deliver the right incentives in the system to create real change.Designed to Move’s goal is to create a world where physical activity, play, and sports are all both highly valued and an expected part of life. Our efforts are focused on creating positive experiences for children, so they can learn to love sport in a way that enables them to realize their full potential as they grow older. The Framework for Action provides a best roadmap to inspire and motivate children toward a better, brighter future. Because everyone needs to move more to lead healthier, happier lives, the Framework is equally focused on opportunities to integrate physical activity into daily life—wherever we live, work, move and play. &#xa0;Nike, the Premier League, ICSSPE, British Heart Foundation, Young Foundation, Sustrans, and others are working together to drive these efforts forward.&#xa0;In response to the specific barriers highlighted by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee we will look at the following:&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Reasons why participation in sport by women decreases.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The variety of sports on offer to girls at school.&#xa0;

[[[Reasons why participation in sport by women decreases.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Designed to Move is a framework which advocates for universal access to sport and physical activity. It recognises that a focus on the hardest to reach groups such as young girls is needed to tackle the issue of decreasing sport and physical activity levels prevalent in today’s society. &#xa0;In order to address this urgent issue we must create positive early experiences of sports and physical activity for all children. We must specifically focus on the first 10 years of life in order to break the cycle of physical inactivity and subsequent negative consequence to individuals and society.&#xa0;Inactive parents often have inactive children, as children follow by example. Children with two inactive parents are 5.8 times less likely to be active. Therefore, focusing on increased physical activity among our children should be a core priority in order to break this cycle and thereby create a society where physical activity and participation in sport is the norm rather than the exception. &#xa0;The benefits for society and individuals are enormous. Whilst productivity levels and the number of graduates increase, fuelling a stronger economy, research shows that on the individual level physically active adults are significantly less likely to suffer from anxiety, depression or psychological distress. Overall there is an enormous upside in having future generations who are physically active.&#xa0;Better use of community resources will facilitate and increase participation in sports. A cross-sectoral approach at the hyper local level is essential to best utilise existing resources. The solution requires a coordinated approach that considers the way our cities are designed; that schools become hubs for physical activity before, during and after formal education takes place; that our workplaces are structured to prioritise activity; as well as how community environments and voluntary organizations are engaged at local level. Better use of local resources, by children for example, should in turn have a positive effect on their parents who see the enjoyment they take from being physically active. This would essentially encourage the positive cycle of activity.&#xa0;Government and private/commercial resources should be optimized and new alternative ways of financing should be identified. There is also potential to improve measurement of impact and outcome of physical activity on community levels; to specifically track changes driven by occupational, transport, leisure and domestic factors; and to disaggregate by age, gender, culture, income levels, location and specific intellectual or physical needs. This could help to more accurately allocate resources, where they would give the best possible effect.

[[[The variety of sports on offer to girls at sch]]]

[[[ool.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;As demonstrated in the seven design filters we believe that sport should be designed for Universal Access and if we are to have the biggest impact we should prioritise the hardest to reach. Girls and women are identified as one of these groups. While 71% of boys do not meet the minimum physical activity guidelines, the same counts for 81% of girls.&#xa0;Creating and reinforcing positive female role models should be further encouraged and be from all levels including; parents, siblings, teachers, coaches, elite athletes and females in the media.&#xa0;Best practice suggests that if it is not practical for boys and girls to play together (e.g. for cultural or religious reasons), opportunities should be created for both genders and investment should be made in female coaches to increase girls’ comfort and participation. Additionally, girls respond well to activities that include friends and peers. A practical example of this would be the Nike Training Club which uses a physical activity curriculum focused on girls and using female instructors. The program also enables the training of girls to become instructors for their friends. Nike piloted this in schools across London in 2011 and has it has since been adopted by several schools within the United Kingdom .&#xa0;We need to ensure that pathways are available for the talented and at the same time enable opportunities for all to regularly participate in sport and physical activity. There is a need to develop the right incentives and motivations for children to participate. We should focus on creating feedback for children as a positive enabler - all children get excited about reaching personal achievements and/or contributing to team goals. Building group and individual feedback loops into activities lets children know how they are doing and provides motivation for all levels of ability.&#xa0;The role of the teacher, coach or mentor is fundamental to creating positive early experiences of sport and physical activity for children. It is vital that we recognize the value of the coach within schools and that a coach or teacher delivering physical activity should be well trained and celebrated. Coaches must be trained to deliver age-appropriate physical activity options, adapted to children`s developmental age rather than chronological age. Currently, physical education teachers aren’t valued and coaches often don’t fare much better, except at the very highest level. This is counterintuitive considering the importance of ensuring that children receive top quality, fun and positive experiences of sport and physical activity.  &#xa0;The Designed to Move framework has developed seven design filters which should be considered when creating an environment for positive experiences of sport . These include universal access, ensuring that the activity is age appropriate, dosage and duration of the activity, ensuring that the activity is fun, providing incentives and motivation, positive feedback and positive role models and instructors.&#xa0;Interest in sport during their teenage years is an important societal concern, but in a world with limited resource the evidence shows that to genuinely break the cycle of physical inactivity we need to focus on the first 10 years of life. &#xa0;We recognize that there is a need for greater coordination between schools, voluntary organisations, sports clubs and private enterprise. As a society we need to create environments and communities which actively encourage the whole community to integrate physical activity back into our daily lives. This is the fundamental call to action in ASK 2 of Designed to Move.                Furthermore, our research has shown that children under ten are the game-changer for encouraging increased physical activity at all later age groups and segments of society. Current policy does not prioritise this age group.&#xa0;Quoting the 2012 Move It report:&#xa0;In January 2012, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) launched Sport England’s new strategy, ‘Creating a sporting habit for life: A new youth sport strategy’. This outlined a number of important changes to sports policy, including a focus on young people (14 to 25-year-olds), a transitions programme to sustain participation into adulthood, a performance regime for the National Governing Bodies (who have failed to significantly increase participation rates) and increased funding to open up existing facilities, such as secondary schools, for community use.&#xa0;The new emphasis on young people is encouraging, but we believe that the strategy fails to address some of the core structural and policy problems. The philosophy of sports policy remains embedded in supporting elite and competitive sports.&#xa0;Physical activity levels have typically been observed to drop when people are at particular transition points in life, such as puberty . Research shows that by the age of 15, European children are 50% less active than they were at the age of 9. Children performing sports during secondary school is associated with a 7-8% increase in income every year of a person`s life, along with 15% greater chance of attending college or university. A critical intervention at a young age, in line with ASK #1 of the Designed to Move Framework, could help to reverse these statistics and enable children to remain physically active. We believe that these early positive experiences are essential to breaking the negative cycle of inactivity. Central factors for such positive experiences are great teachers and role models, well-designed activity programs adapted to the age level, positive feedback and universal access.&#xa0;Parents and caregivers are the most influential advocates and cheerleaders for children. It is therefore important to communicate the benefits of physical activity to these groups. However, when children become teenagers, influence will shift from parents to friends and piers. Programmes therefore need to be designed to reflect this shift and focus and invest in diverse role models, from everyday relations to well-known athletes. In addition, we need to re cognize and enforce the importance of older teenagers as role models and the potential power of their mentoring influence on younger children.&#xa0;Best Practice suggests that physical activity programs are age-appropriate. Children between the ages of 13-16 should be participating in integrated group activities by building values and societal lessons and be offered opportunities for leadership and a variety of sporting roles.

[[[Nike and “Designed to move”:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]NIKE, Inc., based near Beaverton,&#xa0;Oregon, is the world’s leading designer, marketer and distributor of authentic athletic footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories for a wide variety of&#xa0;sports and fitness activities. Nike was founded on the power of sport and its&#xa0;ability to unleash human potential. We believe if you have a body, you’re an athlete. Today, however, the physical inactivity epidemic presents a serious&#xa0;threat to our individual and collective potential. The intent of Designed to&#xa0;Move is to help create a world in which future generations run, jump, and kick their way to their greatest potential. To realize this vision, we must do two&#xa0;things: create early positive experiences for children, and integrate physical&#xa0;activity into everyday life. At Nike, we are committed to creating a healthier future by thinking differently and working together to drive forward using&#xa0;Designed to Move as the roadmap.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Chaaban, J.
