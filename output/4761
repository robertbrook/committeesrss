default During the 2010 General Election my colleagues and I conducted an experiment that has important implications for the broadcasting of televised election debates. This research was published in the open access journal

default2. Our experiment concerned the so-called “worm” – the squiggly line that often accompanies televised election debates. This line is supposed to represent the views of undecided voters, moving up when a candidate says something the voters endorse, and down when a candidate says something they don't like. The worm was a prominent feature of ITV's coverage of the Leaders’ Debates during the last UK election; similar devices were used by the BBC and the Guardian. The worm is not unique to the UK – it has attracted considerable controversy in Australia and New Zealand, with some candidates arguing that the worm had been “rigged” to be biased against them. Even without any deliberate bias it's very unlikely that the worm provides an accurate indication of the views of undecided voters, given that it is based on such a small sample (20 people in the case of ITV's worm and a mere 12 voters in the case of the BBC worm).

default3. We
default asked 150 people to watch the live broadcast of the final General Election debate in 2010 – a version that included the worm – and then answer a few questions. Unbeknownst to the participants, the worm that they saw was not based on a panel of undecided voters – it was manipulated by us. One group saw a worm that was biased in favour of Gordon Brown, while for another group it favoured Nick Clegg. Although the debate was identical in all other respects, the two groups had completely different ideas about who had won the debate. The group that saw a worm which favoured Gordon Brown thought that he had won the debate, whereas the group that saw the worm which favoured Nick Clegg overwhelmingly thought that he was the winner.

default More worryingly, we saw a similar effect when we asked people about their choice of preferred Prime Minister.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf people had been voting immediately after this debate, it seems likely that our manipulation could have had a significant effect on how they voted.

default4. On the basis of our findings we argue that there is a strong case against broadcasting the average responses of a small sample of undecided voters simultaneously with the General Election debates. Millions of voters who watch such broadcasts will be exposed to social influence processes that we know can be very powerful. If the final election result is very close it will be difficult to rule out the possibility that the outcome has been affected by the views of an unrepresentative sample. The public interest would be well served by ensuring that the arrangements governing the broadcast of the debates prohibit the simultaneous broadcast of the worm.
