defaultINTRODUCTIONdefault&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultThis Memorandum has been prepared by the Wales Office to assist the Welsh Affairs Select Committee in the examination of delegated powers in the draft Wales Bill. It identifies the provisions of the draft Bill that confer powers to make delegated legislation. It explains in each case why the power has been taken and the nature of, and reason for, the procedure selected.
default&#xa0;
defaultPURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE BILLdefault&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultThe draft Wales Bill makes provision in relation to the electoral arrangements of the National Assembly for Wales (“the Assembly”); the devolution of tax and borrowing powers to the Assembly and the Welsh Ministers; and miscellaneous other provisions in relation to the Assembly and the Welsh Government. The delegated powers contained in the draft Bill relate to the devolution of tax and borrowing powers in Part 2 (Finance) and related orders in Part 4 (General).
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultPart 2 of the draft Bill implements many of the recommendations made by the Commission on Devolution in 
defaultWales
default (the Silk Commission) in its Part 1 report
default on fiscal devolution to 
defaultWales
default. The coalition’s programme for government committed to establish a process for the Assembly similar to the Calman Commission (in 
defaultScotland
default), depending on the outcome of the referendum on Assembly powers (which took place in March 2011). The Government established the Silk Commission in October 2011, with a two-part remit firstly to recommend a package of fiscal powers to devolve to the Assembly to improve its financial accountability and which are consistent with the United Kingdom’s fiscal objectives, and then to recommend modifications to the current boundary of the Welsh devolution settlement to enable Parliament and the Assembly to better serve the people of Wales.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultThe Commission published its Part I report in November 2012, recommending a package of tax and borrowing powers to devolve to 
defaultWales
default. The Government responded in November 2013 accepting, in whole or in part, all but one of the thirty-one recommendations for which it was responsible. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultPart 2 of the draft Bill implements those recommendations requiring primary legislation. In outline, it amends the Government of Wales Act 2006 (“GOWA 2006”) to devolve stamp duty land tax and landfill tax to the Assembly; provide for new devolved taxes with the agreement of the Government; provide for a new Welsh rate of income tax, subject to an affirmative vote in a referendum triggered by an Assembly vote; and provide for new borrowing powers for the Welsh Ministers in relation to current and capital expenditure.

default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultClause 6 introduces a new Part 4A into GOWA 2006. Section 116B(1) of that Part provides for Her Majesty by Order in Council to amend the Part to specify a tax as an additional devolved tax and make any necessary modifications of the provisions relating to devolved taxes that She considers appropriate.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultSection 116B(2) provides any modifications as Her Majesty considers appropriate may be made to any enactment or instrument in connection with an Order made under section 116B(1).
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultThese powers mirror existing powers in section 109 of GOWA 2006, which permit Her Majesty by Order in Council to amend Schedule 7 (Acts of the Assembly) to that Act. Devolved taxes are to be specified in new Part 4A of GOWA 2006, rather than in Schedule 7, and so it is necessary to introduce new, specific powers to specify a tax as a devolved tax.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultSection 116B(3) provides that no recommendation is to be made to Her Majesty in Council to make an Order under this section unless it has been approved by both Houses of Parliament and by the National Assembly for Wales. This is considered to be an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny for an order that specifies a tax as an additional devolved tax, and ensures that a tax can become a devolved tax only with the agreement of the Assembly and both Houses of Parliament. The procedure is the same as is already used for Orders under section 109 of GOWA 2006 to amend the Assembly’s legislative competence.

defaultPAYE), to be laid before the House of Commons 
default              
defaultonly.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultClause 8 inserts Chapter 2 (income tax) into new Part 4A of GOWA 2006 enabling the Assembly, subject to a referendum, by resolution to set the Welsh rate for the purpose of calculating the rates of income tax to be paid by Welsh taxpayers (a “Welsh rate resolution”). 
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultNew section 116G permits the Treasury, by order, to modify enactments to take account of the Assembly’s power to set a Welsh rate. In particular, such an order may exclude the effect of a Welsh rate resolution in relation to certain enactments, modify any enactment and postpone temporarily the effect of a resolution in relation to the operation of PAYE. The procedures applicable to orders under this clause are modelled on those provided for in the Scotland Act 1998 in relation to the Scottish rate.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultSubsection (1) of new section 116G provides that a Treasury order may disapply subsections (2A), (2B) and (2D) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the basic rate, higher rate and additional rate at which income tax is charged), or may modify their effect, in relation to any enactment. Subsection (2) permits the Treasury, by order, to modify any enactment in connection with an order made under subsection (1), or in connection with the Assembly’s power to make a Welsh rate resolution.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultSeveral tax reliefs are calculated by reference to gross income before deduction of income tax. The introduction of a Welsh rate would raise questions about the rate which should be used in the calculation of reliefs and of income from which tax is deducted at source. The Government would need to consider this with relevant stakeholders, if and when an affirmative vote in a referendum occurs, before coming to a final view on the treatment of such reliefs. It is considered that it is appropriate for such matters to be dealt with by secondary legislation once such discussion takes place, particularly given that it is not yet known if or when a referendum will be held on commencing the income tax provisions.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultFollowing an affirmative vote in a referendum, detailed and technical consequential amendments would be required to tax legislation as a result of the introduction of the Welsh rate. It would be inappropriate to set out all such details in primary legislation. In particular, there would likely be a long period between the enactment of the Bill, the holding of any referendum on income tax powers and, in the event of a yes vote, the date when the Assembly exercises its new Welsh rate setting power for the first time. Wide powers to make consequential amendments are needed in order to make necessary consequential amendments to existing legislation and to “future proof” the powers set out in the draft Bill. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultSubsection (3) provides that an Order made under subsection (2) may, in particular, postpone temporarily the effect of a Welsh rate resolution in relation to the operation of PAYE.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultA fundamental part of the PAYE system is the use of tax tables by employers to calculate how much is to be deducted from their employees. If the Assembly either did not pass a resolution until shortly before the start of the tax year, or were to replace one resolution with another at a late stage, there may be practical difficulties for HMRC, payroll operators and others in making the necessary changes to their systems before the start of the tax year. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultSimilar problems may arise if the UK Government were not to make a decision in relation to the main rates of income tax, or to any relevant allowances, until shortly before the start of the tax year. Where such a problem arises in relation to the main rates of income tax, the relevant Finance Act will normally contain a provision to deal with the impact on the PAYE system. This power will allow similar provision to be made in relation to a Welsh rate.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultSubsection (4) provides that an order under subsection (2) may, to the extent that the Treasury consider it to be appropriate, take effect retrospectively from the beginning of the tax year in which the order is made.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultIt is not uncommon for a Finance Act to receive Royal Assent after the start of a tax year to which it applies, and for provisions made under such an Act to be given retrospective effect from the start of that tax year. This power would allow the Treasury to make the necessary consequential amendments required as a result of such a provision.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultOrders made under subsection (2) are subject to the draft affirmative procedure in the House of Commons, in accordance with the convention that tax matters are dealt with only by the House of Commons. It is considered that the draft affirmative procedure is appropriate to allow the House of Commons to scrutinise the impact of the Welsh rate on the wider income tax system.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
defaultOrders which make provision only in relation to subsection (3) - i.e. postponing the effect of a Welsh rate resolution in relation to PAYE - are subject to the negative resolution procedure in the House of Commons. It is considered that the negative procedure is appropriate given the technical nature of any such change.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultThese procedures are the same as those applicable to the similar order making powers relating to the Scottish rate resolution.

defaultClause 10 permits Her Majesty by Order in Council to cause a referendum to be held in 
defaultWales
default about whether the income tax provisions in Chapter 2 of new Part 4A of GOWA 2006 (inserted by clause 8) should come into force. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default              
defaultSubsection 10(4) provides that no recommendation is to be made to Her Majesty in Council to make an Order under this section unless it has been approved by both Houses of Parliament and by the National Assembly for Wales. Subsection 10(5) further stipulates that the Assembly must approve the Order by no less than two-thirds of the total number of Assembly seats (i.e. no fewer than 40 Assembly Members voting in favour). 
default&#xa0;
default25.
default              
defaultThis Order in Council procedure is considered to be an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny for an order that provides for a referendum to take place on whether the income tax provisions come into force, and ensures that a referendum can only take place with the support of the majority of Assembly Members. This is the same procedure as provided for in section 103 of GOWA 2006 in relation to a referendum about commencement of the Assembly Act provisions in the 2006 Act. The section 103 procedure was used successfully to bring about a referendum in March 2011, which resulted in the Assembly gaining legislative competence in all twenty areas devolved to

defaultThe income tax provisions are those contained in clauses 8 and 9. Clause 8 inserts a new Chapter 2 into new Part 4A of GOWA 2006 to provide that, subject to a referendum (provided for by clause 10) the Assembly may by resolution set a Welsh rate for the purpose of calculating the rates of income tax to be paid by Welsh taxpayers and other related provisions. Clause 9 makes consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968. 
default&#xa0;
default27.
default              
defaultClause 12 provides that, subject to the referendum, the income tax provisions are to come into force in accordance with an order made by the Treasury. Such an order may appoint the day on which the tax provisions are to come into force and appoint a tax year as the first year in which the income tax provisions are to have effect. Different provision may be made for different cases.

defaultClause 14 amends Part 4 of the Finance Act 2003 to disapply stamp duty land tax in respect of land transactions involving land in 
defaultWales
default. Subsection (4) provides that the section has effect in relation to land transactions with an effective date on or after such date as is appointed by the Treasury under this subsection. This is subject to transitional provisions set out in subsections (5) and (6).

defaultOrders made under this clause are not subject to parliamentary procedure, consistent with the usual practice for commencement orders.

default              
defaultStamp duty land tax is disapplied in 
defaultWales
default in connection with clause 13, which inserts Chapter 3 of new Part 4A into GOWA 2006. New section 116J provides that a tax charged on the acquisition of an estate, interest, right or powers in or over land in 
defaultWales
default, or of the benefit of an obligation, restriction, or condition affecting the value of any such estate, interest, right or power, is a devolved tax.
default&#xa0;
default32.
default              
defaultClause 14 comes into force two months after enactment of the Bill and allows the National Assembly for 
defaultWales
default to legislate to implement a devolved tax in place of stamp duty land tax in 
defaultWales
default. Subsection 13(2) provides that the devolved tax may not be charged on a land transaction in 
defaultWales
default unless stamp duty land tax has been disapplied in respect of that transaction. 
default&#xa0;
default33.
default

defaultLandfill tax is disapplied in

default in connection with clause 15, which inserts Chapter 4 of new Part 4A into GOWA 2006. New section 116L provides that a tax charged on disposals to landfill made in 
defaultWales
default is a devolved tax. A disposal is a disposal to landfill if it is a disposal of material as waste and is made by way of landfill. 
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultClause 15 comes into force two months after enactment of the Bill and allows the National Assembly for

defaultClause 17 amends section 121 of GOWA 2006 to provide that the Welsh Ministers may borrow from the 
defaultSecretary of State
default, subject to Treasury controls and limits, to:
default&#xa0;
default              
default(a)
default              
defaultmanage in-year volatility in the Welsh Consolidated Fund;

defaultWelsh rate resolution; and 
default              
default(d)
default              
defaultfund capital expenditure. 
default&#xa0;
default40.
default              
defaultSection 122 of GOWA 2006 prescribes an aggregate borrowing limit of no more than £500 million in respect of (a), (b) and (c) above. Subsection 17(5) allows the 
defaultSecretary of State
default by order, with the consent of the Treasury, to revise this limit upwards or downwards, but not to specify a limit below £500m.
default&#xa0;
default41.
default              
defaultClause 17 also inserts new section 122A into GOWA 2006. New subsection (1) specifies an aggregate limit for Welsh Ministers’ capital borrowing of £500 million, and new subsections (2) and (3) enable the 
defaultSecretary of State
default by order, with the consent of the Treasury, to revise this limit upwards or downwards, but again not to specify a limit below £500m.
default&#xa0;
default42.
default              
defaultOrders under this section are subject to the approval of the House of Commons through the draft affirmative procedure. This is considered to be an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny for an order which varies Welsh Ministers’ borrowing limits.

defaultDraft affirmative procedure in the House of Commons only if SI includes provision modifying any provision of an Act or a Measure or Act of the Assembly, otherwise negative procedure in the House of Commons only.
default&#xa0;
default43.
default              
defaultSubsection 24(1) enables the Treasury, by order, to make such supplementary, incidental or consequential provision as appears appropriate in connection with the provisions of Part 2 of the draft Bill (Finance), and such transitional, transitory or saving provision as appears appropriate in connection with those provisions coming into force.
default  
defaultSubsection (2) enables the Treasury, when exercising its power, to make different provision for different cases or classes of case or for different purposes, or to make provision which applies generally, provision subject to specified exceptions or provision only in relation to specific cases or classes of case. This mirrors the powers conferred by section 157(2) (a) and (b) of GOWA 2006.
default&#xa0;
default44.
default              
defaultSubsection (3
default) provides that an order made under this clause may modify an enactment passed or made before this Act is passed.
default&#xa0;
default45.
default              
defaultSubsection (4
default) provides that when a statutory instrument containing an order made under subsection (1) modifies primary legislation (made in either Parliament or the Assembly), then it is subject to the draft affirmative procedure in the House of C
defaultommons. Otherwise, subsection (5
default) provides for the negative procedure to apply in the House of Commons. 
default&#xa0;
default46.
default              
defaultPowers to make consequential provision are commonly found in primary legislation, and the Scotland Act 2012 contains powers framed in similar terms. The draft Bill already includes consequential amendments (e.g. in Schedule 2) which have been identified as necessary, but additional amendments may need to be made to both parliamentary and Assembly legislation in order to implement the Bill’s financial provisions in full. 
default&#xa0;
default47.
default              
defaultThe power is necessary because it would be impractical to ensure that every consequential amendment is set out on the face of the draft Bill. It also enables provisions to be made for consequential amendments to legislation currently being considered by Parliament, and to legislation made before the income tax provisions come into force (in the event of an affirmative vote in a referendum).
