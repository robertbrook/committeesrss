&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Transition Town Totnes Cycling Group (CYS0136)&#xa0;I am aged 70, have cycled for independence as a child, and for transport, exercise &amp; fun ever since. Recently retired and involved with Transition Town Totnes since the start of what is now a world-wide movement, I started the Cycling Group for fun, and to work on Sustainable Transport for access to the surrounding villages and within the town. http://www.transitiontowntotnes.org/groups/transport/

[[[A walking/cycling programme for local transport]]]i) 

[[[Delivered nationally &amp; implemented locally]]]We are all pedestrians, except for children in push-chairs and the infirm or disabled in mobility scooters. All of us need exactly the same facilities i.e. safe, convenient, direct, healthier, pleasant and well maintained. So the case for walking is the one which should get public support, if it is promoted in all mass media, nationally &amp; locally. (See below:

[[[3. A publicity campaign]]])Because in the UK we have allowed our number of cycling trips to fall to 2% or less of all trips, support nationally for building cycling infrastructure is not likely to be very large. But pedestrians are at the top of the transport hierarchy, in official documents at least, and we are all pedestrians at some time, so pedestrian infrastructure could be the pilot on a tandem with cycling provision behind. The programme must be 

[[[driven]]] nationally because it would require central funding from the DfT, and joint working with other departments such as Health. (See DNCS Section.5, and below: 

[[[Joined up Departments]]])But a walking/cycling programme would have to be 

[[[delivered]]] locally, because each Highway Authority has responsibility for and best knowledge of its own area. Local Authorities were the main means of delivery for the National Cycling Strategy 1996 (See DNCS above Section 4, and especially 7 Weaknesses). It would be important to address these weaknesses in a new strategy, bearing in mind also this evidence (The implementation of walking &amp; cycling policies in British Local Authorities p.15 and Conclusions p.20) of the lack of funding and high level commitment hampering effective delivery.Local delivery can be done successfully (See [2] 1998 Teenage Pregnancy Strategy). The rate of under-18 conceptions in England fell by 13 per cent from the 1998 base line to 2008, and continues to fall. ii)  

[[[Ring-fenced]]]If the funds are not ring-fenced, they are likely to be raided for ‘emergency’ requirements and then not replaced.iii)  

[[[Training]]]We seem to have lost in the last 50 years some of our willingness to walk, and most of our cycling culture too, except in cities like Cambridge.

[[[g]]] is therefore needed. Bikeability is doing well here, but should be more structured, fuller, for all children, and continue into secondary school.But not just for children.Adults, especially those with children of school age, should be strongly encour-aged to take up free training for riding on the road, arranged for times they find convenient. They will then be able to encourage their children’s riding, especially to school, rather than forbidding it as ‘too dangerous’, which often happens now. Basic maintenance &amp; repair could with advantage form part of this training.Equally important is 

[[[training for traffic engineers]]].[3] p.38The overriding objective in Highways Departments during the last 50 years has been provision for motor traffic. The primary criterion for road schemes was then and is still the maximisation of road &amp; junction capacity for motors.For example, minor road T-junctions have often had the entrance and exit corners widened out, i.e. the radius of the curve increased. This gives drivers vision further into or out of the junction. Fine for drivers, for that allows the corner to be taken at higher speed. However, not only is this intimidating for pedestrians, but the width of road they have to cross is increased, often doubled. This is a major worry for the elderly and mothers with young children.Designing major junctions for pedestrian and cyclist safety and convenience seems not yet to be well developed in some Highway Authorities. Neither do DfT rules yet allow some of the designs that are well tried &amp; tested on the continent.Hence the need for trials at the Transport Research Laboratory last summer of  low-level cyclists traffic lights and Dutch layout roundabouts.In November I was asked to County Hall by our senior Traffic Engineer to discuss a drawing for a Dutch layout roundabout that I had prepared as a proposal for a major junction in the town. Our engineer admitted that he personally had not designed a roundabout before, except for a small unimportant one. It would have to be done by consultants. In addition, there was only one of the engineers in the County’s consultants who might have the skill to design this layout, and there was no way of ensuring that this engineer would be entrusted with the job if it was put out to the consultants. (See DNCS Annex A, Section 5. Research and Development. There seems to be little mention of professional development  in this review.) iv)

[[[  Joined up Departments]]]It seems axiomatic that the Departments concerned in Central Government would have to be persuaded to work together on a major programme such as this:The previous Minister for Cycling, Norman Baker, indicated that he was holding discussions with the Dept. of Health and others, but whether there have been agreements on ways of working and lines of communication is not yet clear. Without these agreements joined-up working would seem most unlikely.In Local Government, the most obvious join-up would be with Public Health, as Bristol appears to be doing.[4] [5] Probably most Local Authority Public Health Services recognise the contribution that everyday walking and cycling make to people’s activity levels. But a look at Public Health Strategy documents on the web does not give confidence that many have yet made agreements on ways of working and lines of communication with Highways, as mentioned above. Without these, joined up working with, and contributions from Public Health seem unlikely to be forthcoming.v) 

[[[ Constant checking]]]Checking is like a cyclist going over the various ‘systems’ on their bike, e.g. brakes – brake blocks not worn down? blocks not loose? correctly positioned? cables oiled and no broken strands? levers correctly adjusted?  Responsible cyclists do this constantly.Every link in the programme chain would need to be monitored, from strategic planning through identifying &amp; prioritising schemes with local communities, consulting stakeholders, especially Public Health, identifying funding &amp; negotiating Section 106 contributions from developers, to informing people of what has been achieved.Evaluation of the effectiveness of different parts of the whole programme – infrastructure, training, information on routes, provision of cycle parking etc – are helpful for the dissemination of good practice. But evaluation is challenging, because no single part of the programme on its own will much increase cycling safety or numbers. Lots of training &amp; encouragement without good infrastructure will not persuade the general population to be on a bike next to large lorries or to join a  multi-lane roundabout with many drivers changing lanes at speed.

[[[2. A Champion in each locality]]]Without a Champion embedded in the Highway Authority, the co-ordination of all the different requirements needed to deliver the National Strategy locally is unlikely to work well.Planning &amp; design of infrastructure needs input from the District Councils and Public Health; different departments will need to put in place agreements to work together, set up clear lines of communication and inform all concerned of the new arrangements; good relations with county/city-wide media will have to be fostered; workshops &amp; information roadshows to inform everyone of the benefits to health, the economy, household budgets, wellbeing.This might translate for the Champion to:-And then when the above is beginning to bed down, local cycling campaigns or forums could be asked to monitor the delivery of new schemes and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, so that congratulations &amp; thanks to all concerned can be given, as well as support to improve ways of working where needed. And, of course, more constant checking that no link in the chain has broken.

[[[&amp;]]]

[[[ funded publicity campaign]]]It seems we took in the late ’60s what has proved to be a wrong turning – we promoted the car, and the motor vehicle in general, as ‘the way to go’. The car became the normal way of getting about, and cycling is now seen as ‘odd’. In the words of the authors of the Understanding Walking &amp; Cycling Report, an extensive three year university research project [6]: “The key message that comes from this research is that at present in Britain using the car for short trips in urban areas is convenient, habitual and normal. It is what people expect to do, what most people expect others to do and what many other people who have yet to benefit from car ownership aspire to do. Alternatives to the car – especially cycling and walking – are perceived to take too much effort, need planning and equipment that causes hassle, and may be risky and uncomfortable.

[[[ They also run the risk of being perceived by others as eccentric or odd.]]] These are all powerful reasons for not walking and cycling and for using the car for most short trips in urban areas.”  Policy implications p.17Our cycling numbers up to the ’50s were comparable to those on the continent. We had a well regarded cycle manufacturing industry, cycling to work was normal, cycle touring was a well established recreation. Cycling is not new for the UK, and some of those people have continued riding well into their 80s.

[[[The benefits of good walking]]]

[[[ &amp; cycling facilities ]]]have never before, to my knowledge, been explained via the national media to the general population in a 

[[[sustained Government funded campaign.]]] It will take an imaginative, well funded promotional campaign, as part of a sustained national walking &amp; cycling strategy, to build the nationwide support needed to reach again walking &amp; cycling numbers comparable to those of some of our European neighbours.&#xa0;References[1] Infrastructure and cyclist safety, Transport Research Laboratory Nov. 2011. http://www.trl.co.uk/online_store/reports_publications/trl_reports/cat_road_user_safety/report_infrastructure_and_cyclist_safety.htm (Requires download.
