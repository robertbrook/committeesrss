[[[&#xa0;]]]ABOUT THE AUTHOR: &#xa0;PREVIEW: &#xa0;BACKGROUND:               THE HCPC REFUSED TO INVESTIGATE LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS: &#xa0;5 July 2012: I submitted a properly completed complaint form by email to the HPC’s email address (ftp@hpc-uk.org) for Fitness to Practice cases. The HPC, thence the HCPC, never acknowledged my submission.&#xa0;I have copied below the complaint, unedited, from the complaint form.&#xa0;“Deacon is a registered social worker and nurse who took money from my ex-wife to write a defamatory document (dated 24 February 2008) that accused me of the disgusting crimes of “both spousal and child abuse” and recommended that I should be criminally prosecuted, based on nothing but malicious hearsay and biases, without contacting me or any other witnesses or admitting my ex-wife’s motivations or incredibility. &#xa0;Deacon’s document is not a court document

[[[ ]]]– it is not even marked as confidential. It specifies no intended recipients or destination. She does not address the report to anybody or specify who asked for the report: “I have been asked to write a report on my work with the above child.” She was asked by my ex-wife alone, who paid for it. She attempted (23 March 2008) to admit this report into family court during a dispute about property, but the court ruled it as inadmissible, yet it was used to defame me outside of court. No child was at issue in court. No court ever has requested or admitted this report. Deacon and my ex-wife contacted no criminal authorities. They used this report to slander me and for material gain during a dispute about property.              Deacon’s document is defamation by a self-identified carer exploiting her qualifications as a carer. Deacon’s report began with a list of all her credentials, followed by a description: “I am a qualified psychiatric nurse, a qualified Deacon and a qualified practice teacher in social work.” (This document is attached.)&#xa0;I struggled for two years in family court with my ex-wife raising new false issues like this (the judgment condemned her for tortious interference, breaches of trust, and incredible evidence). After completing family court, I complained about Deacon (Deacon was never an issue in family court), but Deacon interfered with my complaints. &#xa0;In her communications, Deacon contradicted herself and lied about her actions:Her email contains 

[[[lies about supposed attempts to contact me]]]. In her email to me she claimed that she had tried to investigate my side of the story, that she tried to contact me during her investigation but found my “whereabouts unknown”. Yet she contradicts herself in the next sentence when she claimed that she had tried to contact me at my employer. Every one of my employers has maintained a web page in the public domain with my profile and full contact details. She claims to have tried to contact me at Cranfield University around the time that she compiled and signed her report in February 2008, but I was not employed by Cranfield University until April 2008. She claimed that her emails to me on my employer’s email server were returned, but nobody else had any trouble with that server, including my ex-wife, who defamed me to Cranfield in June 2008. If any email had bounced, she could have written to me at my employer’s postal address. In any case, I had other public profiles, most obviously on my own business’ website, with publically-accessible email address and postal address, and a dozen other public profiles, including the Facebook page through which she emailed me successfully in February 2010. She did not contact me in 2008 by any of a dozen available means.”&#xa0;10 July 2012: I submitted my complaint a second time but again HCPC never acknowledged it.&#xa0;12 July 2012: I complained to feedback@hpc-uk.org about the lack of response. Ruth Cooper, PA to the Director of Operations, replied the same day, stating that she had passed it on “to the relevant department.”&#xa0;17 July 2012: I emailed Ruth Cooper again complaining that I had heard nothing from anyone else at HCPC.&#xa0;18 July 2012: Ruth Cooper replied, apologising and again stating that she would contact the relevant department.&#xa0;10 August 2012: email from Amita Malhotra, Case Support Manager, re-allocating my complaint from some undeclared other category of case (MIS23597) to a Fitness to Practice case (FTP24607). I had always made a Fitness to Practice complaint (see 5 July 2012).&#xa0;15 August 2012: email from Joshua Carey (using ftp@hcpc-uk.org) reporting his finding “that it appears that on 11 February 2010 the GSCC emailed you advising that it was not prepared to further investigate your concerns” and “that it is not the responsibility of the Health and Care Professions Council to reinvestigate complaints which were previously raised with the GSCC for which you may not have been happy with the decision.” He asked me to “advise us if you consider that this matter has not previously been investigated by the GSCC.” I did so by email the same day, for which I received no acknowledgement from the HCPC.&#xa0;25 August 2012: I emailed to ftp@hcpc-uk.org, reminding the HCPC that I was awaiting a response.&#xa0;30 August 2012: I emailed to ftp@hcpc-uk.org, asking for a response and warning that I would complain to the Ombudsman if I were to receive no response within 7 days.&#xa0;3 September 2012: I emailed Ruth Cooper, PA to the Director of Operations, warning her of the deadline.&#xa0;4 September 2012: Ruth Cooper emailed to say that she had contacted the FTP department and would contact me again if she heard anything. I heard nothing further from HCPC. &#xa0;THE HCPC IS UNACCOUNTABLE: &#xa0;SUMMARY: &#xa0;RECOMMENDATIONS: &#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
