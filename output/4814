[normal]Submission from the City Growth Commission[bold] (CD0[bold]2[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I 
[normal]note with interest 
[normal]the Communities and Local Government Committee’s
[normal] 
[normal]inquiry into
[normal] 
[normal]f
[normal]iscal devolution to cities and city regions.  
[normal]The City Growth Commission, launched in October 2013, explore
[normal]s
[normal] similar questions. 
[normal]The Commission 
[normal]is an independent and 
[normal]authorit
[normal]ative inquiry into how best to enable our cities to respond to the fiscal and economic challenges of the future
[normal], in the context of a global trend towards growth driven by mid-tier cities
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commission will build on the growing consensus in favour of re
[normal]balancing the economy and dev
[normal]olving more power to our cities
[normal] and
[normal] ask how we can make our cities financially and economically sustainable. It will also ask how growth in other cities can complement London’s economic success and 
[normal]look at 
[normal]the relationship between devolution, reform and growth strategies in London and in our other cities. In particular, the Commission will focus on 
[normal]local 
[normal]labour market
[normal]s, skills and investment
[normal], issue
[normal]s
[normal] of critical importance to the future of our economy. 
[normal]The ul
[normal]timate objective of the Commission is to lay the foundations for a significant shift away from the centre and towards cities, and to show the next Government, of whichever party, why this is needed and how it can be achieved. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]The Secretariat will be hosted by the RSA, which has run several important and influential Commissions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]For example, the 
[normal]2020 Public Services Commission
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]haired by Sir Andrew Fos
[normal]ter
[normal], was influential in shaping the public service reform agenda prior
[normal] to 
[normal]and following – the 2010 election by bringing together 
[normal]a range of 
[normal]perspectives 
[normal]across the political spectrum, academia, 
[normal]and 
[normal]public, private and voluntary sectors.   
[normal]Other examples in
[normal]clude the 
[normal]Academies Commission (
[normal]c
[normal]haired by Christine Gilbert), and
[normal], currently, 
[normal]the Independent Review of the Police Federation
[normal] (
[normal]chaired by Sir David Normington
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]During the course of the Commission’s Inquiry we will publish reports and papers on our findi
[normal]ngs as they emerge.  The first of these will be a scene setter looking at the factors which are driving growth in cities globally, and the challenges and opportunities that thes
[normal]e throw up for British cities. 
[normal]In the Spring
[normal] we will also host some evidence sessions across the country
[normal], after which w
[normal]e anticipate being in a position to discuss some of our emerging findings. If that dovetails with your timescales for oral evidence then I or one of my Commissioner 
[normal]c
[normal]olleagues would
[normal] be pleased to provide evidence 
[normal]at a future hearing of the 
[normal]Communities and Local Government Committee’s inquiry.  
[normal]I look forward to hearing from you in due course.
