defaultester Combined Authority (GMCA)
default has welcomed the Government’s policy to devolve resources, decision-making and functions away from Whitehall and toward the city region.
default This submission
default to the Committee
default highlights in particular:
default1.default              defaultWdefaulthat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level defaultdecision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?default 
default1.1
default              
defaultGreater Manchester established the
default first Combined Authority in t
defaulthe country
default 
defaultin April 2011, reflecting the importa
defaultnce given to governance at the heart of our city region growth strategy, alongside the GMLEP, building on the long-standing
default tradition of effective joint working 
defaultacross local public and private sector partners in the city region. 
default1.2
default              
defaultWe share Government’s 
defaultview that an over-centralised state can act as a barrier to the most effective
default local
default public sector reform and economic growth
default; and w
defaulte 
defaulthave developed
default a compelling case for how devolution
default can
default yield significant benefits
default at both the local and national level
default.
default 
defaultDe
defaultvolution
default to the right level of local government enables effective coordination and prioritisation of spending to be maintained in support of local growth and regeneration objectives. 
defaultMoreo
defaultver, a
defaultt a time when public resources are scarce,
default we believe
default that
default i
defaultt is more important than ever that we allow places with mature governance arrangements and clear strategies to determine their own transport priorities to drive GVA and growth.
default1.

default              
defaultCity region governance in Greater Manchester mirrors the conurbation’s func
defaulttional economic area
default 
defaultthat generates an annual GVA of £48 billion
default and is 
defaulthome to
default a growing population of over 2.7 million people. 
defaultDevolution has enabled decisions and funding considerations in relation to transport to be
default 
defaultmade in a much broader context,
default including strategic planning, future housing and employment site development, 
defaulttown centre regeneration -
default and provides for a fuller understanding of environmental impacts. 
default1.4
default              
defaultThis has enabled
default GMCA and the GM Local Enterprise Partnership 
defaultto secure
default a long 
defaultterm consensus 
defaulton policy direction and spending priorities, as set out in 
defaultthe
default recently revised
default G
defaultreater 
defaultM
defaultanchester
default Strategy, 
defaultStronger Together
default, with a clear focus on growth and value for money. 
defaultCritically
default, through the GVA-led investment criteria that we hav
defaulte developed and adopted locally, we are able to ensure that our investment priorities are consistently focussed on growth in a way that Government department appraisal 
defaultapproaches cannot, with
default this
default being
default particularly so in the case of 
defaultDfT
default’s
default transport apprai
defaultsal methodologies
default.  
default2.default              defaultDo local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local defaulttransport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?default2.1
default              
defaultOur
default city region governance system is supported by t
defaulthe transport expertise developed by Transport for Greater Manchester (
defaultTfGM
default, the renamed GM Passeng
defaulter Transport Executive) providing
default 
defaultpo
defaultlicy support, technical appraisal and the delivery capability required for transport schem
defaultes of all sizes and complexity. 
defaultThis evolving, adaptable 
defaultand
default a
defaultccountable governance structure has 
defaultensured that Greater Manchester is well placed to
default work with Governme
defaultnt’s
default new approach to funding major transport schemes
default to maximise local and national policy objectives
default.
default We look forward to developing further aspects of devolution through the new Growth Deal that we intend to agree with Government in 2014 with a view to pr
defaultogressing reform and 
defaultefficiency across all agencies involved in delivering transport investment and services in Greater Manchester
default.
default  
default 
default2.2
default              
defaultT
defaulthe o
defaultptimum delivery body
default depend
defaults
default on local circumstances
default and requirements
default; 
defaultit is to some extent 
defaulta corollary of the devolutionary process that different arrangements will emerge as appropriate responses for 
defaultdifferent
default geographies and circumstances. 
defaultTherefore, we welcome the Government
default’s
default continued
default policy
default intention, as established under the recent City D
defaulteal policy, to establish local arrangements for devolution that reflect local governance arrangements and local priorities in different parts of the country
default, so that those who are ready to progress with devolution quickly are able to do so
default.
default 
defaultThis is importa
defaultnt in the case of Greater Manchester, where we have strong governance and delivery capacity already in place, thanks to the £2 billion transport investment programme underway here, and are therefore ready to accelerate the rate of devolution to a greater d
defaultegree than will be the case elsewhere. 
default 
default3.default              defaultWhat is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?default 
default&#xa0;
default3
default.1
default              
default              
defaultGreater Manchester maintains a dialogue with neighbouring authorities, 
defaultwith a view to 
defaultaddressing
default connectivity
default barriers that if
default resolved collaboratively can yield benefits for the wider economic area.
default 
defaultThis contemporary form of engagement offers
default significant
default benefits over the previous regional
default model, which attempted to determine
default 
defaultcollaboration
default between local authorities on the basis of artificial boundaries such as the North West. In the absence of these structural constraints, Greater Manchester has established new cross-boundary working, with South and West Yorkshire for example,
default that better reflect economic interdependencies and opportunities to secure improvements through economies of scale.
default&#xa0;
default3
default.3
default              
defaultWe see further scope for collaboration in the future, particularly if the providers of key motorway and rail infrastructure linking 
defaultGreater Manchester with neighbouring areas are also drawn into close working arrangements with us. However, under current arrangements that limit the funding available to local transport, neighbouring authorities are often constrained in their ability to c
defaultollaborate in direct spending partnerships. Long-term funding deals with authorities would provide greater scope for cross-
defaultboundary spending partnerships.
default4default.default              defaultHow effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national defaulttransport agencies?default              
default4
default.1
default              
defaultIn recent years, northern transport authorities have demonstrated their ability to collectively prioritise and promote 
defaultgenuinely transformative transport schemes that deliver cross-boundary impacts
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultNorthern Hub
default rail investmen
defaultt programme was established as a national investment priority following a concerted effort
default by all northern partners
default 
defaultand Network Rail 
defaultto promote a clear and consistent business case for the expansion of rail capacity to secure regional benefits
default. 
defaultCloser 
defaultworking between 
defaultTfGM
default, Greater Manchester highway authorities
default and the Highways Agency has also begun to bring benefits 
defaultthrough a series of protocols that establish common principles for working across adjacent parts of the strategic and local highway system
default.
default 
defaultFurther effective
default project-based
default joint working 
defaulthas also taken place 
defaultin relation to a number of schemes, such as the construction of the 
defaultOrdsall
default Chord (a key element of the Northern Hub), a complex scheme which involves local highways
default and planning authorit
defaulties, Highways Agency, Network Rail and
default 
defaultTfGM
default.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.2
default              
defaultThis local approach to regular and effective
default working 
defaultis
default increasingly
default mirrored at a
default planning and governance
default level, with regular dialogue 
defaultnow in place
default between 
defaultTfGM
default, the Highways Agency, Network Rail
default and 
defaultDfT
default 
defaultt
defaulthrough a series of officer 
defaultengagement channels
default.  In addition, representatives of Network Rail and other agencies attend meetings of the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee, both to brief members on specific infrastructure developments and to respond
default to service issues.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.3
default              
defaultWe see scope to take these relationships further to ensure consistent alignment
default between local economic priorities and 
defaultinvestment decisions made by national bodies,
default such as Network Rail and the Highways Agency.
default 
defaultWe are keen, for 
defaultexample, to explore the opportunities offered by the forthcoming revised Highways Agency arrangements to align investment activities across the local and strategic highways system in Greater Manchester.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultIn the context of rail
default devolution
default and preparatio
defaultn for HS2
default,
default we 
defaultare proposing 
defaulta 
defaultre
defaultfresh
defaulted
default relationship 
defaultwith
default Network Rail
default to ensure that national investment supports local growth priorities and to promote partnership spending arrangements
default.
default Critically,
default 
defaultHS2 offers a unique opportunity to secure long-term gro
defaultwth and regeneration in Greater Manchester, subject to the right levels of facility being secured at Manchester Piccadilly in particular. This will require long-term partnership funding arrangements with Network Rail that enable optimal scheduling of inves
defaulttment across Control Periods 5, 6 and 7 to ensure that transformational facilities can be delivered to unlock regeneration benefits at the earliest opportunity.
default5default.default              defaultDo the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local defaultauthorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?default&#xa0;
default5
default.1
default              
defaultEffective devolution requires
default a predictable and stable funding regime over the long term
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultlevel of funding available for major local transport schemes
default 
defaulthas 
defaulthistorically
default 
defaultbeen
default significantly
default below 
defaultthat required to meet economic growth potential. 
defaultT
defaulthere remains a substantial funding gap between the large city regions outside London and the capital itself, with Treasury figures showing that the total public spend per head on t
defaultransport in London is 2.3 times greater than the spend per head for the North of England and the West Midlands combined (source: 
defaultpteg
default).
default In addition
default, the process for determining major scheme funding decisions has been constrained by a scheme-by-scheme analy
defaultsis by central government. Collectively, this has undermined the ability of authorities to promote the programmes of infrastructure investment that give wealth creators the confidence to undertake entrepreneurial investment in a local economy, as has been 
defaultseen in London from the Docklands Light Railway onwards. 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.2
default              
defaultL
defaultocally, the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities
default 
defaultsought to address this through 
defaultthe £1.5 billion GM Transport Fund (GMTF)
default in 2009. This
default initiative built on the “self-help” approach to transport infrastructure provision that Greater 
defaultManchester adopted two years’ earlier to unlock a funding package for the £575 million 
defaultMetrolink
default Phase 3(a) programme, more than half of which

default              
defaultH
defaultence, major scheme transport funding in Greater Manchester is now a complex product of direct (major schemes) and indirect (top-sliced ITB) central government funding alongside local prudential borrowing. 
defaultT
defaulthrough the
default 2012
default City Deal
default, GMCA has agreed the principle of an
default 
default“
defaultEarn Back
default”
default model
default with Government, which
default builds on the self-sufficiency 
defaultapproach to
default delivering infrastructure investment. The model uses a formula to provide a
default long-term
default revenue stream to
default support further long
default-term investment, subject to
default additional GVA, 
defaultmeasured i
defaultn changes in rateable values
default at the Greater Manchester level,
default being
default created relative to a 2015 baseline. Earn Back, therefore, provides
default both a future revenue stream and
default an additional incentive for Grea
defaultter Manchester to prioritise local government spending to maximise GVA growth.
default 
defaultMore recently, a number of other city regions have indicated their intention to develop self-reliance models as part of moves towards revised governance, demonstrating the impor
defaulttance of this approach. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultHowever, these new approaches will require consistent long-term commitment from all transport funding partners if their impact is to be sustained over the long-term. For example, through the forthcoming Local Growth Fund arran
defaultgement, Greater Manchester has been allocated a core provision of £110 million from 2015/16 to 2020/21, extending to £199 million by 2024/25. Whilst it is welcome to see Government establishing longer-term core allocations of major sche
defaultme funding, the scal
defaulte of funding should be viewed alongside spending priorities for the city region. 
default 
defaultFor the period to the end of the current decade alone, the Greater Manchester LTB has identified a minimum investment pip
defaulteline of more than £300 million
default schemes,
default 
defaultalongside the £350 million 
defaultMetrolink
default extension to Trafford Park 
defaultto support
default growth in the country’s largest industrial park, which is also home to the Trafford Centre and adjacent to the nationally important M60/M62 motorway. Beyond this, 
defaultGMCA has
default set out t
defaulthe case for a major programme of tram-train developments, combining the country’s largest tram system with one of the fastest growing urban rail markets to enable growth to be sustained into the 2020s
default, alongside the delivery of transformational HS2 facilit
defaulties discussed at 4.4 above
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.6
default              
defaultT
defaulthe Committee is
default also
default encouraged to not overlook the importance of
default ITB
default funding, which enables
default local 
defaulttransport authorities to directly deliver smaller investment schemes, such as
default local access
default and highways pinch-point
default measures
default, 
defaultand acts as a long-term
default funding source to
default secure optimal larger solutions that could not be supported through development contributions alone
default. 
defaultSince the CSR in 2010, ITB funding has reduced by 
defaultaround 50% compared to levels
default under the LTP2 period 
defaultto 
default2010/11
default. 
defaultWe welcome the fact that ITB has been maintained as a p
defaultolicy for 2015/16 onwards, 
defaultbut note
default that the £458 million per annum to be made available for ITB nationally
default will still be around 30% lower than the national provision in 2010/11. 
defaultIn additio
defaultn
default, we have concerns about the likely 
defaultallocation arrangements for
default the
default £258 million
default of ITB following r
defaultecent consultation o
defaultn future
default allocation
default 
defaultformula
default options
default, 
defaultwhich suggested 
defaulta 
defaultshift in funding away from the m
defaultetropolitan areas
default.
default&#xa0;
default5
default.7
default              
defaultThe reduction in ITB has been 
defaultin part offset by 
defaulta wide range of
default 
defaultDfT
default funding competitions. 
defaultHowever, this approach to funding 
defaultruns the risk of undermining Government’s devolution intentions
default. In addition, the short-term natu
defaultre of funding competitions
default present
defaults
default challenges for local transport authorities in planning for the long-term and
default in encouraging
default long-term private
default sector commitments to local investment
default or regeneration initiatives. 
defaultFurthermore, 
defaultsignifica
defaultnt staff resources are required to put together competi
defaulttive bids
default. In Greater Manchester, officers have addressed this challenge by taking 
defaulta
default city region-wide approach to bids, coord
defaultinated by 
defaultTfGM
default. However, this has proved
default increasingly challenging for local authorities elsewhere
default and risks doing so here too in th
defaulte context of further reductions in local authority funding
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.8
default              
defaultFinally,
default we would highlight 
defaultthe 
defaultwider
default implications of further reductions in the local authority revenue support grant, 
defaultfollowing
default the
default recent Spending Round
default. 
defaultConsistent a
defaultccess to revenue funds 
defaultfor 
defaulton-going travel services and promotion measures
default, which
default 
defaultare 
defaultessential in sustaining modal shift amongst commuters,
default 
defaulthas been a long-standing 
defaultissue
default.
default R
defaulteduced local authority revenues have already brought reductions in local supported
default bus services and other travel support measures in many areas of the country
default;
default and
default they
default are likely to place increasing downward pressure on budgets for transport services in the major city regions outside London. The element of revenue funding provided thro
defaultugh the Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) has been a welcome change in this regard, 
defaultalbeit that LSTF is still time-limited in nature even after t
defaulthe recent commitment to its extension
default for 2015/16. The recent national LSTF conference highlighted the ch
defaultallenges that this will bring beyond 2015/16 for authorities in sustaining support for local carbon and active travel measures. 
default6default.default              defaultWhat impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growthdefault Fund have?default6
default.1
default              
defaultAs already set out above, Greater Manchester is well-prepared for the further devolution and changes to transport spending governance that the LGF will bring.
default Our governance arrangements remain the subject of on-going review, and we 
defaultwelcome
default the opportunity through a future Growth Deal to establish local arrangements across the entire Greater Manchester investment framework, which 
defaultmay remove the need for an explicit LTB. 
default We will
default also be 
defaultbe
default looking to utilise this
default opportunity to secure furthe
defaultr parallel reforms that ensure that the impact of LGF funds can be best maximised through clear long-term partnership and programme based investment frameworks across all local transport agencies operating in the city region. 
default7default.default              defaultHow can local authorities defaultattract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?default7
default.1
default              
defaultAs set out under question 5
default above, a core long-term central governmen
defaultt funding commitment to local transport funding is a key component in attracting private sector funding. As also set out earlier, the Greater Manchester authorities recognise that not all of this funding can be accessed through traditional major schemes fu
defaultnding channels, but rather requires all parts of the public sector to align spending programmes in the interests of consistency. This could potentially include greater use of European Structural Investment Funds
default if UK Government can be persuaded of the cas
defaulte to press for greater deployment of EU SI Funds to support transport schemes that unlock real low carbon economic opportunity.
default 
default7
default.2
default              
defaultIt also requires innovative thinking on the relationship between transport spending and future ret
defaulturns to the Treasury as 
defaultshown in principle by the
default Earn Back model and in the current example of the funding agreement established for the transport infrastructure needed to support the Battersea/Nine Elms development in London. Looking towards the delivery of HS2 facilities, such
default as the proposed stations in Manchester, we see a need to develop this innovative approach to finance further
default, alongside the need for a long-term rail funding regime discussed 
defaultabove,
default so as to ensure that transport facilities are delivered at a scale and pa
defaultce that ensures the wider economic impact of transport investment – in the form of new local employment and regeneration – is fully realised in practice.
default8default.default              defaultHow clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?default8
default.1
default              
defaultA
defaults set out above, 
defaultG
defaultreater Manchester has established clear lines of accountability and a robust governance framework 
defaultfor transport expenditure decision making
default. However, there remains some uncertainty over the specific role that 
defaultDfT
default will play in supporting 
defaultdevolved delivery of transport investment from April 2015. We would welcome clarity on this at the earliest opportunity
default, so as
default to ensure that systems can be best develop
defaulted to support shared objectives.
