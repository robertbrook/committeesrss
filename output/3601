defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default All three of you are very welcome. Before I engage with the witnesses, I want to make a few points. The Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Does anybody have a relevant interest? We always seem to skirt over this one. I take it 
defaultthat 
defaultthey have not. The session is on record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct and this will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. For the record, would each of the witnesses begin by stating their names and official titles?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: My name is Sue Maguire. I am a professorial fellow at the Centre for Education and Industry at the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultWarwick
default.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: My name is Martyn Sloman. I am a visiting professor at 
defaultKingston
default 
defaultUniversity
default and an extraordinary professor 
defaultat 
defaultNorth-West University
default, 
defaultSouth Africa
default.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: My name is Paul Copeland and I am lecturer of public policy at Queen Mary in 
defaultLondon
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much. Does anybody want to make an opening statement before we go into the questions? Lord Brooke, you have the first question.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Welcome. Good afternoon and thank you for the written evidence that we have had, which is interesting. One of the problems that I have in trying to get to the heart of this issue is the terminology in the field of unemployment, which to an outsider can be somewhat ambiguous. What do you think is meant by youth unemployment as opposed to worklessness and the other category of NEET that is increasingly used throughout the whole of Europe as well as the 
defaultUK
default? For example, if a young person has left school with no job and is then put by a government programme on to a short-term training scheme, where do they crop up in these figures? What are the real figures and how do we get a better understanding about the real unemployed?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: You have picked up on a very key issue. If we are famous for anything in 
defaultBritain
default, we are famous for defining the term NEET. We created the term and it was created in the late 1990s following concern about the growing number of young people whose destination was unknown. Prior to 1988, all young people in 
defaultEngland
default were eligible for income support or unemployment benefit when they left school. That was terminated in 1988, so 16 to 18
default 
defaultyear-olds were no longer classified as unemployed. The only group of young unemployed that we had were the post-18 group and they were young people who were claiming benefit and actively seeking work. We had this group of young people who were operating under the radar and who had no official connection to any agency. Towards the end of the 1990s there was growing concern about this unknown group and who they were and, more critically, how many there were. Their official status was zero in the unemployment camp because they were not classified as unemployed. So we coined the term NEET
default—
defaultnot in education, employment or training
default—
defaultto get a handle on this population of under-18s who were not participating in education, employment or training. 
defaultThe distinction is very much, in my mind, that the under-18s were NEET and the over-18s were those who could claim benefit and were actively seeking work. Those two definitions have become rather blurred and the NEET definition is used now more widely to incorporate both young people who are actively seeking work, the unemployed, and the non-active group, the NEET group. Within that NEET group, we now have over a million young people in 
defaultEngland
default. 
defaultW
defaulte have these strange definitions and terms, but if we want a classification of just unemployed, they are the young people who are actively seeking work and are claiming benefit. The NEET group are far more difficult to quantify in number and purpose.
defaultThe Chairman:default Just for clarification, the NEET group, as you now describe them, do not get benefit. They could be looking for work, of course.
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: Of course they could, yes. The unemployed are a sub-group of the NEET group. We have half a million in 
defaultEngland
default who are unemployed and the rest are classified as inactive. We have “actively seeking” but that is a much more accurate count because they are counted in the unemployment statistics.
defaultThe Chairman:default They are registered in the 
defaultj
defaultobcentres and so on?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: They would be registered in the 
defaultj
defaultobcentres and within the labour force survey. When the labour force survey is conducted, they declare themselves as actively seeking work. The inactive group are far more difficult and the problem of quantifying them is greatest within the 16 to 18 group because they have no natural entitlement to income support until the age of 18.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Do you think it is important from society’s viewpoint that we should find some mechanism whereby we can stick with them and know of their existence, where they are, what they are doing? Has anybody done any academic work to try to follow a cohort of them for a number of years to assess their cost to society or to themselves in terms of health, perhaps criminality or other areas of social problems that might arise from being in that category? I 
defaultdo not wish
default to blame anybody in any sense, because a lot of people have problems that lead to the difficulties they encounter, but I wonder whether we follow through what the true cost is when we start talking about them not having anything at all from the state when in fact they are costing the state a lot.
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: The figures for the unknown group were very small
default,
default but over the last couple of years they are rocketing because the infrastructure has been withdrawn to map the NEET population. So we have a growing problem with the unknown group and who they are or what they are. We cannot assume that they are NEET
default,
default but we do not actually know who they are. 
defaultS
defaultome work 
defaultwas 
defaultdone a couple of years ago by the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultYork
default and the 
defaultNational 
defaultAudit Office looking at the cost to society of being NEET, so the costs of being NEET have been quantified.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Do you have any ideas about 
defaultwhether it would 
defaultbe right that we should try to track them, as we could prior to 1988?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I think it is crucial that we track them
default,
default because if we lose young people and they have a destination unknown at the age of 16, we know from the figures that they emerge at the age of 18, having been lost for two years. They turn up at 18 because they can claim benefit and in our eyes they have been left for two years with nothing to do. The problem is far greater to fix if you have left someone for two years, or perhaps longer, than if there is instant intervention at 16 and they are supported and tracked and monitored through the system. We have disturbing numbers of unknown. I have some figures with me that show that the unknown figures since 2010 have doubled or trebled in some areas.
defaultThe Chairman:default Would it be possible for you to send them to us?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I will send the figures to you.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much. Prof
defaultessor Sloman, would you like to 
defaultadd to that?
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Can I defer first to Dr Copeland? I think 
defaultthis 
defaultis a little more 
defaultin 
defaulthis area
default. I will 
defaultthen I come back, if I 
defaultmay
default.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: Here is hoping. Maybe I should mention this definition of worklessness or joblessness. This is an interesting one and is even more recent than the NEET classification. Worklessness is an EU-wide definition
default,
default and within the literature you will see a flipping between worklessness and joblessness
default,
default 
defaultbut 
defaultit actually means the same thing. The definition here is individuals who are working less than 16 hours a week, so these individuals are still employed albeit working part-time or below 16 hours a week. The definition of worklessness or jobless households, for example, very much features in Europe 2020, the EU’s new reform strategy and successor to the 
defaultLisbon
default agenda, which attempts to define poverty as individuals living in jobless households and is supposed to pick up on issues of economic inactivity. 
defaultThe problem with the definition is twofold. One is that individuals are still working, albeit for 16 hours or less a week, and the second is that the definition itself picks up all economically inactive people, such as those on disability benefits and pensioners. There is a real problem with using a worklessness or joblessness definition to look at the youth unemployment problem. It does not give you an accurate picture of what is really happening out there.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Could I make some general comments first, my Lord Chair? I was very pleased to be invited here
default,
default but perhaps I should position myself. I am basically a training manager in organisations. That is what I have come through. I have held director roles as head of training in organisations, so I have looked at this problem from a slightly different perspective 
defaultfrom
default the definitions. I would make two very general observations and point you in the direction of something. 
defaultFirst of all, this is about the most confused area 
defaultfor 
defaultvocabulary that it is possible to look at. The definitions of categories
default 
defaultseem to vary. Y
defaultou cannot tie them down, and there are multiple schemes and acronyms, all with strange-sounding names. My view is that you have to define the problem before you can comment on the solution. The challenge facing us is
default whether 
defaultthe problem 
defaultis 
defaultone of youth inactivity, a problem of a lost generation, or a problem of a lack of skills for the future through training
default.
default Those are quite different problems
default,
default but we need to determine which of those we want. With the metrics reporting and definition, it is more important to start with the problem than 
defaultto 
defaulttry to drill down through definitions. 
defaultSomething that attracted my attention when I was looking at this problem was a Local Government Association report called 
defaultHidden Talents
default. 
defaultT
defaulthat argued, very powerfully, for a scorecard for local areas, if you could agree a scorecard, because you have three 
defaultgovernment departments
default, Education, Business, Innovation and Skills
default,
default and DWP, each producing different figures and definitions and each focusing on different areas. I fear that is not an answer to your question but I hope it is an observation that might help the Committee.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Cotter:default You have spoken about skills
default,
default and this is something that is raised time and time again when people come to Parliament
default—
defaultthe lack of engineers and the lack of having anticipated this years back
default—
defaultand it can be very much applied to youngsters who perhaps need to roll their sleeves up and do things.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: We have a very important dialogue going on in this country about the skills of young people at present
default,
default and it is very hard to disentangle it. Again, I do not know 
defaultwhether
default this helps the Committee or not. I live in 
defaultNorfolk
default, and 
defaultNorwich
default is the nearest place. We have a very serious structural problem there, and it is not untypical. In the 1930s, 30% of girls and 25% of boys went into the boot and shoe industries in 
defaultNorwich
default, so you could talk about the skills of boots and shoes. That has totally disappeared. Last week in the 
defaultEastern Daily Press
default, which is our local newspaper, the head of Start-rite—I do not know 
defaultwhether
default you remember Start-rite, the children’s shoes that used to be made in Norwich—
defaultsaid that
default he would like to bring it back to Norfolk if he could but at present they are mainly manufacturing in Portugal and Italy, I think from memory, or it might be Portugal and Spain. Are we going to invest in boot and shoe skills in 
defaultNorwich
default in the hope that something happens? The answer, of course, is no. 
defaultW
defaulte need to get our young people into work as quickly as possible because it is work that produces the skills. People learn skills from work. I can expand on this by all means. What we have at present in 
defaultNorfolk
default, which is occupying a lot of my time, is a totally bogus propaganda campaign without any substance, 
defaultNorwich
default for Jobs, which masks the real problem. The real problem is not enough jobs at present in the English economy for young school leavers who are not sure what they want to do, and who does at 16. Does that help?
defaultLord Cotter:default Very much, thank you.
defaultThe Chairman:default I was going to ask you when 
defaultthe issue of
default skills came up, because surely it has been for
default 
defaultever thus, right from the beginning of the 20
defaultth 
defaultcentury. How did people become motor mechanics, because there were no motor cars? The skills had to follow the new inventions. I keep coming back to the point that nowadays we say 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are in the digital age
default and 
defaultIT is supposed to be the great answer to everything, but the IT skills are more talked about than real and there is a huge gap of people 
defaultwho claim to be skilled and those 
defaultwho are truly skilled in IT. I think this is one of those things that people could major on. 
defaultThe
default clerk has just 
defaultasked 
defaultwhat we think are the most helpful statistics to look at when we are considering the whole issue of youth unemployment
default.
default We are being bombarded by statistics from everywhere. Can I ask the three of you not necessarily to give us the answer to that now but to think about it and see if you can help us through this? Maybe it is OECD, maybe it is the British Government, maybe it is a red book or a green book or a yellow book or something, but we really need to know because I think we are in danger of confusing and comparing unlike with like, so to speak. That is just as an aside.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default On that issue—I realise this might come up later on the question about the historical situation—there was a time when with national service all young men went into the 
defaultA
defaultrmy and very often they learnt a skill in that way. Nobody is going to reintroduce national service, I suspect, but perhaps there could be some sort of community service, as in 
defaultSwitzerland
default and other countries, that could fill that sort of gap. Is this being looked at at all?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: There is a national citizenship programme that was launched a couple of years ago that offers young people citizenship training over the summer period.
defaultBaroness Hooper:default That is not a skill.
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: It is just a programme.
defaultThe Chairman:default A social service 
defaultinitiative?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I think there is huge potential. If we think about the numbers of ageing in society and the growing loneliness that is reported, we have all these people who are in need and all these young people with the capacity to give. It does not seem a bridge too far to join them together.
defaultLord Kakkar:default I find this a rather interesting discussion and I just want to be clear. Are we saying that there is no clear definition of this problem at a European level? If that is the case, how can you have reasonable policy and determine 
defaultwhether 
defaultthat policy is being effective if you do not have a clear definition of the problem and are unable to see whether that policy is actually affecting the numbers if they are changed from time to time because the definition changes?
defaultDr Copelanddefault: There is an EU-wide definition of youth unemployment that captures individuals from 15 to 24. An issue is that some countries, even the 
defaultUK
default, will give slightly different age parameters. In the 
defaultUK
default it is 16 to 24, I believe. 
defaultW
defaulthat normally happens 
defaultwith 
defaultEU documentation is that they differentiate between youth unemployment and NEETs, just to show you some of the variation and the problems within those statistics. 
defaultA
defaultt EU level 
defaultI think 
defaultthere is an awareness of these problems that we are talking about
default, b
defaultut in terms of EU policy and how that affects member states, the EU’s role is very much to guide member states to their own solutions, so there is no
default 
defaulttop-down, homogenous way of doing things.
defaultThe Chairman:default I have just been reminded that Professor Maguire could probably give us a quick answer about the best statistics to look for.
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: The statistics that I would look at for the 
defaultUK
default are the ONS statistics. The most recent were published in August. They give our figures for 16 to 24
default year-olds
default. There is a statistical bulletin that is published every three or four months. I can send you the link. They would be the figures that I would use.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much for that, and thank you for reminding me that we should get the answer now.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Fearn:default In your view, what is the
default nature of the current problems 
defaultwith respect to youth unemployment across 
defaultEurope
default? Are the key concerns related to the numbers, who is affected
default,
default and where are they located across 
defaultEurope
default?
defaultDr Copelanddefault: I may overlap between questions 2 and 3 here, so do excuse me
default,
default but I see them as linked. I think it is important to note that youth unemployment is not a recent problem or 
defaulta 
defaultrecent phenomenon. Back in 1994 the European Commission noted that youth unemployment across the EU stood at 20%, so that is quite high. Of course, in the early 1990s we had the recession
default, b
defaultut when you compare the EU to its then main competitors in the early 1990s, the 
defaultUSA
default and 
defaultJapan
default, 
defaultEurope
default has had a long-term youth unemployment problem. If we take the current situation in the 
defaultUK
default where youth unemployment is at approximately 20%, and we look back at the 20-year period, we will see that 10 years prior to 2008 it was still at 10%, so it is still considerably higher than the then level of general unemployment. 
defaultWhy exactly is this the case? I am of the persuasion that that 10%, that kind of drag on unemployment, is a complex problem. It is for numerous variables to explain this situation, so it is not just a case of individuals with poor training skills. There may also be some social issues involved in that problem. 
defaultThe reasons are 
defaultclearly not the same as 
defaultin 
defaultsome other European countries. Our current level of youth unemployment, although it has increased, has not increased as much as other European countries. Our long-term rate of youth unemployment has not been as high as some European countries. When we look across the EU, we see that long term it is the Mediterranean countries that have had a problem here, and we include 
defaultFrance
default within the discussion. These Mediterranean countries have had much higher levels of youth unemployment than the 
defaultUK
default and this is because they have often operated dual labour markets, so younger generations find themselves on contracts that are less generous than older generations. It is much easier to dismiss a young person off these contracts
default,
default so younger generations get made redundant much more easily. They have this dual labour market system. 
defaultWe started from a situation before the crisis where youth unemployment was high already
default,
default and it has increased since 2008, but we think of the problem countries as being those in the 
defaultMediterranean
default because of the downturn. The problem in the 
defaultUK
default is similar in the sense that youth unemployment has sky rocketed because there 
defaultis 
defaulta lack of jobs. We can talk all day about skills, and skills are fundamentally important, but if you train and retrain the 
defaultUK
default’s young and there is no job waiting for them at the end
default, 
defaultthis is just a waste of money. If you look at northern European countries since 2008, the economies of the Scandinavian countries, 
defaultGermany
default and 
defaultAustria
default have boomed and their youth unemployment has fallen. I think that serves as a good indicator of the real problem. We have an issue of skills but we have an issue of a lack of jobs
default,
default so you have to take a much broader and more holistic perspective on the problem.
defaultThe Chairman:default Is there not a mismatch? Not everybody who is unemployed can go into these jobs. There are an awful lot of employers looking for people but they cannot take them because they do not have the skills, so it is the mismatch between what the employers think these people are capable of and whether they are capable of being trained in a period of, say, three or four months.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: I think 
defaultthat 
defaultlong term there is some mismatch
default,
default but I do not agree that there 
defaulthas been 
defaultsuch a mismatch since 2008. In some instances there have been over 100 applications for one single job. That is not a mismatch of skills
default; t
defaulthat is a lack of jobs in the economy.
defaultThe Chairman:default Can I follow that one through? We all know the story about the 5,000 people who applied to Rolls-Royce in 
defaultDerby
default to get apprenticeships. It is not that they could not get jobs elsewhere but they have targeted Rolls-Royce because they know that they are going to get terrific training and great skills. That does not mean that all those 5,000 people are not going to get jobs elsewhere. They have just all focused on Rolls-Royce.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: I still think those numbers are ridiculously high
default:
default 5,000 applications for one job.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is what we have been told.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Apprenticeship
defaults
default 
defaultare
default something I know a 
defaultgreat 
defaultdeal about. That 5,000 is right because it is a very well known, attractive scheme and you would get that. A well
default 
defaultstructured apprenticeship scheme wherever will get eight or nine applicants, and probably more, for every position. One of the things that concerns me, and I want to put this on 
defaultthe 
defaultrecord—I do not know 
defaultwhether 
defaultit is permissible to produce written material afterwards but I would certainly be keen to do so on this point
default—
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, 
defaultplease
default.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: 
defaultWhat concerns me is that w
defaulte are using loose vocabulary to define a problem. On Monday last week the Government announced 
defaulttheir 
defaultnew policies on apprenticeships, or at least half of them, and that word is now losing its meaning. The word “apprentice” no longer means what it is considered to be in popular parlance. My father was an apprentice. He was a coachbuilder apprentice
default for 
defaultfive years. He started off on very limited pay, went through and left with a transferable skill that could be taken anywhere else. 
defaultNow, 
defaultthe term “apprenticeship” 
defaultis being 
defaultused to describe a job with training in a framework defined by the employer. I used to run the graduate investment banking training scheme for NatWest Markets. I could easily, on that definition, call it an apprenticeship and increase the figures. We are setting a target, 
defaultarbitrarily
default, for the number of apprenticeships, believing that we are solving the problem
default,
default or, bluntly, pretending that we are solving the problem. 
defaultThe most depressing thing is that the announcement last Monday, which was one of the most significant and important announcements in skills training in 
defaultBritain
default, passed without any public debate or any mention in the newspapers. It was not mentioned on the news, it did not feature in the serious papers, and yet 
defaultit 
defaultis the most profound change in our attitude to skills training in 
defaultBritain
default.
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I think there are two causes of youth unemployment. It is either down to structural changes or a labour queue hypothesis. Structural changes to the youth labour market were most dramatic in this country in the late 1980s
default and 
default1990s when the manufacturing sector diminished
default,
default and therefore the traditional youth labour market that existed for school leavers was decimated. That damage to the youth labour market has never been repaired because that infrastructure does not exist. 
defaultA
defaultfter that 
defaultwe went towards 
defaultencouraging increasing numbers of young people to remain in full
default-
defaulttime education as an alternative to finding work. I think we are picking up the consequences of those policies now. 
defaultWe are talking about a broad spectrum of 16 to 24
default year-olds
default, including graduates and young people
default,
default who are leaving learning without basically literacy and numeracy, so we cannot group them all together. They have very specific needs and very different skill levels. I think we have to be quite honest here and say that we have not had a real commitment to placing young people in employment for many years, particularly the younger groups. The focus has been on increasing rates in 
defaultfull-time
default learning
default,
default and it is only when young people have emerged from that and that has coincided with a recession that we are suddenly screaming about youth unemployment. I think we have to be honest and say that that has not been a policy priority in this country and in many other countries, unlike 
defaultGermany
default, which has 
defaultalways sustained a healthy apprenticeship programme that is well supported and as such ha
defaults
default never experienced high levels of youth unemployment since the war.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is very useful indeed and very sobering. 
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default I refer to an earlier point made by Dr Copeland
default. 
defaultI believe you said 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a severe shortage of jobs available. This comes back to the confused mixed messages we are getting within this Select Committee. Mr W
defaultells
default from the Department 
defaultfor
default Business, Innovation and Skills told us something very different last week. He said, “One of the things I should say is that our labour market is sufficiently flexible that there are jobs for everybody in the sense that there is a very dynamic and diverse range. It is actually quite difficult to regard someone as unemployable because the range of jobs in the 
defaultUK
default is quite great
default”.
default How do we square this circle?
defaultDr Copelanddefault: 
defaultIn the 
defaultUK
default we have 
defaultissue 
defaultwith skills, 
defaultand retraining is necessary. I strongly believe, however, that since 2008, if you look at the statistics, there has 
defaultabsolutely 
defaultbeen a shortage of jobs. For example, research published in April 2013 by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was rather critical of the lack of lending for small and medium-sized enterprises since 2008. I wonder 
defaultwhether 
defaultanybody has 
defaultactually 
defaultspoken to anyone between 16 and 24 years-old and asked them about their experiences of employment or trying to get a job, whether they are 18 or after university. I have very first-hand experience of graduates trying to get a job within the sector that I am employed in and I can tell you they face much more difficulty now than they did five years ago. 
defaultIn any kind of analysis of youth unemployment, we can look at the statistics but we also need qualitative accounts of individual experiences, and there is a north-south divide. It is much easier to find a job in the south-east then it is up north. Spend a day in 
defaultManchester
default or Sheffield and you will soon see that the disparities are huge and that if you are a young person in those cities you face much more difficulty than you do in somewhere like 
defaultLondon
default.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Can I add something on that? It is not simply a north-south d
defaultivide. It is also a rural-city
default divide as well. I live in rural 
defaultNorfolk
default. I do not know who your expert witness from the Department 
defaultfor
default Business, Innovation and Skills was but I would very much welcome him to visit north 
defaultNorfolk
default. First of all, young people are now entirely dependent on getting to work by some sort of transport, which is enormously difficult anyway. The key thing for them is passing their driving test and having someone who has the money to give them a car, because there is no transport.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default And pay for the insurance.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: And pay for the insurance, absolutely right. Yes, that is the big thing. In our little market town, there is a computer shop and I have got to know the fine young woman who is working there. She has a 2:1 
defaultdegree 
defaultin criminology and wanted to work with young offenders, and if there is one thing we are not short of it is young offenders. There is plenty of material there for her to work with. She has a record of applying for 20, 30, 40 jobs. Famously she tells the story of applying for one job at Aviva Norwich Union at 6
default o’clock
default one evening and getting an automatic response back at 8 am the following morning from the computer telling her she was not good enough. She has been in touch with the probation service in Norfolk to try to get voluntary work in that area and she says 
defaultthat 
defaultthe problem has been that they are so overwhelmed with young people trying to get job experiences of any sort that the probation service is unable to cope with sorting between people who have some particular interest, a law background or interest in working with young people, and decent young people who are just desperate to get anything on their CV. 
defaultThat is the situation that we are facing
default,
default and I firmly believe that it is a structural issue that is a reflection of the world economy and certain jobs going. It applies throughout the whole of 
defaultEurope
default. It is more acute in places like Greece and Spain, we know that, and it is less acute in the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, we know that, but it is certainly, most disturbingly for us, a problem that is not moving at all in Britain. However you define it
default, 
defaultand I do not have the expertise of my two colleagues
default, the significant thing about 
defaultth
defaulte
default figure 
defaultof 958,000 unemployed which 
defaultSue referred to
default 
defaultis that quarter on quarter it has shifted by 1,000 in 958,000. The 1,000 improvement was entirely in female unemployment. Male unemployment went up in that 16 to 24 category. That is correct, is it not?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: Yes, but there is a hidden issue around that. It looks as though we have a particular problem with male youth unemployment but that is because we have 355,000 young women between the ages of 16 and 24 who are classified as NEET inactive, so they do not actually appear on the unemployment statistics at all, compared to a figure of 130,00
default0
default males. I find it very disturbing that a third of a million young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have been written off already and do not even appear on the unemployment statistics because they are classified as inactive, therefore they are not even picked up by the agencies and are eligible for the 
defaultW
defaultork 
defaultP
defaultrogramme or the youth contract. I find that quite disturbing.
defaultThe Chairman:default It is indeed. A lot of what we have unearthed today seems to be disturbing, but we have to crack on a bit I am afraid.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultI wanted to follow up on that, but we are moving on. 
defaultLooking for help from history, if we can, how does what we face now compare with historical experience, either in boom or bust times? Are there lessons that we ought to be able to learn from either good or bad times? When we are trying to look with our telescopes towards the future, is there anything 
defaultthat 
defaultwe can discern coming up in as a result of experience we have had in the past?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: 
defaultI think it is probably best to look back to 
defaultthe late 1970s
default and 
defaultearly 1980s when the huge structural changes occurred to the youth labour market. The intervention then was the youth training scheme, which we will all remember, probably, for its label of slave labour
default,
default offering young people pittance wages and employers exploiting them for six months
default,
default and things like that. I had the opportunity to look at the evaluation of the youth training scheme a few months ago
default,
default and I think 
defaultthat 
defaultif we had that amount of money and that amount of commitment now we would be rubbing our hands together with glee because it looks like a great programme compared to the opportunities and interventions that are being created for young people currently.
defaultWhat we need to learn from the 1980s experience is that we 
defaulthad 
defaultyoung people who were subject to long-term unemployment and the effects of that on their re-engagement and ability to find a job were long lasting. The idea of a scarring effect was born from that experience. If learn anything 
defaultfrom that 
defaultit would be that we should be intervening sooner rather than later
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthose interventions should be employment training and education, not just one or the other, and that we should stop blaming young people for this problem. It is society’s problem and we should embrace it and not 
defaultblame
default young people because they cannot find jobs. It is impossible for some young people to find jobs.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Could you flesh out very briefly the youth training scheme? You say 
defaultthat 
defaultit was much abused at the time but 
defaultthat 
defaultactually we would love to have it now if we could. What were the key elements in it?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: It was a point I made earlier
default:
default that at that time we were still tuned into the requirement that young people should find work rather than keeping them in learning
default,
default and therefore we understood employers’ needs much more, how they might use young people and in what kind of capacity. We had a much better grip of where young people fitted into the labour market. I am not certain that we would know that now. We know where they go 
defaultto learn
default and we know what qualifications fit together, but I am certainly not convinced that we know where young people fit into the labour market in this country. I think we need some intelligence as a base in order to develop policy from that.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: May I build on that a little? I agree with a lot of what Sue was saying
default,
default but I think 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are in a different situation from the situation historically
default 
defaultbecause of structural changes in employment, particularly as they affect young people, and the sort of skills that people need at work are changing. This is one of the reasons, Lord Wilson, why so many young people who do find first jobs find them in either the retail sector or the hospitality sector where the skills needs are pretty easily recognisable, if I can put it that way without diminishing the high quality of training that go
defaultes
default on. I do not think we are going to find a solution in the current cocktail of policies or the traditional cocktail of policies. 
defaultOne thing is certain now
default:
default we have far too many schemes. A Select Committee of the House of Commons looking at Jobcentre Plus had evidence from an expert witness who said 
defaultthat 
defaultthey had counted 48 separate schemes in the 
defaultUK
default affecting youth unemployment. I 
defaultread
default the minutes today and I can reference it. The Local Government Association has identified 35 separate schemes. I do not think there is going to be a solution 
defaulton 
defaultschemes. I think we need more radical solutions now. 
defaultWe need to understand, and we can, what drives employers’ training. I am quite happy to say a little more about that. I know a little about what determines that decision to train. I 
defaultadvocate 
defaultin fact a change in the Companies Act legislation. I do not think we will solve this problem without requiring companies to accept wider social obligations. That is pretty radical but that is where I am coming from.
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default You have rejected a couple of cocktails. Your cocktail is a sort of single drink, the Companies Act?
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: No, it is not. I have a cocktail of four I can offer you. Very quickly, 
defaultthey are 
defaulta change in the Companies Act, more devolution to local government because of the triple schemes,
default a change to the role of the UK
defaultCES towards honest reporting, and some sort of charter.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Sorry, CES?
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: 
defaultThe 
defaultUK Commission for Employment and Skills, which has become the scheme promoter. I think we need more honest reporting. We need it to have the sort of role that the financial one has, an Office for Budget Responsibilit
defaulty-
defaulttype role. Finally, 
defaultt
defaulth
defaultere should be 
defaulta charter. I will put these in writing.
defaultThe Chairman:default That would be wonderful. I was about to ask you that and I 
defaultwondered whether 
defaultI 
defaulthad 
defaultthe nerve to 
defaultdo so
default.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: That was garbled. I apologise.
defaultThe Chairman:default No, that is really helpful. Lord Wilson, do you have a supplementary
default question
default?
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default I have, but do you want to say anything on the earlier point, Dr Copeland?
defaultDr Copelanddefault: Yes, building on what my two colleagues have said
default. 
defaultI will be brief. Sue was talking about the 1980s, but if we look at the 1990s as well we will see that the trends in statistics show some kind of hangover of youth unemployment that lasts for about eight to 10 years, so it can take a good decade for this to actually come down. 
defaultT
defaulthe interesting thing about earlier peaks in youth unemployment and the current situation is that then we did not have welfare to work, which we do now, which I think has been successful in some respects in getting some individuals back into the labour market. 
defaultThe problem I have when looking at youth unemployment and this idea that it will take about eight to 10 years for youth unemployment to come back down to its pre-recession level is the social consequences of that. We know that when individuals are outside the labour market for a long period, whether they be youth unemployed or general unemployed, they often need much more than something like A
default4e
default to get them back into work. There was discussion in the media last week that they could develop physical or mental health issues that cannot be tackled in the more conventional sense and they often require more social intervention. Thinking about this long term, we need to broaden the way that we look at getting people back into work. 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default May I pick up a point made by Professor Sloman when he said that we have far too many schemes? We are looking at EU action to tackle unemployment and we are talking about far too many schemes in the 
defaultUK
default. If you look around the European Union as a whole, how many does that add up to and how are we finding out what is best practice in relation to what is going on in other countries?
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: As I understand the European youth guarantee and what they call the youth employment initiative, it is meant to be an umbrella commitment with local interpretation. 
defaultT
defaulthat is probably the correct approach there, given the multitude of schemes that exist. As you can see, I am much more of a commentator than an academic, coming from a practitioner background. The problem is that we cannot say, “Would we not like to be like 
defaultGermany
default was 50 years ago today?”
default,
default and build on that. 
defaultGermany
default has achieved what 
defaultit has 
defaultthrough a variety of circumstances and accidents. Other countries have achieved what they have or what they 
defaulthave 
defaultfailed to achieve through a variety of schemes, but I think it comes down to something pretty basic, and this is where the 48 or the 35 schemes confuse. 
defaultThere are three things. You can act on the supply side, which is 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can try to get more young people to have better skills to begin with, and that is a wide gamut
default: i
defaultt is maths and English, very specific skills, communication skills and technology skills. You can act on the demand side 
defaultby 
defaultsubsidising employers in some way or another to create more jobs, and the 
defaultO
defaultpposition 
defaultare 
defaulttalking about using public procurement. 
defaultY
defaultou can do something on job matching, which is trying to ensure that there is a better match between the market, that the careers service works more effectively, that they get more careers advice, 
defaultthat 
defaultyou get businesses going into schools
default,
default and so on, so the market for clearing becomes more efficient. When it comes down to it, those are the three things 
defaultthat 
defaultyou are basically doing
default,
default and you can put 
defaultin 
defaultthe schemes on all that. 
defaultWhere we have suffered is that we insist on overselling whatever the latest scheme
default is
default. They have stopped doing it now but I used to read the Business, Innovation and Skills regular update of the schemes
default,
default and in one month I counted the word “celebration” used
default 38 times: 
default“We have celebrated the success of this scheme, we have celebrated the launch”. We have nothing to celebrate.
defaultThe Chairman:default I think you have made that quite clear. It is a rather confused basket 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are looking at. We have to crack on because we have a lot to get through.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Cotter:default Thank you very much for your robust contributions. They are very welcome. 
defaultThere are f
defaultar too many schemes. What do you think about the evidence from the Government suggesting that the position in the 
defaultUK
default is rather better than the rest of 
defaultEurope
default? Are the Government talking about our actions or the level of unemployment? You are saying a lot about the array of different initiatives. What do you think about this evidence from the Government that we are much better positioned? If so, in what way?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I do not think we should be celebrating the fact that we have 1.09 million young people who are classified as NEET and another percentage who we do not even know where they are. In particular, the latter is very worrying. Yes, we are not as bad as 
defaultGreece
default and 
defaultItaly
default but we have an unacceptable level of youth unemployment and we need some action
default. W
defaulte particularly need to tackle the younger age group, between the ages of 16 and 18, where the cuts in services mean that the entitlement to careers guidance and access to support for those young people who are NEET is of grave concern and hence why we have this growing unknown population. We need early intervention to curb a worrying trend of protracted lengths of youth unemployment. I do not think we have much to celebrate. We have a lot to act on.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: All I would add is that we are mid-table in most of the OECD rankings, which if you are a 
defaultNorwich
default 
defaultCity
default supporter is pretty good going but it is not good news at all. What is worrying is that our situation is deteriorating and the raw figures are not shifting month on month. I keep coming back to that. Whatever we are doing, we are not moving that problem. 
defaultY
defaultouth unemployment now is up there with the care of the elderly or affordable housing in the south-east, which is seen as a critical social problem affecting our development as a society that shows no sign of shifting.
defaultLord Cotter:default I think the overselling of interventions is emerging. I have a strong feeling about the political overselling of things and you seem to be saying the same sort of thing. The youth guarantee scheme has one or two different points and a stable situation. Thank you very much for that. I do not know whether to ask you any more
default,
default but I think you have answered with what you have said up to now that perhaps we are overselling things and we need to be more stable and consider the points you are making.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: We need to get a better information base too about what we are concerned about. Apprenticeships are a good example to take. The number of apprenticeships is going up
default,
default but do apprenticeships mean what they used to mean
default,
default and all those sorts of things. These become propaganda figures if we do not watch it.
defaultThe Chairman:default Dr Copeland, were you about to say something?
defaultDr Copelanddefault: No. For issues of time, I agree with what they—
defaultThe Chairman:default No, come on.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: I would like to reiterate the point 
defaultabout 
defaultthe Government saying that the 
defaultUK
default position is rather better than the rest of 
defaultEurope
default. Youth unemployment in 
defaultGreece
default is 65%, so if you compare the 
defaultUK
default situation of course it is much better but it is certainly not much better than other northern European countries, echoing the point 
defaultmade by 
defaultProfessor Sloman.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default Could you let us know your view on the effectiveness of the actions that have been taken at the EU level so far, such as the youth employment programme and the youth employment initiatives? Are there other ways in which the EU might take more effective action? Before you answer that, could I say 
defaultthat 
defaultI have read Dr Copeland’s very helpful report that you gave us before the meeting and, reading the last paragraph, I think you are 
defaultprobably 
defaultgoing to say something about supporting entrepreneurships.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: In answer to the first part of the question about how effective have actions been so far at EU level, such as the youth employment programme and youth employment initiatives, I think it is too early to tell. These initiatives have only come forward in the last couple of years. I daresay 
defaultthat 
defaultin some member states they have not even been acted upon, so it is still too early to make a judgment on the outcomes of EU activity
default, b
defaultut I reiterate the point that the EU does not give a policy prescription here for what member states do with regard to youth policy. It 
defaultvery much supports
default, whether it be by funding or the sharing of best practice, what is going on in that member state. 
defaultA
defaultny EU initiative is then only as good as what is happening at each member state level and the activity and impetus at each member state level. 
defaultI would say something else about EU activity since 2010. There is an awful of grumbling, particularly in the UK, about how much money the EU wastes—whether that is true or not is of course deb
defaultatable—particularly when we think about funds for the common agricultural policy. Here we
default have an example of the EU ring-
defaultfencing €6 billion to do something to specifically help its vulnerable. I think the EU is doing something absolutely right here and is 
defaultnot wasting money. Again, member states can do with that at local level how they see fit as long it fits within the parameters of what is prescribed. 
defaultAre there other ways in which the EU might take more effective action? This is a tricky one because the EU is constrained in what it can do for EU youth policy. We can come up with all sorts of amazing ideas of what the €6 billion could do, but according to the treaty it can only spend the money on education and training. Articles 50 and 126 of the treaty spe
defaultcify that the EU can play a co-ordinating role for youth and education. With the recent initiatives, the 
defaultC
defaultommission and the EU itself has very much fitted in with that legal framework
default,
default so we struggle when we want to go beyond it. 
defaultOne idea that I thought would fit in with that framework and could complement some of the activities at EU level is building on some of the initiatives that the EU has done in the structural funds with regard to hub activities, specifically focusing on the EU’s young and helping them to set up their own businesses. That is one thing the EU could do and should do more. We have seen that lending to small and medium-sized enterprises has contracted massively. That is where a lot of jobs and growth will come from in the economy
default,
default and there are a considerable number of young people out there who may have ideas and may want to set up their own business
default,
default but the resources are quite limited. You could package that in terms of training and so forth. That is one possibility.
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default Are you saying that that is not currently possible within the remit of what the European Union 
defaultis 
defaultsaying 
defaultit is 
defaulttrying to do with education and training?
defaultDr Copelanddefault: I believe that 
defaultwithin 
defaultthe education and training remit, the recent initiatives of the EU are not doing that to tackle this youth unemployment problem. In the past the structural funds have funded particular regional activities for these hubs, 
defaultwhich are 
defaultusually located close to universities to set up entrepreneurial activities, but I believe 
defaultthat 
defaultit has not targeted it towards the current set of problems.
defaultThe Chairman:default Following on directly from Lord Liverpool
default’s question
default, we have known about this €6 billion up to 2016 and then €8 billion to 2020 for a very long time, at least it seems a very
default long time, but we have had very little information about how 
defaultm
defaultuch of it has been spent, what has been done with it and what the results are.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Can I try to clarify a bit and test my understanding? In preparation for this, I tried to dig a little deeper from my position. As I understand it—and I know you have had evidence from the 
defaultd
defaultepartment—they have to present an implementation plan by Christmas. This is the key thing. They are very helpful at the 
defaultC
defaultommission. They have sent me all the documents on the implementation plan, the templates that you have to put your material in, and it covers a wide variety of headings. I am interested from a professional point of view now 
defaultin 
defaulthow much variance there will be if they publish those implementation plans, different approaches being used across 
defaultEurope
default. It is too early to judge the effectiveness of that. 
defaultIf I can pick up the Earl of Liverpool’s question, one thing I would like to see that could be done at European level—and I defer to my professional colleagues on all this—is some sort of protection for the young employee in charter terms. One of the effects of these famous 48
default,
default 35 or however many schemes is 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is 
defaultplenty of evidence now of small-
defaultscale abuse
default,
default and when there is it is quite serious and disturbing. We have a labour market for young people where employers can take advantage, and there is anecdotal evidence and precise evidence. Let me give you just two
default examples
default. Jobs have been advertised on the Government’s National Apprenticeship Service website at below the minimum wage. This is well documented and I will put it in my evidence. Another employer, whose name you will all recognise, advertised on the National Apprenticeship Service for a 37
default 
defaulthour
default 
defaulta
default 
defaultweek trainee unpaid. I think we are at the stage where generally we ought to be thinking about some sort of charter or protection for young workers.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes. I am sure you are right. Do you feel that the response at 
defaultUK
default level, such as the youth contract and payment by results in the w
defaultelfare to work area, is pointing in the same direction as EU initiatives, as other member states’ initiatives?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I do not think they are, no. The youth guarantee is giving an offer of a job or training place within six months and the €6 billion has to be applauded as a step in the right direction for tackling youth unemployment. Whether that is enough is debatable. I would bring the Committee back to a point I made earlier, which is that you can only give somebody an offer of a job or a tra
defaultining place or an education place if you know they exist, so I think we have to get a handle on the population and be in touch with the whole population in order to implement that policy. In my view, the offer of a job or training is not enough. We have to support and protect young people to make sure that those transitions are sustained, and I think that is where we move on to look at the youth contract in this country. 
defaultI am involved in the evaluation of the youth contract for 16 and 17
default year-olds
default and it is not just about engaging young people
default; it is about 
defaultsupporting their transitions into a successful outcome and for six months beyond that so that they are sustained in that outcome, because we know that particularly among the vulnerable groups within the NEET population there is a high churn, that they are prone to drop out. There will be churn, so we need more than an offer. We need sustained intervention and I think the youth contract and the principles that underpin that have got that right.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default We know that dealing with youth unemployment is a matter for member states, essentially, with 
defaultBrussels
default holding the purse 
defaultstrings, or at least holding substantial reserves of money that might be deployed in this field. Do you think there is any initiative that we can take in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default to encourage 
defaultBrussels
default to circulate to all member states best and successful practice in this field? For example, in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default, to my own practical knowledge, 
defaultwe are 
defaultlooking at success by charities in trying to provide life skills to the 14 to 16
default year-olds
default and then comparing that with whether they become NEETs in due course. I am very attracted to the idea in Germany of employers receiving a state subsidy so long as there is shown 
defaultto be success 
defaultin making sure that the young people employed by companies with state subsidy end up in 
defaultfull-time
default employment. My question is very simple. Do you think that we should be recommending to the UK Government
default, an
defaultd through the UK Government
default to 
defaultBrussels
default,
default to circulate best practice in all nations?
defaultThe Chairman:default I see two nodding heads. Dr Copeland, you are the odd man out.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: The circulation of best practices has long been a banner for EU level activity, whether it be in youth policy
default or elsewhere
default, but we think more about the employment strategy, for example, where the more active labour market policies that we have in place at 
defaultUK
default level came from other European countries. I believe 
defaultthat 
defaultactive labour market policies
default,
default or flexicurity as it was termed
default then
default, originate from 
defaultDenmark
default and 
defaultAustria
default and there was that sharing of best practice at E
defaultU level. My understanding of EU-
defaultlevel activity and the sharing of best practice is that some platforms for this are already in existence. The Europe 2020 youth on the move initiative, for example, has an annual conference that brings together representatives from the different member states, where different cohorts of the EU’s young will talk about their experiences but different charities and organisations go along and share their experiences and best practices. I believe that in 2011 the 
defaultUK
default declined to send representation to the conference in 
defaultPoland
default at the time.
defaultLord Freeman:default Why?
defaultDr Copelanddefault: You would have to ask the Government.
defaultLord Freeman:default You must have some inkling.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: Euroscepticism
default,
default I should imagine. That would be my gut instinct. Since the 
defaultc
defaultoalition Government 
defaulthave 
defaulttaken office, 
defaultthey have 
defaultwithdrawn from some of the softer EU governance processes, whether it be in Europe 2020 and the youth on the move initiative or refusing to set a level of unemployment in the employment strategy of Europe 2020. The reason may be more complex than the one that I suggested
default,
default but there definitely are platforms for the sharing of best practice at EU level
default,
default and our Government ha
defaultve
default been rather reluctant more recently to engage in those platforms.
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: To be fair, I represent
defaulted
default the 
defaultUK
default at a policy exchange in 2011 in 
defaultWroclaw
default in 
defaultPoland
default. It was a ministerial conference about policy exchange
default,
default and I went and talked at EU level about the implementation of the education maintenance allowance so that other countries could learn from that experience. It may be limited but it has existed. Having said that, it was a bit ironic because the EMA had just been withdrawn in 
defaultEngland
default and I had to stand up and say that, but it was about the policy design and its impact
default,
default and other member states were very interested in using financial incentives. 
defaultT
defaulthere is a missing link 
defaultin
default that there does not seem to be any follow-up to see how much progress has been made and whether anyone has moved forward. There was lots of talk about different policies, but I have not heard anything from that meeting in 2011 about whether anyone has taken anything further or implemented it.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: I think there is a separate issue, which is that 
defaultthe Government more recently have
default seemed reluctant to send official representation to these meetings of exchange of best practice, for example.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Can I add something on this question? One of the queries I 
defaulthave is how the Government feel
default about this European youth guarantee. You have had the witnesses, I have not, but from the information I have had I do not get the impression that they are feeling very positive about it. It seems to me that this is quite a well designed platform for sharing good practice, the structure and the way it is implemented. 
defaultI want to make one other small point on the sharing of best practice that has been a concern of mine for some time, having been a training manager. A lot of the implementation is done at the micro level. The policy and the sharing 
defaultare 
defaultat the macro level and it comes down to the training managers and so on. 
defaultW
defaulte have initiative fatigue and permanent attempts to try to get training managers of organisations to come along to the conferences, to attend these launches and so on
default. T
defaulthere is 
defaultalso 
defaultfatigue in the system now when it comes to sharing good practice, and technology is not helping. 
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you really think that this fatigue, as you call it, is actually preventing best practice being taken up
default,
default because there is a lot of it around?
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Yes, I think there is. You are absolutely right. We have got to the situation now where employers are trying to avoid being engaged in many of these initiatives because they have seen so many come and go.
defaultThe Chairman:default They have just had too many of them.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: I do not know 
defaultwhether 
defaultyou are familiar with train to gain. There was a sudden knock on the door on train to gain. There was a knock on the door on the pledge, so you would sign the skills pledge and then that disappeared, 
defaultthen there were 
defaultfoundation degrees, and so it goes on and on. I was a training manager and 
defaultI learnt
default a way of coping with that. Our chief executive would be buttonholed by someone who mattered 
defaultwho
default said, “You must sign up to whatever it is”. He would ask the person down the line to come and see me. It would mean some sort of change that we probably would not want to make anyway and probably would not be acceptable by the time it had gone back up
default. If
default I am bluntly honest, the best I could hope for is that it would be forgotten about. It was quite often as crude as that with the training and enterpri
defaultse councils, the sector skills.
defaultSince I have depressed you, however, there is some very positive good practice out here. You mentioned the charity sector
default, which is 
defaultdoing some outstanding work in this area, 
defaultas
default indeed are various religious bodies in that broad area, the churches of various sorts, 
defaultbut 
defaultsome of our sector skills councils are 
defaultalso 
defaulttaking the agenda forward very capably. I am very impressed with Cogent, which is the sector skills council for the chemicals industries. 
defaultThey are 
defaultdoing various good things, but 
defaultthey have 
defaultbuilt up that relationship of trust over years with the employers, the trade unions and the employees in 
defaulttheir 
defaultsectors, rather than changing the goalposts and the name and suddenly deciding 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have the great revealed truth, “This is what we need to do”.
defaultThe Chairman:default And have another logo.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Let us have another logo, another campaign.
defaultThe Chairman:default Before we leave that, Professor Maguire and Dr Copeland, what do you think about this best practice
default? H
defaultow 
defaultcan 
defaultwe unpick it or at least make it move?
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I would reiterate what I have said. There are meetings. Perhaps we do not have the official representation
default,
default but I think 
defaultthat 
defaultwe should have more follow-up and more action following it. It is all right having a conference to share good practice, but what happens after that? We have a lot of intelligence in this country, for example about the NEET population, its definitions and different segments, and we have a lot to share there across 
defaultEurope
default. I think we have a lot to give
default,
default and that should be actively encouraged.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: We talk about 
defaultthe 
defaultsharing of best practice. We look for short-term immediate results
default,
default but all the research on EU-
defaultlevel sharing of best practice talks of a much longer-term impact. The sharing of best practice does not manifest itself within say six or 12 months. It can take four, five, sometimes even 10 years. If we think how employment policy has changed across the EU over the last 15 years, it changed in different countries at different times, albeit all moving towards the active labour market policies, but that sharing of best practice took longer than a couple of years. I just err on the side of caution that with the sharing of best practice we are not looking for immediate tangible results. We need to think slightly more long term.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Could we get Professor Sloman to give us a list of these things that have worked? I would be terribly keen to see examples of things that actually have been positive.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, that is a good point.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Yes, of course.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Haskel:default We have had quite a lot of discussion about the supply side and the demand side. You have raised it. You have told us about job matching. But most of the discussion has in fact been about what the EU and the Government can do. What 
defaultcan 
defaultemployers do? You have told us about the sector skills councils. I think most of them have been abandoned, mainly due to arguments over poaching, on my experience. Employers have a great interest in this because they are saying that they want to bring back the shoe business to 
defaultNorfolk
default, as you were saying, but they do not have any people to make the shoes. Are they going to get robots instead of humans
default to sew the shoes
default?
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Incidentally, just for the record, it was the industrial training boards that were abolished, not the sector skills councils. The sector skills councils are still very much there and some of them are very effective indeed.
defaultLord Haskel:default That is right, yes. 
defaultI mean
default the sector training boards.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: 
defaultI
defaultncidentally, Lord Haskel, might I say that in the new apprenticeship arrangements White Paper that was published on Monday last week, the sector skills councils were not mentioned at all. It was direct to employers. 
defaultThe answer, of course, is 
defaultthat 
defaultemployers can do an enormous amount. People learn their skills at work. Commu
defaultnication and team-
defaultbuilding skills are learnt at work and people learn their skills through having a decent developmental manager who will point out what is going wrong, assist them and spend a bit of time with them. That sort of thing is resource intensive and any particular training scheme is also resource intensive. The problem we have as far as the employer is concerned is tha
defaultt skills development is a third-
defaultorder decision. The first-
defaultorder decision is what business are you in, so 
defaultthe question is 
defaulthow you compete, how you 
defaultdeliver the service. The second-
defaultorder decision is how you organise the work, how the work 
defaultshould 
defaultbe 
defaultorganised. Skills are the third-
defaultorder decision. This is a simplification
default,
default I know
default,
default but I believe it to be fundamentally correct. Once you decide how you are going to compete, it is the work organisation
default,
default and skills come third. It takes an enormous amount of energy and effort to think outside that model and it takes resources. 
defaultLord Wilson talked about my cocktail. The first element in my cocktail would be a change in the Companies Act legislation to ensure that employers meet the social obligation for the development of our workforce in future. That is very controversial, but I do not think we will find a solution within our existing framework while the level of overall demand, and in particular the structural demand as it affects young people, is at the level it is. We will continue to live with a 20% unemployment rate and run the risk of some social disruption. So I think employers need to be fundamentally obliged to do it. That is not popular but that is what I think.
defaultThe Chairman:default I think a lot of good employers have a very highly developed sense of social responsibility and outreach 
defaultin
default the areas 
defaultfrom
default which they operate.
defaultProfessor Slomandefault: Yes, they have. 
defaultThat is a
defaultbsolutely right.
defaultThe Chairman:default Again it could be the sharing of best practice and more publicity being given to people like that. We have run out of time, unfortunately, but Dr Copeland and Professor Maguire, would you like to add anything to what Professor Sloman has just said?
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Before we get to that, could I ask one urgent question? Given that we read in the paper that some major employers are already busy recruiting in 
defaultBulgaria
default and 
defaultRomania
default, how do we balance this?
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, indeed.
defaultProfessor Maguiredefault: I think we have to come back to the policy obsession that there has been over the last 10 to 15 years about retaining young people in education. We have not really engaged with employers about young people to the degree that we should have, and I think we need to be honest about that and 
defaultto 
defaultstart acknowledging that with employers. I did some research about 10 years ago in 
defaultLeicester
default and employers were saying, “We cannot get our hands on young people because they all stay on at school”. We have to be honest and say, “We need your support now. We have a youth unemployment problem. How can we work with you to sort this out?”
default.
default We have to be honest and say that we have not done that to a satisfactory degree in recent years.
defaultDr Copelanddefault: What I wanted to say has been covered by Martyn and Sue.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you all very much indeed. It has been a riveting session. I know I could have gone on for another couple of hours. There are lots of things
default to ask
default, particularly on this last point, but I am not going to develop it, and 
defaulton 
defaultthe point that 50% of all children should go to university and 
defaultthe question of 
defaultwhat skills they get at university. All that is part of it, but it is a diversion. We have a very serious position facing us
default,
default but I am old enough to remember a very serious position in the 1950s
default and 
default1960s, and these things do come round. They always said that recessions showed the brightest ones who had the emotion
defaultal
default intelligence to do something about it rather than think that they were going to be making shoes for the rest of their lives and not realising that things like Crocs and trainers got in the way. Thank you very much indeed. You have given up valuable time
default,
default but I can assure you it has been very valuable to us.
