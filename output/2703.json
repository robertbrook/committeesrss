"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Inclusion Scotland&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclusion Scotland (IS) is a national network of disabled peoples' organisations\n and individual disabled people funded by the Scottish Government. Inclusion Scotland’s main aim is to draw attention to the physical, social, economic, cultural and attitudinal barriers that affect disabled people’s everyday lives in Scotland.  \nInclusion \nScotland’s membership \ncollectively represents several thousand disabled people from throughout Scotland.  Welfare Reforms\n,\n and in particular changes to Housing Support\n,\n \ncurrently \nco\nnstitute the issue of greatest concern to our members.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder-occupancy penalty - “Bedroom Tax”&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScottish Government estimates that 95,000 Scottish households will be affected by the Bedroom Tax in the first year. In Scotland 79% of the households \nexpected to be \naffected (76,000) contain a disabled person\n. They will lose an average of £13 pw in housing benefit. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough tenants are being penalised for under-occupying, there is a chronic shortage of 1-bedroom properties.  North Lanarkshire Council, the largest social landlord in Scotland, has 33,000 prope\nrties but as of July only 26 of those \nproperties \ncurrently available were single bedroom properties.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy\n the end of May 2013\n \na Scottish Government survey of local authorities found that \nthere were an estimated 82,500 households in Scotland incurring a red\nuction in their housing benefit because they were assessed as under occupying their property.\n \nOf these households:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA research study \ncarried out by \nFalse Economy on behalf of the\n TUC \nvia Freedom of Information requests \nto local authorities \nfound that Scottish tenants were disproportionately likely to have fallen into rent arrears because of the under-occupation penalty. \nThe research showed that \n8 out of the 20 local authorities that had the worst arrears problems were in Scotland.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example \nin Clackmannanshire two-thirds of the tenants affected had fallen into arrears, which was second only to Barrow in Cumbria, \nwhere\n three-quarters\n were in arrears\n.\n \nA further \n6\n Scottish local authorities reported that \n40-50%\n of the tenants affecte\nd in their area had fallen into arrears. Unfortunately Glasgow\n, which has the highest number of tenants affected in any Scottish local authority area and also the highest levels of urban deprivation,\n \nfailed to\n respond to the \nFoI \nrequest\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclusion Scotla\nnd are concerned by the arrears levels uncovered by the TUC research\n as they represent the position only some 4 months since the Under-Occupation Penalty’s introduction\n and \nextremely concerned that a large proportion of the tenants who are falling into arr\nears will be disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n It must be feared that the proportion of tenants \n&amp; disabled people falling\n into arrears will only increase as time goes by and any financial resources that claimants initially had at the outset of the penalty being imposed \nbecome stretched or entirely exhausted.  Moreover some tenants will have been eligible for Discretionary Housing Payments \n(DHPs) \nduring the first four months but these are \nusually\n restricted to a \n3 \nmonth maximum and so they too \nare likely to\n fall into arre\nars \nwhen their DHPs are withdrawn\n. \n3              Disabled People &amp; the Threat of Eviction:&#xa0;3.1\n              \nScottish Government’s Analytical Services Division have estimated\n the likely consequences of the introduction of the Under-Occupation Penalty. \nThey estimated that \n8,000 o\nf the households affected would move to smaller properties and thus manage to avoid the penalty whilst \nhalf of th\ne remainder (43,000)\n would be able to maintain their rent payments\n and around half would fall into arrears\n.  \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nOf the half that fell into a\nrrears they believed that a quarter (i.e. nearly 11,000 households) would eventually be evicted. Given that 79% of the households affected contain at least one disabled person that might mean 8,000+ disabled people being evicted and becoming homeless.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nInclusion Scotland believe that these\n \nnow look to be\n over-optimistic projection\ns given the levels of arrears in some \nScottish \nauthorities \nis \nalready at or above this level after only 4 months. \n \nHowever\n the additional \n£20 million in \nfunding being made avai\nlable \nby Scottish Government \nto Local Authorities to bolster DHP Budgets \nshould\n have an impact in reducing \nthe rate at which tenants are falling into arrears and thus being evicted.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nNevertheless Inclusion Scotland believes that disabled people will be\n amongst those least able to continue to meet their rent payments.  This is because the Under-Occupation Penalty has not been introduced in a vacuum but in a context where other benefits paid to sick and disabled people are being cut. Thus the cumulative i\nmpact of other welfare reforms will have an impact on their financial resilience and therefore their ability to meet increased rent payments.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nAccording to the Sheffield Hallam University research\n approximately 100,000 \nScots \ndisabled people will be moved off Employment Support Allowance (ESA) \nby 2015 \neither because they exhaust their entitlement to contributory ESA or because they are re-classified as fully fit for work after a Work Capability Assessment (WCA). \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nGiven th\ne planned 20% budget reduction which the DWP is planning to achieve there will also be significant numbers (thousands at least) of disabled people on the Mobility Components and Care elements of DLA who will have to lose entitlement to the PIP to make the \nnecessary savings.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nUsing the DWP’s own projections, by 2018, IS estimates that over \n80,000 working age disabled people in Scotland will lose either some or all of the\n \nmobility allowance that they would otherwise have been entitled to\n if DLA entitlement criteria had continued to be used\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.8              Care component:  In addition because of the introduction of PIP –\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n \n      \nHowever overall nearly \n90,000 fewer disabled peop\nle in Scotland\n will qualify for \nassistance with their care needs/daily living costs that they would otherwise have been entitled to under DLA eligibility criteria. \n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nThus far, the DWP has \nrefused to conduct\n \na Cumulative Impact  A\nssessment due to what it argue\ns are\n the difficulties in model\ning ‘behaviour effects’. However, using the DWP’s own figures in relation to the benefits disabled people received, \nInclusion Scotland\n have been able to calculate that working age disabled people who are 40+ will be \ndisproportiona\ntely affected by reforms to Employment &amp; Support Allowance, the replacement of Disability Living Allowance by the Personal Independence Payment and the Under-Occupation Penalty\n. Thus - \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also \nvery likely that there will be a significant overlap between these groups of disabled claimants (e.g. ESA and DLA Lower Rate Care recipients) as both groups have large cohorts of people with learning difficulties and/or mental health issues/cognitive impai\nrments (e.g. autism spectrum disorder). \nThus 40% of c\nlaimants who have already \nlost entitlement to Employment and Support Allowance have learning difficulties\n \n/mental health issues whilst over 30% of those currently on DLA Lower Rate Care also have these i\nmpairments.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.12\n              \nResearch carried out by Demos on behalf of Scope\n confirms that a substantial proportion of disabled people will experience multiple cuts in their entitlement to benefits. The research suggests that across the UK 120,000 disabled people \nwill experience at least a triple loss of benefits by 2018 with 99,000 experiencing a quadruple cut. \nThe personal benefit \nlosses will range from \na minimum of \n£6,300 \nto \n£23,461 \nper person by 2017.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.13\n              \nResearch by the Scottish Public Health Observatory\n shows that 72,660 people were in receipt of three key benefits (Income Support/Pension Credit, Incapacity Benefit/Employment and Support Allowance/Severe Disablement Allowance, and Disability Living Allowance)\n affected by cuts\n, and 226,520 were in receipt\n of at least two of the key benefits.\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n      \nThus we think it safe to conclude that many of those losing ESA and/or other disability benefits (e.g. via the introduction of PIP\n and changes to ESA entitlement\n) will \nalso be penalis\ned\n under the Under-Occupation regulations.  This means that they will already or in the future suffer substantial losses to their household incomes making it more likely that they will be unable to maintain \ntheir \nrent payments and thus also more likely to ev\nentually be evicted.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExemptions to the Under Occupation Rule&#xa0;4.1\n              \nInclusion Scotland believes that current exemptions to the Under Occupation rule are inconsistent with established case law, wider equality law and disabled people’s human rights. They are\n also being inconsistently applied by local authorities and Registered Social Landlords.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nSince the Court of Appeal judgment in \nGorry V Department of Work and Pensions\n local authorities \nhave received guidance from the DWP to allow an extra bedroom for \nchildren who are unable to share because of their severe disabilities.\n  \nHowever no such exemption has been put in place for adult partners unable, or unwilling, to share a bed because of one\n,\n or both\n’\ns\n,\n severe impairments.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.\n3\n              \nWe believe that this failure to exempt couple’s unable to share a bed is inconsistent with established case law, with equalities law which states that disabled people should not be treated less favourably than non-disabled people  (as it could result in di\nsabled people’s health and safety being jeopardised) and with disabled people’s right, under the Human Rights Act and Article 8 of the European Convention, to a ‘home and family life’.   \n&#xa0;\n4.4     Inclusion Scotland\n believe that it is a totally unwarranted\n intrusion into the private lives of disabled people, and their partners, for the state to insist that they sleep in the same bed on pain of suffering a reduction to their housing benefit and that an exemption should be granted on these grounds forthwith.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n \n              \nInclusion Scotland also believes that an exemption should exist for sick and disabled people who use one of their rooms to store equipment or other items associated with supporting them to live with their condition or impairment. For example a room u\nsed to store a kidney dialysis machine is patently not being used as a bedroom and should not therefore be treated as one. \n \nA case (Lall v Westminster Council) on this very same  legal point was decided in favour of the claimant by a Lower Tier Tribunal ju\ndge. See here for details – \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/26/bedroom-tax-westminster-council-defeat\n \n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nW\ne view the failure to provide such an exemption as jeopardising sick and disabled people’s health and ability to live independently. As only disabled people have an essential need for additional rooms\n (that\n is not shared by non-disabled people\n)\n we believe\n \nthat the Under-occupation penalty is\n \na breach of equality law which prohibits being treated differently on the grounds of disability\n and of Article 14 of the ECHR\n.\n \nThis was also the view of a Lower Tier Tribunal judge in Glasgow in an as yet unreported \ndec\nision -\n see here for the judge’\ns comments: \nhttp://govanlc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/european-convention-of-human-rights.html\n \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n \n              \nThere have also been a number of\n rulings in a Fife Lower Tier Tribunal on whether rooms can be treated as “bedrooms” for Under-occupation penalty purposes.  The judge in these cases ruled that rooms under 70 sq. feet in area could not be treated as bedrooms\n for use by adults and\n that exempt accommodation\n,\n where care and support was being provided by a Housing Association\n, whether or not contracted to do so by a local authority, \ncoul\nd not be subjected to a penalty. See here for details – \nhttp://www.insidehousing.co.uk/regulation/full-details-of-first-bedroom-tax-tribunal-rulings/6528701.article\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5              Discretionary Housing Payments &amp; DLA/PIP Entitlement&#xa0;5.1\n              \nTh\ne DWP made significant additional amounts of funding available to local authorities \nto make Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) available to those affected by the Under Occupation penalty and other changes to Housing Benefit/Local Housing Allowance. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe Guidance\n issued by the DWP specifically recognized that disabled people were likely to be disproportionately affected by the penalty and that local authorities should therefore consider making DHPs where, for example, “additional” bedrooms were being used by partn\ners who could not share a bed with a disabled spouse.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nHowever it appears that disabled people have been placed in a “Catch 22” situation in regards to being granted a DHP by local authorities. On the one hand they have to prove that they are a disable\nd person, in which case the local authority may ask for proof of entitlement to DLA or PIP.  But on the other when they prove said entitlement they are then told that they are not eligible for a DHP because they have additional funding that they can draw o\nn to pay the Under Occupation penalty, namely the very same DLA or PIP benefits payments!\n5.4\n              \nIt should be pointed out that DLA is paid to disabled people to assist in meeting the additional costs associated with their disability. If it is already being us\ned for that purpose then it should surely not be counted by local authorities as disposable income available to the disabled person to meet the Under Occupation penalty. Yet that is exactly what has been happening.  \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nThere does not seem to be a consis\ntent approach across local authorities to a claimant having entitlement to DLA/PIP and their subsequent application for a DHP. The result is that severely impaired people having difficulty in paying their rent\n              \nare being denied support from the very funds s\net aside for that purpose.  This will inevitably result in severe financial pressure on households containing a disabled person who \nare \naffected by the ‘Bedroom Tax’, the very likely accumulation of rent arrears and the potential for, and reality, of evict\nions at some stage.   Needless to say the emotional stress that will be suffered by individuals and families will also be severe and has already led to incidents of suicide and self-harm.\n&#xa0;\n5.6 \n              \nInclusion Scotland believe that in taking DLA into account as \ndisposable income for DHP purposes that local authorities are discriminating against disabled people as non-disabled people do not have access to DLA/PIP and are thus more likely to qualify for DHPs. \n&#xa0;\n5.7\n              \nThis same legal argument was advanced by a disable\nd claimant in Glasgow and we note that the local authority then reviewed their DHP decision\n (see here for details - \nhttp://disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2013\n/june/discretionary-housing-payment-includes-dla\n)\n&#xa0;\n5.8\n              \nHowever it is massively unfair that other disabled people within the same local authority area (and \nalso in other authorities\n) may still be being denied DHPs on the grounds that they are receiving \nDLA/PIP as no case law precedent was established that DLA should not be taken into account. This should be addressed by making DWP Guidance much more specific in calling for DLA/PIP payments to be disregarded by local authorities when considering whether t\no award DHPs.\n \n&#xa0;\n3 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Impact of Planned Housing Benefit Changes in Scotland: The Number of Disabled Households Affected By The Under-Occupancy Penalty, Scottish Government, Feb 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nUpdated Evidence On The Number Of Households Affected By The Housing Benefit Under Occupatio\nn Penalty, Scottish Government, June 2013\n \nReducing the Housing Benefit of Households of Working Age in Social Housing\n&#xa0;\nUnder-Occupying a Property, Scottish Governm\nent, Analytical Services, Dec. 2012\n&#xa0;\n \nIncapacity Benefit Reform: the local, regional and national impact\n, \nBeatty &amp; Fothergill, Sheffield Hallam University, 2011\n Destination Unknown April 2013, Demos, April 2013 See here: \nhttp://www.demos.co.uk/blog/destinationunknownapril2013\n&#xa0;\n \nMaking a bad situation worse?
