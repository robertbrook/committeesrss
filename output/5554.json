"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOAR0019Written evidence submitted by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL)&#xa0;About ATL, the education unionATL, the education union, is an independent, registered trade union and professional association, representing approximately 160,000 teachers, head teachers, lecturers and support staff in maintained and independent nurseries, sch\nools, sixth form, tertiary and further education colleges in the UK. AMiE \nis a distinct section of ATL for \nleaders and managers in colleges and schools\n. \nATL is not affiliated to any political party and seeks to work constructively with all the main \npolitical parties.\n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the context of high achievement, Ofsted’s \nnegative tone\n and the perception of an unlevel playing field undermine the inspectorate’s standing.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfsted\n‘s \nmain weakness is that it cannot guarantee the outcomes of its i\nnspections process. \nInconsistencies in the quality and accuracy of judgements persist.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nATL \nbelieves\n \nprofession-led local systems of accountability and improvement\n would better serve young people’s education\n.\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission’s final section highlights \nspecific issues HMCI must address.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is disappointing that despite the vast majority of schools being considered ‘outstanding’ or ‘good’ after Ofsted raised the bar in its inspection regime that the overwhelming \ntone of \nmes\nsages conveyed by the organisation’s launch of its annual report \nis negative.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe patience afforded to academies \n(paragraphs 48, 50) \ndoes not appear to be matched by Ofsted with regards the non-acadamised maintained sector. The politicised \nnature of the in\nspectorate remains\n inappropriate. \n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn this annual report Ofsted repeats criticisms of teaching without acknowledging its own role in the proliferation of the characteristics listed (paragraph 37). This is symptomatic of constant moving of the goalposts and\n exemplifies both the pressure and mistrust the teaching profession feels in relation to Ofsted.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main weakness of Ofsted is that it cannot guarantee the outcomes of its inspections process. Inconsistencies in the qua\nlity and accura\ncy of Ofsted judgements persist.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nATL members have continued to report inconsistencies between inspectors, between inspections and between the experiences of different schools.\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur analysis of Ofsted’s subject surveys published in 2012 and 20\n13 highlights further inconsistency, suggesting outcomes are unreliable, possibly pre-determined, and potentially politically driven. Despite this annual report stating that \nalmost eight \nin ten\n schools were found to be good or outstanding at their most rec\nent inspection, only one subject report, citizenship, \nin ten published, \nfound a similar level of quality in schools.\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are pleased Ofsted has required inspectors to have QTS but believe it continues to underestimate the challenge of maintaining an effecti\nve team of inspectors. The lack of quality control in the inspectorate is damaging not just to its own reputation but damaging to \nchildren’s\n’ education.\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nATL members find Ofsted’s public negativity towards teachers extremely demoralising. The flow of \ncriticism raises stress rather than performance.\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA member from the primary sector\n reports: “Previously graded consistently as \n‘\ngood\n’\n, we received \n‘\nrequires \nimprovement’\n. We felt that some of the criticism was fair, but some unfair; however, we set to work \nhard and improve … The process since Ofsted has been extremely negative.\n&#xa0;\nIt seems to me that\n&#xa0;\na school with\n&#xa0;\nsome faults has now been completely destroyed as morale is very low; teachers continue to work extremely hard but feel\n&#xa0;\ndemoralised, depressed and exh\nausted and support staff are also affected by the oppressive atmosphere in the school … This punitive regime has done nothing to improve the school.\n”\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn ATL secondary school member\n \nhighlights the gap between effective accountability and the reality of Ofst\ned inspections: “It is 'all stick, and no carrot', but \nit should \nbe about professional dialogue \nand improving\n the educational experience for \nchildren.\n”\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfsted \ncan’t be relied upon for its judgments and can’t be counted on to play a role in\n helping schools improve\n because of its two major problems: inconsistency in quality and accuracy; and having next to no respect amongst the teaching profession.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn\n alternative\n must address these issues and\n ATL would like to see \nprofession-led local system\ns of accountability and improvement.\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy being designed locally and with the involvement of current classroom teachers \njudgments would be respected\n, \nunique \nschool circumstances better understood\n,\n and improvement plans would be relevant and effectively suppo\nrted\n. A national body such as Ofsted would have the role of overseeing the processes to quality assure them and \nprovid\ne confidence that \nschools are\n properly\n accountable\n in these new, local structures.\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre \ncomplaints and appeals against Ofsted inspection findings increasing?\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDoes Ofsted acknowledge it has a significant problem with its own quality control?\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy do so many of Ofsted’s subject surveys suggest teaching is considerably worse than is being found i\nn school inspections?\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is being done to improve Ofsted’s reputation with the teaching profession?\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCan a national agency of inspectors really \nsupport \nchildren’s\n’ education and \noffer a better system of school and college accountability than local \nprofession-led systems of inspection and improvement?\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
