[[[Written evidence submitted by Terry James [OLS0050]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Having been brought up in a Christian household and taught Christian values and principals as set out in the Holy Bible from a child, it is of great concern to me that there is not more protection for young people today from the extremely harmful effects of online pornography.It is equalling distressing to hear of the ongoing abuse of children being used to create pornographic images.It is the parentâ€™s responsibility to protect their children from any type of danger be it physical or moral but is also the responsibility of the government to use its powers to take steps to enforce this protection.If a child by any means has gained access to unsuitable material then that is a sad failure on the part of the parents, the government and the internet providers. If everybody shoulders their bit of responsibility our children can be protected and must be protected. As for the ongoing use of the internet for child abuse and pornography, this is an evil that cannot be tolerated. The government has powers it can use to fight this terrible activity. Action must be taken to protect these innocent children from exploitation.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
