[[[Hinks]]]

[[[ (LTC 38)]]]At the age of 41 I had breast cancer in 2006 and consequently had to have a mastectomy. I had reconstruction at the time of my surgery which unfortunately was unsuccessful so had to have further corrective reconstruction in 2010. As a result of my initial surgery I developed lymphodeama in my left arm. A part from regular measurements and supply of compression sleeves there is no MLD ( Manual Lymphatic Drainage ) available in our area.I have been paying an excellent private MLD practitioner on a regular basis for the past 5 years. This treatment has vastly improved and managed my condition and this is going to be on going for the rest of my life. I know it is the case with a lot of ladies that I have come into contact with that have developed Lymphodeama following surgery that it is just treated as unfortunate and something we have to just deal with. I know financially the NHS is extremely stretched but as more an ladies are now ending up with this lifelong disability it seems very sad that his problem is not being totally understood and treated as the disability it is. I have to be constantly aware of what I do in my day to day living and am not able to do a lot of activities and general work that I used to be able to do.I hope my account of my situation helps in maybe looking into this problem that affects so many people.May 2013
