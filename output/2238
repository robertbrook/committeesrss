The testing will generally prove the working of
[normal] the changes 
[normal]to the 
[normal]EPM 2010
[normal] system
[normal] after the SP1 update, such as the EPM configuration settings
[normal] and 
[normal]any possible changes to the EPM system and
[normal] the way users will work with the system, e.g. changes in the user interface.
[normal]Testing will also perform basic functionality checks, to prove that the fundamental features can be accessed 
[normal]as before (Pre SP1 update
[normal]).
[normal]Data validation and integrity checks will also be performed:
[normal]Testing will not be formally applied to standard, out-of-the-box functionality of MS Project and EPM, except where it is explicitly covered in the user guide.
[normal]Testing will take place at various points, in the developm
[normal]ent cycle, first proving that the SP1 update along with the June 2011 cumulative update works, resolves known issues without any adversities within Pre Production. 
[normal] PED 
[normal](validation)
[normal] as
[normal] 
[normal]well as PICT 
[normal]Change Advisory Board approval will
[normal] be sought, moving towards 
[normal]verification that everything actually works in the final, 
[normal]updated production EPM
[normal] system.
[normal]This forms the main approach 
[normal]to testing the EPM 2010 SP1 update 
[normal]and signing it off as ready to go-live.

[normal]NextCPFcast
[normal]CPnStatus
[normal]CPnStatusData
[normal]Check out projects in MS project clients and undertake updates (look at changes)[bold] 
[normal]Notes:
[normal]Updated and published PE55555 successfully.
[normal]Undertook schedule updates using PWA schedule as well as updated all three PDP pages successfully.
[normal]However, When I attempted to make changes in the schedule PDP page – project task dates (CP date milestone) the PWA schedule pa
[normal]ge doesn’t refresh with this new
[normal] data until you click edit. As well as that, the 
[normal]‘
[normal]CPnStatus
[normal]’
[normal] field 
[normal]in the EPM views 
[normal]doesn’t refresh either. 
[normal]This is not an i
[normal]mmediate concern at this stage 
[normal]as
[normal] EPM users are advised not to use the PWA schedule 
[normal](
[normal]as 
[normal]there are still

[normal]There were some variations but this was due to additional projects being added after the SP1 update had occurred and now.

[normal]Test MS Project P[bold]rofessional 2010 Client [bold]works[bold]Notes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Test MS Project Professional 2010 Client connects to EPM 2010 server[bold]Notes:
[normal]This works well, however, within PPE I am unable to checkout a Project from the PWA (using the web client) as done in Live. I think this is a PPE domain issue. To get around this, I can actually check out a Project via opening the MS project Client and using the Open&gt;&gt;retrieve Project from project Server route as oppose to clicking open on a selected project within a PWA Project centre view.
[normal]Verify and check Project plan data[bold]Notes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Verify and check appr[bold]opriate views [bold]contain correct data (Projects)[bold]Notes:
[normal]Views seem to 
[normal]have the correct data 
[normal]however;
[normal] I have noticed that there seems to be a change in how Project server records ‘Not 
[normal]Baselined
[normal]’ tasks. Before SP1 Non 
[normal]Baselined
[normal] tasks
[normal] 
[normal]would be stored with a date and time as: ’00:00:00 or 01/01/00.
[normal]Now in the View (post SP1) the Non 
[normal]Baselined
[normal] Tasks are showing as: ‘30/12/99’.
[normal]Although, I doubt this will have an adverse effect on the results contained within EPM, I will undertake more investigations regarding this to 
[normal]find out
[normal] what the impact (if any) is and why there is a difference. 
[normal]Verify (where possible) the permission levels for Project data access i.e. that the new security model still applies (using Test account)[bold]Notes:
[normal]Have checked the EPM Security group’s permissions still work and they do.
[normal]I checked the Project Leader grou
[normal]p which is used to filter the My
[normal] Projects view 1 to show only projects assigned to owner – 
[normal]working
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I also checked that this security group could see and edit their own projects –
[normal] working
[normal]I added the Project Leader Buddy
[normal] and assigned the test user (assigned to 
[normal]the
[normal] Project Leader Buddy
[normal] group) to a project not owned by the test user – 
[normal]the test user could then edit the project he was assigned as a buddy (team assignment). – 
[normal]working
[normal].
[normal]Removed the Project Leader buddy settings to which the test user could then only edit his Project. 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Put the test user in the PED Project Support group (only) and the test user could only edit those projects assigned to as team member and view (no edits) those projects not assigned team member –

[normal]Update project within PWA[bold]Notes:
[normal]Working. 
[normal]However, Project Schedule updates is still recommended to be done in MS Project professional as there still appears to be some issues with the Scheduling engine in PWA and how it calculates formulated fields.
[normal]Assign team members via Project Pro and PWA[bold]Notes
[normal]Assigning team members via MS Project pro works as it should and security permission settings related to this will be applied. However, although assigning team members via the PWA works, for some reason the security permissions related to team members does not apply. This is the same as pre SP1 and is not the cause of the SP1 update. Further investigations about this will be undertaken as a BAU issue (as project/team member assignments continue to be used)
