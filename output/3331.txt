[[[Written evidence submitted by Dr Fenton F. Robb (IPC0004)]]]&#xa0;              IPCC AR5 is unashamedly presented, not as the outcome of scientific observation, but as a compilation of the opinions of a close community of experts. This is made abundantly clear in Section A Introduction paragraph 3. As the unadulterated facts of the matter are not available, this invites, indeed demands, criticism ad hominem. &#xa0;Thus, it is legitimate, indeed essential, to examine the nature of the experience and learning of those purporting to be expert in this methodology and to expose them to criticism by examining the following issues:&#xa0; (a) This is a new discipline and few have been able to accumulate sufficient experience to qualify them as ‘experts’. What is an expert climatologist?&#xa0; (b) Climatologists form a closely-knit peer group that shares an interest in promoting public alarm and provoking continued research. &#xa0; (c) It may be that, centred on UEA, several climatologists may be political activists who share a belief in ‘post-normal science’ which sees ‘scientific research’ not as a search for ‘truth’, but as a vehicle for the achievement of personal and collective goals. &#xa0; (d) Climatology is in effect a subset of the ‘Futurology’ and cannot be subjected to the test of falsification until after the future has been experienced. Thus it is crucial to discover why so many of the IPCC models failed to anticipate the stability of the climate over the past 15 years. AR5 offers several hypotheses about variables that were not examined adequately in the models. No credence can be given to such excuses unless and until there is evidence to support them but asking for more evidence promotes the expenditure of more public money in pursuit of a research methodology so dependent on expertise as it may b fatally flawed.&#xa0; (e) Throughout the papers great emphasis has been placed on trends from the past to the present and the inference is that these will continue unabated indefinitely. But the future need not be like the past and in the instance of a highly complex and non-linear systems extrapolations from past trends are more likely as not to be misleading. A point to this effect as made in AR1.&#xa0; (f) The definition of ‘climate scientist’ as one who believes that there is AGW and who engages in research, not to seek the causal relations that give rise to the phenomenon but engages in research about its effect, rather than its causes precludes dissent about the founding hypothesis – that catastrophic global warming is taking place as a result of human activity. So ‘all true climate scientist agree’ and those who dissent are not climate scientists.&#xa0; (g) Despite previous assessments providing the opinion that ever increasing temperatures were on the way, AR5 reverts to a prognosis similar to that of the First Assessment. Surely this must mean that there is less cause for alarm. &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
