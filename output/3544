defaultAs
default a 
defaultSociety we welcome the opportunity to provide our views to the Welsh
default 
defaultAffairs Committee inquiry into 
defaultthe
default exploitation of shale gas reserves.  In particular, we will comment on the availability and use of existing Welsh Government policy and guidance in relation to exploratory drilling, testing and production of shale gas following “
defaultfracking
default”. 
defaultWe will seek to explain:
defaultWith significant area of 
defaultWales
default underlain by geology which, typically, would contain potential for shale gas, it is perhaps inevitable that interest in the exploration and exploitation of these reserves will grow in the short to medium term.  Currently within 
defaultWales
default, only exploratory wells have been the subject of planning applications, with permissions most recently granted in the Vale of Glamorgan and in Rhondda Cynon Taff.  A planning application for an exploratory well near Wrexham has also recently been received and is currently being assessed by the Regional Shared Service team which provides specialist advice to the planning authorities of North Wales.
defaultWhen assessing such applications, the Local Planning Authority is bound by Section 38 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to determine those applications with regard to the provisions of the development plan in place, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  This approach is re-affirmed by the over-arching national document 
defaultPlanning Policy 
defaultWales
default (edition 5, November 2012).  
defaultThe majority of planning authorities in 
defaultWales
default have an adopted development plan, in the form of either a Local Development Plan, or its predecessor, a Unitary Development Plan.  Upon adoption, these plans should provide the Local Planning Authority with a robust basis on which to make rational and consistent decisions on development proposals.
defaultGiven that the interest in unconventional gas exploitation is a relatively recent development in 
defaultWales
default, it is unlikely that any adopted development plan would have 
defaultspecific
default policies addressing the potential impacts arising, particularly of gas production or stimulation by fracturing.  That said, recent decisions have shown that sufficient policy guidance and clarity is available to robustly determine applications for exploratory wells.  This has been held to be the case with decisions taken at both the Local Planning Authority level, (in the case of the Vale of Glamorgan and Rhondda Cynon Taff) and by the Planning Inspectorate (in the case of the appeal decision on the previously refused planning permission for an exploratory well at the 
defaultLlandow
default Industrial Estate in the Vale of Glamorgan).
defaultTypically, development plans will include more generic policies which will seek to direct developers to locations appropriate for sustainable growth; protect minerals reserves; specify criteria which would identify new development to be acceptable in terms of its impact; preserve and enhance the natural environment  by protecting it against inappropriate development; protect the environment, public health and local amenity; support development proposals which promote the provision of renewable and non-renewable energy and promote high standards of design.  This list is by no means exhaustive, but reflects those key areas that the Local Planning Authority will need to asses when determining applications for shale gas exploitation.
defaultAn out of date, or complete absence of, an adopted development plan should not preclude a Local Planning Authority from determining planning applications and again 
defaultPlanning Policy Wales
default provides clarity on this scenario.  It advises that when development plan policies are outdated, Local Planning Authorities should give them decreasing weight in favour of other material considerations, such a national planning policy.  This was the case with the Vale of Glamorgan Unitary Development which was adopted in 2005 and covers the period between 1996 and 2011. The Local Planning Authority then determined whether policies within the adopted Development Plan were out of date, or had been superseded by other material considerations. This should be done in light of the presumption in favour of sustainable development.
defaultThe exploitation of natural gas gains supports in 
defaultMineral Planning Policy Wales
default which states “where oil and gas operations can be carried out in an environmentally acceptable way and consistent with the principles of sustainable development, there is no case in land use planning terms for placing more restrictions on the development than are necessary to ensure the protection f the environment.”
defaultWelsh Government’s 
defaultEnergy Wales: A Low Carbon Transition
default states that gas will be a key transitional fuel because greenhouse gas emissions from gas are significantly less than coal subject to the method of extraction. It goes on to note that gas is a flexible, responsive and reliable source of energy which can play a key role in the transition to a genuinely low carbon energy system.
defaultIn addition, further context is provided by the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s 
defaultOverarching National Policy Statement for Energy EN-1
default which indicates that fossil fuel power stations will continue to play an important role in our energy mix as the

defaultto note that the most recent decisions on planning applications for exploratory wells in the Vale of Glamorgan have referred to the Department for Communities and Local Government’s document
default “Planning practice guidance for onshore oil and gas” July 2013. 
defaultAppendix 1.
default Whilst it is acknowledged that this document was produced for English mineral planning authorities, the broad principles within it are equally relevant to 
defaultWales
default with respect to its explanation of the separate processes that run alongside planning with regard to authorising the exploration and extraction of gas.  
defaultIn particular, the guidance sets out the roles of the key regulators in addition to mineral planning authorities:
defaultThe guidance goes on to set out the relationship between planning and the other regulatory regimes, explaining that they are “separate, but complementary”. It continues that the planning system “controls the development and use of land in the public interest”, referring back to paragraphs 120 and 122 of the 
defaultNational Planning Policy Framework
default (NPPF).
defaultAgain, whilst the 
defaultNPPF
default reflects the planning system in 
defaultEngland
default, the purpose of planning therein defined and replicated above is very similar to that found within 
defaultPlanning Policy Wales
default at paragraph 1.2.1 which explains:
default“The planning system manages the development and use of land in the public interest contributing to the achievement of sustainable development.”
defaultTurning back to the DCLG Guidance, it states that the planning system should focus on whether the development itself is an acceptable use of the land, and the impacts of those uses, rather than on any control processes, health and safety issues or emissions themselves where these are subject to approval under other regimes.  It clarifies that “mineral planning authorities should assume that these non-planning regimes will operate effectively”.  
defaultThe Guidance then turns to the principal environmental matters and issues that mineral planning authorities should address when determining applications for gas extraction.  It lists them as:
defaultSo the DCLG guidance is valuable in determining the roles of the regulators and the matters which the mineral planning authorities should address.  The lack of applicable planning guidance specifically for Welsh planning authorities should be addressed as a priority.  The DCLG guidance has been welcomed by mineral planning authorities within England and much of it could be replicated in Welsh guidance.  The absence of such guidance creates an inconsistency across the UK and potentially places Wales at a disadvantage.
defaultShould such Welsh guidance be recommended to be produced, Planning Officers Society for Wales would actively assist in its development.  A sub-group of officers involved in minerals and waste planning within Wales already exists and works positively to improve the consistency of delivery of this complex and specialist area of work.
defaultFollowing the publication of the DCLG guidance, they have since moved to address secondary legislation in respect of “
defaultRevised requirements relating to planning applications for onshore oil and gas
default September 2013”
default. 
defaultAppendix 2.
default In particular, DCLG propose changes to the notification of landowners prior to planning applications being submitted; the use of a standard planning application form for onshore oil and gas development and providing clarity on the calculation of the fee to accompany any planning application.  
defaultConsultation on those changes closed in mid October, but Welsh Government would be well advised to note the responses made by interested parties. In particular, concerns have been raised that proposals to reduce the need for notification of landowners prior to the submission of planning applications is a retrograde step at a time when an increase in pre-application discussions and their value is being advocated across the planning spectrum. The proposed changes seek to clarify the position on planning fees and this is a matter that Welsh Government should address.  The proposals on fee setting as set out in these revised requirements should not be replicated in Wales. The DCLG proposals clarify that the fee should be calculated on the area of the above ground workings only. 
defaultExperience from mineral planning authorities in England has shown that the resources to assess a planning application that involves 
defaultfracking
default can be hugely draining on those authorities, so the planning fee should reflect that.  The planning application boundary (upon which the fee would be calculated) should include the area over which gas would be drawn extrapolated to the surface. That would result in a planning fee that is proportionate to the potential impact of the proposed development and the resource required from the local planning authority to assess it. The technical issues and consultation requirements for unconventional gas go far beyond that which fees normally cover and cater for in more conventional forms of development.  
defaultApplications for unconventional gas effectively constitute engineering and mining development and the fee schedule should reflect that.
defaultFinally, whilst it is recommended that guidance should be provided for the assessment of unconventional gas exploitation in Wales, the technical expertise of the local planning authorities which will assess such applications is also worthy of consideration.  Mineral planning is a notable specialism within the planning system, one that in two-tier local government would be undertaken by the County Council, as the strategic planning authority.  In a single tier system this burden is placed on the unitary authority.  Experience in minerals planning is increasingly sparse and local planning authorities should continue to collaborate to establish resilient, experienced and knowledgeable teams to assess these complex applications.  Arrangements  are in place to provide these services in South West and North Wales, led by Carmarthenshire and Flintshire respectively. Other local planning authorities in Wales should ensure that they are adequately resourced to ensure that these applications are assessed in a robust, efficient and consistent manner.
