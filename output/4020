defaultI believe UK Police Polices are now universally involved in a “Crime Quota/Target” system which corrupt, not impartial and incorrect.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn other words Police Officers are so engrained
default with the “need for a conviction” after arrest that they will ignore any potential crime or potential crime unless they have that possibility.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have personally been a direct victim of this kind of “policy” in Wiltshire but can see that it is operating el
defaultsewhere too. Just look at the recent murder of the man in Bristol who had repeatedly called the police for help and protection. They did nothing. He’s now dead and wrongfully investigated for 
defaultpaedophilia
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my own case I became a victim of crime and trie
defaultd to get police help. Consistently, again and again, they refused to act despite being given named individuals connected to gangs.
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain and again they  said “we can’t do anything unless there is scientific evidence”. That is no way to “police” anything. 
defaultIt’s useless.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis form of “lunacy” is directed impacted by the “crime statistics quota/target” system which essentially has the effect of creating a failed police force until someone is harmed, hurt, attacked, killed or major property damage is done. The
defaultn there’s “scientific evidence”.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt’s too late!
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat’s the point of that? It’s worse than useless.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut it gets worse. It has instilled in police officers an attitude of arrogance, aggressiveness and the general idea that “they” are now not only the “cou
defaultrt of law” themselves but are indeed completely above the law.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf you don’t change this, then there is no point in having a police force at all.
