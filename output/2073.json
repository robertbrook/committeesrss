"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nRoyal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (SLC 013)\n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\n1\n              \nRoSPA \nis\n a\n \nregistered charity that promotes accident prevention in all areas of life. \nOur\n mission is to save lives and reduce injury. \nRoSPA was a member of the Level Crossings Advisory Group, established by the \nLaw Commission and the Scottish Law Commission as part of its review\n of, and subsequent\n consultation paper\n on, the law on level crossings. \nRoSPA \nwelcomes\n the Committee’s Inquiry \ninto Safety at Level Crossings \nand \nis\n grateful for the opportunity to submit evidence.\n \n&#xa0;\nSafety at Level Crossings&#xa0;\n2\n              \nThere are over 6,000 level crossings, of many different types, in Great Britain. \nOn average, there are 9 deaths, 7 major injuries and 23 minor injuries on levels crossings each year. In 2012/13, there were 9 deaths at level crossings \n(\n4 pedestrians and 5 vehicle occupants\n)\n and 10 collisions between trai\nns and road vehicles\n. \nT\nhere were \nalso 302\n near misses\n \nwith pedestrians and 152 with road vehicles\n, as well as \n1,822 reported incidents of misuse of level crossings by pedestrians and 1,736 reported incidents of misuse by road vehicle drivers.\n&#xa0;\n3\n              \nOver 90% of \nthe \nrisk \nat level crossings \nin\n \nrecent\n year\ns has \nbeen due to\n user error (e.g., not knowing how to operate the crossing\n, misjudging the time it takes the train to reach the crossing or \nnot realising a \nsecond train\n is coming) or \nuser abuse\n (e.g., \ndriving around half-barriers, \nnot stopping for red \nlights, not requesting \npermission \nto cross \nand leaving gates open)\n.\n \n4\n              \nA review\n \n of fatal accidents at level crossings in Great Britain \nbetween \n1946 \nand\n 2009\n identif\ni\ned that 1,250\n people \nhad been\n killed \no\nn level crossings\n over that \n64 year \nperiod\n. \nFatal\n accidents and fatalities at level crossings fell by about 65% in the ﬁrst half of that period, but \nthen\n \nremained constant \nfor the rest of the period \nat about 11 fatal accidents and 12 \ndeaths\n per year.\n \nThe number of crossin\ngs f\nell\n by about 7\n5% over the period\n.\n However, t\nhe number of fatal accidents ha\nd\n remained almost un\nchanged for about 30 years.\n&#xa0;\n5\n              \nAlmost all (\n95%\n)\n \nof the \nfatalities at level crossings \nwe\nre road users.\n Of the \n1\n,\n252 fatalities\n, 700 (56%) were pedestrians, 487 (39%) were \nvehicle \noccupants, including two-wheeled vehicles and farm vehicles, 44 (4%) were railway staff, and 21 (2%) were railway passengers. \n&#xa0;\n6\n              \nThe review grouped l\nevel crossings \ninto three broad types:\n \n&#xa0;\n              \n(\n1\n)\n              \nRailway-controlled crossings: \nrailway staff\n operate the crossing (manually or by remote control)\n, wh\nich is \nalmost always interlocked with railway signalling, so it is not possible to clear the signals for a train un\ntil \nthe crossing is closed to the road. \nT\nhe \nnum\nber\n of \nthis type of crossing\n declined from about 4\n,\n150 in \nthe late \n194\n0s\n to 813 in 2006–2009. \nA\nccident rates \non these crossings also \ndeclined\n and \naccount\ned\n for only about 5% of level crossing fatal accidents and fa\ntalities in 2009. \n&#xa0;\n              \n(2)\n              \nAutomatic crossings:\n \na\nn\n \napproaching \ntrain triggers the operation. \nThe\nir\n numbers grew from zero \nbefore the 1960s\n to 800 in 2001/02–2005, \nbut fell \nto 720 in 2006–2009.\n Accident rates \nare higher because the\nir safe use depends primarily on \nroad users observing warnings \nthat a \ntrain\n i\ns\n approaching\n. In 2009, automatic crossings accounted for 52% of fatal accidents and 54% of fatalities at level crossings. \n&#xa0;\n              \n(\n3)\n              \nPassive (‘user-worked’) crossings, including footpath crossings\n: \nthose\n \ncrossing \nmust check it is clear to cross;\n s\nometimes telephones are provided to check \nwith \nrailway \nstaff\n. \nMost\n level crossings\n are this type\n, \nwhich\n \nare typically on private roads, farms, or footpaths. \nThe\ny\n ha\nve\n declined from about 22,900 in \nlate 1940s \nto 5\n,\n140 in 2006–2009. \nThe\nir\n \naccident rate \n(\nmostly\n pedestrian accidents\n) \nis much lower than automatic crossings\n \nbecause\n they are not \non \npub\nlic\n roads\n and\n \nhave lower\n usage. However, their acc\nident rate has not declined\n \nand \nthey accounted for \n43% of fatal accidents and 41% of fatalities \non level crossings \nin 2009\n.\n&#xa0;\n7\n              \nT\nhe \nreview concluded that the \nprincipal reas\non why the number of fatal \nacci\ndents\n has not declined since the early 1970s is the replacement of railway controlled \ncrossings \nby automatic crossings. However, it \nnotes that \nautomatic crossings have a number of advantages, \nin that t\nhey \ndo\n not need staff and \ncreate\n less delay \nfor\n road users. Nevertheless, they are less safe, so a balance has to be struck between safety, cost and delay. \n&#xa0;\nAre current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved? &#xa0;\nIn addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?&#xa0;\n8\n              \nT\nhere is a comprehensive\n approach to improving safety at level crossings, includ\ning\n a programme of level crossing closures and improvements, risk assessments using the \nAll Level Crossing Risk Model (ALCRM)\n model, thorough accident investigations and an extensive research and deve\nlopment programme.\n \n&#xa0;\n9\n              \nHowever, given that level crossings are places where roads and road users cross the railway, they inevitably remain high risk infrastructure. \nT\nhe most effective way to reduce accidents, deaths and injuries at level crossings is to \nclose the crossings\n if\n possible\n, \nwhich\n is Network Rail’s policy. \nThey have \nclosed 700 level crossings across Britain \n(about \n10\n%\n of the total\n)\n since 2009 as part of \ntheir\n £130m national level crossing investment programme.\n \nHowever, it is \nnot \npossible to \ncl\nose all crossings without a huge investment to provide alternatives, such as tunnels, bridges or road diversions\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n10\n              \nThe next most effective approach \nis\n to design level crossings that depend as little as possible on road users behaving safely\n, \nbecause crossings which depend on the behaviour of road users \nhave the highest accident risks.\n \nAn example of this approach is converting \nautomatic half-barrier crossings to automatic full-barrier crossings with obstacle detection\n, so that a train is not cl\neared to pass the crossing unless it \nis \nclear.\n \n&#xa0;\n11\n              \nGiven the dominance of road user misuse as the cause of level crossing accidents, close co-operation between the railway sector and highway authorities and the police is essential.\n It would also be useful\n if there were fewer different types of level crossings as this would help the public to understand how they should be used.\n \n&#xa0;\n1\n2\n              \nThe level and type\n of information differs significantly by level crossing type and \nsometimes \nwithin a single type of level crossing. \nIn r\noad user surveys and trials\n all \nrespondents underst\nood the ‘stop’ signals \nbut responses to ‘amber’ and ‘not illuminated’ varied.\n \nParticipants identified level crossing advance warning signs, but did not associat\ne the different signs and signals with different types of level crossing. Comprehension of the St Andrew’s cross was particularly poor.\n&#xa0;\n1\n3\n              \nAwareness of the possibility of second trains was low\n, with participants \nexpect\ning\n the barrier to rise immediately after the first train.\n \nIn video scenarios, a\nround 25% \nof \nparticipants would proceed over the crossing despite the presence of the lorry on the far side. Around a quarter of these people did not notice the lorry and a signif\nicant minority notice\nd\n \ni\nt\n \nbut were prepared to start over the level crossing anyway.\n \nThe study recommended \nstandardising barrier and gate mark\nings,\n m\ninimising the variety of signs\n and\n using \nv\nibro-tactile warning\ns\n (\neg rumble strips)\n \nand \ncross hatching \non \nthe approach to\n level crossing\ns\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1\n4\n              \nOther recommendations\n \nincluded \nenhancing the salience of the crossing itself, and sightlines\n to it\n, influencing vehicles’ approach speed\n,\n preparing drivers for the possibility that they may have to stop, integrating level crossing signals with traffic lights or road markings and warning road users about additional trains\n when more than one is passing.\n&#xa0;\n1\n5\n              \nVehicle Activated Sign\ns\n (VAS\ns\n) \nredu\nced \nthe risk of vehicle\ns\n blocking back on level crossings (ie, entering the crossing when the exit is blocked by other vehicles) \nby \n60%\n, \nbut \nonly in the \nshort-term (the first three months), after which blocking back returned to pre-VAS levels.\n \nL\now cost mobile VASs could be deployed in short bursts at sites with blocking back problems, especially  where blocking back is anticipated due to local events or road works. \nT\nhe vast majority of more severe events were \ndue to \nmisjudgements made by drivers\n,\n but a\nlmost a third of drivers were observed trapping the vehicle in front on the crossing.\n&#xa0;1\n6\n              \nI\nmprovements could be made to public awareness of emergency phones at level crossing\ns\n, and \nto \n999 call pathways for reporting an incident.\n Three-quarters of people would call for help when faced with a level crossing incident, and 70% of these would use their mobile phone to call 999. Only 27% would use the level crossing phone. A\ns \nonly 42% of \npeople\n were able to explain how to use an emerge\nncy phone correctly phone visibility\n, and use instructions,\n \nshould be improved\n. A standardised Level Crossing Emergency Protocol should be developed\n, perhaps along the lines of \nNetwork Rail\n’s \nprotocol to support the response to bridge strikes \n&#xa0;\n1\n7\n              \nRoSPA be\nlieves that greater use \nshould be made \nof \nCCTV\n \nand Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology \nat level crossings\n, prioritising those \nwith an identified problem of road user misuse. \nANPR technology enables drivers who mis-use crossings to be identified and issued with a fixed penalty or prosecuted. This would provide a \nstrong\n deterrent, especially if the ANPR cameras are visible and prominent. \nCCTV can provide powerful images to educa\nte road\n users about the dangers of \nmis\nuse\n of level crossings. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?&#xa0;\nIs Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?&#xa0;\n1\n8\n              \nL\nevel crossings represent a growing proportion of the \nall railway deaths\n. According to the review (mentioned above)\n, by \n2009 \ndeaths at level crossings \nrepre\nsented 46% of all railway \nfatal\nities\n (excluding trespassers and suicides) – \nit was 11% in 1946 - 1950\n.\n \nTherefore, improving safety at level crossings should be one of the top safety priorities for the rail budget.\n&#xa0;\n1\n9\n              \nGiven the fact that road users are the main cause of most level crossing accidents, there is a case for road \nbudgets being used to help fund safety improvements at level crossings. The difficulty is that level crossing crashes and casualties are a very small proportion of overall road accidents and casualties (even though they are a major proportion of railway ac\ncidents and casualties). Therefore, it is natural tha\nt road safety budgets are focus\ned on the main road safety issues. \n&#xa0;\n20\n              \nHowever, t\nhe railways, highway authorities, police and HSE need to work closely together to ensure a consistent and integrated appro\nach to level crossing safety, b\no\nth in terms of national policy and local policy at level crossing sites.\n \nNow that some \nresponsibility for public health \nhas been\n transferred to local authorities, \nin England, t\nhe\nre \nshould \nalso be \nopportunities for \ncloser working with public health \nservices.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Is Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?&#xa0;\n21\n              \nMis\nuse\n of level crossings by drivers should be treated as a serious criminal off\nence\n because t\nhe potential \nto cause a catastrophic accident, resulting in multiple fatalities\n,\n is clearly high. A collision between a train and a car at a level crossing in 2004 caus\ned 7 deaths. The law and the penalties should reflect this level of risk.\n R\noSPA \nbelieves\n that \ncurrent \nroad traffic offences should continue to regulate the conduct of drivers at level crossings\n that cross roads\n; i\nt seems unnecessary to create new offences\n.\n&#xa0;\n22\n              \nHowever, \nthere is a case for new offences related to pedestrian behaviour at level crossings\n because r\noad traffic offences do not, in general, regulate the conduct of pedestrians. \nIn 2012/1\n3, 4\n pedestrians were killed at level crossings\n, 302 were involved in near misses with trains at level crossings and 1,822 incidents of pedestrian misuse of level crossings were reported. \nThe RSSB has \nestimated\n that the risk of death or serious injury to pedestrians makes up 77% of the total risk to th\nose crossing the railway at level crossings\n. A\n large proportion of this risk occurs at footpath crossings.\n&#xa0;\n2\n3\n              \nTherefore, \nRoSPA believes that there is a case for \nnew offences that would apply to pedestrians who deliberately mis-use level crossing. However,\n it \nmust be made \nclear \nat the crossings \nwhen and how \npedestrians \nshould cross\n so that \nthey \ndo not \nface charges for reasonable mistakes.\n&#xa0;\n2\n4\n              \nIt is important that laws and penalties act as a deterrent, which means that they have to be widely known, \nand \nthere\n must also be a perception that those who breach the laws are likely to be detected and prosecuted.\n&#xa0;\nHow should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?&#xa0;\n25\n              \nAs stated in \nour\n response\n to \nthe \nLaw Commission and the Scottish Law Commission\n’s\n 2010 consultation paper\n RoSPA thinks that t\nhe regulation of safety at level crossings should be governed by the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.\n \nHowever, g\niven that railways and level crossings are a specialised area of knowledge and practice, \nwe\n agre\ne\nd\n \nwith the \nprovisional proposal\n in the consultation paper\n \n‘\nthat ORR, as the safety regulator for the railways, should remain as the body with overall responsibility for safety regulation at level crossings.\n’ \nFollowing this consultation, \na\n \ndraft Bill and \nRegulations under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 are being produced.\n \n&#xa0;\n26\n              \nH\nighway a\nuthorities also have \nduties to ensure the roads \nnear level crossing \nare safe to use, \nand \nappropriate signs and road markings are provided\n. \nAs stated in paragraphs 21 – 25 above, RoSPA believes that deliberate mis-use of level crossings by road users should be treated as a serious criminal offence under road \ntraf\nfic law\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2\n7\n              \nCo-ordination between\n all the agencies involved\n is essential. \nNeithe\nr the rail sector nor the HSE have the necessary expertise (or resources) to manage the highways around level crossings and highway authorities and the police do not have the necessary expertise (or resources) to manage the railway side of level crossings.\n \nVery clear working relationships and protocols between the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)\n, \nthe Office of Rail Regulation (\nORR)\n, Network Rail, \nhighway authorit\nies, \nroad safety practitioners\n and the \npolice is \ncrucial.\n A National Level Crossing Safety Strategy \n(similar to one produced in Australia\n) \nmight help co\n-o\nrdinate the activities of all these agencies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?&#xa0;\n28\n              \nRaising public awareness is \ndifficult to achieve and maintain without the funds to conduct sustained publicity and education campaigns, involving television, cinema, radio, online, social media and print adverts and resources.\n&#xa0;\n29\n              \nA wide range of education and campaign materials ar\ne\n \navailable\n, including Network Rail’s ‘Don’t Run The Risk’ campaign. Other \nexample\ns include\n the \nOffice of Rail Regulation\n’s\n guide to using level crossings safely\n, which is\n aimed at pedestrians and motorists.\n \nA range of school \nresources\n and other materials for parents, level crossing users and youth groups are published by Network\n Rail.\n \n&#xa0;\n30\n              \nAdvice is, of course, only useful if it is widely disseminated and promoted and reaches its intended audience. The ORR \nand Network Rail \nshould work\n closely with Local Authority Road Safety Officers, other road safety and road user organisations\n, and public health practitioners,\n to \nincrease the use \nof the\nir campaigns and resources\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n1\n              \nThe \nLASER \nAlliance\n,\n which is \nhosted by RoSPA\n, and is commi\ntted to\n helping people learn how to make responsible decisions about safety and risk\n \nhas\n a useful role to play in promoting level crossing safety, in conjunction with road and railway safety partners. \nA number of permanent safety centre members of\n the\n LASER Allia\nnce\n,\n including Lifeskills (Bristol), DangerPoint (North Wales), Flashpoint (Bodmin), Safeside (Birmingham), Risk Factory (Edinburgh), Warning Zone (Leicester)\n,\n have scenarios and distribute educational \nresources about railway safety.\n&#xa0;\nEvaluation&#xa0;\n3\n2\n              \nEvaluation is a \nkey way \nof\n assess\ning\n whether \neducation initiatives are effective, and whether they can be improved. RoSPA, the Department for Transport and road safety practitioners produced an online evaluation toolkit (called “E-valu-it”) to help practit\nioners to evaluate their road safety education, training and publicity interventions.\n A similar approach and resource could be developed for railway education campaigns. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n As noted in paragraph 2, this had reduced to an average of 9 deaths pa. by 2012/13.\n \n “Level Crossings A Joint Consultation Paper”, The Law Commission Consultation Paper No 194 and The Scottish Law Commission Discussion Paper No 143, 2010\nhttp://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/cp194_Level_Crossings_Consultation.pdf\n \n&#xa0;\n \n              \n“Annual Safety Performance Report 2012/13”, RSSB, 2013\nhttp://www.rssb.co.uk/SPR/REPORTS/Pages/Annual-Safety-Performance-Report-2012-2013.aspx\n \n&#xa0;\n \n              \n“Our Approach to Managing Level Crossing Safety”, Network Rail, \n              \nhttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents4424Level20Crossing20Policy.pdf.pdf\n&#xa0;\n  “Fatal accidents at railway level crossings in Great Britain 1946–2009”, Andrew W.
