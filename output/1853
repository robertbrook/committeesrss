[normal]&#xa0;[bold]DCLG Select Committee inquiry into Local Government Procurement[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written e[bold]vidence s[bold]ubmitted by the[bold] West London Alliance[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background[bold] to the West London Alliance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The WLA is a partnership of six
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]West London councils - Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Harrow, 
[normal]Hillingdon and Hounslow.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These councils serve a population of 1.8 million people and have a joint annual expenditure of £3.8bn a year. There are over 77,000 VAT registered business and nearly 700,000 employees active in this West London area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The WLA a
[normal]ims to: promote the interests of West London residents and businesses; improve and develop public services; and to reduce their costs through collaboration.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]representing the interests of West London in terms of economic development, transpor
[normal]t and spatial planning policy, the WLA
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]facilitates a number of major improvement and efficiency programmes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The WLA is also a founder member of the West London Partnership (WLP) which brings together the public, private and voluntary sectors in West Lond
[normal]on to promote the economic, social and environmental interests of West London businesses and residents.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The [bold]West London Alliance[bold] coordinates collaborative procurement activity with and on behalf of member boroughs[bold]&#xa0;[bold]There are currently 
[normal]seven major
[normal] 
[normal]improvement and efficiency programmes in which WLA members collaborate when programmes align with their council’s objectives and plans.  Some programmes also involve working with other councils in London, particularly the Tri-Boroughs (Hammersm
[normal]ith &amp; Fulham, Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The seven programmes are;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further programmes are in development
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As well as improving services, the aim is to achieve savings
[normal] and/
[normal]or avoi
[normal]d costs. The area target for this is at least £57m in the period up to 2016/17.  Programme delivery has been supported by grant aid from a number of sources, particularly Capital Ambition.  DCLG grant was awarded to LBH&amp;F on behalf of the WL Housing Partne
[normal]rship, while the WestTrans Partnership secured grant from the TfL Sub Regional Fund.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NB: Due to the nature of the WLA’s [bold]C[bold]o[bold]llaborative [bold]P[bold]rocurement[bold] [bold]activities this submission to the CLG select committee focuse[bold]s[bold] mainly on [bold]questions 2 and 3[bold].[bold] 
[normal]Accordingly [bold]Boroughs themselves will respond on the other four CLG questions directly.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Collaborative Protocol[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In managing WLA multi borough procurements we adopt a protocol that requires 
[normal]the nomination of a lead borough for
[normal]; 
[normal]p
[normal]rocurement
[normal], legal service, financial 
[normal]advice, technical specification, HR, TUPE, IT, quality, safety and environment.
[normal]  
[normal]The lead borough may be different for each discipline and each project. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The protocol requires that we place our collective trust on the integrity and robustness of the lead 
[normal]boroughs internal policies
[normal], 
[normal]processes 
[normal]and people 
[normal]to ensure rectitude.

[normal]ailed analysis of the business case for collaboration and a business proposition for the creation of a public health procurement hub was produced, demonstrating potential efficiency savings.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] West London Alliance supports and facilitates a considerable amount of knowledge sharing and networking activity which
[normal] 
[normal]support
[normal]s
[normal] council services
[normal] in 
[normal] 
[normal]future 
[normal]planning through the
[normal] provision of 
[normal] intelligence, learning and benchmarking 
[normal]and 
[normal]provides
[normal] opportunities for joint 
[normal]procurement 
[normal]activities and collaboration
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The key officers groups which meet on a regular basis are the West London
[normal];
[normal] Treasurers, Environment Directors, Planning Policy Officers, Regeneration Officers, Heads of Procurement,
[normal] Proper
[normal]ty and Estates Managers,
[normal] Leisure Officers and Information Managers.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The WLA also facilitates two Improvement and Efficiency Network events each year. These bring together council officers to discuss common issues and challenges and share best practice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition to networking within West London, the WLA has been contributing to and learning from the experience of other councils in London
[normal] and beyond
[normal]. Since 2011 it has chaired the London Collaborative Efficiency Network (LCEN) and the London Economic De
[normal]velopment Sub-Regions Group.  The latter discusses key issues affecting 
[normal]procurement in 
[normal]London such as
[normal];
[normal] employment, funding opportunities and wider strategic economic development issues. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The West London councils are represented on the London Procurement S
[normal]trategy Board by representatives from the Heads of Procurement and Treasurers Groups. They have been developing important linkages between the London-wide programme and the West London Procurement Board and Hub.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]WLA observations specifically related to [bold]cross borough procurement projects[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Some p[bold]oints worthy of [bold]further[bold] [bold]explor[bold]ation[bold];
[normal]              
[normal]Most boroughs are very supportive of collaboration at the top level of the political and administrative 
[normal]strata.  It makes sense after all to seek economies of scale and to reduce management overheads for both the contracting entities as well as the client organisations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Political realities however have to be recognised and taken into consideration.
[normal]Boroughs
[normal] will have their own individual Missions Statements, Visions and Policy Directives.  These will have been develop
[normal]ed
[normal] from manifestos and electoral promises with a view to delivering to resident
[normal]s
[normal] outcomes that are politically desirable and that politicians 
[normal]are
[normal] held accountable for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When viewed across a multi borough environment, aligning procurement activity that dovetails these absolutes into collective deliverables is 
[normal]challenging
[normal].  There will always be borough specific imperatives from a local perspective
[normal] that need to be understood.
[normal] 
[normal]That said, the common theme across all public sector bodies is the obligation to 
[normal]operate
[normal] as efficient
[normal]ly
[normal] as possible, to seek and to gain best value, and to drive out excess costs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is 
[normal]arguably the job of procurement 
[normal]professi
[normal]onals
[normal] and their client organisations to make the economic case for collaboration. To do this they have to understand how such a case may be constructed and where derived benefits will flow from.  
[normal]T
[normal]his goes beyond simply specifying a requirement and multipl
[normal]ying this up across a number of boroughs. It is more about understanding from a bidding 
[normal]contractor’s
[normal] perspective how they can
[normal] be incentivised to
[normal] reshape the way services are configured and delivered so that costs can be driven out and benefits delivered in
[normal] parallel with enhancing the quality of the outcomes. These skills are and this knowledge is not always readily available in-house to boroughs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is often at this client / procurement level that collaborations become frustrated as there can be a disconn
[normal]ect between the high level political will and the ability of the departmental teams to
[normal]; 
[normal]a) 
[normal]be able
[normal] to 
[normal]see
[normal] the benefits of such and 
[normal]make change 
[normal]happen, 
[normal]b) be able to and objectively assess and 
[normal]articulate 
[normal]upwards 
[normal]the benefits 
[normal]and 
[normal]risks involved with making s
[normal]uch changes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As mentioned previously collaboration can be frustrated where it is not high enough on 
[normal]the
[normal] agenda to bring it to the forefront of peoples thinking and more importantly their future planning.
[normal] 
[normal]More often than not 
[normal]borough 
[normal]procurers
[normal] are content with satisfying the
[normal]ir
[normal] immediate requirements, rather than planning for the future. They will often cite lack of resources, time or other priorities as matters that divert them from pursuing collaboration.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An underlying issue may be that collaboration threatens the status quo within an individual borough and individuals or the departments they work in may see it as portending the future and their control over it.   As with all change unless people can see th
[normal]eir role in the future they may well challenge it or seek to frustrate it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other matters that can frustrate collaboration or procurement improvement can be;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Lack of vision[bold] /[bold] [bold]Apathy / Parochialism[bold] / Lack of confidence[bold]•[bold]              [bold]Organisational inadequacy[bold] / inadequate skill base to take on new challenges[bold]•[bold]              [bold]Limited capacity or confidence in dealing with [bold]a changed risk/ reward profile[bold]•[bold]              [bold]Mistrust of partners in other boroughs[bold] / Political alignment[bold]•[bold]              [bold]Fear of lack of control[bold] / individual budgeting[bold] / Poor unders[bold]tanding of risk[bold]•[bold]              [bold]High staff [bold]turnover /[bold] churn / overabundance of interim staff [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]These matters can be overcome through dialogue and working with colleagues to share a clear vision of the future from senior levels downwards, however this takes time and care
[normal]. Peoples concerns need to be aired and valued and they need to know that they will be supported in any new initiative. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Staff will need to recognise that the general direction of travel within the procurement fraternity is towards collaboration and that 
[normal]they will be given support to up skill and embrace this on behalf, not only of their own employers, but also the wider regional public sector community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As previously discussed, many 
[normal]local authority procurement staff were traditionally recruited on the basis that they were required to understand the corporate and European procurement rules and are able to ensure control over and compliance with these strictly controlled requirements.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his offers up a level of protection for Authorities from challenges from aggrieved bidders and also from the EU commission itself from charges of non-compliance. Both of which can incur costly remedies if 
[normal]a borough is 
[normal]found to be at fault.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This being the
[normal] case then the room for a
[normal] more
[normal] entrepreneurial approach to procurement is not only limited but could be viewed as being positively discouraged by more risk adverse boroughs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a norm then it could be suggested that the staff that populate procurement dep
[normal]artments may not have the
[normal] incentive
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]aptitude or the proficiency to engage fully in what the private sector may classify as normal commercially lead behaviour
[normal]. 
[normal]N
[normal]egotiation and deal making 
[normal]may therefore 
[normal]not be familiar territory for them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is relatively easy to hide behind process and restrictive rules to avoid being commercial driven, however without challenging the status quo and testing the art of the possible the ability to drive through change and make value driven deals will be frus
[normal]trated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Training can be given to enhance commercial skills however instilling the confidence into individuals to plan for and to use these skill in a live procurement environment may be more of a problem if those staff are not naturally inclined to engag
[normal]e in this activity or do not believe they were recruited to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold].[bold]              [bold]What Skills, Knowledge Training and Education are required?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]For most borough 
[normal]staff
[normal] 
[normal]multi
[normal] borough collaborative
[normal] procurement 
[normal]projects
[normal] are novel. They tend to be ‘first off’ 
[normal]/ 
[normal]‘one
[normal] off’ e
[normal]xercises for them.
[normal] By necessity then 
[normal]the WLA 
[normal]training focus is in this area.
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst not wishing to make collaborative procurement training an industry in its own right, there is an opportunity and benefits to sharing best practice between boroughs and 
[normal]between London borough regions on this topic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Template and example documents are kept on the WLA knowledge portal
[normal] -
[normal] which is a
[normal]lso a
[normal] 
[normal]r
[normal]epository for lessons learned material
[normal],

[normal]o
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]don’ts
[normal], 
[normal]case studies 
[normal]and links to best practice.
[normal] 
[normal]All material deve
[normal]loped by our projects is recycled as learning material for others.
[normal] 
[normal]We also maintain an ‘experienced practitioner’ network to act as a touch stone for future projects
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Collaborative Workshops[bold] (example)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In June 2013 the WLA ran a procurement workshop
[normal] entitled 
[normal]Listening, Learning and Improving[bold]. 
[normal]This was c
[normal]haired by one of our Chief Executives and peopled with strategic directors, procurement and delivery staff, as well as Legal, IT, HR and other representatives. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Objective;[bold] 
[normal]shar
[normal]ing
[normal] experiences both goo
[normal]d and bad and discuss
[normal]ing
[normal] solutions to problems and how resolutions were achieved
[normal], 
[normal]test
[normal]ing
[normal] whether optimum solutions were found. Or how we could have done better?
[normal] Thus b
[normal]uilding up a network of 
[normal]‘people who can’[bold] 
[normal]within our boroughs - such that they can be 
[normal]called on in the future to help, support and if necessary lead on future procurements
[normal]. 
[normal]People who can[bold] 
[normal]are not necessarily procurement professionals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We also run regular procurement 
[normal]learning 
[normal]workshop sessions for the WLA and other boroughs to attend. Each 
[normal]Worksop is themed and for each we invite guest speakers to discuss relevant procurement and supply issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Topics covered to date have included;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]Green Deal[bold] / [bold]•[bold]              [bold]Eco[bold] / [bold]Fuel Poverty[bold] [bold]/ [bold]London Living Wage[bold] /[bold] [bold]RE:FIT / RE:NEW[bold]•[bold]              [bold]Social Inclusion / Third Sector [bold]engagement[bold]•[bold]              [bold]SME / [bold]Cross River Partnership[bold] / Involving Local Suppliers[bold]•[bold]              [bold]Collaborative Procurement[bold]•[bold]              [bold]GPS [bold]initiatives - Contingent labour[bold]•[bold]              [bold]Digital Inclusion [bold]/ P[bold]an London roads and highways framework - GLA[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We have also had in attendance at our workshops re
[normal]presentatives from;
[normal] 
[normal]non WLA b
[normal]oroughs, London Councils, GLA, Central Government Departments, 
[normal]contractors, 
[normal]trade bodies, 
[normal]regional efficiency agencies specialist industry experts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Within the WLA
[normal] we have created a formal network of boards, network groups, directors, senior staff and operational staff - flowing down from the Chief Executives - who meet every 4 weeks. To ensure ownership of all matters related to procurement and other collaboration.
[normal]See attached chart.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of procurement the focus of this activity is the Procurement Board.  Which is the governing body for the WLA head of procurement
[normal]’
[normal]s programme and to which the annual business plan is presented, debated and signed off.
[normal] 
[normal]This Bo
[normal]ard 
[normal]is 
[normal]chaired by the Chief Executive of Hounslow Council and it has wide membership across the WLA group of
[normal]; Head of Legal Services (Brent
[normal]), Director of Finance (Hillingdon), Me
[normal]mbers (from Hounslow and Barnet
[normal]), Treasurer (Kensington and Chelsea), Head of 
[normal]Procurement (Ealing), Director of Environment (Harrow) and the Director of the WLA.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Within the WLA we operate a standardised 
[normal]Benefit Realisation[bold] 
[normal]process. The concept is aimed at making the link between the cost savings and the benefits identified and established in a business case and secured from a procurement competition, to that which Finance Directors within a borough recognise as being delive
[normal]red on the ground. Thus closing the budgeting
[normal] /
[normal] 
[normal]procurement 
[normal]cycle loop where historically there has been little or no correlation between the costs and benefits that 
[normal]are 
[normal]claim
[normal]ed as
[normal] resultant from a procurement activity
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst this requires extra work as 
[normal]it is a planned discipline within the procurement and finance departments of a borough 
[normal]–
[normal] it
[normal] is useful in that it helps
[normal] in bringing credibility and corporate ownership to the savings claims.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Benefits Realisation process if overseen by a Board made up o
[normal]f the Finance Directors from all of the boroughs, and is  chaired by an independent Treasurer from outside of the immediate WLA group.
