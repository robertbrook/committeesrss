We have \nalso set out, in Appendix \n1\n, the Tax Faculty’s \nTen T\nenets for a \nB\netter \nTax S\nystem by which we benchmark proposals to change the tax system\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nICAEW is a professional membership organisation, supporting over 14\n2\n,000 chartered accountants around \nthe world. Through our technical knowledge, skills and expertise, we provide insight and leadership to the global accountancy and finance profession.\n&#xa0;\n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur members provide financial knowledge and guidance based on the highest professional, technical and eth\nical standards. We develop and support individuals, organisations and communities to help them achieve long-term, sustainable economic value.\n&#xa0;\n6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Tax Faculty is the voice of tax within ICAEW and is a leading authority on taxation. Internationally recognis\ned as a source of expertise, the faculty is responsible for submissions to tax authorities on behalf of ICAEW as a whole. It also provides a range of tax services, including \nTAXline\n, a monthly journal sent to more than 8,000 members, a weekly newswire and \na referral scheme.\n&#xa0;\n7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Draft Finance Bill 2014 clauses propose legislation affecting four aspects of partnership tax:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn this submission, we confine our comments to the first two of these proposals as these will be of the greatest concern to a large number of partnerships.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe law on partnerships dates from the Partnership Act 1890. A partnership is transparent for tax purposes. Consequently, although a partnership must submit a tax return each year \nshowing\n the \npartnership profits, any profits are allocated to the partners and taxed on them, with individual partners paying income tax in respect of any allocated share of partnership profits through their own personal tax returns.\n&#xa0;\n10.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLimited liability partnerships (L\nLPs) were introduced in 2000 to provide an alternative business structure. However, the tax rules for LLPs follow those for ordinary partnerships. \n&#xa0;\n11.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll partnerships are treated in the same way no matter how many partners are in the partnership. Historical\nly there were some limits on the number of partners that could form a partnership although many types of professional partnerships were exempted from this requirement and in 2002 the upper limit was abolished entirely. The vast majority of partnerships in \nthe UK have only \ntwo\n or \nthree\n partners\n,\n but some (usually professional) partnerships are very large, with 500 partners or more. \n&#xa0;\n12.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe tax rules for partnerships are not \nalways \neasy to understand. Most of the guidance on practical application \nand \npractices \nfor taxing partnerships is set down by HMRC in guidance.\n&#xa0;\n13.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe increasing divide between employment law and tax law leads to more uncertainty, complexity and unfairness as individuals are taxed as employees\n,\n but w\nithout\n equivalent \nemployment rights. The proposals to tax LLP salaried partners as employees will add a further group of individuals who will be in this position. \n&#xa0;\n14.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe papers\n and supporting documents\n, published on 10 December \n2013 \nrun to \na total of \n117 pages. The draft legislation is highly complicated and we are still analysing the detail of the proposals.\n&#xa0;\n15.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are concerned that the proposals are too complex for practical implementation and are disproportionate to the problem\ns\n they are attempting to resolve. The stated \nobjectives\n of the proposals are to level the playing field and to tackle tax avoidance, but we are not convinced these proposals support the objectives.\n&#xa0;\n16.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLLPs are a flexible and competitive commercial structure \nand\n,\n since they were introduced\n,\n the number of them ha\ns\n grown considerably. However, the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these new rules will significantly undermine the \ncommercial \ncase for using an LLP. There are serious commercial implications to \nthis new legislation and we consider it likely that business\nes\n will now favour using \na company structure, even if an LLP might have been a better structure\n. \n&#xa0;\n17.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe anti avoidance legislation in new s\n \n863C, ITTOIA 2005 is particularly \ndifficult to understand\n \nand \nappears to \nrely on deciding whether arrangements have been put in place with a main purpose of ensuring that someone is not a salaried member. \nOn our reading of this legislation, potentially all salaried members would be within the legislation. \n&#xa0;\n18.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExam\nple 17 of the Technical guidance provides a simple illustration\n of the problem\n:\n&#xa0;\nP has been an employee of the DEF LLP. She has reached that point in her career where she is offered membership.\n&#xa0;\nIn order to become a member, P needs to invest in the LLP. Sh\ne has some capital of her own, and the LLP arranges with the Bank for her to have a normal commercial loan to cover the balance. An undertaking is given that on P’s retirement from DEF LLP, the firm will pay back the loan directly out of P’s capital accoun\nt and, if necessary, any undrawn remuneration, with full recourse against P if these amounts prove insufficient.\n&#xa0;\nThese arrangements have been put in place to enable P to become a full member of the DEF LLP. They have not been put in place to enable P to e\nvade \n(sic)\n \nbeing a Salaried Member. P faces genuine risk, she has invested in the DEF LLP and does owe the Bank money, which she will need to repay and, in the interim, she will have to pay interest.\n&#xa0;\n19.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn our view, b\necoming a full member\n,\n on terms akin to t\nhose of a partner in a traditional partnership, is not avoiding being a Salaried Member\n and should clearly not be within the ambit of the legislation\n.\n \nWhile we are pleased with this conclusion, and with the other \nexamples designed to show the working of th\ne Salaried Members test as a whole, we do not consider this compensates for the overly complex legislation itself\n. T\nhis appears to be another example of ‘taxed according to the law but untaxed by concession’. \n&#xa0;\n20.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, part of the rationale behind the\n new rules is to stop profits being held in corporate form; but this will still \nhappen\n using simpler corporate structures instead.\n&#xa0;\n21.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Office of Tax Simplification has been conducting a review of partnership tax, the results of which were published on 22 \nJanuary 2014. Introducing complex legislation which will affect many businesses, potentially leading to structural change while the results of the review are still being considered\n,\n seems an unnecessary complication\n and does little to provide much needed s\ntability and certainty to the UK tax system\n.\n&#xa0;\n22.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese proposed new rules introduce a significant additional compliance cost for LLPs. These are complex rules that will impact on \nsetting up new business structures and then again to any \nchange\ns in business structures. Seeking advice on such rules will always tend \nto be \nmore expensive \ndue to \nits\n highly specialist nature\n. \n&#xa0;\n23.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe guidance runs to 56 pages and includes numerous examples to assist users. While this is most welcome and helps users to \nunderstand the intended application, it is no substitute for simple \nand \nclear legislation. \nThe rules appear to be quite widely drafted and potentially catch a number of situations which we do not think should be caught. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n24.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe agree that there should not be a presumption of self-employment for a member of an LLP, but \nconversely \nnor should there be a presumption of employment. \n&#xa0;\n25.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHMRC’s guidance states that ‘The salaried member legislation is being introduced \nso that those members who are effectively in the position of employees will be taxed as employees whilst those members who are in a position equivalent to partners will continue to have the same tax treatment as partners.’ The proposals do not achieve this\n. To do so\n,\n \nany tests should be by reference to the \nexisting status test rules for income tax\n. Instead, we have an entirely new set of \ntests proposed as new s\n \n863B, ITTOIA 2005.\n&#xa0;\n26.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe existing rules for determining an individual’s employment status could be\n used for an LLP. Since a large number of LLPs are likely to be professional partnerships, these are most likely to have the expertise necessary to interpret the exi\ns\nting status test rules correctly. \nThus, f\nurther law should not be necessary.\n&#xa0;\n27.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese propos\nals suggest that \nthe existing law for identifying \nwhether a person is \nemploy\ned or \nself employ\ned is inadequate. If so, then we would have thought that those rules need to be reviewed and a comprehensive rule introduced that works for all business forms. \n&#xa0;\n28.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe key issue here remains the disparity between the tax \ncost\n of employment as opposed to self employment. This is a structural problem within the tax system caused by employers\n’\n NIC. This difference creates tension for many more taxpayers than just those i\nn partnerships and is particularly problematic for freelancers. \n&#xa0;29.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are numerous practical problems with the detail of the legislation. \nFour e\nxamples given to us by our members so far include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;30.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhose \nLLP members subject to the new legislation \nwill be taxed as employees from 6 April 2014.\n This is too short a period to make any necessary changes given that at that date many LLPs will be part way thro\nugh an accounting period.\n \nFor example, \nABC LLP \nhas a year end of 30 April. Under the new rules, \nC \nwill be \ntreated as an employee from 6 April 2014. If the partnership decides to actually make C an employee from 2014/15, rather than just deeming him to be s\no for tax purposes, there is \nin our view \ninsufficient time to rearrange his employment status.\n&#xa0;\n31.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe any change should apply from the start of the first accounting period after 6 April 2014.\n&#xa0;\n32.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are also concerned that the Real Time Information \nrequirements have not been considered. The new RTI penalty rules are also effective from 6 April 2014 and we believe that the combination of the two could give rise to considerable administrative burdens\n and practical implementation problems\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n33.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile we agree that the use of mixed membership partnerships for the sole purpose of avoiding tax on the profits drawn out of a business should be addressed to ensure that a fair amount of tax is paid\n, we do not agree with all the \nchanges proposed. \n&#xa0;\n34.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposals fail to accommodate the commercial and historic reasons why some businesses have a mixed partnership structure. For example, many businesses hold land within a corporate partner or use such a member to build up working cap\nital requirements. The fundamental rule of partnership tax is that all the profits are allocated each year to the partners and then each must pay their share of the tax. Of course the business could then choose to physically retain the cash representing so\nme of the partners’ profit shares, but \nthis results\n in a relatively high charge on reinvestment as compared to retaining profits in a company\n.\n The use of a company within an LLP structure therefore helps to narrow the tax disincentive to retain and reinves\nt earnings which comes with just using an LLP.\n \n&#xa0;\n35.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOther mixed partnerships include a corporate partner as a member in order to access reliefs or tax credits only available to companies such as research and development tax credits\n or for employee share schemes\n.\n&#xa0;\n36.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs far as mixed partnerships are concerned\n,\n we would like to see a de \nminimis\n in order to exclude many of the small\nest\n businesses from the\nse\n proposals; we would prefer to see them excluded by legislation rather than by guid\nance.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;37.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAfter a period of consultation\n,\n the Government adopted the Tax Consultation Framework in March 2011. The Framework set\ns\n out five stages of consultation: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n38.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn cases where tax avoidance was in point there might be the need to introduce measures without the prior consultation envisaged in the Framework. \n&#xa0;\n39.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe framework has provided an improved approach to designing, developing and implementing tax policy. How\never, we have two particular concerns about it:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n40.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe problem with these impact assessments is that the figures o\nften appear to be based on a wholly unrealistic assessment of what changes are actually needed to implement any proposals and what management and due diligence processes are needed to ensure that any changes are correctly implemented. There is a need for c\nonsultation with business and professional advisers at an early stage to identify in detail what needs to be done and by whom\n so that such processes can be built in to any \ncostings\n.\n&#xa0;\n41.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn relation to the second point, w\nhile generally the process has improved there have been some examples where this has not been the case. \nI\nf we take RTI again, we raised numerous concerns during the consultation process, particularly in respect of the timetable and the need to submit returns ‘on or before’ the payment date. While there have been welcome changes made as a result of the consult\nation process, we believe there should have been greater prior recognition of the potential problems and how they could have been addressed. \nWe \nalso \nhave similar concerns with the rules \nthat were \nintroduced imposing an annual tax on enveloped dwellings\n whi\nch looked to us to be largely unworkable\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n42.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn our meetings with Ministers we have said that we want the Chancellor to re-commit to a simpler tax system \nto\n restore the tax system’s reputation for simplicity, stability and predictability. \nIn our view t\nhe\n pa\nrtnership \nproposals are in direct conflict with that aim\n.\n&#xa0;\n43.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn November 2010\n,\n the Government published a Roadmap for Corporation Tax which has been welcomed by business. We would now like a similar document to be published for perso\nnal tax. Certainty about the taxes individuals must pay on their income and chargeable gains is a contributory factor to a business’s decision to base itself in the UK. \n&#xa0;\n44.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe key elements of the business roadmap were: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n45.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n \nproposed \ncomplex new rules on partnerships and offshore intermediaries \nshould not be allowed to \nimpact o\nrdinary transactions. \n&#xa0;\n46.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt Budget 2013, the Chancellor announced that the government would consult on changes to two aspects of the tax rules on partnerships in order to prevent tax loss ar\nising from: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n47.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt was proposed that t\nhose changes w\nould \ntake effect from 6 April 20\n14. \n&#xa0;\n48.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe initial proposals were published in May 2013 and we responded to those in TAXREP 35/13\n where we raised a number of concerns about the proposals\n.\n&#xa0;\n49.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile some of our concerns have been addressed, the fundamental challenges we made then are still present in the revised \nproposals set out above\n. \n&#xa0;\n50.&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summary, w\nhile we welcome the new approach to tax policy making with \nits emphasis on \ni\nmproved \nconsultation, we consider that Government and its advisers \n(\nboth \nin HM Treasury and \nHMRC\n)\n need to \ndo more to address \nthe \nlegitimate concerns \non proposals \nexpressed by business. \nIn particular\n, creating more employees for tax purposes without regard to the e\nmployment law position\n, while underestimating the costs and not recognising that \nbusiness\nes\n \nmay wish \nto retain profits for working capital\n,\n shows a failure to understand \nhow \nbusiness\nes operate. \nT\nhe proposals fail to reflect the need for a tax system that i\ns simple and certain to operate and which aligns with business needs. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCopyright © ICAEW 201\n4\nAll rights reserved.\n&#xa0;This document may be reproduced\n \nwithout specific permission, in whole or part, free of charge and in any format or medium, subject to the conditions that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Where third-party copyright material has been identi\nfied application for permission must be made to the copyright holder.\n&#xa0;\nicaew.com\n/\ntaxfac\n&#xa0;\nThe tax system should be:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe ten tenets\n \nare explained in more detail in our discuss\nion document published in October 1999 as TAXGUIDE 4/99 (see \nicaew.com/en/technical/tax/tax-facul\nty/~/media/Files/Technical/Tax/Tax%20news/TaxGuides/TAXGUIDE-4-99-Towards-a-Better-tax-system.ashx\n )\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n"
