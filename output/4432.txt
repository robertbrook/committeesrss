[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0; Kantar Media, Purpose Remit Tracking Study 2011-2012, July 2012. RAJAR analysis. Ofcom, The Communications Market 2012: Radio and audio, July 2012. RadioCentre analysis - Based on BBC’s total increase in share of hours of 4.7 percentage points for 15+ listeners between 1999 and 2012 being exclusively at the expense of the original commercial radio share of 47.8 (so 9.8% as a proportion of this) – and this 9.8% loss being applied to the proportion of commercial radio gross revenue (£552m in 2012). Around 75% of total revenue according to industry estimates.  RadioCentre analysis - Based on Radio 1 and Radio 2’s combined increase in share of hours of 6.5 percentage points in the 25-44 age group between 1999 and 2012 being exclusively at the expense of the original commercial radio share of 61.3% in 1999 (so 10.6% as a proportion of this) – and this 10.6% loss being applied to the proportion of commercial radio gross revenue aimed at 25-44s, which available evidence suggests is around 75% (£414.5m in 2012).
