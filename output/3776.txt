[[[Brian Gilbert – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I am increasingly concerned about the continual increase in off-roading by bikes and 4x4s, plus quadbikes not only in the National Parks but right across the county, and the failure of present government legislation to deal with it and would like to recommend that further clauses affecting rights of way should be added to the present legislation to enable the wide spread problem to be dealt with in a more positive manner.&#xa0;The damage and disruption caused by this activity is severely against the basic ethos of National Parks and life in the countryside and is not something which should have to be tolerated by residents of communities affected 24 hours a day; it reduces peoples quality of life which is definitely not taken into account by these people on bikes and 4x4s, also quads.&#xa0;I live in Pilsley Village on the Chatsworth Estate, a single street in the village, 'High Street', provides access for these offroaders to and from Bradley Lane, they are aggressive, arrogant and abusive, and usually drive in a very dangerous manner doing wheelies etc up and down high street. It is impossible to remonstrate with them in anyway because what they are doing is supposed to be legal.&#xa0;For a great number of years, Pilsley Village and also villages in the area which are too numerous to mention have been complaining and campaigning to all local authorities to no avail also we have formed action groups.&#xa0;Last year on 4, 5, 6 December 2012 I attended a public inquiry meeting on Bradley Lane held over the three full days in Bradley Village Hall.&#xa0;The meeting was conducted by a Inspector called Mr Mark Yates, the meeting was well attended by the reps of County Council, off roaders and Pilsley area representatives. In my opinion Mr Yates conducted the meeting in a fair and professional manner. The same applies to the following site meeting up and down Bradley Lane. Pilsley residents were very pleased to hear his eventual decision to redesignate Bradley Lane to bridleway status.&#xa0;However the off roaders have appealed against his decision putting the bridleway status in doubt. Also it seems we are to get another Public Inquiry Meeting.  Also the ongoing expense to public taxpayers must be tremendous considering the build up and the conduct of such meetings.&#xa0;A few years ago when Bradley Lane was becoming very rutted and muddy the County Council estimate to repair it was £75,000 plus £5,000 for them to maintain it. It has since been repaired but the off roaders are now destroying the new surface so that it will need repairing yet again. If more positive legislation was in place to restrict or ban this activity hundreds of thousands of pounds of valuable public money could be saved in road repairs, public meetings and endless hours of office work.  Therefore I think it most important that members of the Committee advising the Deregulation Bill understand the scale of off roading in the Peak District and elsewhere and the problems and distress it is causing and would like them to consider whatever additions to the Bill are necessary to eliviate the problems and improve the quality of life for communities. &#xa0;I enclose photos of off road bikers using Bradley Lane also the extent of damage to the original damage by 4x4s, bikers and quad bikes. The lane became impassable for any other users.&#xa0;I also enclose photos and report of a family vehicle accidently going down Bradley Lane in the dark. The vehicle contained a young mother and two young children. &#xa0;Since the photos were taken Bradley Lane has been repaired at Great Expense to taxpayers. The off roaders, bikers, 4x4 quads etc. are continuing to use lane and are damaging the new surface which means it will eventually need repairing yet again.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;9 September 13&#xa0;&#xa0;
