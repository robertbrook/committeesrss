"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the London Borough of Enfield (SLC 030)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.              Introduction&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nI am the Cabinet Member for Environment at Enfield Council and my portfolio includes local traffic and transport matters. The Council is the traffic and highway authority for most roads in the borough, including all of those with level crossings. I am also\n a ward Councillor for Southbury Ward, which has been significantly impacted by the recent closure of the level crossing in \nLincoln Road\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.              Level Crossings in Enfield&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThere are currently three level crossings in \nEnfield\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe crossings in both \nOrdnance Road\n and \nGreen Street\n are automated crossings, whereas the crossing in \nLincoln Road\n is manually operated\n (see photo)\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nData provided by \nNetwork Rail for the period between 2005 and October 2012 indicates the following number of incidents:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;FatalityNear MissMisuseOrdnance Road1\n3\n186\nGreen Street&#xa0;1\n2\n125\nLincoln Road&#xa0;0\n3\n8\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nA ‘misuse’ is when the crossing is used incorrectly, \nbut does not come close to causing an incident (e.g. a pedestrian jumping over the barrier and crossing when no train is near). A ‘near miss’ is when an incident is almost caused (e.g. pedestrian jumping over the barrier almost gets hit by a train).\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nIt should be noted that the \nLincoln Road\n level crossing has a relatively good safety record, with a low level of misuse compared to \nthe \nt\nwo automated crossing\ns\n in the borough.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nThe Council\n understand\ns the inherent risk associated with level crossings and there have indeed been several serious incidents in \nEnfield\n, including recent fatalities.\n \nIn addition to the fatalities at \nOrdnance Road\n and \nGreen Street\n highlighted in the table above, two\n 16 year ol\nd boys were killed on the Pegamoid footpath crossing in March 2006\n. This crossing was closed shortly afterwards following consultation with the Council.\n              \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nThe Council \ntherefore s\nupports Network Rail’s efforts to improve the safety of the railway\n and is\n committed \nto work in partnership to help achieve this objective\n. However, railways can lead to significant severance and level crossings \nplay a vital role \nin maintaining local \nconnectivity in some parts of the borough\n. \nWhilst safety is critical, the impac\nt of level crossing closure\ns\n needs to be properly \nunderstood\n by all \nparties\n before decisions are made. \nIndeed, t\nhe \nimportance of early discussion with the local traffic authority is reflected in the legislation relating to changes to level crossings\n and t\nhe guidance issued by the Office of Rail Regulation\n. \nNetwork Rail’s own policy on \nmanaging level crossing safety\n also\n \ntalks in terms of ‘\npartnership working and taking an holistic approach to reducing level crossing risk\n’.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nHowever, a\n recent example in \nEnfield\n provides \nevidence of how not to handle a level crossing closure, wh\nere \na\n ‘safety’ concern \nat a crossing in \nLincoln Road\n \nwas used to justify closure \nwithout \nany \nengagement\n with \neither the local authority or \nthe local community\n. \n4.              History of Lincoln Road Level Crossing &#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nWhen the construction of railways was authorised, mainly in the 19th century, the individual enabling Act of Parliament specified how the railway was to cross other ways (for example roads and footpaths), eit\nher by bridge or on the level. Where the crossing was on the level, the arrangements for protecting the users, both railway and highway, were specified.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nThe railway to \nEnfield\n \nTown\n was constructed under powers contained in The Enfield and Edmonton Ju\nnction Railway Act 1846. The site of the level crossing \nin what is now \nLincoln Road\n \nwas referenced as an \nOccupation Road\n. \nHowever, t\nhere is no power in the Authorising Act for the railway to cross the road at grade, which was a requirement for all railways\n authorised after s. 46 of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 came into force. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nNetwork Rail \nrecords indicate \nthat the \ncrossing has been \nstaffed \nsince at least the late 1880s. Closure to vehicles at night is documented back to at least 1939, \nbut it is presumed that the hours of manning were the result of a contractual agreement dating from the time when the land served by the level crossing w\nas agricultural\n.\n Network Rail argue that there are now no successors in title who may be entitled to us\ne the crossing as of right, the area having been built up many years ago.  Network Rail also highlight that t\nhe then \nEnfield U\nrban District Council \nwas advised of the crossing’s occupational status in June 1947\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nNetwork Rail have confirmed that s\nigns describing the opening times of the crossing were recorded as present in 1956. The hours were proposed to be reduced to 0800–1800 Monday to Saturday \nin \nFebruary 1994, although manning appears to have reverted to 0600 to 1800 at some time after that. \nN\network Rail also argue that the \nregular closure of the crossing to vehicles at night and on Sundays is evide\nnce that a right of way for vehicles cannot have been established.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.              Recent Closure of the Crossing&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nA brief chronology of the closure of the \nLincoln Road\n level crossing is summarised below:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nAs mentioned above, the number of incidents recorded at the \nLincoln Road\n level crossing appears relatively low when compared with the other crossings in the borough.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nTh\ne only information provided \nto the Council b\ny Network Rail\n to \nindicate their \nsafety concerns is \nreproduced below:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nNetwork Rail explained more about their thinking in their letter to Nick be Bois d\nated 4\nth\n June 2013 \nin which they state\n:\n&#xa0;\n‘It is felt that the narrow and humped nature of the crossing would push vehicles onto the pedestrian walkway, putting foot \nusers at risk of injury. It was proposed, therefore, that some mitigation work be implemented bef\nore re-opening to vehicles. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, as the level crossing is due for closure, the expense of any mitigation work would be unjustifiable, and so the decision has now been taken to keep the crossing closed permanently’.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.              Recommendations &#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nWhether \nor not\n the level crossing in \nLincoln Road\n is a public or private right of way is \nirrelevant\n to most people. The fact remains that many local people used the crossing on a regular basis and \nits closure has had a significant impact.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nNetwork Rail failed\n to \nconsult\n or engage with the \nCouncil in its capacity as the local traffic authority\n about the closure of the crossing\n \nthis\n has prevented the Council f\nrom effectively carrying out its duties in properly managing traffic in the area. \nNetwork Rail also fail\ned to undertake any consultation with the local community priority to the closure. \nRegardless of the status of the crossing, \nthis is simply unacceptable. \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThe recent report from the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission into Level Crossings\n \nis a\n timely and detailed review. \nI understand that t\nhe recommendations in the Commissions’\n \nreport are aimed at\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nThe Council generally support\ns\n \nthe \nLaw Commission’s recommendations\n and welcomes the \nclarification of \nt\nhe \nlegal\n basis\n for the closure of crossing\ns. However, following \nour recent experience \nwith the Lincoln Road \nl\nevel \nc\nrossing, \nI would recommend that\n \nin all cases where closure of a level crossings used by the public is being considered\n: &#xa0;\n              \n              \nRecommendation 1&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nRecommendation 2&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nLevel Crossings Act 1983, as amended\n \nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/level_crossings_guidance.pdf\n              \n \nwww.networkrail.co.uk/documents4424\nLevel20\nCrossing20Policy.pdf.pdf\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://lawcommis\nsion.justice.gov.uk/docs/lc339_level_crossings.pdf\n&#xa0;\n"
