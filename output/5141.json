"Written evidence from the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association [TOB11]\nExecutive Summary3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe illicit trade in tobacco products has been a serious problem for the UK for 20 years, one brought about by high levels of taxation in this country. Advice given to the then Chancellor in 1999 following an independent evaluation of the problem of tobacco smuggling by Martin Taylor, on which the Government’s \nTackling Tobacco Smuggling\n strategy was largely based, makes this clear. The report\n states; “The principal cause of the smuggling, of course, is the high level of duty in the UK”. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe tobacco industry is an important contributor to the UK economy, directly and indirectly supporting over 70,000 jobs, as well as delivering over £12 billion to HM Treasury in excise and VAT in 2012/13 alone. However, latest Government estimates show that up to £2.9\n billion was lost in 2010/11 to the illicit market and this has wide implications for businesses throughout the supply chain, as well as the impact that illicit trade has on society as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe TMA’s approach to tackling illicit trade is primarily through communications, awareness raising and developing strategic partnerships. At a national level, we\n work with \nTMA members\n to raise awareness through the media, campaign on refreshing Government approaches to tackling the illicit trade and work with key stakeholders such as HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) in developing AIT strategies. At a devolved and regional level we are working with stakeholders to ensure a greater understanding of the issues and by working together we are able to \ndeliver\n \nmedia and/or enforcement led \ncampaigns to address illicit activity\n. At a local level we provide support for campaigns such as the Real Deal\n – a campaign for fake free markets, work with the Police and Trading Standards to raise local awareness and are actively driving intelligence to the appropriate authorities. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have \naddress\ned\n the individual points raised in the consultation\n and\n provided examples of the work that the tobacco industry is undertaking in partnership with law enforcement. \n&#xa0;TMA response to the Home Office Select Committee questions&#xa0;Why the number of arrests, prosecutions and convictions for tobacco smuggling have fallen over the past three years;8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe National Audit Office (NAO) Report\n on progress in tackling tobacco smuggling indicates that the level of prosecutions against organised crime groups fell in the period 2012/13, yet, despite the fall in prosecutions, revenue loss protection increased, which is welcome.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHMRC figures\n indicate that prosecutions for the evasion of duty increased sharply in 2012/13. In addition to criminal prosecutions, HMRC appear to be using civil penalties (wrongdoing penalties) and we support their use as a deterrent.  \n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nThe 2010 Spending Review (SR) allocated additional funding to tackle fraud\n and we acknowledged that this would take time to filter through, as well as the training period involved for new criminal investigators. We understood that the funds allocated through SR 2010 were unlikely to have taken effect until 2012/13.\n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0; \nThe TMA works in partnership with Trading Standards as supporters of the \nReal Deal\n campaign for fake-free markets and on many local initiatives. We are disappointed that the work to prevent and tackle illicit tobacco is sometimes compromised by individual and/or regional Trading Standards Authorities\n forces that decline to work \nin partnership with the TMA citing public health concerns, rather than prioritising actual enforcement activities. The recent launch of the Local Government Declaration on Tobacco Control (see Annex)\n includes the following commitment:  \n“Protect our tobacco control work from the commercial and vested interests of the tobacco industry by not accepting any partnerships, payments, gifts and services, monetary or in kind or research funding offered by the tobacco industry to officials or employees.” \nWhilst several councils have signed up to this pledge, it sends confusing messages when Trading Standards are in frequent contact with the tobacco manufacturers on issues relating to smuggling. Ultimately, tackling tobacco smuggling cuts across a number of government departments and therefore it is particularly important that they work together. If one department chooses not to work with the TMA or TMA members it may undermine the efforts of other enforcement bodies. \n&#xa0;\nWhy Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13;12.\n&#xa0; \nDue to the nature of the fraud we believe that it is difficult to estimate the size and scale of future seizures, as well as when and where the seizures might take place. The NAO report indicates that seizure levels have remained broadly consistent in recent years, which suggests that a significant quantity of illicit tobacco continues to be seized. However, appropriate resources should be available to send a clear message to criminals intending to smuggle into the UK that illicit products are likely to be seized and will be pursued by the appropriate authorities.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nDuring a recent visit to the Coventry Postal Hub we learned that successful seizures of counterfeit tobacco products \n(up to 50 tonnes of hand rolling tobacco a month – equivalent to 2x 40ft lorries a day) \nhas led to a significant reduction in activity at Coventry; however, this is likely to have been displaced to other entry points. Given ongoing concerns over departmental budgets, we would stress that resources should be available to Border Force to counter new threats as they emerge. \n&#xa0;\nWhether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate.14.\n&#xa0; \nAlthough the current maximum penalties appear to be appropriate, we recommend a greater application at the lowest level to deter criminals who appear to be ‘\ngetting away with it’\n and who threaten the viability of legitimate retailers. Applying stiff penalties at the lowest level is extremely important in dissuading shopkeepers who may be tempted to engage in illicit activity in this difficult economic climate. Well \npublicised enforcement activity helps to maintain the flow of intelligence to \nthe authorities\n, as it provides the reassurance that something is being done. We acknowledge that there are legal issues with HMRC providing direct feedback to intelligence sources, and we are working with HMRC and organisations such as the Tobacco Retailers’ Alliance (TRA) to ensure successful enforcement action is appropriately publicised. \n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0; \nHMRC could mirror the approach taken by the Police in providing greater transparency with regards criminal cases, for example\n,\n highlighting how many cases are ongoing, how are they being taken forward and success rates. This again would provide greater reassurance to stakeholders of the work that is being undertaken by HMRC. \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0; \nRetailers face a number of regulations with significant penalties\n.\n \nU\nnder the display ban regulations, fines of up to £5,000 can be imposed for non-compliance\n, which is greater than some fines for selling illicit tobacco products\n. Therefore, a shopkeeper may face a greater sanction for leaving the tobacco display open in between selling to adult customers than a criminal selling tobacco products from the back of a car. \nWhilst there appears to be comparatively modest sanctions f\nor some forms of illicit activity, it is extremely important that these penalties are still imposed, especially when compared to a fine that a legitimate retailer may face for an administrative error. \nThe similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect on each other, and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency operations in Northern Ireland.17.\n&#xa0; \nBoth the UK and the Republic of Ireland impose high rates of taxation on tobacco products. \nDuring\n the 1990s, the duty escalator in combination with the Single Market led to a dramatic increase in tobacco smuggling and cross border shopping. Tobacco smuggling peaked in 2000/01, when up to 69% of hand rolling tobacco and 24% of cigarettes were estimated by HMRC to be illicit. \nIn 2001, the duty escalator was removed\n, and supported by the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling \ns\ntrategy led to a gradual reduction in smuggling. \nIn response to \nthe economic crisis, the Government re-introduced the duty escalator in 2010 and as a result non-UK duty paid \n(NUKDP) \ntobacco is rising\n. The experience in Ireland mirrors the UK, when substantial tax increases imposed in the 2000s led to the acceleration in tobacco smuggling. The Irish Government elected to freeze tobacco duty rates during 2009\n and 2010 and as a result non-Irish duty paid (NIDP) levels began to fall\n. More recently, the \nGovernment has imposed significant duty increases on tobacco products and the level of NIDP is rising again. \n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0; \nMuch like the UK, Irish customs have seized significant quantities of illicit products,\n both counterfeit and genuine non-domestic products such as illicit whites. Industry empty pack surveys indicate that a significant portion of \nNUKDP\n is comprised of product originating in comparatively low price EU member states, similar to what has been seen in Ireland.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0; \nThe Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland plays a vital role in addressing issues such as the illicit trade in tobacco and the movement of illicit goods through the border area.\n&#xa0;\nThe possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK; and20.\n&#xa0; \nStandardised packaging lowers the barrier to entry for criminal gangs who trade in illicit and counterfeit products and would lead to an increase in illicit activity in Ireland. Ireland is a comparatively small market, yet criminal networks have sought to target it, as evidenced by a number of high profile seizures\n involving products specifically produced for the Irish market. It is difficult to say at this stage what impact standardised packaging in Ireland may have on the UK, but past experience shows that illicit products destined for Ireland have crossed over into Northern Ireland and Scotland, especially in areas where there is an established demand for cheaper illicit tobacco products.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt should be noted that Mike \nNorgrove\n, \nDirector, Excise, Customs, Stamps and Money, HMRC,\n told the Northern Ireland Committee, that with regards to plain packaging: \n“\nthe obvious danger from our point of view is that the ability to detect counterfeit or illicit material would be made more difficult by a system where there was no difference between one packet and another\n”\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0; \nFor more information on the TMA member companies’ views on standardised (or plain) packaging, including in relation to the potential for such measures to exacerbate the issue of illicit trade, please see their respective submissions to the 2012 consultation.\nThe relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity.23.\n&#xa0; \nWe understand that tobacco smuggling is increasingly linked to organised crime, driven by the high profits and relatively low penalties in relation to other forms of smuggling. The links are highlighted by organisations such as Europol\n, the World Customs Organisation\n, but, more specifically the links to paramilitary activity have been identified by the Organised Crime Task Force\n.\nTackling illicit trade24.\n&#xa0; \nThe following examples demonstrate how the TMA and member companies are working with governments and authorities to tackle tobacco smuggling and counterfeiting. \nThe FCTC Illicit Trade Protocol25.\n&#xa0; \nThe TMA’s member companies have consistently supported the development of the Illicit Trade Protocol (ITP) and encourage the government to undertake consultations with all relevant stakeholders on its implementation. \nThe scope of the ITP is very broad; it contains measures in the areas of: licensing, due diligence, tracking and tracing, financial controls, record keeping, duty free sales, internet sales, free zones, offences and sanctions, and international cooperation. Many of the controls proposed in the ITP may already exist in the UK. But, due to the transnational nature of the illicit trade in tobacco products, the UK still experiences a high level of illicit trade. Therefore, the ITP must be applied consistently across all signatory countries.\nOLAF Agreements26.\n&#xa0; \nThe EU is fully aware of the risks posed by the different tax levels applied across the Member States. The Directive setting out the tax rules for tobacco products states\n:\n “A certain degree of convergence between the tax levels applied in the Member States would help to reduce fraud and smuggling within the Union”.\n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0; \nThe TMA’s member companies have all signed individual \nagreements with\n the EU \nto jointly combat the illicit trade in tobacco\n. The agreements cover general co-operation between the member companies and the Anti-Fraud Office of the European Community (OLAF). The agreements strengthen cooperation in a number of areas and include funding by the member companies over a number of years to support anti-illicit trade initiatives\n&#xa0;\n28.\n&#xa0; \nThe Government has described these agreements as being: \n“\nan important step forward in the fight against tobacco smuggling. Signing them sends a clear and consistent signal that we are working in step with the EU, other member states and tobacco manufacturers to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products.”\n. \nMemoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and Supply Chain Legislation29.\n&#xa0; \nOne of the cornerstones of the UK Government’s Tackling Tobacco Smuggling strategy and the fight against tobacco smuggling is the Memoranda of Understanding (\nMoU\n) between the TMA’s member companies and HMRC. The first \nMoU\n was signed in April 2002 with a revised, common \nMoU\n signed in March 2006.\n&#xa0;\n30.\n&#xa0; \n“\nMoUs\n between HMRC and the UK tobacco manufacturers have been an important element of the strategy, and have played a crucial role in restricting the availability of genuine cigarettes to smugglers.” \n&#xa0;\n31.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nMoU\n creates a comprehensive framework for co-operation aimed at combating the smuggling of both genuine and counterfeit tobacco products into the UK as well as seeking to deter all aspects of the illicit trade in tobacco products. \nThe TMA member companies have been working with HMRC in developing a revised \nMoU\n and this will be officially signed on 5 September 2013. \n&#xa0;\nWorking in partnership 32.\n&#xa0; \nIn April 2011, the Government published its refreshed \nTackling Tobacco Smuggling \ns\ntrategy\n. \nT\nhe strategy \nincludes \na clear additional commitment from HMRC and UKBA to establish a new \nA\nnti\n-I\nllicit \nJ\noint \nW\norking \nG\nroup\n (A-IT JWG)\n with the UK tobacco manufacturers and the TMA with the aim of proactively developing an improved and shared understanding of the illicit market in the UK.  \n&#xa0;\n33.\n&#xa0; \nThe overarching A-IT JWG, which formalises long-standing interactions between HMRC and the Industry, provides an open forum for the Tobacco Industry and HMRC experts to meet bi-annually to share insight and experience, examine issues, and explore opportunities for the industry and/or HMRC to tackle \nthe illicit market and emerging threats. The \nA-IT JWG\n supports and complements the Memoranda of Understanding between HMRC and the tobacco manufacturers and/or the EU Co-operation agreements.  \n&#xa0;\n34.\n&#xa0; \nOther work streams identified include intelligence sharing and communications, with a communications framework already in place that sets out that the TMA, Philip Morris UK &amp; HMRC will jointly work together to develop more effective marketing and communications around illicit tobacco.\n&#xa0;\n35.\n&#xa0; \nThe TMA are also working on a number of partnership projects to tackle illicit trade, incorporating stakeholders such as the Police, Trading Standards, the Intellectual Property Office, and other rights holders. \nCodentify® 36.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nCodentify®\n technology has been developed by the four major tobacco companies\n to \nenable law enforcement and other officials to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit products. \nThe \nCodentify® \ntechnological solution can also deliver, tracking and tracing and digital tax verification.  Full implementation of \nCodentify®\n in the UK is expected in late 2014/early 2015. It is fully compliant with the provisions contained in the FCTC Anti-illicit Trade Protocol. The revised EU Tobacco Products Directive contains provisions that would undermine the use of \nCodentify®\n and we have strongly recommended that these provisions are not taken forward by the Commission. Further details on \nCodentify® are \navailable in the Annex. \nCovert Markings 37.\n&#xa0; \nSince 1st October 2007 all cigarettes manufactured for the UK market by our member companies and Philip Morris International carry covert technology to allow the easy identification\n by law enforcement officers\n of genuine/counterfeit product in the retail network. This was extended to hand rolling tobacco from 1st October 2008. The anti-counterfeiting (reader) device used to detect illicit counterfeit product is being used across the UK by HMRC and Trading Standards Officers. \nConclusion38.\n&#xa0; \nThe illicit trade in tobacco products continues to cost HM Treasury £ billions in lost revenues but there are encouraging signs from HMRC that the increase in \nenforcement activity is delivering more prosecutions. The TMA welcomes a more open approach by HMRC to ensure stakeholders throughout the supply chain are aware of the work that is being done. A greater deterrent is required at the local level to ensure that perceived small scale illicit activity is not tolerated. \n&#xa0;\n39.\n&#xa0; \nThe TMA’s member companies work extensively with a number of enforcement agencies in the UK and across the world to tackle the illicit trade. The manufacturers have been at the forefront in developing technological solutions which provide greater supply chain security as well as delivering the means for enforcement agencies to detect illicit products.\n&#xa0;\n40.\n&#xa0; \nWith increasingly higher levels of tobacco taxation and prevailing economic conditions, the ability to tackle illicit trade effectively is made much more difficult, as consumers are increasingly incentivised by above inflation excise increases to seek \nNUKDP\n products. By adopting a more measured approach to tobacco taxation, the Government would address head on the key driver of the illicit trade in tobacco products. \nJaine\n Chisholm \nCaunt\n, \nSecretary General\nTobacco Manufacturers’ Association\nAugust 2013\nAnnexCodentify® In 2011 the four major tobacco companies\n \nfounded the \nDigital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) with the aim to promote cost effective industry standards and supporting technology solutions to tackle illicit trade. The \nCodentify® \ntechnological solution can deliver product authentication, tracking and tracing and digital tax verification. \nCodentify® product authentication enables law enforcement and other officials to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit products. The system uses unique alphanumeric codes so there will be no need for dedicated scanning devices or specialist training.\n  Codentify is in the process of being rolled out across the UK, with full implementation expected in late 2014/early 2015. \nC\nodentify® track and trace will enable stakeholders to monitor and secure the distribution of products worldwide. A unique code is securely applied directly onto every packaging unit.\nAs products move along the supply chain between different trading partners, the unique codes are scanned, creating a complete record of its journey history.\nThese unique codes, together with Codentify® track and trace data exchange and reporting formats, are based on international standards. This enables all stakeholders throughout the supply chain to use standard equipment and processes to track and trace product movements within and across national borders.\nCodentify® track and trace enables law enforcement authorities to retrieve information about the product, its manufacture, distribution and legal status, including products in transit. \nCodentify® track and trace provides law enforcement authorities with the visibility needed to accurately identify national and international illicit trade patterns and assist criminal investigations.\nCodentify® digital tax verification enables governments to protect tax revenues by strengthening recovery capabilities and reducing opportunities for evasion.\nLicensed manufacturers apply to government for permission to produce online via a secure internet connection. On approval, production can begin under real-time government control. A unique, secure code is applied onto every packaging unit. Once printed, these codes are counted and encrypted production information is immediately and securely communicated to government. Using this information enables governments to accurately calculate and reconcile due taxes. \nCodentify® track and trace will enable stakeholders to monitor and secure the distribution of products worldwide and is fully compliant with the provisions contained in the FCTC Anti-illicit Trade Protocol.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/foi_240712.htm\n http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/measuring-tax-gaps.htm\n Anti-Illicit Trade Task Force (Scotland), Scottish Anti-Illicit Trade Group, Government Agency Intelligence Network (GAIN)\n http://www.realdealmarkets.co.uk/\n http://www.nao.org.uk/report/progress-in-tackling-tobacco-smuggling/\n http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/text/130610w0002.htm\n http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/change-programme/\n Operation Lauderdale Overview Report, London Trading Standards Authorities (May 2013)\n Not published\n http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/Horizontal_Services_files/DisplayGuidanceFINAL.pdf\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/evasion_of_excise_duty_with_intent_to_defraud_her_majesty/\n Empty Pack Survey (2012)\n http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/tobacco-smuggling-costing-556m-26649456.html\n http://www.itmac.ie/?content=irish-total-cigarette-market \n Revenue Customs Service\n Empty Pack Survey (2012)\n&#xa0;\n http://www.revenue.ie/en/press/archive/2010/pr-091210-cigarettes.html\n Available at: \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmniaf/uc556-i/uc55601.htm\n \n These are available at: \nhttp://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK__3MNFEN.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO7J7DCZ?opendocument&amp;SKN=1\nhttp://www.jti.com/how-we-do-business/key-regulatory-submissions/\nhttp://www.imperial-tobacco.co.uk/index.asp?page=453\n \n \nhttps://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/octa2011.pdf\n \nhttp://www.wcoomd.org/valelearningoncustomsvaluation_eftobaccoandcigarettesmuggling.htm\n http://www.octf.gov.uk/getattachment/655790ee-fd44-4486-ba71-973cf77195bc/Annual-Report---Threat-Assessment-2012.aspx\n DIRECTIVE 2011/64/EU (available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:176:0024:0036:EN:PDF) \n Justine Greening, then Economic Secretary to the Treasury; Hansard HC Deb 23 November 2010: Column 272W\n Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling Strategy 2006\n BAT, ITG, JTI &amp; PMI\n BAT, ITG, JTI &amp; PMI\n"
