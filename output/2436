default1.1
default              
defaultAffinity Sutton Group is one of the largest 
defaultHousing Associations
default in England
default.
default 
defaultWe work in over 120 local authorities in which we own or manage over 57,000 properties.  These include General Needs, Supported Housing, Keyworker, Leasehold and Part Buy/Part Ren
defaultt homes
default.
default 
defaultWe welcome the opportunity to 
defaultsubmit evidence to your inquiry into the 
defaultprovision of support to meet housing costs in the reformed welfare system.
default In 
defaultparticular we wish to comment on the social sector size criteria and will focus on the 
defaultimplications of this reform on landlords.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultOur 
defaultbusiness planning 
defaultassumption is that
default 
defaultthe welfare reforms will lead to 
defaultour rent arrears 
defaultto 
defaultmore than double to 9.5% and our bad debts 
defaultto 
defaultmore than quadruple to 3.5% after 
default20
default16/17. We estimate that 230 
defaultAffinity Sutton 
defaulthouseholds will be subject to the benefit cap losing an average of £64 per week which will have an annual 
defaultadditional rent arrears 
defaultimpact on us of £0.7m. We have estimated that the 
defaultsize criteria
default will affect 4,000 of our residents (66% under
default-
defaultoccupying by 
defaultone
default bedroom and 34% by 
defaulttwo
default bedrooms) and that this will have an annual impact of £4.2m. Therefore our total exposure from these two changes is estimated 
defaultto cause us to lose income of
default nearly £5m
default pa
default assum
defaulting
default that 
defaultnone of the shortfall from reduc
defaulted benefits is made up in other ways.

defaulte invest
default heavily 
defaultin our communi
defaultties 
defaultthrough our Community Foundation which we have endowed with £53m. 
defaultThe current economic climate and cuts to
default welfare have led us to support our residents by helping them into work and helping them manage their money better.
default&#xa0;
defaultLast year we helped 585 long term unemployed people into work, provided 77 apprenticeships and helped over 1700 take up affordable financial
default products and over 1200 access free debt advice.
default The level of our investment in this work – approaching £4.5m pa – will be exceeded by the loss of income we expect to suffer as a result of the welfare reforms.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of our residents are vulnerable and

default2.2
default              
defaultThe shortage of housing in this country is well-documented and in addition to supporting communities Affinity Sutton is committed to delivering affordable homes.

default              
defaultRent is the main source of Affinity Sutton’s income and is essential for maintaining our existing homes
default, supporting our communities
default and building new affordabl
defaulte homes.  If we are to meet our housebuilding commitments
default and continue to add value to our neighbourhoods
default it is important that we do everything possible to maximise rent collection in a way that gives our residents the chance to pay.  
defaultFor example, every pound of the public funding we receive to support our affordable housing programme is matched by £6 of private borrowing and other finance that we 
defaultprovide and this debt has to be repaid over time. 
defaultThe timely payment of rent is clearly ex
defaulttremely important if we are to do so.

defaultRent arrears for those who are under

default risen 
defaultover seven times more
default quickly than average
default and 
defaultin a single month increased 
defaultby 
defaultmore than three times 
defaultthe all resident figure for the total five month period.  
defaultBy transferring the burden from Housing Benefit to Housing Association balance sheets an unintended consequence of this policy could ultimately put the supply of new affordable homes at risk
default; a situ
defaultation that would see more families reliant on the 
defaultmore expensive 
defaultprivate rented sector and an increase in the cost to Housing Benefit.
default&#xa0;

defaultIt is likely that th

default  
defaultLocal Authorities have been able to award a greater number of DHP payments
default during this period
default than would usually be the case because they built up reserves over the past few years
default. We fear 
defaultthis increased reliance of households on DHP is not sustainable in the long term.

defaultwhich allows households to move into a home with one bedroom more than they are deemed eligible for. 
defaultSince April 2013 we’ve completed 449 mutual exchanges
default; largely as a consequence of the shortage of smaller homes,
default 85 of these house
defaultholds (19%) moved to accommodation which was still too large by one bedroom. A

default2.8     
defaultIn some areas, particularly i
defaultn the north of England
default,
default we have historically allowed under-occupation of three and four bedroom houses
default. This is both because this is the predominant property type and also
default because we 
defaultcannot
default meet
default 
defaultthe large demand for two bedroom homes
default. Additionally, we try 
defaultto
default actively manage levels of child density, thereby allowing families to grow into a property and help with community stability and cohesion. Most local authority allocation schemes allowed for under occupation by one bedroom for the same reasons. Generall
defaulty local authorities have now changed their approach to allocating properties to fall in line with the housing benefit changes which came into effect April 2013 and do not nominate households who would under occupy and be affected by the benefit changes.
default&#xa0;
defaultCo
defaultnsequently, 
defaultdemand is falling for larger homes in some northern towns and cities (examples are Hull, Bradford, Leeds, 
defaultand Newcastle
default-upon-Tyne). In these locations the local authority 
defaultis
default either struggling to nominate suitable housing applicants or have simp
defaultly said they cannot nominate applicants for larger homes for the foreseeable future.

defaulte are currently

default generated by the under-occupation penalty
default. We are working with three
default other social landlords -
default&#xa0;
defaultRiverside
default, Gentoo and Wigan and Leigh Housing - with support from the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York). Using the DWP’s own savings impact model, 
defaultand re-r
defaultunning it with data drawn from 
defaultreal experience across the four organisations since April, our initial findings indicate that the level of savings projected by DWP are likely to have been overstated to 
defaulta significant extent
default, 
defaultpossibly by as much as a 
defaultthird. Despite the generation of savings being one of the Government’s key objectives for the policy, and central to Parliamentary debates during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, our study confirms the DWP’s own assessment that 
defaultthere is 
default“uncertainty
default about likely claimant and landlord responses to the introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” (DWP 2012 p13). Our work also highlights significant deficiencies in the design
default of the model which are likely to have further overstated the level of savings generated through the implementation of the under-occupation penalty.

default Whilst it is difficult to quantify these additional costs with accuracy, taken together with the reduced savings discusse
defaultd above, we believe there is now a powerful case for urgent scrutiny of the £930m two year savings estimate, which has been presented as one of the central objectives of this policy.
