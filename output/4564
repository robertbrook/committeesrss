defaultGovernment education reforms, aimed at improving school standards, have led to a
defaultn increasingly autonomous schools system, through conversion of existing schools to Academy status and opening of new schools as Free Schools. These schools have greater freedoms in a variety of areas including whether to expand school places to meet deman
defaultd, decide self-improvement needs and are their own admissions authority.   
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese reforms have directly led to a decline of the traditional council role in educ
defaultation. Yet, government is clear; local authorities
default as champions of children and parents, with a 
defaultdemocratic mandate, have a responsibility that every school do their best for the local population. Local authorities continue to hold legal duties covering education including to ensure sufficient school places, overall responsibility for school performan
defaultce in the local area and fair access for all children.
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 2010, schools that have converted to Academy status have risen from 38 to 185 at secondary level and from 0 to 125 at primary level in the capital. At the same time, more Free Schools have been s
defaultet up in London than in any other part of England. Of the 174 Free Schools opened in England, a total of 58 (34 per cent) are in London.

defaultBased on evidence from across London, London Councils has identified gaps 
defaultwithin system that put at risk the aspirations behind government reforms. 
defaultLocal government has a vital role to play in ensuring continued improvement to the schools system
default. The
default following 
defaultfive 
defaultchanges are needed to support 
defaultautonomous schools flourish whilst
default at the same time providing parents with the reassurance needed within the education system:
default2.1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo
default support schools address signs of failure at the earliest opportunity
default - Local authority issued early warning notices for Academies and Free Schools should be sup
defaultported by a statutory backstop, in the same way they are for maintained schools.
default2.1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo ensure new schools are setup in areas/wards where there is projected demand - A change in government policy to put new school applicants in touch with London boroughs at th
defaulte earliest chance.
default2.1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo support vulnerable children – Government should provide 
defaultFair Access Panels with the power to issue a direction to an Academy to admit a hard-to-place pupil, as they currently do with maintained schools 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMaking the education system more accessible to parents and local communities - Ensuring Academies share the same statistical returns with local authorities at the same time they make them available 
defaultto the Department for Education. 
default&#xa0;

defaultThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with defaultsponsorsdefault?default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities are legally responsible for providing school places for every child resident in their area. To do this, boroughs closely monitor the supply and demand for places and ensure there is sufficient school capacity to meet the needs o
defaultf their community.
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll regions are experiencing a rise in demand for school places but this a pressure not spread evenly across the country. Over the 10
default years
default since Census 2001, London’s population grew by 900,000 (11.6 per cent). 
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLondon Councils latest 
defaultanalysis has shown that between 2012/13 and 2016, the shortage of school places is set to reach 118
default,000. 
defaultFor many local authorities, it is becoming increasingly challenging to create additional classrooms in existing schools.

defaultcademies, of which there are 368
default in London, are responsible for their own expansion and should they opt to do so, bid directly to the Department for Education for fu
defaultnding. The Government also approves applications for new Free Schools without consultation with local authorities. 
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithin boroughs and across London, like all reg

defaultto government vary significantly. There is no systematic approach in place and many local authorities only find out about plans to expand or create new Free Schools once they have been approved by Government. This makes it difficult for local
default authorities to be able to include these new places in medium to long term place planning.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities have 198 statutory duties relating to education and children and young people's services to discharge. Irrespective of school provider type, local 
defaultauthorities have three core 
defaultresponsibilities in relation to education - ensuring a sufficient supply of school places, tackling underperformance in schools and ensuring high standards as well as supporting vulnerable children. 
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs 
defaulta more
default autonomous education system has evolved, it has become increasingly challenging for local authorities to discharge these duties. At the same time, central government’s ability to support academies and free schools will become progressively strained as the
default 
defaultnumber of Academies and Free Schools increases
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities, as champions of children and parents, with a democratic mandate, have a responsibility that every school
default should
default do their best for the local population and therefore, ensure the aspiratio
defaultns behind government reforms are fulfilled. Based on evidence from across London, London Councils has identified five key changes that are needed to address risks in the system
default.
default 
default&#xa0;default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnabling continued school improvementdefault Academies and Free Schools are respons
defaultible for their own school improvement as outlined in the Education Act 2011. However, some schools will not be able to thrive on their own and DfE and Ofsted do not have the capacity to work with each school in the country to prevent standards declining. I
defaultt is critical that support and challenge is offered to schools at the earliest possible moment to minimise the impact that any signs of failure may have on the quality of education a child receives.
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLondon boroughs are well placed to do this and have succ
defaultessfully demonstrated how they use early warning notices, when serious issues emerge, to turn around performance in maintained schools.
default 
defaultLondon Councils is calling on government to enable local authorities to issue early warning notices to all state funded 
defaultschools, supported by a statutory backstop, to ensure that they 
defaultare 
defaultact
defaulted
default upon by schools, irrespective of type to prevent failure.
default&#xa0;default4.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMeeting the growing demand for school placesdefault Many Academies and Free Schools work closely with local authorities and consult them on the potential to expand or set up new schools. However, there is no systematic approach in place and many local authorities only find out about plans to expand or crea
defaultte new schools once they have been approved by the government. In some instances in London, Academies and Free Schools have opened in areas where there is limited demand for schools and therefore, take up of places is extremely low by local families. 
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo 
defaultaddress these inconsistencies within the system, London Councils believes there is a strong role for local authorities, with their expert local knowledge
default and intelligence
default, to offer a package of support to Academies and Free Schools. This could include effe
defaultctive advice on viable sites and development costs; and ensuring schools sufficiently meet community needs. This would enable local authorities to broker effective relationships with Free School candidates and support those that demonstrate quality, cost-e
defaultffectiveness and meet the growing need for places.
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order for this to be effective and deliver parental choice in state education, London Councils is calling on government to share information on Free School candidates 
defaultat the earliest opportunity
default.
default&#xa0;default4.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSuppdefaultorting vulnerable children to achieve positive outcomesdefault Supporting vulnerable children to achieve positive outcomes is an integral part of a local authority’s duties. It is important that the education reforms do not hinder a borough’s ability to fulfil th
defaultese duties, particularly in relation to schools. 
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlacing excluded pupils in appropriate schooling is a particularly difficult duty to deliver and every part of the school system needs to share equally in this responsibility. To ensure the system is viabl
defaulte in a world with a majority of Academies, government needs to act to empower Fair Access Panels to issue a direction to an Academy to admit a hard-to-place pupil, as they currently do with maintained schools.
default&#xa0;default4.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMaking the education system more accessible tdefaulto parents and local communities defaultIn an autonomous schools sector driven by choice parents will play an increasingly important role in shaping local education provision. However, many parents will need support in order to make informed decisions as they navi
defaultgate their way through the market. It will be increasingly difficult for parents to locate, understand and compare data for all schools as the market diversifies. 
default&#xa0;
default4.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLondon Councils is calling on all schools, including academies, to share the same data and 
defaultstatistical returns with local authorities at the same time that they make them available to the DfE. Local authorities can then make this data available to local parents and also use it to support the local family of schools, challenging those where issue
defaults are emerging, and enabling the more effective delivery of their statutory duties.
default&#xa0;
default4.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, 
defaultlocal authorities should be able to conduct a financial audit or investigation into any school, including Academies, if they feel that there are issues deserv
defaulting further scrutiny. This information would be important for the wider community to be able to assess the value for money provided by a school.
