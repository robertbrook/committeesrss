[normal]              
[normal]Whether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our view they are not. Tobacco smoking is powerfully addictive and kills half of all lifelong users. Illicit tobacco allows price-sensitive smokers who
[normal] would otherwise quit to remain 
[normal]smokers, and provides a low cost and completely unregulated entry product for children and young people. Although legal in the UK, long-term tobacco is more hazardous than all widely used illicit drugs, yet sentencing for illicit supply is extremely lax relative to that for other drug offences. New sentencing guidance for drug offences indicates, for example, sentences of 14 years for people convicted of a leading role in the smuggling of large quantities of Class A drugs [1]. Whilst a search of the Sentencing Council website does not produce any documentation at all, recent cases cited on the HMRC website provides examples of sentences for leading roles in major tobacco smuggling operations of 3 and 5 years (see 
[normal]http://press.hmrc.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Ringleaders-jailed-for-12-5m-cigarette-smuggling-attempt-68b69.aspx
[normal]); 3 years (
[normal]http://press.hmrc.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Cigarette-smuggling-gang-jailed-68d9d.aspx
[normal]);  and 6.5 years (
[normal]http://press.hmrc.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Cigarette-fraudster-told-to-cough-up-criminal-profits-68a98.aspx
[normal]). This much lower level of sentencing for tobacco relative to other illicit drugs surely makes tobacco smuggling a far more attractive option to the criminal than illicit drugs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It would also appear that the “supplementary payments” (fines) that the tobacco companies are required to make as part of the deals reached with the European Commission may be inadequate to deter on-going industry involvement in the illicit trade. For example, as part of the deal reached with Philip Morris International (PMI) following civil action filed by the European Community in New York PMI and RJ Reynolds (now part of Japan Tobacco International, JTI), PMI pay five times the tax value of genuine products seized but only for seizures of over 90,000 cigarettes. On smaller seizures they pay only the tax that is due.  As is estimated that only 1 in 10 smuggled cigarettes will be seized [2] fines would have to be at least 10 times the value due to make it financially disadvantageous to smuggle. Furthermore, the Project Star report shows that seizures significantly underestimate PMI contraband, further suggesting that the fines are unlikely to be adequate.  In line with this we note evidence of 
[normal]fairly recent TTC involvement in illicit trade [3, 4,5] and failure to control its supply chain in such a way that cigarettes are then likely to leak to the illicit market [6].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, we feel that a registry and licensing system for tobacco retailers would help to ensure that retailers are deterred from engaging in the illicit tobacco trade (as in the illicit trade protocol (see below).

[normal]              
[normal]The possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity 
[normal]              
[normal]and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are data available on the relationship between standardised packaging and the illicit tobacco trade, although these data are not specific to developments in Ireland. However, they provide a useful insight into how smuggling may or may not be affected by changes in packaging. This is important as a common assertion made by the tobacco industry is that standardised packaging will increase smuggling.  The industry have spent considerable sums on advertising campaigns that seek to make the link between tobacco smuggling and plain packaging, and have funded other organisations and individuals to put forward the argument that plain packaging will increase the illicit trade. Recently leaked PMI documents show that the argument that standardised packaging will increase illicit trade was one of four main arguments to be used against the policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The most recent source of information on this topic is a report prepared by Luk Joossens, a Belgian researcher for Cancer Research UK and published in November 2012 [1]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The key findings from Joossens report were that: those that make counterfeit cigarettes find all existing packs easy to forge; counterfeit packs are extremely cheap to make – so cheap that they cannot easily become cheaper and affect the retail price; and government action has been successful in reducing illicit trade in the UK and this type of action needs to be continued and strengthened. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Most of the illicit tobacco market in the UK is not made up of legitimate products ‘smuggled’ across borders but instead by counterfeit (fake) cigarettes and ‘illicit whites’ – foreign brands manufactured for the explicit aim of smuggling. The tobacco industry states that plain packs will be easier to forge, but ignores the fact that existing branded packs provide no barrier at all to counterfeiters. Joossens argues that the cost of manufacturing a pack of counterfeit cigarettes is currently 10-15p and about a third of this is packaging. All existing packs are easy to forge. Counterfeit packaging is already so cheap that there is no feasible way that cheaper packaging would have an effect on profitability or retail price. Thus plain packaging will not make counterfeit cigarettes either easier to make or more affordable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Joossens also states that 
[normal]the tobacco companies are not credible commentators on the issue of plain packaging and smuggling (see below) and it is important that their claims about the links between the two are addressed. The key to addressing tobacco smuggling is effective government enforcement, with or without plain packaging. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition to the points made by Joossens, UK organisations including the Trading Standards Institute [2] have said that standardised packaging will have little or no impact on tobacco smuggling.

[normal]General points
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Protocol on illicit trade[bold]Effective action on tackling smuggling requires a comprehensive strategy spanning from actions at the international level through actions at a regional and national level, to actions at regional and local levels. The UK has implemented effective national strategies to reduce tobacco smuggling, but an additional step is required to ensure an international comprehensive tracking and tracing regime; the UK should ratify the illicit tobacco protocol as part of the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control [1].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Regional and local activities[bold]In addition, regional and local activities to reduce illicit tobacco should be supported. An example of this is the ‘North of England Tackling Illicit Tobacco for Better Health’ Programme [2]. The Programme aimed to reduce the demand as well as the supply of illicit tobacco and the findings suggest that addressing demand for illicit tobacco is also important alongside penalties and sanctions [3]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Credibility of tobacco industry on illicit tobacco[bold]The credibility of the tobacco industry in debates of the illicit tobacco trade is highly suspect. There is overwhelming evidence of the transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) long history of involvement in the global illicit tobacco trade [4-8]. In the UK in the 1990s, for example, TTCs found to be deliberately over-supplying their brands to countries where there was no demand for them in the knowledge that these cigarettes would then be smuggled back into the UK [6].   Although the nature of the illicit tobacco market has since changed substantially [6], emerging evidence suggests the TTCs have continued to be involved in the illicit trade and failed to control their supply chain [9-12] despite signing agreements to this address both these issues [see 11]. For example, cigarette smuggling to and through Bulgaria continued after the deals reached with the European Union [5] and Japan Tobacco International (JTI) is currently under investigation by the European Anti-Fraud Agency, OLAF, following evidence that its involvement in illicit continued until recently [9].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the UK, Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise (HMRC) estimated that for 2011 the aggregate supply of certain brands of roll your own tobacco (RYO) to some countries exceeded legitimate demand by 240 per cent [11] suggesting that TTCs may be re-using their 1990 cigarette export practices on RYO.  Similarly, massive TTC overproduction of cigarettes in Ukraine has been shown to fuel the illicit market in Europe [12], a finding supported by a recent pan-European survey showing that illicit tobacco use was greatest in those living in countries which shared a land or sea border with Ukraine, Russia, Moldova or Belarus [13]. Furthermore, Philip Morris International’s (PMI) own data suggest that in 2010 around a quarter of illicit cigarettes in Europe are PMI’s own brands [14]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]TTC arguments and data on illicit tobacco[bold]Despite historical instances of involvement in the illicit trade and current allegations of complicity as outlined above, TTCs continue to use the threat of illicit tobacco to argue against key tobacco control policies in numerous jurisdictions [15-17]. For example, it has been shown that TTCs consistently and misleadingly argue that tobacco tax and price rises will increase the illicit tobacco trade [15], even in jurisdictions, including the UK and Ireland, where much of the price increases have been shown to be directly attributable to industry price increases rather than tax increases [18,19]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This argument was widely used in Australia (the first country to introduce standardised packaging for tobacco products in December 2012 [eg 20,21]. Despite the publicity achieved, evidence indicates that the tobacco industry and those working on its behalf exaggerated the scale of the illicit tobacco problem and misleadingly suggested the trend was upwards. For example, a report by accountancy firm 
[normal]Deloitte prepared for the three large Australian cigarette firms claimed that the market share of illegal cigarettes had increased from 6% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2010 [21]. In contrast government data suggested it was 3% and steady [22]. Economists examining trends in use of legal cheap cigarette brands, the closest competitor to illicit, showed their market share was steady thereby indicating that the claimed increase in illicit was highly unlikely [17].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similar data and arguments are now being propagated by the tobacco industry in the UK [23-25]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recent unpublished work (which we would be happy to share with the committee in confidence) examining the veracity of the industry data on illicit tobacco and press coverage thereof raises a number of concerns. One such concern is that TTCs have deliberately sought to solicit press coverage on the illicit tobacco trade in the UK using their ‘empty
[normal] pack surveys’ which involve the collection of 
[normal]discarded cigarette packs to determine their authenticity.
[normal] 
[normal]These surveys have a number of limitations. These include methodological issues such as appropriate sampling techniques and the representativeness of the settings where the surveys take place (such as close to borders or within football grounds) and the fact that they can only measure non-domestic product which includes both illicit and cross border sales. As such they can exaggerate the scale of the illicit tobacco trade in the UK. Secondly, p
[normal]ress coverage citing such industry data on illicit appeared to coincide with the government consultation on standardised packaging, a period when discussions about whether to proceed with standardised packaging were taking place.  Both the press coverage and recently published industry data appear intended to stress that levels of illicit are high and increasing.  Yet this apparent increase is not seen in all available independent data which show continuing declines [26, 27]. Evidence of industry data delivering higher estimates of the illicit trade compared with independent estimates is available elsewhere [28]. 
[normal]Furthermore, in the UK, a clear upward trend in the market share of ultra-low price cigarettes [29], the closest competitor to illicit cigarettes also casts doubt on the veracity of industry claims that illicit is increasing.  
[normal]Finally, the tobacco industry routinely misreports HMRC data, citing the HMRCs upper estimate rather than the more likely mid-estimate, thereby exaggerating the scale of the problem [eg 30].
