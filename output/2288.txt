[[[Request]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am the national lead for roads policing and would provide the following brief overview of the current technology position and any potential issues in relation to autonomous road vehicles and intelligent transport infrastructure in so far as it may affect the police service.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Background]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Certain elements of autonomous vehicle technology are already being incorporated into current vehicles; &#xa0;&#xa0;The majority of these systems are classified as supporting the driver and also include technology such as electronic stability control and anti-lock braking systems found on the majority of new vehicles.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The development of autonomous vehicles and the requisite infrastructure is a research area still in development, with research being carried out in a number of countries, most notably by Google in California. There is also a research programme being carried out in the UK at Oxford University. However, thus far this work is limited to a relatively small number of vehicles into which is fitted a substantial computer system including a variety of sensors. The infrastructure is currently very immature in relation to car to car and car to infrastructure communication. That said, some States in the USA have licensed the use of autonomous vehicles within that state alone for example Nevada, where the only stipulation is that the vehicle bears a red licence plate to identify it.&#xa0;Future Issues for the Police Service

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Road Safety]]] From an engineering perspective, designers see autonomous vehicles as the way in which “Vision Zero”- no collisions could be achieved, with the human error element, via the driver being removed.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Technical ]]]One of the issues discussed within the ITS workforce is around what comes first, the vehicles or the infrastructure? Both of which are likely to be very expensive. Why would you create an expensive infrastructure with no vehicles to use it and alternatively why purchase a vehicle with the autonomous capability, where there is no supporting infrastructure? Additionally, what happens when an autonomous vehicle is approaching a junction where a non-autonomous vehicle is present?&#xa0;

[[[Legal]]] When is the driver in control of the vehicle and who is then liable if and when the technology fails and a collision/offence occurs? Is there an opportunity for a driver to override the autonomous system and if so is it recorded on the vehicle?&#xa0;

[[[Police Investigation ]]]Following road traffic collisions police investigators will need to access vehicle systems, independent of the vehicle manufacturer, as it may be the vehicle manufacturer who is liable if the technology is found to have failed or have been claimed by the driver to have failed. This data may be recovered voluntarily or via a court order which can be costly and time consuming. The service would therefore welcome guidance regarding the recovery of future of evidence.&#xa0;

[[[Cyber Attack]]] There have been recent articles and reports released into the illegal “hacking” into engine management systems of two vehicles in the USA and allegedly gaining control of those vehicles via the inputting of codes into the vehicles computer systems. This currently requires a direct connection to the vehicle and the particular CanBus code for that particular make, model, type but in the future with the requirement for systems on the vehicle to communicate with other vehicles and the infrastructure this may create may leave vehicles open to external interference.&#xa0;

[[[Location Technology ]]]Currently location technologies such as GPS, provide sub 5 metre accuracy. Whilst this level of accuracy is suitable for satellite navigation it would not be suitable for autonomous vehicles, where centimetre accuracy may be required to prevent collisions, together with millisecond timing to communicate with other vehicles and the infrastructure. Therefore, any positioning/timing signal will need to be extremely robust and not susceptible to either jamming of those signals or “spoofing” (Where a false signal shows a vehicle in a different location from where it is at that time).&#xa0;Overall, at this time both vehicles and infrastructure are immature with a number of issues to be considered as highlighted.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
