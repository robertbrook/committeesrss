[normal]Written evidence from Monitor (PEX 0018)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Monitor is the sector regulator for health services in England.  Our job is to protect and promote the interests of patients by ensuring
[normal] the whole sector works for their benefit.  We exercise a range of powers granted by Parliament which include setting and enforcing a framework of rules for providers and commissioners, implemented in part through licences we issue to NHS-funded providers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Monitor has recently begun to build capacity to more robustly evaluate the sustainability of the health system.  An economics team and a sector reporting team have been established and much work is in progress that will aid our understanding of how the h
[normal]ealth sector is coping with demand and available resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This document is our response to the Committee’s request for evide
[normal]nce in the areas 
[normal]of interest to the Committee 
[normal]we are qualified and able to comment on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 
[normal]Details of forward planning being made by NHS Foundation Trusts are set out in Monitor’s Annual Plan R
[normal]eview (APR), published i
[normal]n July
[normal], which is available at 
[normal]http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/home/news-events-publications/our-publications

[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]On the basis of the track record of F
[normal]oundation 
[normal]T
[normal]rust
[normal]s i
[normal]n recent years, the 
[normal]Annual Plan Review indicates the sector will continue to be resilient in the short term
[normal].  However, we know that the
[normal] number of foundation trusts
[normal] in financial distress has increased, as has the number struggli
[normal]ng to meet operational demands.  T
[normal]he outlook on overall funding is uncertain and the spending review has confirmed that financial pressures will increase beyond 201
[normal]5/16.
[normal]  The review 
[normal]suggests the balance of longer term ris
[normal]ks has shifted to the downside.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]Tariff deflation, combined with inflation of costs, drives the need for year-on-year efficiency savings and increas
[normal]es the financial stress on the foundation trust
[normal] s
[normal]ector.
[normal] 
[normal] This is most markedly demonstrated by a decline in the overall sector EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) 
[normal]percentage 
[normal]– a key measure of cashflow - from 7.1% in 2009/10 to 6.0% in 2012/13.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 As a summary
[normal], the 
[normal]APR revealed
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 
[normal]The organisations who have suffered significant and persistent deficits tend to have a combination of one or more of the following issues:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, there can also be very specific factors which contribute to persistent deficits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].6 
[normal]Without transformational change, for example through integration of services and service redesign, efficiency opportunities are likely to become increasingly difficult to identify and deliver which may lead to increasing financial distress across the FT
[normal] sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 
[normal]Monitor recently published a paper, 
[normal]Closing the funding gap: how to get better value health care for patients
[normal] (available at: 
[normal]http://www.monitor.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/ClosingTheGap091013.pdf
[normal]).  It
[normal] sets out our current thinking on the challenges facing the NHS and s
[normal]ome potential approaches to meeting them, in order to kick start the 
[normal]“honest and realistic debate” called for by NHS England on the challenge that the NHS faces
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Monitor’s view is that 
[normal]health services will need to change radically in order to secure 
[normal]the future of the NHS – the system as a whole will need to close a £30 billion funding gap while providing good quality services to patients that are free at the point of use and fit for the needs of patients in the 21st century.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 
[normal]This funding gap will
[normal] be the greatest financial challenge the NHS has faced in recent years. It will require difficult decisions to be made. The NHS will have to achieve ‘more for less’ at a higher rate than it ever has before. One ‘huge heave’ will not be enough, and the NHS 
[normal]will have to ensure that improvements in productivity do not lag behind the rest of the economy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 
[normal]Our report outlined potential opportunities which are available to deliver better care and close the financial gap. These opportunities won’t be easily ac
[normal]hieved, but have the potential to close the financial gap and improve the way services are delivered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 
[normal]The available evidence indicates a range of opportunities to make significant recurrent productivity gains across the NHS by 2021 and beyond. These opportunities break down into four main types, outlined below: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It will 
[normal]be highly likely that the changes required to im
[normal]plement these opportunities will result in
[normal] significant consolidation and reconfiguration of existing services.  Difficult decisions will have to be made.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitor is currently working with the NHS Trust Development Authority
[normal] to examine the challenges facing smaller NHS hospitals of which there are around 70 non-specialist acute trusts with an annual income of less than £300m.
[normal]  In particular we are seeking evidence on:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1 
[normal]Monitor recently carried out some work to look into 
[normal]the ‘marginal rate rule’ for Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) services. This rule means that A&amp;E admissions above a baseline set in 2008/09 are reimbursed at 30% of the usual NHS price (tariff), with commissioners retaining the other 70% in order to enable the
[normal]m to invest in better admissions management. Although local variation to the baseline is allowed where there has been a service reconfiguration or other major change to admissions in a particular hospital, some commentators suggested that this approach mig
[normal]ht be contributing to financial pressures on NHS providers. 
[normal]              
[normal]4.2 
[normal]We published a paper on the findings of our review, which is available at: 
[normal]http://www.monitor.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Monitor%20and%20NHS%20England%E2%80%99s%20review%20of%20the%20marginal%20rate%20rule.pdf
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]Overall, the evidence indicates 
[normal]a reduction in 
[normal]growth
[normal] in avoidable emergency admissions, particularly in patients being admitted for short stays in hospital (less than 48 hours). We have also heard from stakeholders that, where the rule is well implemented, it encourages collaborative and transparent investm
[normal]ent in measures to manage demand for urgent and emergency care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]These positive findings would have been outweighed had we found evidence that the rule systematically caused financial difficulties for providers which might affect 
[normal]the quality of patient
[normal] care.  However,
[normal] the large majority of providers appear to be managing with the rule in place. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 
[normal]Additionally, the review heard from many providers about potentially serious issues on the horizon with payments for urgent and emergency services generall
[normal]y. For example, many said that their A&amp;E services are loss-making and supported by cross-subsidies. We take these issues very seriously. At present, detailed information on emergency care costs and revenues is scarce. Trying to unpick cross-subsidies befor
[normal]e we fully understand their extent, direction and causes could destabilise providers’ finances. We need more detailed understanding of the costs of urgent and emergency care to develop robust reforms to the payment system that ensure sustainable quality ca
[normal]re for patients.
[normal]  This work is ongoing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6 
[normal]In the interim, additional financial support has been made available by the Secretary of State for Health for winter pressures on A&amp;
[normal]E departments for those Trusts which Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority judge 
[normal]would most benefit
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 
[normal]Planning is still being carried out in relation to practical arrangements for the shared funding for health and social ca
[normal]re announced by the Government.  
[normal]However, it is clear that there is likely to be a significant sh
[normal]ift of resource out of the acute sector and this will incre
[normal]ase the likelihood of structural
[normal] change to services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 
[normal]Last yea
[normal]r, Monitor published a report entitled
[normal] 
[normal]Enablers and barriers to integrated care and implications for Monitor
[normal], which is available at 
[normal]http://www.mo
[normal]nitor-nhsft.gov.uk/home/news-events-publications/our-publications/browse-category/guidance-health-care-providers-and-co-23
[normal]. The evidence this provides suggests that there are real benefits to patients and service users from the better integration of ser
[normal]vices, particularly in terms of improved quality. However, specific UK evidence on cost savings is relatively weak. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 
[normal]We have since been working with our partner organisations across the health and social care system to improve the integration of health and social care services, for example through seeking integration ‘pioneers’ to help maintain momentum and accelerate th
[normal]e adoption of new models of coordinated care across the country. This work is still at an early stage.
