defaultMonitor is the sector regulator for health services in England.  Our job is to protect and promote the interests of patients by ensuring
default the whole sector works for their benefit.  We exercise a range of powers granted by Parliament which include setting and enforcing a framework of rules for providers and commissioners, implemented in part through licences we issue to NHS-funded providers.
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor has recently begun to build capacity to more robustly evaluate the sustainability of the health system.  An economics team and a sector reporting team have been established and much work is in progress that will aid our understanding of how the h
defaultealth sector is coping with demand and available resources.

defaultn recent years, the 
defaultAnnual Plan Review indicates the sector will continue to be resilient in the short term
default.  However, we know that the
default number of foundation trusts
default in financial distress has increased, as has the number struggli
defaultng to meet operational demands.  T
defaulthe outlook on overall funding is uncertain and the spending review has confirmed that financial pressures will increase beyond 201
default5/16.
default  The review 
defaultsuggests the balance of longer term ris

defaultTariff deflation, combined with inflation of costs, drives the need for year-on-year efficiency savings and increas

default This is most markedly demonstrated by a decline in the overall sector EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation)

defaultWithout transformational change, for example through integration of services and service redesign, efficiency opportunities are likely to become increasingly difficult to identify and deliver which may lead to increasing financial distress across the FT

defaultMonitor recently published a paper, 
defaultClosing the funding gap: how to get better value health care for patients

default).  It
default sets out our current thinking on the challenges facing the NHS and s
defaultome potential approaches to meeting them, in order to kick start the 
default“honest and realistic debate” called for by NHS England on the challenge that the NHS faces
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultMonitor’s view is that 
defaulthealth services will need to change radically in order to secure 
defaultthe future of the NHS – the system as a whole will need to close a £30 billion funding gap while providing good quality services to patients that are free at the point of use and fit for the needs of patients in the 21st century.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultThis funding gap will
default be the greatest financial challenge the NHS has faced in recent years. It will require difficult decisions to be made. The NHS will have to achieve ‘more for less’ at a higher rate than it ever has before. One ‘huge heave’ will not be enough, and the NHS 
defaultwill have to ensure that improvements in productivity do not lag behind the rest of the economy.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultOur report outlined potential opportunities which are available to deliver better care and close the financial gap. These opportunities won’t be easily ac
defaulthieved, but have the potential to close the financial gap and improve the way services are delivered.
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultThe available evidence indicates a range of opportunities to make significant recurrent productivity gains across the NHS by 2021 and beyond. These opportunities break down into four main types, outlined below: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt will 
defaultbe highly likely that the changes required to im
defaultplement these opportunities will result in
default significant consolidation and reconfiguration of existing services.  Difficult decisions will have to be made.  
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMonitor is currently working with the NHS Trust Development Authority
default to examine the challenges facing smaller NHS hospitals of which there are around 70 non-specialist acute trusts with an annual income of less than £300m.
default  In particular we are seeking evidence on:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1 
defaultMonitor recently carried out some work to look into 
defaultthe ‘marginal rate rule’ for Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) services. This rule means that A&amp;E admissions above a baseline set in 2008/09 are reimbursed at 30% of the usual NHS price (tariff), with commissioners retaining the other 70% in order to enable the
defaultm to invest in better admissions management. Although local variation to the baseline is allowed where there has been a service reconfiguration or other major change to admissions in a particular hospital, some commentators suggested that this approach mig
defaultht be contributing to financial pressures on NHS providers. 
default              
default4.2 
defaultWe published a paper on the findings of our review, which is available at: 
defaulthttp://www.monitor.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Monitor%20and%20NHS%20England%E2%80%99s%20review%20of%20the%20marginal%20rate%20rule.pdf
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultOverall, the evidence indicates 
defaulta reduction in 
defaultgrowth
default in avoidable emergency admissions, particularly in patients being admitted for short stays in hospital (less than 48 hours). We have also heard from stakeholders that, where the rule is well implemented, it encourages collaborative and transparent investm
defaultent in measures to manage demand for urgent and emergency care.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultThese positive findings would have been outweighed had we found evidence that the rule systematically caused financial difficulties for providers which might affect 
defaultthe quality of patient
default care.  However,
default the large majority of providers appear to be managing with the rule in place. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultAdditionally, the review heard from many providers about potentially serious issues on the horizon with payments for urgent and emergency services generall
defaulty. For example, many said that their A&amp;E services are loss-making and supported by cross-subsidies. We take these issues very seriously. At present, detailed information on emergency care costs and revenues is scarce. Trying to unpick cross-subsidies befor
defaulte we fully understand their extent, direction and causes could destabilise providers’ finances. We need more detailed understanding of the costs of urgent and emergency care to develop robust reforms to the payment system that ensure sustainable quality ca
defaultre for patients.
default  This work is ongoing.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 
defaultIn the interim, additional financial support has been made available by the Secretary of State for Health for winter pressures on A&amp;
defaultE departments for those Trusts which Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority judge 
defaultwould most benefit
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1 
defaultPlanning is still being carried out in relation to practical arrangements for the shared funding for health and social ca
defaultre announced by the Government.  
defaultHowever, it is clear that there is likely to be a significant sh
defaultift of resource out of the acute sector and this will incre
defaultase the likelihood of structural
default change to services.

default&#xa0;

defaultLast yea
defaultr, Monitor published a report entitled

default, which is available at 
defaulthttp://www.mo
defaultnitor-nhsft.gov.uk/home/news-events-publications/our-publications/browse-category/guidance-health-care-providers-and-co-23
default. The evidence this provides suggests that there are real benefits to patients and service users from the better integration of ser
defaultvices, particularly in terms of improved quality. However, specific UK evidence on cost savings is relatively weak. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2 
defaultWe have since been working with our partner organisations across the health and social care system to improve the integration of health and social care services, for example through seeking integration ‘pioneers’ to help maintain momentum and accelerate th
defaulte adoption of new models of coordinated care across the country. This work is still at an early stage.
