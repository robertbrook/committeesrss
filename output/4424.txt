&#xa0;Written evidence from Jolyon Western (CYS0097)CYCLING SAFETY – Changing rule  163 of the Highway code.As more cyclists venture onto the road drivers unused to sharing the road with bicycles  frequently  treat  cyclists as they would other cars passing within close proximity often at speed.Currently “Rule 163 of the Highway Code adds that a driver should give cyclists ‘at least as much room’ as you would a car,” This is far too vague and subjective .It ignores  completely the inherent difference in the risk involved in passing a four wheeled vehicle in which the driver is enclosed in the vehicle and that in passing  a two wheeled vehicle which is subject to wind or road surface  irregularities that can deflect the path of the rider.New drivers and indeed current drivers need to be given unambiguous  directions on what a genuinely safe distance to allow is. In other countries , Germany &amp; Spain  for example there is a clearly stated 1.5 metre passing standard written into law.  Other areas have mandated minimum 3 ft limit yet  the UK apparently has nothing beyond the bland statement &amp; potentially misleading advice in rule 163.Changing this to a specific distance and ensuring that drivers ,new and old  become aware of this is a crucial  step in creating a safer environment on our roads for cycles and for car drivers.Obviously  this is in the interests of cyclists but  there will be many well-intentioned but  ill-informed  drivers who armed with this awareness may  as a result  not experience the trauma of being involved in what are frequently serious or deadly bicycle car collisions.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
