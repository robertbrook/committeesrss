"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by RICS Wales (DWB 07)&#xa0;RICS Wales is the principal body representing professionals employed in the land, property and construction sector and represents some 4000 members divided into 17 professional groups across Wales. As \npart of our Royal Charter we have a commitment to provide advice to policy makers and in doing so we have an obligation to bear in mind the public interest as well as the interest of our members\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;RICS Wales position. We will decide on taking a position when a Referendum is called by Welsh Government and following Consultation and engagement with our Members and based on circumstances at that time.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;RICS Wales position. We would comment that it could potentially allow Welsh Government to invest in Infrastructure, and that the effect would depend on what Welsh Government did with it. So if for exampl\ne it was used to reform the tiered\n element, or to make Wales relatively more attractive this would likely be positive. Conversely however we would be very concerned if it was used to raise revenue over and above that levied in England because of the geographical proximity of Wales to Engla\nnd versus Scotland and the resulting cross border nature of many developers. \n&#xa0;RICS Wa\nles position. We welcome this provided\n it is used to support investment in Infrastructure in Wales.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The Bill will allow Welsh Government borrowing powers of £500 million for Capital spending aand £500 million on their current account. &#xa0;RICS Wales position. While we would not rule out supporting higher limits in future\n,\n we\n think this is fine for now. How\never\n the caveat that it should be regularly reviewed to \nreflect changing conditions and needs. However we warmly welcome the greater flexibility in regards to the circumstances in which Welsh Government Ministers can borrow in the short term\n.&#xa0;The Bill will increase the Assembly Term to 5 years and drop the ban on dual list and constituency candidacies for the Welsh Assembly at the same election.RICS Wales position. We have decided to remain neutral on these\n electoral\n points. \n&#xa0;RICS Wales position. In our view this is a sensible measure granting flexibility as devolution in Wales and the constitutional position across the UK continues to evolve go\ning forward.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;RICS Wales position. We would strongly support this and ask Welsh Government and the UK Government to agree such a \nprotoco\nl as swiftly as they can to help ensure devolved legislation operates smoothly alongside UK wide legislation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
