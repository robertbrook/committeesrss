"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Staffordshire County Council (LPG 57)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStaffordshire County Council believes local government, as a sector, plays a crucial role in not only improving lives but supporting the economy and local communities through the way we operate.\n&#xa0;\nThe county council has significantly influenced national thinking through its involvement in the Cabinet Office’s Commissioning Academy and developed its own innovative commissioning framework which is transforming how we operate and work with others. \n&#xa0;\nCommissioning tends to mean different things to different people and organisations. In Staffordshire, we ‘commission’ in order to secure better outcomes for our residents, focusing on what makes a real difference. This informs how we spend our own money but also encourages us to influence how other organisations spend their money and look at the contribution of residents and communities themselves.\n&#xa0;\nOur strategic commissioning approach promotes spending as much time as possible establishing what question we are trying to answer, establishing an in-depth understanding of our residents’ needs and using this information to inform what we invest our resources in. \n&#xa0;\nBasically being clear why we are commissioning. By getting this right, we have much more of a chance of success and will procure exactly what is needed. This approach also helps to support de-commissioning decisions and avoid repeat re-contracting due to lack of evidence of impact. \n&#xa0;\nImplementing a new framework needs detailed work to align support processes including finance and crucially procurement. In this respect procurement proffers a strategic role in that they can support current delivery, the transition to a new model and then integrate with the new service. \n&#xa0;\nAt the same time procurement is an essential process within the commissioning framework, delivering value for money by maintaining operational excellence and controlling cost. Historically procurement was the means of simply acquiring goods and services, but increasingly there is a need to see it as a means of introducing commercial insight and objectives into decision making to ensure that value for money and cost are controlled throughout the delivery of services by the public sector. \n&#xa0;\nOur submission will follow the same format as the questions asked by the committee under the following themes: Delivering Value for money, collaboration and access to skills and expertise. \n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDelivering Value for Money \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStaffordshire County Council has undertaken a process of developing its procurement from ‘good’ to ‘great’. Procurement is seen as an integral part of the county councils development in becoming a strategic commissioner and securing the best outcomes for our communities.  Our procurement team has won 11 National Awards for its innovative practices since 2009.  We are finalists in 2 categories for this year’s CIPS awards in September.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, procurement is very much a means to an end, meaning that we have redesigned procurement to be run along commercial lines as part of a performance management system emanating from the Medium Term Financial Strategy. The \nobjective is managed by the procurement process on a commercial basis to reduce the cost of supply. \n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn reducing the cost of supply we are looking to sustain the low cost through the life cycle of the contract. This means looking beyond the initial tender price and looking at the ongoing cost of the procured item. Doing so prevents instrumentalism in the management of the tender and means that the costs associated with a product can be managed appropriately on a long term basis. \n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur Head of Procurement is a Social Value Champion for the west midlands and social value is at the heart of our procurement strategy.  An example of this is our partnering with a local Social Enterprise to embed, so far, over 200 local apprentices in our supply chain.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDelivering Value for Money: Impact\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis has several advantages, notably in maintaining a high level of value for money for the tax payer, but it also facilitates the necessary adaptability of a commissioning organisation and its changing procurement needs. By focusing on cost not price and integrating this into the commissioning process, we can ensure that the procurement reflects the demands of the services. \n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, we want to focus on how our procurement process can support local prosperity. As a council we spend around £500m per year on goods and services that we increasingly look to spend locally, whilst still complying with EU procurement legislation.  Our procurement team has won national awards for its work in this area. \n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPart of this is removing barriers to local suppliers by becoming a customer of choice. This involves approaching our procurement from the perspective of the supplier and ensuring that local firms can access opportunities with the council – this ensures that we maximize the impact of our procurement locally whilst maintaining our focus on costs.    For example, by the sensitive use of ‘\nlotting\n’, i.e. dividing contracts into districts of the county, all milk drunk by Staffordshire school children comes from local tenant farmers and is supplied by a local supplier.  All our seasonal fruit and vegetables are also supplied by local suppliers.  We were awarded the West Midlands Federation of Small Businesses Award for the Best “Small Business Friendly” Procurement Policy in 2012.  \n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCollaborative &amp; joint opportunities \n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall\n \nStaffordshire\n \nCounty\n Councils innovative strategic commissioning approach has required a cultural shift to the role that we play as part of a wider public sector.  We currently provide a procurement service to 4 of our District Councils and are in discussions with the Police to do similar.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to our use of performance management to look at activity, outcomes and cost we have a wider responsibility to support our partners and work with them. One way is to share our procurement contracts with partners to avoid duplication, reduce cost and simplify the process for local firms to bid for contracts.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdmittedly we are at the early stages of collaboration but there is a clear necessity to engage with joint opportunities on the basis of maximising value for money as well as supporting a wider engagement across the public sector. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to skills, expertise, and capabilities \n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have undertaken a long term investment in our procurement team as we recognised its role in support of our wider financial and corporate objectives. But we also recognised the need to reform our procurement services from being part of a procedure to being part of the discussion undertaken by managers within the council.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCrucially we recognized the gaps in our procurement process and the need to ensure that the people who tend to procure services in local government do not work in procurement! Thus we undertook a program that set our clearly the priority outcomes (in terms of Staffordshire’s Vision, values and behaviours) and fixed procurement as part of our operating model.  We undertook a “One Council” review of procurement to ensure that all people who undertook procurement are professionally directed and supported. \n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDoing this through a review has led to an ongoing investment of £300,000 creating 6 new Category Managers with a focus on recruiting newly qualified staff and additionally training current staff in professional procurement qualifications.  Since 2008, we have invested over £50,000 in getting procurement staff professionally qualified with the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS).  We currently have 16 fully qualified staff with a further 15 staff in the process of becoming fully qualified.   \n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy focusing on creating a new team with the professional credibility and the ability to present commercial expertise alongside service expenditure, and establishing procurement within the corporate mind-set Staffordshire County Council has secured around £2m worth of ongoing savings through staff alone.  Since 2008, when we introduced category management, the procurement team has achieved cashable savings of £32 million and through the re-negotiation of existing contracts, a further £10.5 million of cashable savings.  \n&#xa0;\nTaken together, the importance of procurement in the delivery of a strategic commissioning cannot be overstated, and the examples provided give an indication about how procurement has been developed within local government and how it can support the work of council’s in adapting to future pressures. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
