[normal]Written evidence from

[normal]I have been cycling regular for many years mostly in the Midlands. I do voluntary work to support cycling through 
[normal]Sustrans
[normal] and the CTC. Through this work I talk to many 
[normal]people and especially would be cyclists. I have assisted with adult cycle training. The message I hear over and over again particularly from would be cyclists is "I would not cycle on road - 
[normal]its
[normal] too dangerous". I used to spend a lot of time trying to refut
[normal]e this argument, but sadly I am afraid I am beginning to believe them myself. My own perception is that cycling has become significantly less safe and consequently I am now much more selective over when and where I cycle.
[normal]The recent deaths in London are a 
[normal]great sadness 
[normal]to me, but I also feel 
[normal]enormous frustration because at the strategic level the problems are well understood and the answers known. These were articulated in the Get Britain 
[normal]C
[normal]ycling
[normal] 
[normal]R
[normal]eport
[normal] which received unanimous support in the commons.
[normal] I
[normal]Quit
[normal]e simply you need segregation between a 100kg cyclist 
[normal]traveling
[normal] at 10mph and cars and 
[normal]lorries
[normal] with a mass 20-300 times greater, perhaps 
[normal]traveling
[normal] 3 times as fast.
[normal]Whilst this situation prevails, talk about education, training, 
[normal]behaviour
[normal], helmets
[normal], headphone
[normal]s 
[normal]etc. is just whistling in the wind. I am frustrated that the media and politicians focus on cyclist 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] normally citing jumping of red lights. Whilst I agree this is unacceptable it p
[normal]ai
[normal]ls
[normal] into insignificance compared with motorists who speed, pass 
[normal]too close to cyclists and generally drive without due care and attention. Cycling in cities has become an extreme sport only to be attempted by the young confident and fit. 
[normal]It doesn't have to be like this. One only has to look overseas to Holland. Here cy
[normal]cling is a normal activity carried out daily by young and old. Cyclists are not kitted out in body 
[normal]armour
[normal], but they do have a proper segregated infrastructure. 
[normal]The Dutch reap enormous benefits from this infrastructure by providing a viable way to travel w
[normal]hich reduces congestion and make cities more 
[normal]liveable
[normal] .
[normal] In turn this benefits the environment and the nation's health. This vision cannot be achieved overnight it requires vision, it requires leadership and it requires investment. Sadly I see none of these
[normal].
[normal]As I cyclist myself for more than 30 years I have witnessed cycling becoming increasingly dangerous. I now very carefully choose when and where I cycle. There are very few segregated cycle routes available to me and even these are in a poor state of repa
[normal]ir.
[normal]The strategic solution will not happen overnight, so I would suggest the following tactical changes
[normal]:
[normal]- make 20mph the default speed limit where people live;
[normal]- equip lorries with sensors
[normal] to cover blind spots
[normal]- ban 
[normal]hgvs
[normal] during rush hour
[normal]- more traffic in
[normal]fringement enforcement 
[normal]- more cyclist awareness training for motorists . 
[normal]- 
[normal]more
[normal] cycle training particularly for adults
[normal]I must stress that these are tactical, and must not been seen as a substitute for a fit for purpose infrastructure.
[normal]Do not on any accou
[normal]nt make helmets compulsory or ban cycling in any way. This is not solving the problem, but admitting defeat.
