"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Basf Plc (CCS01)The Committee invites responses addressing some or all of the following questions:\nBASF intends to respond to those listed in red given our expertise and interest\ns. \nBASF\n is the world’s leading chemical co\nmpany: The Chemical Company. Our\n portfolio ranges from chemicals, plastics, performance products and crop protection products to oil and gas. We combine economic suc\ncess with environmental protection and social responsibility. Through science and\n innovation, we enable our customers in nearly every industry to meet the current and future needs of society. Our products and solutions contribute to conserving resources, e\nnsuring nutrition and improving quality of life. We have summed up this contribution in our corporate purpose: We create chemistry for a sustainable future. BASF had sales of €72.1 billion in 2012 and more than 110,000 employees as of the end of the year. \nBASF has been at the forefront of innovation in gas treatment for over 40 years. In 1971, the company for the first time applied newly developed technology based on activated methyldiethanolamine to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from synthesis \ngas to produce ammonia, a crucial starting material for fertilizer. The facility, which is still in operation, is located at the Ludwigshafen, Germany. \nToday, almost 300 plants worldwide employ BASF’s knowhow to remove acid gases such as CO2 and hydrogen \nsulphide (H2S) from various types of process gases. Recently, the company started marketing its combined gas treating technology, chemical and technical service offerings under the new Oase® brand. \nWith climate change becoming an increasing concern global\nly, the team is actively leveraging its expertise to become a leading contender in the race to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) commercially viable. \nMore information about BASF’s gas treatment solutions can be found here:\nhttp://www.intermediates.basf.com/chemicals/web/gas-treatment/en/\nBASF UK generated €3.6bn revenue in 2012 of which €1.9bn was oil, gas, and metals trading. Th\ne remaining €1.7bn accounts for 3% of BASF global chemical sales (€62bn), Our UK mark\net share is around 3% of the £\n57\nbn \nUK \nChemicals sector. \nThe bulk of our UK sales are chemicals and performance products (e.g. pigments, water treatments and care chemical\ns). We are major providers \nof product \nto supply chains for \noil and gas, \nagriculture, automotive, construction, and pharmaceuticals, as well as to other chemical manufacturers. \nWe are major sponsor of innovation in the UK with over 100 R&amp;D partnerships in \n2011. Within BASF this was the highest number outside Germany. These range from\n university projects with partners such as Imperial College, to institutional projects and\n commercial partnerships with BP and Shell.\nIf we were a UK-led business we would be on\ne of the top 100 companies in the UK. Several of our sites have over 80% of their product exported.\n We are one of @70 companies engaging with the Government’s Strategic Relationship Management Programme\nBASF are prov\niders of chemistry solutions for carbon capture, we are not major providers o\nf storage solutions, but work in partnership with those that are\n,\n to deliver CCS \npilots and \ntrials. \nNiederaussem – solvents for scrubbing BASF\n is a partner in a pilot project st\neered by RWE Power at \nthe\n Coal Innovation \nCentre\n in Niederaussem, Germany, near Cologne. The object is to test highly energy-efficient and oxygen-stable solvents for removing carbon dioxide from bituminous coal emissions. BASF has developed an improved scr\nubbing process\n, based on\n \ninnovative \nsolvents\n, \nto capture CO\n2\n. We have\n demonstrated that energy input can be slashed by about 20%.\nThe pilot plant was built and engineered by Munich-based inte\nrnational gases group Linde. It \ncaptures around eight tonnes per \nday of CO\n2\n, equivalent to a separation efficiency of 90% for the flue gas processed. The technology should allow more than 90% of the process gas from a power plant to be captured for sequestration underground. \nBoth BASF and Linde are now working on solut\nions for demonstration plants – the first are due on stream in 2015 – as well as large-scale power plants. CO\n2\n capture is expected to be used commercially\n in coal-fired power stations in\n 2020. \nPuertollano – IGCC output purificationIn Spain\n a special BASF gas treatment technology\n \n- similar to the purification of syngas - is being used at the IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) power plant of ELCOGAS in Puertollano\n. It\n \nwill\n capture about 35,000 tons of gas annually. The plant\n,\n alrea\ndy in commercial-scale operation, is also being used for demonstration purposes. It is expected to provide a wealth of information relating to the viability of the IGCC concept, which differs from the post-combustion capture concept. \nNorth Carolina – second generation ‘water-free’ capture technologyIn the US BASF has joined forces with RTI International – a\nn institute \nbas\ned in Research Triangle Park, \nNorth Carolina – to develop second-generation capture technology. \nWe\n \nare looking\n into novel non-aqueous so\nlvent systems that can be recycled. The aim is to find a “water free” capture process that could use 40% less energy than conventional amine-based processes.\nWe hope to\n clear a path for rapid commercialisation of the carbon capture technology and thus enab\nle cost-competitive clean energy production from coal-fired power plants.\nNagaoka City – efficient CO2 recovery from natural gasIn Japan, BASF has linked up with local companies JGC and INPEX to perform demonstration tests with a new technology for effect\nively capturing and recovering CO\n2\n contained in natural gas. The tests were started in August 2010 at INPEX’s Koshijihara natural gas plant in Nagaoka City.\nJGC and BASF in began developing the High Pressure Acid Gas Capture Technology (HiPACT) in 2004. Th\nis process shows a “significantly higher” CO\n2\n absorption, compared with existing processes, and is capable of regenerating the solvent under high pressure conditions. An important milestone will be to transfer the new technology to an operating gas process\ning plant.\nHiPACT should help reduce overall power consumption in the facility while also lowering investment costs. \nB\necause the gas is released from the solvent at well above atmospheric pressure there is\n also \n a significant reduction in the amount of ene\nrgy required \nfor\n high pressure applications such as chemical synthesis or underground\n sequestration\n.\n&#xa0;\nW\ne would not be involved in\n pilot projects if we did not believe carbon capture technologies were likely to present significant commerci\nal opportunities in future. For example\n,\n \nin \nthe Middle East demand for purified CO2 is increasing, in particular to raise yields in crude oil production (by means of enhanced oil recovery) and in urea production.\nThere are and will be markets for Carbon Ca\npture technologies even if Carbon Capture and Storage proves to be an unworkable or uneconomic choice for climate change mitigation. \nCCS is still \na \nvery expensive \nand unproven \nway to mitigate \nCO\n2\n emissions from industrial processes and generation. It reduces efficiency and productivity compared to processes without CCS. It is some way from being cost competitive with the best alternative carbon reduction technologies. \nAt the current time, without\n a \ncomparable  \nglobal price for the carbon,\n the introduction of CCS\n within the UK or EU unilaterally,\n would lead\n to higher energy bills for domestic consumers and \ncompetitive disadvantage\ns\n for industry\n. This would be true for \nboth \nenergy-intensive industry\n (due to higher e\nlectricity prices) and for carbon-intensive\n industry\n \n(\nthat would have to introduce\n their own CCS\n)\n.\nNevertheless, \nif there were a global price for carbon\n,\n CCS\n might have advantages:\nPolicy measures \nto \nencourage\n CCS in \nthe UK and EU\n should not seek to put a \nhigh cost burden on \ndomestic \nc\nompanies \nand consumers\n. \nT\nhey\n should \nfocus on \nthe development and demonstration \nof \nfuture \n(and lower cost) \nCCS technology thro\nugh targeted fundin\ng, rather than\n deployment \nsubsidies. \nIf UK CCS demonstrations are generously subsidised, and UK industry is forced to pay for this through electricity market reform and / or inadequate energy intensive industry exemptions - one clear consequence is that manufacturing suppliers to CCS projects\n based in the UK will be less competitive than those not paying the subsidies outside the UK. \nSupport for CCS, like other low carbon technologies carries a strong risk of creating a ‘green growth paradox’. Making a market but unmaking the domestic industr\ny required to service it. \nPubli\nc finance \nfor R&amp;D \nis \nthough \nessential for CCS. \nPrivate investors alone will not take on the risk of a technology that has no market without significant sustained government intervention to create one.  \nPublic subsidies are o\nnly acceptable for the pilot phase of new technologies and have to be reduced according to the cost reduction. Long\ner \nterm \nsubsidies which have to be paid\n by other market participants are not acceptable.\nS\nocial acceptance is \ncrucial\n. The extensive developm\nent and operation of appropri\nate sites and\n a nationwide network of pipelines \nwill require \ndialogue with the public and NGOs.\n \nA single\n legal \nframework is also helpful\n. Regional\n variation\n - as in Germ\nany - has led to some states blocking pilots. \nTechnology \nnationalism will not help deliver CCS. It is unlikely any one country will have comparative a\ndvantage in every aspect of the \nCCS value\n chain.  CCS\n expertise is global.  Our spread of projects in the EU, US and Asia we hope demonstrate\ns\n the benefits \nand spr\nead \nof multilateral partnerships. \n \nWe, or rather our Wingas Storage subsidiary at Saltfleetby (currently in transition to Gazprom subject to a Commission competition ruling), have already found the UK market for storage solutions to be challenging. \n&#xa0;\nAltogether, RWE is spending around €9 million on the \nNiederaussem \ndevelopment project. The German federal government contributed about €4 million to the cost of the pilot plant\n. \nThe North Carolina project is being su\npported in part by a $2 million grant from the US Department of Energy.  \nThe ambition of the current and previous Government to make the UK a global export champion for CCS technologies is bold\n. It\n has not happ\nened yet and\n might be more credible if \nnarrowly focused on specific parts of the value chain with serious potential for comparative advantage\n. It might be more credible for the UK to focus on partnership rather than leadership\n within international teams.\n \nWe recognise internationalism is a part of the UK approach, but \n \npremised on an assumption collaboration will be delivered by companies that have succeeded in the UK first, based around the pilot projects that have been two years away from starting for muc\nh of the last decade.  \nWe do not \nthen \nbelieve the UK can or will be global leaders in \nall\n CCS \ntechnologies and suspect \nthe desire to ‘build it here’, evident since the \nabort\ned BP Peterhead project\n (2007)\n, has held back\n,\n not helped the commercialisation and export of ‘invented here’ technologies. \nWe suspect\n further\n there has been less ‘invented here’ as a result of seeking UK-led projects rather than partnerships of the willing. \nThese c\nould lower UK costs\n,\n while broadeni\nn\ng the pool of  expertise involved, and improving the prospects for future commercial success. \nFor example, for the\n manufacture of BASF’s future CCS intermediates to take place in the UK, even those based on \nhypothetical \nUK science partnerships, there wou\nld have to be significant evidence of comparative advantage from the tax, planning and regulatory regime, local expertise, and appropriate sites. \nWe would need to see evidence of an emerging CCS hub both domestic and for export, and multiple partners\n,\n to \nspread risk and accelerate innovation. We would like\nly\n seek to invest in and partner with emerging SMEs or adapt existing plant rather than build from scratch. \nAll of this would need \nto be significantly and relatively more attractive than current opportunities in other countries - many of which are ahead of the UK in respect of CCS projects and pilots – many of which have established cost advantages for skills and supply in Intermediat\ne Chemicals. \nWe do agree with the strong focus in the strategy placed on cost-reduction. We do agree with many of the \nideas put forward by the report\n of the CCS Cost Reduction Task Force. We do again though think too much attention is being given to domes\ntic pilots and projects and not enough to selecting markets and partners with lower cost profiles than t\nhe UK. \nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
