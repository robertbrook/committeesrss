[[[Written Submission]]]&#xa0;Question One: What are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Question Two: Why is the right to vote considered to be a human right?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Question Three: Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Question Four: What are the financial implications of maintaining the current ban in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Question Five: Is sentence length a legally robust basis on which to retain an entitlement to vote?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Question Six: What would be the likely legal consequences, both domestically and internationally of:&#xa0;a) keeping the law as it is? &#xa0;&#xa0;b) passing legislation giving some prisoners the right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;c) seeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Question Seven: Would giving prisoners the right to vote have any significant administrative impact on either the prison system or the Electoral Commission?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Question Eight: Is there any evidence to suggest that allowing prisoners to vote would have a significant impact on particular constituencies?&#xa0;&#xa0;Question Nine: What lessons can be drawn from the experience of other countries regarding prisoner voting? &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Concluding remarks&#xa0;&#xa0;June 20131&#xa0; For example, ‘Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the decision to prosecute’ (2011) 12 Criminal Law Review 943-956; ‘Sentencing children who kill: one giant leap for the US Supreme Court, one small step for international human rights law’ (2012) 12 Human Rights Law Review 801-813 For example, ‘A&#xa0;rights-specific approach to section 2 of&#xa0;the Human Rights Act’ (2012) 5 European Human Rights Law Review 516-528; ‘Human rights treaties in the English legal system’ [2011] Public Law 554-577 Deborah Cheney, ‘Prisoners as Citizens in Democracy’ (2008) 47 Howard Journal of Criminal Justice 134 Powell v Guest (1864) 144 E.R. 367, 372 On this, see C.R.G.

Hirst v United Kingdom (No.2) (2006) 42 EHRR 41 Hirst v United Kingdom (No.2) (2006) 42 EHRR 41 [49]-[50] The American Civil Liberties Union website has excellent coverage on the important of the right to vote, in the context of racial discrimination in the United States: http://www.aclu.org/voting-rights  See http://www.inquest.org.uk/. Also see Eric Allison, “How many more prisoners have to die in custody?” The Guardian, 11th June 2013. Available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jun/11/how-many-prisoners-die-custody  See, for example, headlines such as “Human rights is merely a sweetner for rapists, murderers and violent criminals” (Allison Pearson, The Daily Mail, 6th November 2007) Available at http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-492144/Human-rights-merely-sweetner-rapists-murderers-violent-criminals.html   See research by Prison Reform International: http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/ProjectsResearch/Mentalhealth  Raymond v.

Italy (no. 3) [2012] ECHR 868 Frodl v Austria (2011) 52 EHRR 5 On proportionality in sentencing, see for example Andrew Ashworth, “Sentencing and Criminal Justice” (5th edn, CUP), especially chapter 4; Susan Easton and Christine Piper, “Sentencing and Punishment: The Quest for Justice” (3rd edn, OUP) especially chapter 3; R v. Offen (No.2) [2000] EWCA Crim 96 (judgment of Lord Chief Justice Woolf); Weeks v. UK (1987) 10 EHRR 293  See the Crown Prosecution Service’s guidelines on prosecuting ABH: http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/assault_occasioning_actual_bodily_harm/  Please note that I am not suggesting that disenfranchisement is somehow “equal” to a year imprisonment - this is just a hypothetical example to illustrate the point that tying disenfranchisement to sentence length might be legally dubious, as it might result in disproportionate punishments.
