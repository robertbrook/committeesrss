[normal]Letter to the Committee from Peter Schofield, Director General, Neighbourhoods Group, Department for Communities and Local Government[bold]I am writing to you following my appearance at the CLG Select Committee on the 14
[normal]th
[normal] October 2013.
[normal]At the Committee I 
[normal]mentioned that, following the introduction of Help to Buy: Equity Loans, there had been an increase in the amount of demand for new build homes of between 10 and 20 per cent as a result of the scheme. The Chair asked whether this represented an additional 
[normal]2,500 to 5,000 homes a year, based around 25,000 homes a year the scheme will help to finance and the 10-20% estimate, and I said that it did.
[normal]However, rather than using the number of homes the scheme is helping, I should have used the overall number of ne
[normal]w build homes in total. Last year, 22 of the largest builders singed up to Help to Buy and built around 61,500 homes. For these builders, an increase in 10-20% would represent 6,000 to 12,000 homes a year. The overall number may be higher still, given ther
[normal]e is now a total of 939 house builders that have registered for the scheme.
[normal]Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information.
