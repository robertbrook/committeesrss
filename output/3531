[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where public funds are made available to sports, it should be allocated in an equal manner.
[normal] 
[normal]Where a sports organisation receives public funds, they should ensure equal treatment
[normal] of male and female athletes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Since 1972, the laws commonly known as Title IX have ensured that any organisation receiving public funds have had to ensure equal access for all students. This has typically ensured that large American universities spendi
[normal]ng significant sums on men’s sport have had to also allocate funds to women’s sports as well.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. In Britain, while, with one or two exceptions (Oxbridge rowing and rugby), our schools and universities do not have the inbuilt discrimination that the Americ
[normal]an system has, nor the public interest in student sport, we do have a state broadcaster willing to invest significant sums into sport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. It would be a fairly simple matter, and one requiring relatively little readjustment for men’s sports, with a large b
[normal]enefit for women’s sports, to simply require the BBC to ensure equal money paid for the rights to women’s sports, and to ensure that equal viewing time is given to both men’s and women’s sports.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. When women’s sports happen at the same time, and are broa
[normal]dcast equally with men’s sports, we see interest in them, and they receive significant publicity. When they happen separately, and are not broadcast equally, they do not.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Wimbledon and the Olympics are two examples of sports that happen concurrently, a
[normal]nd broadcast concurrently.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. If the BBC made this simple change, we would see a huge increase in the status of women’s sports, giving role models and ways for girls and women to participate.
