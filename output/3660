[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Welsh Language Commissioner[bold]The Welsh Language Commissioner welcomes the opportunity to comment on the effectiveness of Jobcentre 
[normal]Plus, and how its role should, perhaps, change in the context of reforming welfare including Universal Credit.
[normal]This comment is submitted as evidence to assist you in investigating the functions of the Centre.
[normal]The principal aim of the Commissioner is to pro
[normal]mote and facilitate the use of the Welsh language. This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and imposing standards on organizations. This, in turn, will lead to the establishment of rights for Welsh speakers. Two
[normal] principles underpin the Commissioner's work:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In Wales, the Welsh language should be treated no less favourably than the English language
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Persons in Wales should be able to live their lives through the medium of the Welsh language if they choose to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In due course, secondary legislation will introduce new powers allowing the setting and imposing of standards on organizations. Until then, the Commissioner will continue to inspect statutory language schemes through the powers inherited under the Welsh L
[normal]anguage Act 1993.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The post of Commissioner was created by the Welsh Language Measure (Wales) 2011. The Commissioner may investigate failure to implement a language scheme; interference with the freedom to use Welsh in Wales and, in future, complaints rega
[normal]rding the failure of organizations to meet standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of the Commissioner's priorities is to scrutinize policy developments in terms of the Welsh language. Therefore the Commissioner's main role is to provide comments in accordance with this remit and
[normal] to act as an independent advocate on behalf of Welsh speakers in Wales who could be affected by this investigation. This approach is used to avoid any possible compromise of the Commissioner's functions in the area of regulation, 
[normal]and should the Commission
[normal]er wish to formally review the performance of individual bodies or the Welsh Government in accordance with the provisions of the Measure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In carrying out this investigation of the functions of Jobcentre Plus, we ask you specifically to give consideration
[normal] to the following comments:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Commissioner believes that, in conducting this investigation it is vitally important to give equal consideration to the Welsh language from the outset in investigating the functions of Jobcentre Plus.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The importance of safeg
[normal]uarding frontline Welsh language services should be noted as a result of any further reorganization of the welfare system.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Commissioner has already informed the Department of Work and Pensions of her concerns regarding Universal Credit and the lack of 
[normal]Welsh language provision as part of the pilot scheme and also the Child Maintenance Group regarding its lack of forward planning in designing a new website when no consideration was given to a Welsh website at the beginning of the planning process.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Dep
[normal]artment of Work and Pensions' Welsh Language Scheme notes clearly that "Our policies, initiatives and services will be in accordance with this scheme.
[normal] They will support use of the Welsh language which will help the public in Wales to use Welsh as part of t
[normal]heir everyday life. When we contribute to the process of developing or introducing new policies, initiatives, services or legislation led by other organizations, we will do so in a way that accords with this scheme." 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The importance of considering the Wels
[normal]h language in all aspects of the investigation alongside all other factors in investigating the functions of Jobcentre Plus cannot be overemphasised.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We ask you to share your plans with the Welsh Language Commissioner before you implement them in order to 
[normal]provide the Commissioner with an assurance that the Welsh language has been fully considered.
[normal]Once again, thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on your investigation. We ask that you give full consideration to the comments noted above.
