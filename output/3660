defaultWritten evidence submitted by the Welsh Language CommissionerdefaultThe Welsh Language Commissioner welcomes the opportunity to comment on the effectiveness of Jobcentre 
defaultPlus, and how its role should, perhaps, change in the context of reforming welfare including Universal Credit.
defaultThis comment is submitted as evidence to assist you in investigating the functions of the Centre.
defaultThe principal aim of the Commissioner is to pro
defaultmote and facilitate the use of the Welsh language. This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and imposing standards on organizations. This, in turn, will lead to the establishment of rights for Welsh speakers. Two
default principles underpin the Commissioner's work:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn Wales, the Welsh language should be treated no less favourably than the English language
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPersons in Wales should be able to live their lives through the medium of the Welsh language if they choose to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn due course, secondary legislation will introduce new powers allowing the setting and imposing of standards on organizations. Until then, the Commissioner will continue to inspect statutory language schemes through the powers inherited under the Welsh L
defaultanguage Act 1993.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe post of Commissioner was created by the Welsh Language Measure (Wales) 2011. The Commissioner may investigate failure to implement a language scheme; interference with the freedom to use Welsh in Wales and, in future, complaints rega
defaultrding the failure of organizations to meet standards.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the Commissioner's priorities is to scrutinize policy developments in terms of the Welsh language. Therefore the Commissioner's main role is to provide comments in accordance with this remit and
default to act as an independent advocate on behalf of Welsh speakers in Wales who could be affected by this investigation. This approach is used to avoid any possible compromise of the Commissioner's functions in the area of regulation, 
defaultand should the Commission
defaulter wish to formally review the performance of individual bodies or the Welsh Government in accordance with the provisions of the Measure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn carrying out this investigation of the functions of Jobcentre Plus, we ask you specifically to give consideration
default to the following comments:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commissioner believes that, in conducting this investigation it is vitally important to give equal consideration to the Welsh language from the outset in investigating the functions of Jobcentre Plus.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe importance of safeg
defaultuarding frontline Welsh language services should be noted as a result of any further reorganization of the welfare system.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commissioner has already informed the Department of Work and Pensions of her concerns regarding Universal Credit and the lack of 
defaultWelsh language provision as part of the pilot scheme and also the Child Maintenance Group regarding its lack of forward planning in designing a new website when no consideration was given to a Welsh website at the beginning of the planning process.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Dep
defaultartment of Work and Pensions' Welsh Language Scheme notes clearly that "Our policies, initiatives and services will be in accordance with this scheme.
default They will support use of the Welsh language which will help the public in Wales to use Welsh as part of t
defaultheir everyday life. When we contribute to the process of developing or introducing new policies, initiatives, services or legislation led by other organizations, we will do so in a way that accords with this scheme." 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe importance of considering the Wels
defaulth language in all aspects of the investigation alongside all other factors in investigating the functions of Jobcentre Plus cannot be overemphasised.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe ask you to share your plans with the Welsh Language Commissioner before you implement them in order to 
defaultprovide the Commissioner with an assurance that the Welsh language has been fully considered.
defaultOnce again, thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on your investigation. We ask that you give full consideration to the comments noted above.
