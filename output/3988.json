"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Nuffield Health [CEP0008]&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\nPublic benefit delivered1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur charitabl\ne purpose defines our business. All of our services, treatments and facilities, and the funding that enables them, is dedicated to augmenting the nation’s health and wellbeing. \n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImproving public health outcomes is critical and Nuffield Health is uniquely \npositioned as a Third Sector \norganisation\n to achieve long-term, scalable, and leading-edge innovations across the UK healthcare sector. No other healthcare group can combine the freedom to act solely in the interests of the public, with the ability to deli\nver across a range of services, and the flexibility to take a panoramic view. Our carefully built and managed financial strength permits us to \nutilise\n the benefits and independence endowed by our not-for-profit status to consider and meet the genuine needs\n of the UK health consumer.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccessibility to our services matters deeply. Our Trustees review this regularly and report annually.\n \n13% of our revenue comes from products and services that are less than £1 per day, and approximately 20% of our revenues are p\nrovided from services that are free at the point of delivery – predominately from NHS contracts. We also offer free hea\nlthcare education to the public\n and \nhold over 650 events \nannually.\n&#xa0;\nEmpowering our ability to help 4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Health never stops trying to\n better our provision of care and to develop the vision that delivers it.\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe identified people’s health and wellbeing needs and then applied evidence-based propositions to create ‘joined-up’ healthcare:\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2005: \nSona\n Positive Health acquired. Combined with Nu\nffield Hospital’s physiotherapy and health assessment services to create the UK’s first employee wellbeing business – Nuffield Proactive Health.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2007: Cannons Health &amp; Fitness acquired. Combined with Nuffield’s clinical expertise to offer personal wellbein\ng services to the individual.\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2008: Nuffield Hospitals, Nuffield Proactive Health and Cannons united as Nuffield Health, providing ‘joined-up’ healthcare: integrated fitness, prevention and cure across different services and facilities.\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2010: \nBladerunner\n c\norporate fitness acquired. Expands Nuffield Health’s employee wellbeing offer across the UK.\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2012: Greens Health &amp; Fitness acquired. Extends Nuffield Health’s personal wellbeing offer across the UK.\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe continue to expand our investment \nprogramme\n, membershi\np levels, access and revenues.\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£246m has been reinvested into infrastructure, staff, services, support and facilities over the last five years. In a challen\nging debt market, we secured £27\n0m \nin loans \nto support the on-going implementation of our innovative\n strategy.\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGroup turnover grew from £552m in 2010, to\n \n£645m in 2012, with cash generation (EBITDA) increased by 21%.\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012 alone: Group turnover increased 12% and £69m was invested in improving and expanding our services.\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2012: Almost 500,000 hospital \npatients; 191,000 consumer fitness and wellbeing centre members; 104,000 employee wellbeing members in 1,600 companies.\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n25 million customer journeys annually.\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRevenues from Wellbeing services grew from £147m in 2009, to £194m in 2012, and now represent 30%\n of the charity’s revenues.\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Nuffield Health Bond, launched May 2013, is a five-year fixed-term product, offering a fixed annual return of 6% (gross) in cash, for investments of £1,000 - £250,000. Our initial aim, to raise £15m, was reached early due to a phenomenal response that \nresulted in the Bond being over-subscribed - a gratifying endorsement of the Nuffield Health proposition in a depressed bond market. Ultimately the Bond raised £18m to help us make a real difference to the future of healthcare. \n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Health has the bes\nt balance sheet in the private health sector (compared to gym or private hospital operators). We are the least leveraged businesses in the industry and our debt represents less than 25% of our overall value. Alexander Harrison, Director Strategic Debt Fina\nnce, Barclays Commercial Bank, 2008: “Nuffield Health has a very strong balance sheet with a low ratio of debt relative to the sector, further reinforcing their market position.”\n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n13% of revenue comes from products and services that cost less than £1 a day.\n&#xa0;\nHospitals and medical centres21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResponse through innovation is key to our culture. We identify the needs of our patients and consumers, \nanalyse\n healthcare trends, and then act on them. We are defined by dynamism.\n \n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur strong, consistent leadership, married\n to meticulous medical and nursing procedures, and the outstanding quality of our staff, helps us to achieve industry-leading standards.\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a charity we also have a valuable role to play within the hospital sector as a guardian of reasonable pricing. Effec\ntively, we act as a safeguard on for–profit hospital groups, whose need to satisfy shareholders can cause an escalation in costs to the health consumer.\n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK’s largest network of well-invested, not-for-profit independent hospitals and operating theatres. \n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo thirds of Britain within an hour’s drive of our facilities.\n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n31 hospitals, 1,333 beds and 118 operating theatres.\n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n50,000+ \northopaedic\n procedures.\n28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n31,000+ general surgical procedures.\n29.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n16,000+ ophthalmic procedures.\n30.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n36,000+ MRI scans.\n31.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNHSLA 3 accreditatio\nn: unique in independent sector.\n32.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n1,500+ different kinds of treatment.\n33.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlmost 500,000 patients every year.\n34.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlmost 100,000 NHS patients free, at the point of delivery.\n35.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity engagement and partnership health \nprogrammes\n run throughout our hospitals, and f\nitness and wellbeing \ncentres\n.\n36.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe only private hospital group to publish full clinical governance data, with demonstrable outcomes. Patient satisfaction levels over 99% and we have an impressive record of infection-free hospital facilities. \n37.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2009: ‘Recover\ny Plus’ launched to help surgery patients transition to an integrated physiotherapy and fitness-related rehabilitation \nprogramme\n in our wellbeing \ncentres\n, thus improving post-operative outcomes by ‘joining-up’ health and wellbeing.\n38.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£35m invested to create \na national network of facilities, via the Hospitals’ division, offering industry-leading instrument \nsterilisation\n and decontamination services. All six facilities have gained accreditation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\n to the standards required to be compliant with the European Medical Devices Directive (EC93/42) and to achieve ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 9001:2000 compliance. Each has ‘defect rates’ at about half of the accepted national average.\n39.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst provider to offer fre\ne removal and replacement of PIP implants, and establish industry-leading best practice to ensure the safety and best interests of patients.\n40.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnique \nprogramme\n of matron-led care to empower matrons as leaders and decision-makers.\n41.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2009: First independent sect\nor hospital provider to roll out Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) across all hospitals. \n42.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe only independent sector \norganisation\n to compile and publish an Integrated Governance Report (IGR), which stretches from ‘board to ward’. \n43.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupported \ndevelopment of the Exeter Hip, 1970s. Pioneered hip resurfacing in Birmingham, 1990s. 2006: first ever \nautologous\n elbow tissue transplant performed at the \nGerrards\n Cross Nuffield Hospital.\n44.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nZero cases of MRSA \nbacteraemia\n since May 2011.\n&#xa0;Fitness and wellbeing45.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are proud to have been a catalyst in the wellbeing revolution that \nemphasises\n prevention as much as cure. We have acted on this insight and now inform, inspire and enable people to choose lifestyles that are better for their health and wellbeing. Thi\ns is particularly vital in the workplace where so many days are spent. Our workplace employee fitness and wellbeing \ncentres\n allow people to step directly from work into health.\n46.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPreventative healthcare is central to the viability of the UK’s future. It cont\nributes to containing sector costs, improves productivity and helps people to take control of their health. Our commitment to this concept is \nrealised\n through our investment in fitness and wellbeing \ncentres\n, nutritional therapists, health mentors and physi\notherapists, as well as in leading-edge digital innovations such as our \nHealthScore\n™ app. \n47.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the past decade we have acquired four major corporate and fitness chains. We transformed and united them under Nuffield Health to create a unique network of pre\nventative care for the country. This is our vision made tangible to the people we are here to help.\n&#xa0;\nEmployee fitness and wellbeing48.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK market-leader for provision of wellbeing services to employees. \n49.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe provide award-winning wellbeing services to 1,600+ bu\nsinesses, benefitting 104,000 employee members.\n50.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPhysiotherapy offered to our corporate partners in 600+ locations. \n51.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe power the productivity of UK businesses through their people, supporting half the FTSE100 and 40% of the FTSE250 in health and wellbeing.\n52.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe establish new standards of health assessment. In addition to traditional areas, we screen for muscular-skeletal problems derived from poor posture in the work environment and anti-oxidant levels that help prevent health risks such as cancer. \n53.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe innova\nte in evolving ways of caring that best serve our customers, taking the unprecedented step of creating two entirely new kinds of practitioner - the wellbeing physiologist, and the wellbeing advisor - uniquely trained and developed by Nuffield Health. All N\nuffield physiologists are part of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH).\n54.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEurope’s largest health-screen provider: 150,000+.\n55.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n100 Meet Our Experts’ events.\n56.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst charity to develop and implement a \ncentralised\n health screening system, the \nViSystem\n, \nenabling automated aggregate reporting of health data to be monitored and acted on appropriately, with the integrated services and governance to support it.\n&#xa0;\nPersonal fitness and wellbeing57.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur proposition is unique. Everyone who joins our fitness and well\nbeing \ncentres\n receives a clinically-governed Health MOT covering 12 risk areas. This translates into an easily understandable health score, indicating personal levels of health, enabling beneficiaries to address any issues thus taking control of their heal\nth future: the essence of preventative healthcare. Helping people to help themselves is central to meeting the myriad challenges, such as the obesity epidemic, that the UK’s healthcare sector currently faces. We strive to lead that agenda.\n58.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe only consume\nr fitness and wellbeing service in the UK: 65 sites.\n59.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe only national chain of independent physiotherapists in the UK: 130 \ncentres\n and 2,000 physiotherapists.\n60.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe invented the Health MOT as an integrated aspect of fitness and wellbeing \nprogrammes\n.\n61.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n100,000+\n Health MOTs, delivered 2012. \n62.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur research reveals that more than 75% of our members, who have a Health MOT, achieve a measurable improvement in their health. 54% reduced their cholesterol; 57% improved their blood pressure; 35% lost more than 3% of their\n body weight.\n63.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVi4 health assessments recorded a 17% decrease in obesity, blood pressure and cholesterol. \n64.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch from our assessments revealed:\n9%+ of clients had recorded abnormal cardiovascular investigations, including significantly narrowed arteries,\n irregular heart patterns or other abnormalities.\n6%+ of female clients had abnormal mammograms requiring further investigation (10% of these cases were classified as urgent).\n3%+ had abnormal prostate-specific antigen tests and over 5% had abnormal cervic\nal smears.\n65.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield \nHealthScore\n™, built on approximately 70 million man-years of available clinical data, is our exclusive, unique online tool and smart phone app. It helps people live healthier and more active lifestyles through bespoke, personal health a\nnd wellness information. 17,000+ users.\n66.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n650 Meet Our Experts sessions provided.\n&#xa0;A decade of raising the bar67.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Health is \nrecognised\n as living its commitment to excellence. Since 2003 we have won\n \nmore major awards than any other comparable competitor\n, spanning every area relating to healthcare. During the same period we have gained numerous professional accreditations as benchmarks of the highest levels of care.\n&#xa0;Remuneration68.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Health has a Remuneration Committee, comprising trustees of the cha\nrity, which takes independent advice from external advisors. It ensures that senior executives and other employees receive the necessary development and leadership opportunities, and are appropriately motivated and rewarded for their individual and collect\nive contributions to the \norganisation’s\n overall performance. \n69.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith respect to executive remuneration, the Committee has delegated authority from Nuffield Health’s Board of Governors to determine the remuneration package for all senior executives including \nthe Chief Executive.\n70.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Health remuneration package: total compensation, including pension contributions, bonuses and other benefits, is positioned at 75% of the market median (median rate, discounted by 25%) for the reference market. [E.G. if there\n are 11 companies in the comparative market group for a role, and the total compensation level for each company is ranked from lowest to highest, the median level is that of the company positioned in the middle at 6th place. We benchmark at this point and \nthen apply a further 25% discount to determine the level of remuneration].\n71.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrent reference market is a selection of companies based on comparable \norganisational\n size and complexity. \n72.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommittee informed of total compensation levels in private and public h\nealthcare \norganisations\n, and leading charities of a comparable size, to gauge relative positioning of executive packages. \n73.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur trustees conduct an independent annual review of executive remuneration and view the salaries of our executives as being at the a\nppropriate level to attract and retain the talent required to sustain the success of the charity. \n74.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe that a charity should be transparent so all of our pay levels are published in our Annual Report and Accounts.\n&#xa0;Leadership75.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe leadership culture \nestablished by David \nMobbs\n, since becoming Group Chief Executive of Nuffield Hospitals in 2003, has sustained the transformation of our charitable mission in all aspects of our operations. Nuffield Health is the result: a dynamic, innovative, responsive ch\narity, delivering ‘joined-up’ healthcare across society to offer choice and excellence. \n76.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn his watch, we have developed the financial strength to enable Nuffield Health to use its not-for-profit status to consider and deliver the long-term needs of the UK\n health consumer. Our ability to innovate in response to the needs of today and the requirements of tomorrow, across numerous fronts, has helped the UK’s healthcare industry to evolve.\n77.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDavid \nMobbs\n’ catalytic role in our success has been \nrecognised\n by his p\neers and health commentators. In 2010 he was awarded the highest accolade for outstanding individual contribution to the industry at the annual Health Investor awards. He has been personally ranked within the top ten in the ‘Health Investor Power 50’ since\n its inception.\n&#xa0;Conclusion 78.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Health’s charitable mission is to \nmaximise\n our positive impact on healthcare and wellbeing in the twenty first century. To service this vision necessitates a leadership team that is committed to the premise of being a unique charity, operating wit\nhin this sector, and which has the experience, strategic awareness and competence to implement and deliver every aspect of ‘joined-up’ healthcare. \n79.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Health’s ability to make a meaningful difference to countless people, from all walks of life, has b\neen greatly enhanced and expanded over the past decade. Our mission continues.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
