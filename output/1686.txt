[[[ Committee, University of Nottingham (WSC040)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Introduction  This submission is on behalf of the University of Nottingham's WinSET Committee, established in 2005 as a sub-committee of The University Research Board, to represent the concerns of and to monitor the career progression of women in science, engineering, technology, mathematics and medicine based Faculties (STEMM) within the University of Nottingham. WinSET's aims are to:

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The very questions that the Science and Technology Commission have framed for this enquiry imply that the evidence base supporting the premise that the leaky pipeline is wasting talent at every stage is accepted, and so the details of this evidence base will not be revisited in this submission. The WinSet Committee hopes to draw the attention of the Inquiry to points which are particularly relevant to it as a body sited within a University which aims to demonstrate good practice in regard to staff and students within the STEMM disciplines.&#xa0;Question 1: Why do numbers of women in STEMM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? &#xa0;Whilst the institution of the  University of Nottingham (UoN) has put in place a number of actions and policies in order to work for gender proportionality within STEMM and has seen some significant improvements in this area , as recognised  by the 2012  award of an Athena SWAN Silver (making it one of only three Universities to be recognised in this way), the broad sweep view of the statistics relating specifically to the UoN do not run strongly counter to the national picture.&#xa0;However without referring to the minutiae of any data set we do feel that it is important to differentiate between the STEMM subjects as the evidence base shows that whilst it is universally true that the numbers of women in STEMM academic careers decline further up the career ladder, the points in the pipeline which are critical for women’s proportionality do vary from subject to subject implying that a strong evidence based organisational  framework, with a high degree of differentiation, should be maintained in order to allow these precise points to be identified (and addressed)  in each discipline.  For example in psychology the pipeline leakage is most acute when gong from senior lecturer to professor and until this career point there is a very good representation of women, whereas in the chemical sciences there is a steady decline in gender proportionality from undergraduate to professorial level, with a slight increase in the rate of leakage at the point of going from PhD students to post-doctoral researchers (1). There is also evidence that women in senior university management positions tend to be primarily recruited from discrete areas of STEMM (or non-STEMM areas) where a long fixed hours/laboratory culture is less predominant, again emphasising  the need to drill down into data to look at where the critical points on the career ladder occur in each discipline.&#xa0;&#xa0;Given the above there are still a number of general points that can be made, however in view of the relatively small impact that many years of initiatives have demonstrated and the glacial time scale in relation to the advancement of women in STEMM academic careers it is clear that there can be no simple answer to this question. Key obstructions in the academic “pipeline” which are well documented and some of which are more likely to affect women include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;And finally, and new to the debate,&#xa0;&#xa0;Whilst there have been a number of initiatives around the majority of points listed above given the lack of impact demonstrated we focus in our submission on the impact of unconscious bias and the potential impact of the changes in U.K. retirement legislation. &#xa0;Given the number of initiatives in the area of retaining and advancing women in STEMM academic careers and the fact that most men and women in academia explicitly, and sincerely, profess to hold egalitarian beliefs the effect of unconscious bias on limiting our ability to achieve the desired goals cannot be understated.  Recent research in this area has underlined the fact that non-conscious hypotheses about sex differences play a central role in shaping men and women’s professional lives and that these hypotheses are held by both male and female STEMM practitioners. These hypotheses affect &#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Expectations of men and women•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evaluation of their work•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evaluation of their performance&#xa0;The effect of unconscious bias can be addressed but in order to ensure accurate evaluations, we need not only institutional policies but also increasing numbers in candidate pools, challenging of hypotheses, and accountability.   Direct training events showing exemplars have been shown to be effective in promoting discussion as to unconscious bias and its effect on evaluation outcomes.The effect of unconscious bias may be exacerbated in the near future by the effect of changes in U.K. retirement legislation.  If one accepts the evidence base that shows that the men have a disproportionally strong representation in both senior positions within STEMM academics departments and senior university roles then it follows that we are approaching an era where the turnover of individuals in senior positions may be slowed for some time, thus not facilitating more (currently) junior women to move into these roles. &#xa0;Given the current demographics that are in place this position will not be easily overturned without the implementation of deliberate government policy/interventions.&#xa0;Question 2: When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?&#xa0;We not in a position to answer this question and in fact believe that even at a national level there is no effective tracking of such movement within any sector of the labour force.  Exit interviews are not routinely taken up by leavers even in circumstances where they are offered and as a result HR departments are limited as to the longitudinal data that they can acquire. However it must be assumed that when highly trained women leave academia there is an important loss of human capital from the sector.&#xa0;In some instances women may transition to an industrial science career but as the data shows that there is also a leaky pipeline within that sector it must be assumed that in many cases the transition is made into careers which their transferable skills may be put to good use but where the majority of the high level research and technical skills that they have acquired are not utilised.  &#xa0;RCUK should provide the statistical data on leavers from the post-doctoral positions that they fund as this information is required for completion of a final grant report.&#xa0;Question 3: What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?

[[[&#xa0;]]]Whilst there is a continuing need to provision a strong evidence based organisational framework, with a high degree of differentiation and to drill down into data to look at where the critical points on the career ladder occur in each STEMM area, in many areas of STEMM this evidence framework exists up to the present time and this analysis has been carried out in some detail over the last decade by the professional bodies associated with the disciplines. This has allowed for some macro analysis and presented the opportunity for policy makers/educational practitioners/practitioner activists to learn from the initiatives implemented. &#xa0;However given that there have been ~3 decades of UK initiatives on and projects designed to recruit and retain girls and women into STEMM fields and to facilitate their progress, with relatively little impact, it is important that we now think critically about the range of frameworks and practices and evaluate why such little progress has actually been made.&#xa0;

[[[Solutions/Good ]]]

[[[Practice]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;There is an easy list to [produce which each university should address. It is essential to address these if women in all STEMM areas are to perceive that there is an effective future for them within academia.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Examples of Good Practice]]]&#xa0;Anne McLaren Fellowships&#xa0;One example of good practice within the UoN   that attempts to address these issues, albeit for a relatively small cohort of staff, is the 'The University of Nottingham Anne McLaren Fellowships' program. This is targeted at exceptional female scientists and engineers who seek to establish a research career in the UK. The Fellowships provide a recognised first step into an independent research career and are  funded by the UoNs Research Board.&#xa0;Each fellowship offers:&#xa0;&#xa0;Over the last ten years, the Anne McLaren Fellowships for female researchers in STEMM subjects have attracted outstanding early career researchers across a range of disciplines to the University. To date, the programme has provided ~ 50 early career female researchers a strong basis from which to develop their research careers.  It is key to its effectiveness that all components of this fellowship are in place.&#xa0;In addition to the establishment of the WinSET committee we also highlight three other examples of good practice undertaken at UoN. &#xa0;&#xa0;APPLE is an award-winning positive action programme to help women at junior and senior lecturer level to achieve their career goals and potential offered by Professional Development, UoN. Analysis of UoN promotions and appraisal data highlights that the programme has supported enhancements to job performance. Feedback from women who have attended the APPLE programme shows that many women feel more confident in taking on more responsibility or a new role. Many previous delegates say that a significant benefit of the programme has been to expand their network of people within the University and this has allowed them to work more effectively (for example, in collaborating and winning research funding).&#xa0;&#xa0;WAND provides a progression from the APPLE programme. It is available to those in in academic role at the University, at a senior lecturer level and early in the professorial career. Participants are enabled to: &#xa0;Identify / clarify their career goals  Identify their strengths and development opportunities  Develop strategies and enhance skills / knowledge to support their career choice(s)  Receive one-to-one career support / advice from a mentor  Extend their personal networks and build coalitions with colleagues&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Women’s Network provides an informal forum for debate and raising awareness, ensuring that women are not unfairly disadvantaged in order to promote diversity and equal opportunities both within and outside the institution. The Network acts as a mechanism for communication with the University including raising issues of University practice and procedure. &#xa0;These initiatives are not restricted to the STEMM disciplines. &#xa0;Athena SWAN and JUNOAt a national level the Athena SWAN scheme and schemes such as the JUNO project of the Institute of Physics are examples of good practice where recognition is made of HE institutions that have put in place a number of actions and policies in order to work for gender proportionality within STEMM.  There has been considerably ‘buy in’ by the HE community for these schemes and their importance has been underlined by the support given to them by such preeminent individuals as the Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies. Her statement that any NHS/University partnerships applying for NIHR funding in 2015 where the academic partner has not achieved at least the Silver Award of the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science should not expect to be shortlisted, was a clear signpost of the commitment that all funding bodies should be expected to demonstrate to promoting gender proportionality in STEMM.    

[[[We wish to emphasise the impact that adoption of the Athena SWAN charter has had in HE institutions, and to recogn]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Question 4: What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEMM careers? &#xa0;The need for holistic cultural change in STEMM higher education, covering both staff and students, will mean that issues will have to be addressed at a number of different levels but importantly by partnerships between educators and Government. In addition there are issues that can only be initiated and tackled by government via funding bodies and via legislation. &#xa0;The Research Excellence Framework (REF).&#xa0;The REF&#xa0;Equality and Diversity Advisory Panel (EDAP) provides advice to the funding bodies, the REF team and the REF panels on the implementation of equality measures, reviewing institutions' codes of practice on the selection of staff and producing a report of good practice found in the codes. Over the course of the REF period this has resulted in some changes in the criteria and implementation of equality measures.  There is however a widespread feeling within the community that these measures were only brought in after considerable voicing of disquiet from bodies and individuals concerned to promote gender proportionality within academia and that outside certain universities there remains a large degree of second guessing as to what the rules mean and the level to which individuals can be hidden in order to maximize financial benefit.  &#xa0;Grant Evaluations (Research Councils UK).&#xa0;If we follow on from the findings of the REF EDAP on implementation of equality measures when assessing research excellence it is important that in the allocation of funding for research a similar implementation of equality measures takes place.  It is also strongly suggested that RCUK are required to publish gender disaggregated data on submissions and success rates.&#xa0;The Supply Side.&#xa0;One important component of addressing the retention of women in STEMM is on the supply side.  Research has shown that for any component of a labour force that can be identified by a specific characteristic the presence within a unit needs to rise to &gt; 20% before the evaluation of their contribution becomes automatically fair and reasonable.  In some STEMM disciplines the undergraduate intake to the discipline is dangerously close to that figure, and in many instances it declines very quickly to a far smaller percentage.  Therefore there is the issue of the STEMM pipeline in schools which requires Government initiatives and funding.&#xa0;
