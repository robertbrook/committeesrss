[[[The Association of Local Bus Company Managers (ALBUM)]]]&#xa0;ALBUM represents the 'non‐aligned' sector of the bus industry. The Association has 150 members, representing over 50 companies in the independent, state‐owned and municipal sectors, who between them operate almost 5,000 buses, which is about one bus in twelve nationally. This makes ALBUM members collectively Britain's fourth largest bus operator ‐ in the same league as the big five multi‐national groups. Stagecoach runs 8,000 buses in the UK, First Group 6,500, Arriva 5,800, ALBUM members 4,800, Go Ahead 4,600 and National Express 1,600.&#xa0;We now submit our response to the Transport Committee's questions.

[[[How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?]]]2.1              Rural and island communities are widely recognised by Government and local authorities as being isolated and in need of special treatment. However, there is less appreciation of the differences in need according to the degree of rurality, size and location of the communities.  These range from remote, deep rural settlements (often difficult to serve cost-effectively beyond statutory minima) to villages of varying sizes and market towns.  A settlement's location may be as important as its size; distance from the nearest large town; type of terrain and quality of road access; and whether or not it is on a main interurban road (which may enable a small settlement to be served by passing trunk bus routes).2.2              There is much less recognition of problems of isolation in urban communities, where peripheral housing is often built with scant regard for public transport access; at densities too low to warrant frequent buses (or any service at all in the evenings and on Sundays); and inconveniently sited in relation to jobs and services - except for travel by car.  Current and proposed relaxations in planning controls may worsen the situation in both urban and rural areas.2.3              Demand is specifically identified for some groups in the population, such as through the statutory provision of travel concessions for school transport and elderly etc. people. However, although there is a right to a concession, such as free bus travel, there is no statutory guarantee beyond educational provision of a service on which to use it. Service levels where they cannot be provided commercially are subject to local authority discretion, which is subject to budgetary constraints and influenced by the level of central government funding. There are no standard, national service level criteria, each local authority determining its own, which may relate to settlement size, access to facilities, or mainly be determined by the availability of finance.2.4              People living in isolated areas may not be well represented and have difficulty in making their needs known.  In many rural areas the traditional, often elderly, bus-using population has been replaced by younger 'commuters' who primarily use cars. The cost per person of providing bus services then increases, but the service retains its importance to those who use it. Indeed as the availability of shops and other services in rural areas declines the need for transport links increases for those who do not have alternatives. The withdrawal by Royal Mail of the Post Bus network a few years ago removed a valuable low cost alternative way of providing scheduled bus services, particularly in deep rural areas.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[public transport to isolated communities?]]]3.1              The majority of buses now have step-free access, aiding their use by disabled and infirm people, as well as those with shopping, luggage or infants in pushchairs. But some roads, especially in deep rural or hilly areas, are inaccessible to such buses, due to their width, curvature or sudden changes in gradients. The problem of parked cars, which hamper, or may even preclude, bus operation, is very marked in urban housing estates and rural villages.  So too is the growing problem of larger private vehicles (4x4s) on rural roads coupled with lower floor buses, which makes passing increasingly difficult or impossible.  Even if accessible buses can reach rural/isolated communities, those with mobility problems need to be able to get on and off the buses. There is often insufficient highway width for a kerb and hard standing to be provided to permit level entry onto a bus.3.2              The use  of public transport for elderly people is encouraged by the availability of statutory free concessions on buses and services are most likely to run during the daytime, when such people most commonly travel; but the tightening of rates of re-imbursement to bus operators for revenue foregone is causing reductions in services. This is expected to be a growing problem.3.3              Young people have traditionally not been  considered as a 'deserving' category. Apart from educational journeys, their travel patterns are poorly understood - but are thought to be diverse in time and spatial spread and largely leisure-related. With the rise in school leaving age there is an increasing demand for transport to school for older students.  Many bus companies charge full adult fare for what is peak travel and increased numbers travelling can mean that a larger vehicle has to be operated at a higher cost. Where local authorities do offer schemes of reduced price travel these tend to be for younger scholars up to the age of 16, the rates for which are under pressure to be reduced.  There is, though, a growing tendency for bus operators to offer price concessions on a commercial basis to young people, even if they are not in education, although the non-availability of evening buses often constrains their travel opportunities.

[[[What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?]]]4.1              The populations of isolated rural communities are generally much too low to justify a bus service without subsidy, the availability of which is declining due to constrained government and local authority spending.  Diverting bus routes off direct  town-to-town or radial roads is not always feasible; and the resultant longer travel times between larger settlements may cause a net reduction in patronage.4.2              Where isolated rural communities or housing developments are on, or close to, roads linking larger urban settlements,  they tend to enjoy a more frequent / consistent bus service than demand from the settlements would naturally warrant.&#xa0; &#xa0;Inter-urban route frequencies have grown over the past decade or so, and where this occurs access to public transport has improved (if not in the evening).&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0; Some success has been achieved by concentrating principal, high quality bus services on direct routes, with feeder services between isolated communities and designated interchanges. The key  is to link isolated communities that are away from main roads to those roads, although demand for local feeders has sometimes been disappointing, due to the small populations catered for and to the extended travel times of interchange journeys compared to direct routes. 4.3              For isolated urban and suburban communities, improving access to bus routes may be achievable by creating more and better / safer footways, more pedestrian crossings, improved signage to and from bus stops and new 'short cuts' to enable people to reach bus routes. If walking distances are short, providing access to frequent bus services along roads skirting housing estates may be preferable to attempting to run infrequent and tortuous services through each estate. In some locations, it may be possible to link two or more housing areas by creating short sections of bus-only road, so a single route can serve an extended population.4.4              Bus - rail links are often said to be a viable option.  For these to be effective, both bus and train services must be fully reliable, to avoid the dis-benefits of either missed connections,  unacceptably long timetabled interchange times, or disrupting operations network-wide if trains or buses are obliged to wait for late-running connections. In Norfolk, the success of the Coasthopper bus linking hourly with an hourly train service has been encouraged by bus publicity appearing as standard on the train timetable leaflets and by through ticketing.&#xa0;&#xa0; This works well with incoming tourist visitors but there is much greater difficulty generating demand the other way around as it is not possible to issue a through ticket on the bus.4.5              For the longer term, planning regulations must ensure that public transport access requirements are anticipated when locating and designing new communities. Houses must be built where they can be served efficiently and effectively by public transport, with consent linked to Town &amp; Country Planning Act 1990 'Section 106' developer contributions towards the cost of bus or rail access wherever necessary / possible. Unfortunately many planning authorities often do not include public transport in their requirements for S.106 agreements, which can often be subject to the whims of local politicians who have other priorities.

[[[How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?]]]5.1              Community transport is provided by a mix of professional and voluntary organisations. Its principal disadvantage is that it is usually run  for or most suited to use by a particular client group: educational, health, social service, sport, youth, elderly, disabled, etc.  Services are generally only known to members of the specific local community or group.  They are seldom if ever marketed to or suit the needs of visitors, whether friends and relatives visiting local residents, or tourists - a category of user of particular importance in some rural areas. Demand may be too low to justify regular or frequent services, timetables thus commonly being either very sparse, or planned on a demand-responsive basis. Where demand responsive services are run, much of the sought-after economy of running small, community-based buses is lost in the expense of running the call centre and booking places on services.5.2              Community transport as described above may be best considered as a mode of last resort; but it may also be possible to improve links between scheduled local buses and the communities they serve.  Options for applying the successful concept of Community Rail Partnerships (see Association of Community Rail Partnerships website www.Acorp.uk.com) to local bus services should be considered.5.3              Isolated suburban and urban communities are generally less well served by community transport, partly as in suburban housing estates there may be less cohesive community spirit than in rural villages.  Community transport here is thus generally limited to essential provision such as that for health and social services. 5.4              A crucial point is that there is no statutory concessionary fare scheme on community transport.&#xa0; Thus where peripheral parts of local bus services have been withdrawn and replaced by community transport acting as quasi bus services, this proves a stumbling block to their successful integration into the wider network.5.5              One of the problems with community transport is that it relies on volunteers. There is an increasing call for help throughout the 'voluntary sector', whilst the pool of available people seems to be reducing, as a result of which it is difficult to offer a regular, reliable and enduring service.  Instances in Kent, which may not be unique, are of two small communities that wanted a community bus service to replace a post bus service, but had no one willing or able to volunteer as a driver;  and a proposed scheme that had an available vehicle, but no one prepared to drive a service in the rural area wanting the service.&#xa0;

[[[To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[and other demand-responsive transport services?]]]6.1              Taxi buses were legalised under the Transport Act 1985, but take-up has been minimal, the taxi continuing to be seen by both the taxi trade and by users an essentially an 'individual' mode, or for groups of people travelling together; but not for sharing with 'strangers'. 6.2              Taxis and private hire vehicles (phv) can fulfil a need for isolated communities, and fares for groups of several fare-paying passengers travelling together are often competitive with bus fares.  Taxis sometimes meet a one-way demand, especially where buses are infrequent or inconvenient, e.g. to bring people back from a shopping trip to which they have taken the bus.6.3              Rural bus service supply is often influenced by the provision of statutory home-to-school transport, with services between school peaks provided by the same vehicles. The level of demand at peak times is often greater than could be met by a taxi, which makes their use for non-educational journeys a less viable proposition. In any case, at school times there is often a shortage of accessible taxis because they are almost all already undertaking school contract work. Conversely, in the off peak there are taxis waiting for passengers.&#xa0;6.4              In some, typically urban, 'isolated' communities taxis and  phv s fulfil a social / cultural role, for example for ethnic minority women  who prefer to travel in vehicles driven by members of their own communities.6.5              In areas with very small populations it will not be economically possible to offer more than a limited bus service.  Opportunities for co-ordination between bus services and taxis should be explored, such as perhaps taxis providing evening services or additional departures on infrequent routes at 'bus' fares. Lack of finance may preclude this from becoming a common option though.&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[communities? How can these services be made more affordable?]]]7.1              The main obstacle is that low levels of population, diverse travel times and dispersed destinations mean that cost recovery from any public transport service will be very low and a high per-passenger subsidy will be required. Providing any but the most minimal of services, sometimes limited to statutory minima such as school transport, will often fail to meet government or local authority funding criteria. There is therefore an important role for the planning system, to ensure that new development takes place where and in a manner in which it can best be served by public transport.&#xa0;7.2              Every opportunity must be taken to co-ordinate the supply of transport for different client groups (see 5.1). This will involve organisations being prepared to work together in ways they are not used to and a willingness to compromise, for example on school and college attendance times, health appointment times, etc. Some 'exclusivity' of provision may have to be foregone, for example in transporting elderly and younger people or those with differing medical needs together. This may not be simple, but wider opportunities could be sought and might combine achieving offering better services with making worthwhile economies.&#xa0;7.3              Enhanced information about bus services generally, and to isolated communities in particular, generates demand. Many bus companies, authorities and the Government (e.g. through Transport Direct) have made great improvements in the marketing of bus services and making timetable and fares information available.  More needs to be done, not only by professionals, but perhaps also by communities themselves, as discussed above in paragraph 5.2.&#xa0;7.4              For a bus service to be provided to a local isolated community it has to meet the same regulatory conditions as busiest city bus routes.&#xa0;&#xa0; If the service is run by community transport, practically none of those regulations apply, yet the local bus in isolated rural communities is trying to do what CT does but do it better and more inclusively, in that it is open and available to all. Examination of opportunities shows that to run a 30 seat low floor vehicle for a day's work costs about £110k a year.  To run a 16 seater bus as a PCV costs about £75k and to run a 14 seat bus as a CT operation about £50k.&#xa0; The difference between the last two is the cost of regulation.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is an urgent need for a lower level of regulation for small feeder PCV vehicles, their role in that form being certified by the local transport authority so that their minimal use is not abused, and maybe a maximum annual mileage to be specified, to enable some of the excessive regulatory control to be released.&#xa0;&#xa0; ALBUM members have raised this issue with the Minister and officials among whom there is some understanding and nascent sympathy for the idea.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
