defaultI am very happy to respond all be it briefly (because of the timescale) to the request for evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultCan I say how pleased I am that the select committee are addressing this critical issue that has so often been sidelined.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt was a great pity that 
defaultthe first Millennium Development Goals did not explicitly recognise the enormous and additional challenge faced by those with disabilities in the developing world.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe simple points that I wish to make are that where disadvantage exists (because of pover
defaultty, gender, ill health and geographic circumstance), the situation for those with disability is materially and significantly worse. That is why in addressing issues relating to the provision of education for children (and transport to and access into the s
defaultervice) children with disabilities need substantial additional help as well as investment in cultural change and work with families.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is why the facilitation of new technology is so critical in such circumstances as a liberator for youngsters with disa
defaultbility.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is why with relation to the transition from whatever level of schooling has been made available, work needs to be intensive with youngsters if they are to have any chance of earning a living, becoming independent and providing them with the ki
defaultnd of dignity and self determination which others take for granted.
default&#xa0;
defaultLinking investment in health and immunisation programmes with positive action in not only preventing but urgent remedial action in relation to disability is also critical.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor many dis
defaultabled children (I found this in relation to blindness when visiting East Africa with Sight Servers International) it was evident that with the right measures, disability could either have been prevented or in some circumstances cured.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis was not simply
default a matter of medical intervention or surgery but also the social measures that needed to go with it to ensure that regular immunisation (and follow up drug provision) was accessed. The work with children in and out of school and families was coordinated ac
defaultross agencies and, those working on such programmes, actually had some 
defaultidea as to what they were doing. My experience was that with all the best intentions in the world, there were a large number of people who were intermediaries, who had no experience wha
defaulttsoever and had never been trained in dealing with disability issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am pleased that internationally, there is now mention of disability in the revised programmes but turning good intentions and the right words into action will take something more tha
defaultn gestures.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need practical measures for training, for added value interventions, for follow up and above 
defaultall 
defaultfor coordination between programmes.
default&#xa0;
defaultEmbedding action to prevent and to support those with disability into programmes will take time. Above 
defaultall, it will take strong and determined will to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultIs that will evident?
