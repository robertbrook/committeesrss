"&#xa0;\nAFS0098Written evidence submitted by Mr. and Mrs. C. Jones&#xa0;\nConcerns arising from our observations of the setting up of Route 39 Academy in \nNorth Devon\n:\n&#xa0;\n\"Evidence of demand\" is required, but it seems that the evidence submitted to the DoE and the EFA by a prospective \nFree\n \nSchool\n is accepted at face value. No attempt is made to scrutinise how the evidence is obtained.\n(in the case of R39, evidence of demand was apparently obtained at open days held at a local theme park and via a website survey managed by R39 themselves)&#xa0;\nThe governors of a prospective \nFree\n \nSchool\n are expected to undertak\ne a programme of consultation with the local community, but there appears to be no attempt made by the DoE to ensure that this is not just a box-ticking exercise. Again, results of these consultations appear to be accepted at face-value - there is no forma\nl opportunity for local opposition groups to voice their concerns.\n(in the case of R39, all attempts by a local opposition group to engage with the governors and discuss important issues were declined, including one occasion when R39 cancelled a presentation they were due to give to a parish council meeting when an opposition group was also granted permission to make a presentation)&#xa0;\nIt would appear that the EFA can approve funding for a \nFree\n \nSchool\n even b\nefore planning permission is granted for the school to be built. This leads to the suspicion that the DoE would intervene if permission is refused by local planning committees.\n(in the case of R39, funding has been approved in spite of the fact that planning permission for a temporary site was refused - the planning application for the permanent site has still not been submitted)&#xa0;\nThe EFA is happy to fund Free Schools in areas where there is n\no shortage of school places.\n(in the case of R39, the governors maintain that competition is good and will raise standards across all schools, and yet they have struggled to fill their places and the 4 existing state secondary schools in the area have all lost a few pupils) &#xa0;\nOur concern about the \nacademies\n programme \nis that\n it is possible for\n funding for a free school \nto\n be approved with very little evidence of demand for the school, \nwith little or no public consultation and without planning permission first being granted for the proposed site. Furthermore, not enough consideration \nis given to\n \nthe impact on other schools in the area.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
