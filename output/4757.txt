[[[ targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording practices?]]]For 2013-14, I have set five ‘headline’ targets. Two of these (Burglary Dwelling and Violence against the Person) are Crime Reduction Targets. The other three are detection targets (Burglary Dwelling, Rape Offences, and Violence against the Person with Injury). I have also set a number of other key crime reduction targets, such as Rural Crime, Metal Theft and Disrupting Organised Crime Groups. We are still in quarter 3 of the current performance year and it is difficult to say with any precision what the true impact of PCC target setting has had on police recording practices. The current set of ‘headline’ targets for Thames Valley Police has, on the whole, been challenging for the Force. The backdrop to delivering these is set against continuing reductions in budget and resource.  However, the Force has for many years also responded positively to challenging targets set by the previous Police Authority. Thames Valley received a positive assessment from HMIC of its data integrity back in 2011. The cornerstones for this were based upon strong leadership that focused on ethical recording, along with good practices for recording crime consistently and accurately.  I have no reason to believe that the Force has departed from these policies and practices.Whilst we are conscious that some PCC’s have followed the government’s line of introducing a single target for ‘reducing all crime’, this in itself can create a number of perverse outcomes. We have discussed future target setting with our local HMIC and it has been suggested that a limited basket of key targets can be appropriate in addressing areas which require focused performance improvement. &#xa0;

[[[How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?]]]I have attempted to answer this question through our initial evidence submitted to the Committee (via the APCC) in November 2013. This can be viewed at http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidenceHtml/3532 Within Thames Valley, I hold the Chief Constable to account for delivering the Police and Crime Plan and/or for ensuring accountability for the efficient and effective direction and control of the Force. These ‘boundaries’ help reduce my exposure to, and involvement in, the operational ‘micro-detail’ of crime statistics. By focusing on crime statistics at a ‘macro-level’, I have a richer-picture that enables more objective understanding of key performance risks and issues within the Force.&#xa0;&#xa0;My Office regularly monitors timely performance data to identify trends (through the Home Office ‘iQuanta’ Performance Management System) and comparisons are carried out with other forces.  Internal performance reviews from the Force, coupled with external qualitative/quantitative performance information sources, are triangulated to provide an independent perspective.I would like to underline HMIC’s previous assessment of the Force’s data integrity in which good ethical recording and high crime recording standards were acknowledged. I am confident that the Force continues to maintain these standards. However, I do have a concern that fraud, and cyber enabled crime is increasing, and we do not have an accurate measurement of this as it is reported direct to Action Fraud. We have little feedback on the extent of it within Thames Valley, but I believe that, in monetary terms, it is by far the largest crime both within the Thames Valley Police area. I believe this to be the case nationally.&#xa0;&#xa0;20 December 2013
