defaultWritten evidence from defaulta resident of Jersey (Resident A)default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1 
defaultI am a resident of Jersey who is concerned about abuses in our 
defaultLegal and
default Parliamentary system
default as well as the Police
default. 
default.
defaultI understand that my evidence is the property of the Committee 
defaultbut I would respectfully ask that my evidence is not published on the Internet as I am a States worker and fear losing my job if my name is known.  I have discussed this with my poli
defaulttic
defaultal representative.
default&#xa0;
default2
default 
defaultThere are about 300 lawyers in Jersey who have a privileged minority
default status.
default 
default It is from this group that the Bailiff and Law Officers are selected and appointed and
default it seems to me that 
defaultthey still dominate the proceedings of government, the judicia
defaultry
default and the
default 
defaultadministration of so many
default aspects of island life
default.
default T
defaulthey survive apparently 
defaultdespite
default the
default 
defaultrecomm
defaulte
defaultnd
defaultations contained in the Sir Cecil Clothier
default 
defaultand Lord Carswell
default Reports
default.
default              
default3 An example of
default this is a f
defaultormer magistrate designate, jailed for fraud, who despite having not worked since 2008 only resigned in January this year.
default  My understanding is that his salary cannot be reclaimed. 
default&#xa0;
default4
default The 
defaultbehaviour
default of former Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache since 2010 ha
defaults
default highlighted 
defaultproblems in
default the prevailing system
default, by which I mean a concentration of power in few hands
default.
default&#xa0;
default5
default 
defaultE
defaultven whilst serving as Bailiff, Sir Philip was 
defaulta
defaultctive in politic
defaults
default and
default had an agenda
default for an “independent” Jersey
default.  This seems to me to be driven 
defaultby
default elite who wish to avoid accountability for their actions.  If what I read on the local internet Blog sites
default is correct
default, the people do not want it.
default I feel it relevant to mention at this point that these Blogs are increasingly trusted over the Main Stream Media.
default&#xa0;
default6 S
defaultince retiring 
defaultas Bailiff he
default has been elected as a Senator and now sits in the States as a political
default representative 
default“of the people”. 
default His plan for States Reform (removal of Senators and larger constituencies formed the 
defaultmain part of his successful election 
defaultcampaign 
defaultas a Senatorial candidate in 2011.
default&#xa0;
default7
default The recent (24 April) Jersey Referendum, which the politically dominated Electoral
default 
defaultCommission
default which
default he chaired,
default 
defaultattracted a minimal public participation
default of around 26% which does not suggest confidence on the public’s part in the democratic process.  Voter apathy is a problem in Jersey.
default&#xa0;

default 
defaultI
defaultf 
defaultthis

default 
defaultCouncil, will 
defaultb
defaulte for reduced and less democratic representation of the public
default, my concern is that it will make our
default 
defaultsystem of
default 
defaultgovernment 
defaulte
defaultven less compliant with international standards than
default before.
default&#xa0;
default9
default Sir Philip has ambitions to make Jersey independent of the British Crown and to be our Foreign Minister
default. 
defaultThis proposition has not been put to the electorate.
default Any conflict
defaults
default with UK Government
default wi
defaultll, in my view 
defaultbecome more acute as the Island drifts towards “independence” 
default 
defaultassert
defaulting an international identity of its’ own
default, if there is no scrutiny of Jersey’s institutions and Government.
default 
default&#xa0;
default10
default That Jersey’s economy is now so dominated by the so called “Finance Industry” is a
default 
defaultspecific aspect that needs to be considered critically and its affects, both within and
default 
defaultoutside the Island, examined.
default There are questions as to the sustainability of this
default&#xa0;
default1
default1
default 
defaultThe
default ongoing problems relating to the Dean of Jersey have revealed
default gaps
default and obscurities in the arrangements for his appointment and
default 
defaultdiscipline.
default It seems to me that 
defaultthe “Crown” aspect 
defaultis not fully 
defaultunderstood
default by Islanders 
defaultand it is not
default 
defaultcertain where 
defaultr
defaultesponsibi
defaultlity and power lies
default.
default  Indeed, there are two inquiries (under Dame Heather Steele and Bishop John Gladwin) ongoing
default.
default&#xa0;
default12
default Th
defaultat the laws and usages of Jersey are so little understood
default in the Island is
default not a new
default complaint
default,
default but it is evident that the ignorance
default extends to 
defaultrelationships
default with 
defaultUK institutions
default and Government
default.
default              
default&#xa0;
default13
default 
defaultOur
default Home Affairs Minister
default has failed
default to take any
default effective
default action, where he has been advised
default that 
defaultserving police officers have been perverting the course of justice
default.  He has requested the amendment of Standing Orders to prevent 
defaulta Deputy 
defaultasking questions about this.  
default 
default14 
defaultThe loss of evidence from police custody relating to child abuse (Haut de la Garenne) and which is highly relevant to the States Compensation Scheme for victims of abuse
default.  Events at the home came to light in 2008 and only now is a Committee of Inquiry getting underway.
default15
default The collusion of civil servants and politicians to remove a Minister from Office
default over his concerns 
defaultabout
default our Child Protection Policy. T
defaulthis
default was revealed by a former Chief of Police
default, who
default was suspended from his job with no explanation or resolution.  In my view this is against natural justice.   
default16
default The working of the legal aid system which means that ordinary citizens have almost no chance of getting any justice in the legal system
default.  It is means tested and funded by lawyers.  The allocation of a lawyer from a rota system means that justice can be compromised by the allocation of an unsuitable lawyer for the case at hand.
default&#xa0;
default17 Jersey lacks anti-discrimination laws and many other progressive measures.  It appears that the small, powerful legal profession is responsible for blocking these thing
defaults
default from happening
default&#xa0;
default18
default I
default wonder why the UK Government is more committed to Sark’s good governance when it has a population of 600.  Jersey has around 99,000.
default&#xa0;
default19
default Resid
defaultents do not know how to invoke 
defaultgood governance (which is ill-defined) in Jersey
default in order to resolve and prevent abuses
default.  
default&#xa0;
default20
default 
defaultThe
default ultimate responsibility of the UK governmen
defaultt
default also needs to be considered
default,
default as do any failures to intervene.
default The UK must take seriously the responsibility it has under the ECHR towards the good governance of the Crown Dependencies.
