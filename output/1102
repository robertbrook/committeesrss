[normal]Written evidence from [bold]a resident of Jersey (Resident A)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1 
[normal]I am a resident of Jersey who is concerned about abuses in our 
[normal]Legal and
[normal] Parliamentary system
[normal] as well as the Police
[normal]. 
[normal].
[normal]I understand that my evidence is the property of the Committee 
[normal]but I would respectfully ask that my evidence is not published on the Internet as I am a States worker and fear losing my job if my name is known.  I have discussed this with my poli
[normal]tic
[normal]al representative.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]There are about 300 lawyers in Jersey who have a privileged minority
[normal] status.
[normal] 
[normal] It is from this group that the Bailiff and Law Officers are selected and appointed and
[normal] it seems to me that 
[normal]they still dominate the proceedings of government, the judicia
[normal]ry
[normal] and the
[normal] 
[normal]administration of so many
[normal] aspects of island life
[normal].
[normal] T
[normal]hey survive apparently 
[normal]despite
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]recomm
[normal]e
[normal]nd
[normal]ations contained in the Sir Cecil Clothier
[normal] 
[normal]and Lord Carswell
[normal] Reports
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]3 An example of
[normal] this is a f
[normal]ormer magistrate designate, jailed for fraud, who despite having not worked since 2008 only resigned in January this year.
[normal]  My understanding is that his salary cannot be reclaimed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal] The 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] of former Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache since 2010 ha
[normal]s
[normal] highlighted 
[normal]problems in
[normal] the prevailing system
[normal], by which I mean a concentration of power in few hands
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]E
[normal]ven whilst serving as Bailiff, Sir Philip was 
[normal]a
[normal]ctive in politic
[normal]s
[normal] and
[normal] had an agenda
[normal] for an “independent” Jersey
[normal].  This seems to me to be driven 
[normal]by
[normal] elite who wish to avoid accountability for their actions.  If what I read on the local internet Blog sites
[normal] is correct
[normal], the people do not want it.
[normal] I feel it relevant to mention at this point that these Blogs are increasingly trusted over the Main Stream Media.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6 S
[normal]ince retiring 
[normal]as Bailiff he
[normal] has been elected as a Senator and now sits in the States as a political
[normal] representative 
[normal]“of the people”. 
[normal] His plan for States Reform (removal of Senators and larger constituencies formed the 
[normal]main part of his successful election 
[normal]campaign 
[normal]as a Senatorial candidate in 2011.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal] The recent (24 April) Jersey Referendum, which the politically dominated Electoral
[normal] 
[normal]Commission
[normal] which
[normal] he chaired,
[normal] 
[normal]attracted a minimal public participation
[normal] of around 26% which does not suggest confidence on the public’s part in the democratic process.  Voter apathy is a problem in Jersey.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]f 
[normal]this
[normal] gains the approval of the States Assembly and the Privy
[normal] 
[normal]Council, will 
[normal]b
[normal]e for reduced and less democratic representation of the public
[normal], my concern is that it will make our
[normal] 
[normal]system of
[normal] 
[normal]government 
[normal]e
[normal]ven less compliant with international standards than
[normal] before.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal] Sir Philip has ambitions to make Jersey independent of the British Crown and to be our Foreign Minister
[normal]. 
[normal]This proposition has not been put to the electorate.
[normal] Any conflict
[normal]s
[normal] with UK Government
[normal] wi
[normal]ll, in my view 
[normal]become more acute as the Island drifts towards “independence” 
[normal] 
[normal]assert
[normal]ing an international identity of its’ own
[normal], if there is no scrutiny of Jersey’s institutions and Government.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal] That Jersey’s economy is now so dominated by the so called “Finance Industry” is a
[normal] 
[normal]specific aspect that needs to be considered critically and its affects, both within and
[normal] 
[normal]outside the Island, examined.
[normal] There are questions as to the sustainability of this
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] ongoing problems relating to the Dean of Jersey have revealed
[normal] gaps
[normal] and obscurities in the arrangements for his appointment and
[normal] 
[normal]discipline.
[normal] It seems to me that 
[normal]the “Crown” aspect 
[normal]is not fully 
[normal]understood
[normal] by Islanders 
[normal]and it is not
[normal] 
[normal]certain where 
[normal]r
[normal]esponsibi
[normal]lity and power lies
[normal].
[normal]  Indeed, there are two inquiries (under Dame Heather Steele and Bishop John Gladwin) ongoing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal] Th
[normal]at the laws and usages of Jersey are so little understood
[normal] in the Island is
[normal] not a new
[normal] complaint
[normal],
[normal] but it is evident that the ignorance
[normal] extends to 
[normal]relationships
[normal] with 
[normal]UK institutions
[normal] and Government
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal] 
[normal]Our
[normal] Home Affairs Minister
[normal] has failed
[normal] to take any
[normal] effective
[normal] action, where he has been advised
[normal] that 
[normal]serving police officers have been perverting the course of justice
[normal].  He has requested the amendment of Standing Orders to prevent 
[normal]a Deputy 
[normal]asking questions about this.  
[normal] 
[normal]14 
[normal]The loss of evidence from police custody relating to child abuse (Haut de la Garenne) and which is highly relevant to the States Compensation Scheme for victims of abuse
[normal].  Events at the home came to light in 2008 and only now is a Committee of Inquiry getting underway.
[normal]15
[normal] The collusion of civil servants and politicians to remove a Minister from Office
[normal] over his concerns 
[normal]about
[normal] our Child Protection Policy. T
[normal]his
[normal] was revealed by a former Chief of Police
[normal], who
[normal] was suspended from his job with no explanation or resolution.  In my view this is against natural justice.   
[normal]16
[normal] The working of the legal aid system which means that ordinary citizens have almost no chance of getting any justice in the legal system
[normal].  It is means tested and funded by lawyers.  The allocation of a lawyer from a rota system means that justice can be compromised by the allocation of an unsuitable lawyer for the case at hand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17 Jersey lacks anti-discrimination laws and many other progressive measures.  It appears that the small, powerful legal profession is responsible for blocking these thing
[normal]s
[normal] from happening
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal] I
[normal] wonder why the UK Government is more committed to Sark’s good governance when it has a population of 600.  Jersey has around 99,000.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19
[normal] Resid
[normal]ents do not know how to invoke 
[normal]good governance (which is ill-defined) in Jersey
[normal] in order to resolve and prevent abuses
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] ultimate responsibility of the UK governmen
[normal]t
[normal] also needs to be considered
[normal],
[normal] as do any failures to intervene.
[normal] The UK must take seriously the responsibility it has under the ECHR towards the good governance of the Crown Dependencies.
