[normal]Background
[normal]The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) welcomes the opportunity to make an input
[normal] into this Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry into women in STEM careers.
[normal] 
[normal]As a Research Technology Organisation (RTO) NPL is part of the research infrastructure in the UK and has been a highly regarded 
[normal]n
[normal]ational 
[normal]l
[normal]aboratory
[normal], undertaking 
[normal]publicly-funded research, for over a century.
[normal] 
[normal]Our role is to act as the UK’s 
[normal]N
[normal]ational 
[normal]M
[normal]easurement 
[normal]I
[normal]nstitute (NMI).
[normal] 
[normal]We sit at the intersection between scientific discovery and real world application, working as a bridge between academia, business and govern
[normal]ment.
[normal] 
[normal]Our expertise and original research have underpinned quality of life, innovation and competitiveness for UK citizens and business since the opening of 
[normal]the laboratory over 100 years ago
[normal].
[normal]Key facts:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NPL’
[normal]s 
[normal]performance and 
[normal]reputation relies on the first
[normal]-
[normal]class
[normal] people and 
[normal]particularly the 
[normal]exceptional scientists who work at the 
[normal]laboratory
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]As a non-academic organisation NPL welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the inquiry and provide 
[normal]our
[normal] view about what women value i
[normal]n a scientific career outside
[normal] academia.
[normal]Why do numbers of women in STE
[normal]M academic careers decline further up the career ladder? 
[normal]In all three years, once a fema
[normal]le got to the promotion panel there was a 100% success rate.
[normal] 
[normal]This is not the case for male candidates and might suggest that 
[normal]women
[normal] wait until they feel 
[normal]completely 
[normal]ready before applying for promotion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors? 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]What
[normal] should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
