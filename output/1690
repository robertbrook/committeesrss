defaultBackground
defaultThe National Physical Laboratory (NPL) welcomes the opportunity to make an input
default into this Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry into women in STEM careers.
default 
defaultAs a Research Technology Organisation (RTO) NPL is part of the research infrastructure in the UK and has been a highly regarded 
defaultn
defaultational 
defaultl
defaultaboratory
default, undertaking 
defaultpublicly-funded research, for over a century.
default 
defaultOur role is to act as the UK’s 
defaultN
defaultational 
defaultM
defaulteasurement 
defaultI
defaultnstitute (NMI).
default 
defaultWe sit at the intersection between scientific discovery and real world application, working as a bridge between academia, business and govern
defaultment.
default 
defaultOur expertise and original research have underpinned quality of life, innovation and competitiveness for UK citizens and business since the opening of 
defaultthe laboratory over 100 years ago
default.
defaultKey facts:
default&#xa0;
defaultNPL’
defaults 
defaultperformance and 
defaultreputation relies on the first
default-
defaultclass
default people and 
defaultparticularly the 
defaultexceptional scientists who work at the 
defaultlaboratory
default.
default 
defaultAs a non-academic organisation NPL welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the inquiry and provide 
defaultour
default view about what women value i
defaultn a scientific career outside
default academia.
defaultWhy do numbers of women in STE
defaultM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? 
defaultIn all three years, once a fema
defaultle got to the promotion panel there was a 100% success rate.
default 
defaultThis is not the case for male candidates and might suggest that 
defaultwomen
default wait until they feel 
defaultcompletely 
defaultready before applying for promotion.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors? 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWhat
default should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
