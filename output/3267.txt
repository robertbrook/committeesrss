[[[&#xa0;]]]This helps the Victim Liaison Officer to manage the case.  It also helps the victim to have trust in the Victim Liaison Officer if they are knowledgeable about and understand the situation and reduces the embarrassment, anger and distress they may feel by having to recount the circumstances of the offence and their situation to an uninformed Victim Liaison Officer.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[again?   ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Victims worry that confidential information will be disclosed.  I am currently able to reassure them that we abide by Data Protection Policies and can tell them exactly where information is stored and who has access to it.&#xa0;
