[normal]he Co-operative Insurance
[normal] (CMI0011)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Co-operative Insurance is part of the Co-operative Banking Group, which has over 8 million customers throughout the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. The Co-operative Banking Group is itself part of the Co-operative Group, the 
[normal]UK
[normal]'s largest consumer 
[normal]co-operative. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Co-operative Insurance offers a variety of insurance products, including Motor and Household policies, and has been a regular user of the Road Traffic Accident Portal (the Portal) since its inception, historically receiving in the region of 25,000 Road Traffic Accident (RTA) claims via the Portal each year. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a business, we are an ethically led, member owned mutual 
[normal]organisation
[normal], which is committed to ensuring that we pass on reductions on insurance premiums for our policyholders where possible, and we believe that such reductions can be achieved with a reduction in the number of whiplash claims, and reduced spend on legal costs, for those genuine claims which do proceed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have supported the recent civil litigation reforms including changes to recovery of additional liabilities, extension to the RTA Personal Injury Scheme and the introduction of reduced fixed fees and Fast Track costs, and we are hopeful that these measures will 
[normal]ultimately 
[normal]be instrumental in reducing the cost of low value RTA personal injury claims, which in turn should lead to a benefit for our policyholders, in the form of lower premiums. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe, however, that there is a significant opportunity to further reduce the frequency of such claims, and the inherent costs involved, and having considered your letter of 29 October 2013 to the Ministry of Justice (the MOJ) we welcome this invitation from the Transport Select Committee (the TSC) to provide comments on the Government’s Command Paper (the Paper) and our thoughts on other measures which could be taken also. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Timeframe and implementation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We believe that it is extremely important for the MOJ to provide the detail of, and a commitment to, the timeframe and proposals for methods of the implementation of the proposed reforms. Whilst we note that the MOJ states they intend to work “at pace” we believe that it is essential that the changes are agreed and brought into effect with the minimum of delay and bureaucracy in order for the public to benefit from the stated aims of the Paper as expeditiously as possible.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Medical Reporting[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We were pleased to see in the Paper that there was a broad consensus from respondents, and support from the MOJ, to establish an independent and accredited medical panel for the assessment of whiplash and related soft tissue injury claims.
[normal] This accords with our position.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We share the TSC’s view that there is a lack of detail in relation to the proposals in the Paper. In the absence of the detail, our major concerns in the area of medical reporting remain. Our opinion is that of fundamental and paramount importance are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](
[normal]i
[normal]) The true independence and impartiality of the experts conducting the medical assessments and providing the report; 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii) Initial and continuous assessment of those becoming accredited (which we believe can be appropriately carried out by peer review on a random sample basis); and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](iii) The robustness and medical accuracy of the assessment and diagnostic process itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are concerned that there appears to be a potential conflict in the independence of medical reporting, when there exists the possibility of close ties between entities in an Alternative Business Structure (ABS) (provided for under the Legal Services Act). We foresee the situation whereby an accredited practitioner could be employed within one entity of an ABS, and the 
[normal]claimant
[normal] solicitor being another entity within it. We believe that this would be wholly unacceptable, as for the system to be “fit for purpose” it is crucial that independence and transparency are truly in existence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of the report to the practitioner, we believe that in order to seek to drive out fraudulent or frivolous claims the information which should accompany the instructions to the examining expert, as a minimum, should include, where available:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, the presumption against consideration of the 
[normal]claimant
[normal]’s medical notes should be reversed, and therefore allowed if the 
[normal]defendant
[normal]’s insurer or representative deems it 
[normal]necessary
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 
[normal]our response to the MOJ Consultation (Our Response)
[normal] we were of the opinion that claims of 
[normal]the type under consideration
[normal] do lend themselves to the standard medical report form format, but we made it clear that our belief is that the format of the report is less important than the integrity of the diagnostic and reporting process itself. We also have concerns that the process could become “cut and paste”, as it all too often is in the present system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We note that you seek further detail from the MOJ on the subject of “pre-med” offers, and would suggest that, if the process of medical assessment became truly independent, transparent and rigorous, and was accepted by all stakeholders as being effective, the practice would be likely to be considered as having become unnecessary.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We firmly believe that the medical reporting process is the key to reducing the cost and number of claims in the future.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Fraudulently exaggerated claims[bold]We note that you have sought detail from the MOJ on the issue of limiting the right to compensation in grossly exaggerated claims (the fifth bullet point of your letter). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our view, expressed to the MOJ in Our Response, was that the law as it presently
[normal] stands does not provide
[normal] disincentive to 
[normal]claimant
[normal]s to “try it on” with the exaggeration 
[normal]of a claim, when the position is currently
[normal] 
[normal]that the Court can only strike out an entire claim (resulting in the loss of the genuine elements as well) in “very exceptional circumstances”. This is at odds with the situation in first party exaggeration claims which would potentially see the whole claim fall away if the exaggeration was uncovered, and we see no reason to make this distinction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe that the message being sent out presently is that a claimant may as well have a go, as the consequences of detection are largely non-existent, and in anything other than “very exceptional circumstances”, they will still receive the non-exaggerated element of their claim. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We made a number of suggestions
[normal] for the reduction of fraudulent and exaggerated claims
[normal] to the MOJ in Our Response:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe that there is presently a culture which regards either (
[normal]i
[normal]) claiming when there is no injury; or (ii) exaggerating the extent of the injury or loss, as a “victimless crime”, and the only way to change this is for serious sanctions to be imposed in order to break the cycle and act as a real deterrent.
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We are pleased to note the TSC’s scrutiny of the Paper, and hope that our written response to your call for evidence will be of assistance in your continuing consideration of the issues in this extremely important policy area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe that in order to 
[normal]realise
[normal] the stated aims of the Paper, and in turn see the number and cost of claims reduce, ultimately resulting in lower premiums for policyholders, the questions around medical reporting and exaggerated claims are 
[normal]key, and there is a real opportunity to ensure that the claims culture is changed
[normal],
[normal] which should not be missed.
[normal] We further believe that policy change in this area should remain a priority for Government, and should be developed and implemented without any undue delay.
