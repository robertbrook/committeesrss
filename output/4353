defaultWe would welcome DFID work for the social reintegration, physical rehabilitation and livelihoods of  persons with disabilities in Afghanistan.   I have worked in the field of disability for the last 23 years in Afghanistan but I have never heard about DFID assistance for persons with disabilities.  I have heard that they work in other areas and support the Afghan government but I have never seen them to be involved in disability related work.
