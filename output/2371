[normal]I write in relation to your deliberations on off-road motor vehicles and motor cycles use of
[normal]BOATS (Byways Open to All Traffic) and similar rights of way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this area of the Marlborough  Downs, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, we are plagued by 4x4 motor vehicles and motor cycles, on occasions in groups of 10 or more, using open access tracks for joy-riding.  The noise is excessive and the damage to tracks extensive.  As the local authority restores a track it is quickly, within a year, returned to something near to its previous state.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It seems not unreasonable to ask the government to restrict the use of these tracks to non motorised traffic.  If the objective is access to the countryside and quiet enjoyment, surely the noise alone of motorised traffic defeats this objective. The damage to these tracks caused by motor vehicles makes it impossible even for the more assiduous Councils to keep them in a state of repair that permits enjoyable walking indeed in places the tracks in Winter are impassable. Furthermore the speed and volume of vehicles creates danger for horse riders and pedestrians alike.
