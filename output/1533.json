"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from  Norfolk Community Transport Association\n (TIC 043)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n \nThis is a submission to the Commons Select Committee enquiry on passenger transport in isolated communities on behalf of Norfolk Community Transport Association (NCTA).  NCTA is a membership organisation of individual community transport operators in \nNorfo\nlk\n.  We currently have 33 members out of an estimated 70 provider organisations in the county\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n \nThe points addressed by this submission are in relation to two specific questions posed by the select committee:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n \nThe points within \nthis submission are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.4. \nWe recognise that Norfolk County Council has also submitted evidence in response to this call and that the current demand for transport in the county and the profile of residents most in need of transport will have been outlined in that submission.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n \nC\nommunity \nT\nransport \nO\nperator\ns\n (CTOs)\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n \nFifteen operators are running one or more minibuses.  The largest operator has a fleet of over 60 buses and the smallest have one \nor two buses, which primarily offer transport to the activities run by the member organisation.  Seven operators run transport provision only.\n  These organisations operate on Section 19 or Section 22 licences and include paid and volunteer drivers.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n \nFifty-\neight operators run community car schemes only  These are delivered by volunteer drivers using their own cars and are supported by voluntary co-ordinators (in about three organisations there is a paid, part time co-ordinator) and voluntary management commi\nttees/trustees.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n \nOther members are:\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n \nNorfolk County Council currently provides £283,350 in grants to \nsome of \nthese operators and has additionally \nbeen \nawarded contracts to provide specific services such as operating\n demand responsive transport, school transport \netc\n.  Some district councils provide funding to \noperators to subsidise the cost of the journey for the individual passenger\n, for health purposes\n.  Some parish councils also offer a subsidy in their areas.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n \nCommunity Transport Operators are independent community based organisations that have been set up by groups of local people responding to community needs.  Some in \nNorfolk\n have been running for over 20 years.  Some are thriving with pools of up to 50 volun\nteer drivers while some are struggling, unable to recruit new drivers and not seeking to offer a service to people other than existing, long-term users.  As a result, coverage within the county is inconsistent, in terms of where \no\nperators ar\ne based and wha\nt their offer is \n(some CTO\ns support volunteers with the offer of free transport in return for their volunteering role.  This assists those who \nhave been long term unemployed\n to evidence their commitment to developing skills and experience and \ncan \nresult in\n them being offered paid employment).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n \nBus operators provide a range of services including traditional door-to-door, dial-a-ride services in accessible minibuses.  Passengers book a journey and are co\nllected from their home, taken to their destination\n,\n collected \nand taken home again at a pre-arranged time.  They pay a fare and drivers (or passenger assistants) help them on and off the \nbus, \ncarry shopping and ensure they are secured in their seats befor\ne departing.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n \nBus operators also deliver services to Norfolk County Council and others, including a demand responsive transport service called ‘\nFlexibus\n’ in \n5\n parts of Norfolk; school transport, particularly for those needing accessible vehicles, adult soc\nial care journeys, such as to day centres, etc.  These are contracts awarded in a competitive environment.\n  Some CTs provide feeder services to other transport hubs, particularly from isolated rural communities  \n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n \nCar Schemes are focused particularly on he\nalth based journeys, including to doctors’ surgeries, hospital appointments, dentists, opticians, chiropodists, etc.  So\nme also take people shopping or \nto community based \nand well-being \nactivities.  They are based in a specific geographic area\ns\n and offer s\nervices only to people living in a particular parish, village or market town.  \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n \nMost of the passengers \nusing community transport \nare older people, people with a disability or a health problem.  Many are \nmuch older people aged 80+ and a significant proport\nion \n(70 – 80%) \nare women.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n \nThe key factors influencing the environment in which community transport is operating in \nNorfolk\n are:\n&#xa0;\n4.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn aging population – as well as national demographics, \nNorfolk\n is a popular retirement area.  Most rural districts have \np\nopulations of people aged over 75 that are significantly higher than the national average (fig 1)\n. The figure for \nNorth Norfolk\n is particularly high.\n&#xa0;\n% aged 75+\n% aged 80+\nBreckland\n10.31\n6.11\nKing's Lynn And \nWest Norfolk\n10.95\n6.42\nNorth Norfolk\n&#xa0;\n14.16\n8.46\nNorfolk\n&#xa0;\n10.43\n6.24\nEngland\n&#xa0;\n7.01\n3.85\n&#xa0;\nFig. 1\n&#xa0;\n4.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe age of users of a sample group of CTOs in a survey commissioned by Norfolk County Council in 2012 can be seen in fig 2.\n&#xa0;\nFig 2\n&#xa0;\n4.1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDecreasing access to funded hospital transport – although it is claimed that the eligibility criteria have not changed, there is extensive reported evidence that criteria are being applied\n more narrowly,\n to limit access to this service.  The result is a si\ngnificant increase in demand for community transport.  One of our members, North Norfolk Community Transport, reports \njust under \na \n200\n% increase in demand for its \nMedi\nride\n service in the \npast two\n year\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDecreasing public funding for investment in voluntar\ny organisations at a time of recession, means that they are having to do more with less.  Norfolk County Council is maintaining its grant \nfund for co\nmmunity transport in the next\n financial year but is able to make no guarantees for the position \nbeyond Marc\nh 2015\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreasing requirements by funders for operators to meet requirements such as all drivers having Disclosure and Barring Service checks.  Although NCTA offers our members free checks for volunteer drivers, this is still an additional effort for vol\nunteers to go through the checks and to co-ordinate the process.  Whilst these checks are undoubtedly necessary, they are time consuming and some volunteers are reluctant to go through the process.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n \nNCTA undertook a piece of research in autumn 2012 \nin 17 i\ndentified parishes\n in the centre of the county to support a funding bid we were making for a new demand responsive transport service in that area\n. \n \nWe circulated links to an on line survey and additionally distributed 464 hard copies and others were circul\nated by Parish Clerks.  We received 109 returns.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n \nThe headline findings \nwe\nre:\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n \nThe most important aspects \nof the service were the hours of\n operation (82%), availability at weekends (64%) and booking at short notice (45%).  40% of respondents said that home \npick ups\n were important to them.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n \nPeople made comments about how ba\ndly a bus service was needed in the area, how they felt isolated and that journeys were long and difficult and also expensive.  Respondents with disabilities and those with caring responsibilities for others were particularly supportive of the prospective \nservice.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n \nThe biggest demand for transport expressed in NCC’s survey was in the areas of accessing essential services and socialising and meeting family and friends.  These were seen \na\ns important indicators in people’s well being.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n \nThere are a number of factors that limit community transport from playing a wider role in delivering transport services.  The limitations do not include enthusiasm and a willingness to deliver.  \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n \nThere is a limit to what volunteers ca\nn be expected to do.  Most volunteers do not want to work early in the morning, late in the evening or at weekends.  This limits the services that can be offered by volunteer dependent operators.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n \nCTOs\n tend to work in very specific areas and if there is no\n scheme in a particular community, it cannot be imposed from a top down position.  This can result in areas of need not having access to a CT scheme while more affluent communities, with more access to volunteers with nice cars, have thriving schemes.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n \nMan\ny potential passengers cannot afford longer journeys in a CT vehicle, even though they are cheaper than commercial alternatives.  Many people in \nNorfolk\n live 20 miles or more from a major hospital, which would result in a round trip costing around £18.  Ou\nt of county trips to specialist hospitals such as \nPapworth\n could cost around £90 (this might be reduced if a subsidy is available but the passenger would still have to pay £45).\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n \nOnly CTOs running buses with Section 22 licences are eligible to accept \nconcessionary travel passes.  This limits their ability to offer affordable transport to some of the most disadvantaged groups of people in the community and means that some operators have extra\n administration from running two\n different types of licence.\n&#xa0;\n5.6.\n \nCTOs experienced a significant drop in demand for services purchased by adult social services department as a result in cuts to local government funding affecting day centres.  Many of these have closed with the result that some \nisolated individuals have n\nowhere to go and no opportunity to use the transport that is available to them.  CTOs had a sudden drop in income that has affected their ability to run sustainable services.\n  \nThe introduction of personalised budgets has also had an impact on CTOs as previ\nous contracts to provide transport for groups of people from Social Services departments have ended and there is no automatic inclusion of transport costs when individuals plan and agree their budgets.  Some people are making the decision to buy their tran\nsport from a range of sources.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n \nThere are a number of barriers faced by Community Transport Operators in \nNorfolk\n.  The main ones are:\n&#xa0;\n6.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe commissioning agenda – CTOs are seeking full cost recovery from \ncontracts so that other areas of income are not cross-subsidising local authority contracts.  They are competing against commercial providers who are putting in very low bids that are acting as a loss leader.  Sometimes this results in these organisations \nhaving to withdraw from contracts before completion.  Norfolk County Council is seeking to cut their costs and\n many standard contracts are awarded\n only on the basis of price rather than value for money.  The Public Services (Social Value) Act is having lim\nited impact in changing this culture although a recent transport contract did include social criteria.  CTOs will not bid for contracts if they don’t make \nan operating surplus\n from them\n.  \nThe majority of c\nontracts issued by NCC tend to be short term (1 yea\nr) that do not enable contract holders to develop long term plans\n&#xa0;\n6.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of engagement by health providers in CT.  GP surgeries and hospitals \na\nr\ne the main organisational beneficiaries of community transport but make no financial contribution to the services\n.  CTOs could help to reduce costs of non emergency medical transport to the ambulance service, freeing resources to concentrate on emergency services.\n  This would also achieve other cost savings for health providers.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecruiting volunteers – this is a con\nstant concern for all types of CTO.  As described above, the volunteer profile is aging and \nsome schemes are not able to recruit younger volunteers.\n  \nThere is a lack of trustee volunteers coming forward to take over from aging ones \non\n CT\nO\n \nboards\n.\n  \nT\nhe \ntravel expenses\n rate for volunteers is set at 45p for \nup to\n10,000 miles\n.\n \n B\neyond this, the volunteer is deemed to be in profit and is not insured. This limits the amount a volunteer car driver can\n&#xa0;\ndo\n,\n particularly with the increase in the longer runs for h\nospital car journeys.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn aging fleet of vehicles – a recent audit undertaken by NCTA identified that 70% of the bus fleet is between 5 – 10 years old and 27% is over 10 years old\n&#xa0;\n6.1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges to D1 status of driving licences – this is a problem that is beginn\ning to occur as drivers who passed their tests after \n1996\n n\need to take an additional test to be eligible to drive a minibus.  This costs over £1000 per driver and poses a significant extra cost for CTOs.  It also reinforces the dependency on older drivers \nwho have D1 status on their licences\n.  \nCTO\ns could attract younger drivers, pay for them to take the additional test to drive minibuses, only to lose them to commercial operators.  The CTO would then have to begin the recruitment process from scratch\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReq\nuired training for each driver includes:\n&#xa0;\n6.1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditional costs of providing accessible services, such as t\nhe \nprice\n of fully accessible vehicles compared to standard minibuses – a new\n,\n standard vehicle can cost in the region of £18 – 20,000 \ncompared to £\n38 – 40,000 for a fully accessible minibus.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommercial operators tend to carry a maximum of one designated \nwheelchair on any journey.  This is reflecte\nd in their fare structure.  \nS\nome CTOs carry multiple large customised wheelchairs, scooters and mobility aids.  This restricts the amount of fare paying passengers.  A 16 \nseater\n fully accessible minibus can only \naccommodate seven passengers due to the \nnumber\n of wheelchair mobility aids.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe time it takes the majority of passengers to get from their door onto the bus, to find their seat and put their seat belt on.  For individuals who travel in their wheelchair\ns,\n \nadditional time is required to apply all the safety restraints (6) for each wheelchair.  Those passengers who need a wheelchair or scooter to get from their house to the bus and \nfrom the bus, \nonce they have arrived \nat their destination\n,\n take considerably l\nonger and therefore each journey is less time efficient than a similar journey undertaken by a commercial operator\n&#xa0;\n6.1.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn additional cost for CTOs is for safety equipment suc\nh as wheelchair restraints (front and back), wheel chair occupant safety seat belt re\nstraints, seat belt extensions.  The cost is on average £600 per wheelchair.  Some CTOs have up to £3,000 of additional safety equipment on each bus.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n \nIn general, CTOs face the same issues as many other third sector organisations including an increasingly \ncompetitive bidding process to win grant funding and the processes taking an increasing amount of time with more and more complexity in completing each application.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n \nIn order to overcome these barriers, the following actions could be taken:\n&#xa0;\n7.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncrease skills within CTOs to bid for and win contracts\n&#xa0;\n7.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic authorities take social value into account when issuing contracts, publish full details about when current \ncontracts are due for renewal and bidding processes are advertised in good time.  Contracts are awarded on the basis of value for money over the lifetime of the contract rather than the lowest price\n&#xa0;\n7.1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContracts should be offered for \nlonger periods, ideally \na \nminimum \nfive year term\n (with an option to extend a further 3 years)\n,\n which will \nenable CTOs to plan over longer periods and become more sustainable businesses.\n&#xa0;\n7.1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal support \nshould\n \nbe \navailable to assist in the recruitment of volunteers\n specifically for\n driving\n&#xa0;\n7.1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInvestment funds are available to enable CTOs to buy new vehicles (Norfolk County Council is currently offering a Small Vehicles Fund of £250\n,000 but this is a one off oppo\nrtunity\n).  This should be conditional upon CTOs operating a depreciation p\nolicy with a vehicle replacement fund in their budgets.\n&#xa0;\n7.1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment sh\nould review the D1 status on driving licenses or set up a ring fenced fund for CTOs to access funds for training drivers to drive minibuses.\n&#xa0;\n7.1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment should review the LTA Section\n19 s\nervice so that all CTOs are eligible to accept concessionary bus passes  without having to apply for and run a section 22 route.\n7.1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe growing movement towards setting up local community transport forums should be recognised as highly beneficial to the secto\nr and supported to develop and grow.  The benefits of this kind of support are identified below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1.\n \nNCTA is a local support organisation that enables CT\nOs\n in \nNorfolk\n to get together and develop th\neir organisations offering more and better services to local residents.\n&#xa0;\n8.2.\n \nThe specific services we offer are outlined below:\n&#xa0;\n8.3.\n \nPooling resources to save money\n&#xa0;\n8.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe offer a shared minibus insurance scheme, saving most operators approximately £100 per vehicle\n&#xa0;\n8.3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe produce shared publicity materials\n&#xa0;\n8.3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe run an HR contract with a specialist provider so that members can access support with staffing matters\n&#xa0;\n8.3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorking with Suffolk Community Transport we produced a Drivers Handbook for each driver to have in their vehic\nle.  13 of our members took up this offer\n&#xa0;\n8.4.\n \nImproving performance and capacity\n&#xa0;\n8.4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
