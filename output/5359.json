"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Chartered Institute of Taxation (DWB 16)&#xa0;The Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) is \npleased to submit some general comments on the draft Wales Bill that we hope will be of assistance to the Welsh Affairs Committee. We \nrestrict our comments to taxation matters, our area of expertise. We \nwould be please\nd\n to amplify our comments orally or in\n writing if that would be helpful and we look forward to engaging with the Welsh Government as the taxation matters dealt with by the Bill are developed.\n This short paper sets out:\n&#xa0;\nProbably the key point we would wish to make is that \ndeveloping fully operational \ndevolv\ned taxes will take considerable time and resources. That may seem an obvious \npoint but the timescales involved and the resources needed must not be underestimated.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Chartered Institute of Taxation&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CIOT is the leading professional body in the United Kingdom concerned solely with taxation. The CIOT is an educational charit\ny, promoting education and study of the administration and practice of taxation. One of our key aims is to work for a better, more efficient, tax system for all affected by it – taxpayers, their advisers and the authorities. The CIOT’s work covers all aspe\ncts of taxation, including direct and indirect taxes and duties. \n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CIOT draws on our members’ experience in private practice, commerce and industry, government and academia to improve tax administration and propose and explain how tax policy objectives can most effectively be achieved. We also link to, and draw on, si\nmilar leading professional tax bodies in other countries. The CIOT’s comments and recommendations on tax issues are made in line with our charitable objectives: we are politically neutral in our work.\n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CIOT’s \n17,000\n members have the practising title of\n ‘Chartered Tax Adviser’ and the \ndesignatory\n letters ‘CTA’, to represent the leading tax qualification\n. \nThe Low Incomes Tax Reform Group&#xa0;4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough our Low Incomes Tax Reform Group (LITRG), the CIOT has a particular focus on improving the tax system, includ\ning tax credits and benefits, for the unrepresented taxpayer. LITRG is an initiative of the CIOT to give \na voice to the unrepresented, \ni\ne\n those who cannot afford to take professional advice. Since 1998 LITRG has been \nworking\n to improve the policy and proce\nsses of the tax, tax credits and associated welfare systems for the benefit of those on low incomes. \n&#xa0;Key principles for taxation&#xa0;5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nWelsh Government\n has a real opportunity to design the \ndevolved taxes \nin line with proper principles. \nWe think the Welsh\n Affairs Committee could usefully emphasise the importance of these principles in its report.\n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nthink there are four\n key principles to be borne in mind in the design of tax systems:\nConsultation&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are firm believers in the benefits of proper consultation. The point is to get practical input into the development of new tax law. More subtly, a key benefit is that consultation will make taxpayers and advisers more supportive of the law if they have \nbeen involved with its development. \n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are very supportive of the UK Government’s framework for tax consultations as set out in ‘Tax Policy Making: a new approach\n’\n. Its principles parallel our views on what makes effective consultation, views we have pu\nt forward many times over the years:\n&#xa0;\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe guiding principle must be that all tax policy changes are consulted on\n. \nThe main exception would be changes in tax rates. We do accept that changes in rates are always going to be a matter for government and would not normally be susceptible\n to consultation, though there have been instances where the implications of what seemed to be rate changes would have emerged with consultation\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would be happy to supply fuller comments about consultation, including reflections on our experience of the consultative process, if that were helpful. \nStability&#xa0;11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA stable tax system – one that changes only when it needs to – is an important part of th\ne business environment. Investment is encouraged if businesses have confidence in the way the returns from their investment will be taxed. One of the conclusions of the Office of Tax Simplific\nation’s (OTS) first project on small b\nusiness\n was that the grea\ntest source of complexity for small business is change\n. \n&#xa0;\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdeally taxes should be underpinned by a proper framework – key aims for the tax and principles under which it will operate. For the government, the overriding point is \nto promote confidence in the \ntax system. That delivers benefits as taxpayers (business and individual) are more likely to comply with their responsibilities.\nCertainty&#xa0;13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStability promotes certainty and many businesses put certainty at the top of their list of what a tax system needs t\no deliver. They want to know what the result of their actions will be in tax terms. For this reason, retrospective changes to tax laws are very damaging and should be avoided: another benefit of consultation, to ‘get it right first time’.\n&#xa0;\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne manifestatio\nn of certainty is that taxes should be laid down clearly in statute. In today’s complex environment, guidance notes by the tax authority will often be necessary, particularly for the unrepresented. But such material should be explanations, assistance and g\nuidance, not a way for the tax authority to interpret (or even worse, change) the law to how it thinks it should operate. Citizens should b\ne taxed by law, not by guidance,\n nor untaxed by concession.\nSimplicity&#xa0;\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTaxes should as far as possible be expressed \nin clear law and be simple to operate. Administrative burdens on taxpayers should be minimised. When developing new tax laws, it should be part of the planning process to develop the necessary compliance routines and draft the relevant forms to test out th\ne likely burdens that will be imposed and how easy it will be to comply. \n&#xa0;\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt should be borne in mind that it can be more cost-effective in some cases for the central authority to carry out aspects of the administration on a central basis, rather than devo\nlve the work to taxpayers. That said, we accept that in transaction taxes, those taxpayers who are liable should expect to shoulder most of the compliance burden.\n&#xa0;\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne issue to consider under this heading is the place of digital procedures. In general we s\nupport the idea of ‘digital by default’: that in today’s environment, digital communication (e\n-\nfiling, online intelligent forms, information being available on line etc) should be the norm. But it should not be compulsory: regard must be had to the \n‘digitally excluded’. LITRG has a particular interest in this area\n. This is not solely an issue for individuals; many small businesses still rely on ‘traditional’ methods. In developing tax laws, the \nWelsh\n Government needs to have regard to how these grou\nps should be catered for. \n&#xa0;Some comments on Welsh tax proposals&#xa0;18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA substantial part of the draft Wales Bill covers taxation powers. The taxes to be devolved to the Welsh Government are as devolved to Scotland and follow from the \nSilk Commission proposals\n. The CIOT made submissions to the Silk Commission and we support the ways in which these proposals have been developed. \nWelsh rate of income tax&#xa0;\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe decision to allow the Welsh Government a single rate of income tax rather than the varied rates as sugge\nsted by the Silk report introduces the same system as in Scotland. Although this is clearly a very important matter of principle, we think the real work now has to start in terms of how the tax will actually be managed and collected. From our work over the\n Scottish rate of income tax (SRIT), we think that key issues are:\n&#xa0;\n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposals in new s116D-G of the Governance of Wales Act 2006 parallel the equivalent Scottish provisions for defining who is liable to the new tax and correctly build on the new UK S\ntatutory Residence Test. The aim has to be that the vast majority of people can easily ascertain whether they will be Welsh taxpayers (or not) and are sure of their position. Work will be needed over practical issues, such as people who travel regularly be\ntween Wales and Eng\nland for work\n. \n&#xa0;\n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere has been constructive engagement with HMRC over various technical matters relating to SRIT.\n Not all are fully resolved. Examples include tax relief for pension contributions and gift aid donations, and such matters as PAYE settlement agreements. We think it is important that rules and practices for the Welsh and Scottish rates on income tax are \nin step: it would be administratively inefficient – as well as confusing for some taxpayers and employers – if there were definitional differences\n. \n&#xa0;\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA major issue that needs to be tackled is that of communication: making sure the right messages are convey\ned to taxpayers. Taxpayers may easily have a variety of misconceptions about the implications of the new tax system. As implementation approaches, there needs to be a carefully designed programme of communication to taxpayers explaining who is affected, th\neir responsi\nbilities and the implications, \nplus of course how to get additional help and explanations. This will need proper resourcing.\n&#xa0;\n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have regularly pointed out the need to consider demands on employers (and pension providers)\n in tax changes\n. A key \nexample is the extent to which employers will need to give information about \nWelsh \ntax on payslips: the point being that plenty of time needs to be allowed for employers and software suppliers to develop necessary systems\n. \nIt needs to be borne in mind that\n it will not just be Welsh businesses that will have to operate the Welsh rate of income tax.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Devolving Stamp Duty Land Tax&#xa0;24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsideration should be given to adopting a progressive rate system\n for the successor Welsh \ntax to\n remove the market distortions c\nreated by the current \nSDLT \n‘slab’ system. In the context of the residential property market, the effect of the SDLT ‘slab’ system (under which the rate of SDLT applies to the whole consideration once a threshold is reached) is widely recognised as creating\n market distortions with bunching around the price thresholds\n and creating\n avoidance\n opportunities\n (see the case of \nOrsman\n v HMRC\n in 2012, where an allocation of just £800 to garage fittings was enough to reduce the SDLT by £5,200)\n.\n&#xa0;\n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to minimise uncertainty, particularly in the commercial property market, it is important that any inevitable uncertainty over likely future \ndesign and \nrates of \nthe new tax\n is kept to a minimum. \nThis includes the approach to anti-avoidance rules wh\nere there will need to be a balance struck between the desire to guard against avoidance and creating complex rules and uncertainty. \nDelays in doing so may lead to investment decisions being delayed or directed elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\n26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are challenging and problem\natic aspects of SDLT such as the provisions relating to leases, partnerships and trusts. In designing \nthe new tax\n, the\nre is a clear \nopportunity to consult on simplifying the complex aspects of SDLT. We think it is important that sufficient time is built in\nto the legislative timetable to allow for consultation. \n&#xa0;27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe current SDLT online return is overly complex and inflexible to change. Registers of Scotland are currently developing a simplified online Land and Buildings Transaction Tax return. The Welsh Gov\nernment may wish to consider a similar approach. Irrespective of the arrangements adopte\nd\n for collection of devolved taxes, the costs of administration, at least in the longer term, should be reduced if the Welsh Government can construct a less complex tax\n than its SDLT predecessor with a simplified online return.\n&#xa0;\nWelsh Landfill tax&#xa0;28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key aim must be to tax what is actually discarded into landfill, not simply what enters the site. The tax structure needs to encourage recycling.\nRevenue Wales and a Tax Management Bill&#xa0;29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA significant matter is how the new taxes are run: a separate tax authority or by HMRC as agent for the Welsh Government. We assume the former will be the case, thus an organisation parallel to Revenue Scotland will need to be established.\n That will take time and resource.\n&#xa0;\n30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\nre will also be a need to \ndevelop a taxes management system that can cover all the taxes likely to be devolved to \nWales\n. Ideally tax management provisions should \nbe common across all taxes, with difference only where \nthe nature of the tax requires differences.\n&#xa0;\nHow the CIOT can contribute&#xa0;31\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBoth the CIOT and LITRG operate across the UK\n with an extensive and active branch network including \nour\n South Wales Branch. \nWe employ \na number of Technical Officers \nwho coordinate \nand distil input from around 300 of our members who volunteer their time on our various technical committees\n. \nMany more of our members volunteer their time to help with Education, Branches and Professional Standards activities. \n&#xa0;\n32\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur contributions to consu\nltations and general discussions therefore draw on the knowledge and experience of both our members in practice and the in-house technical team. With LITRG we have many links to wider groups who have an interest in tax matters. \n&#xa0;\n33\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CIOT has had significa\nnt involvement with the development of the Scottish tax system and would be able to draw on that experience in contributing to the development of Welsh tax proposals. Submissions that we have made on Scottish tax proposals have regularly drawn on surveys o\nf our members in practice in Scotland. We have also used mediums such as round tables, conference sessions, webinars and articles in \nTax Adviser \nmagazine to disseminate information and discuss issues. We would be pleased to work with \nthe Welsh Government\n t\no make use of these avenues to discuss tax matters, particularly around practical implications of proposals\n. \n&#xa0;20 \nJanuary 201\n4\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/junebudget_tax_policy_making.pdf\n , published 1 June 2010; with response documents and further comments published 9 December 2010 at \nhttp://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/tax_policy_making_new_approach.htm\n .\n An e\nxample would be the changes to CGT Rates in the summer 2010 Budget. \n See \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/small-business-tax-review\n.\n \n See the LITRG report pu\nblished in May 2012 on the growing problems of ‘digital exclusion’ at \nhttp://www.litrg.org.uk/reports/2012/dig-excl\n. \n \n \n[2012] UKFTT 227 (TC)\n. \n"
