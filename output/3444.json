"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Justice Committee (SCE0011)&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe Justice Committee welcomes this opportunity to reflect on its activities over the course of the 2012-13 session and first half of the 2013-14 session. In doing so, it is mindful of \nthe Liaison Committee’s conclusion that “the primary measure of a committee’s effectiveness is the extent of its influence on government policy and its impact on the government department and its agencies”. The Justice Committee can demonstrate a high degree of success according to this measure\n. Most notably, the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee’s report into Presumption of Death were largely implemented via John Glen’s Private Members Bill, which received Royal Assent in March 2013\n; and the Director of Public Prosecutions published guidance on Joint Enterprise in December 2012, and has agreed to collect better data on such prosecutions, as per the recommendations of that inquiry\n. Further examples are detailed in the relevant sections below, which are structured as per the Liaison Committee’s request.\n&#xa0;\na. how the Committee has responded to the Liaison Committee’s best practice recommendations \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOn 12 March 2013, the Committee held a private meeting to consider how it could best respond to the Liaison Committee’s recommendations. At that meeting, Members decided that, rather than identifying and publishing an overarching set of strategic objectives, they would continue to discuss, roughly once a quarter, their short, medium and long-term work programme, and carry out a mix of reactive and pro-active inquiries. Broadly speaking, the Committee’s objectives are to undertake work (and, as appropriate follow-up work) on all the major areas of the MoJ’s responsibility over the course of the Parliament, to scrutinise the work of all the Ministry’s \nmain \nnon-departmental bodies, and to fulfil the core tasks as far as possible. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee routinely considers what it hopes to achieve from inquiries, and their likely impact on Government, through options papers and scoping notes as part of the inquiry planning process. For example, the structure of recent work on proposed reforms to legal aid and probation services was determined by considerations as to whether, when and how the Committee could add value. The Committee has not adopted the practice of agreeing a minute before the start of inquiries setting out what it hopes to achieve. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee initially agreed to use the rapporteur role for visits rather than for evidence sessions or inquiries, in the first instance. Now, as \na general rule, a maximum of four Members attend each visit. It has agreed more recently to appoint a Member to follow-up its 2012 report on joint enterprise. \n&#xa0;\nThe Committee concluded that t\nhe range and diversity of witnesses contributing to Justice Committee inquiries was about right, taking into account online \nconsultations, visits, and evidence from offenders and ex-offenders. The Committee concurs that the principles of diversity and inclusion should be taken into account in planning its programme and had previously agreed to vary its usual meeting time where it would be difficult for witnesses (for example, those who live far from London or who have caring responsibilities) to attend early morning sessions. As a result, an afternoon session was held in order to take evidence from the families of young people who had died in custody and this option has been offered to witnesses on further occasions. It has also agreed to take evidence in private in order to hear from witnesses who feel constrained from giving public evidence, for example from ex-offenders in the Women Offenders inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAt its March meeting the Committee decided not to request training in questioning skills, as it considered that a more ‘professional’ style might not be appropriate.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWitnesses are always treated with respect and courtesy and given a fair hearing.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee has not chosen to appoint formally a European rapporteur at this stage but the C\nhair has acted as a de facto\n rapporteur in attending a number of EU conferences in a representative capacity. The Committee has taken an active interest in Justice Affairs at European level, notably the block opt-out and the proposals on EU data protection. In the latter case, the Committee conducted a substantial inquiry into European Commission proposals following receipt of a request for an opinion from the European Scrutiny Committee.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee has carried out several pieces of work aimed at informing debates on legislation over the past year. Most notably, it undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of relevant provisions of the draft Children and Families Bill, and clearly influenced the content of the Bill that was subsequently laid before Parliament. It has also considered whether or not it is appropriate to trigger the enhanced scrutiny mechanism in respect of each of the Orders under the Public Bodies Act 2011 which fall under the Committee’s remit, and in the case of the Order to abolish the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, carried out such scrutiny\n (see (d) below)\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee concluded that there was no pressing need to reduce the length of Reports, which needed to reflect evidence received, but strives for its reports to be as succinct as possible. In terms of accessibility, it has set a general principle that language used in reports should not be overly-legalistic and terms and concepts that may be unfamiliar to the reader should be explained.\n \nThe Committee now follows the Liaison Committee suggestion that conclusions and recommendations are differentiated by setting out the former in bold and the latter in bold italics and aims to make it clear to whom each recommendation is addressed. In some \nreports the Committee has expressly indicated which recommendations are the most important and will aim to do this as a matter of course over the coming year. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee followed the advice of the Liaison Committee in drawing attention to the inadequacy of the Government’s response to its report on the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council when publishing that response.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAt its March meeting, the Committee agreed to undertake more regular and rigorous follow-up of its conclusions and recommendations by means of a review of each Report published from the start of session 2013-14 one year after publication; and to report such progress reviews to the House periodically. In the first instance, the Committee considered in October 2013 the impact of and potential follow-up for each of its reports from this parliament. In addition, two of its current inquiries (Crime Reduction and Crown Dependencies) were established to follow up progress made in relation to reports from the previous parliament.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee has worked well with other Committees in areas with overlapping remits, notably with Home Affairs and European Scrutiny to coordinate respective roles in relation to the JHA opt-out, and with Environmental Audit and EFRA, where the Committee sought and received subject-specific input in relation to the environmental sentencing guideline.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to reviewing departmental performance and accounts annually, as recommended by the Liaison Committee, the Committee undertook a substantial inquiry into the Budget and Structure of the MoJ, which considered relevant issues around spending and performance in more detail. \nThe Committee has continued to enjoy a fruitful relationship with the National Audit Office and the Scrutiny Unit, whose staff have provided invaluable financial expertise to inform the Committee’s work on the Departmental Annual Report, Ministry of Justice Estimates, legal aid and the court interpreting contract\n. \nThe NAO also\n undertook some research on the funding and work of women’s centres for the Women Offenders inquiry to provide the Committee with a fuller understanding of the likely impact of \nfunding changes for this\n financial year.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Youth Justice report was launched on the floor of the House in March 2013.\n Westminster Hall debates have been held on the Committee’s reports on Freedom of Information, Budget and Structure of the MoJ and the court interpreters’ contract.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nb. how the Committee has approached the revised core tasks approved by the House in January \nThe Committee has aimed to pursue a balanced work programme that accommodates all of the core tasks. \nThrough its\n inquiry work \nit has examined\n strategy (Departmental Annual Report), policy (Youth Justice, Women Offenders, Legal Aid, Crime Reduction, Older Prisoners) and expenditure and performance (\nBudget and Structure of the MoJ, \nInterpreting and Translation Services and the Applied Language Solutions Contract, Crown Dependencies and various one-off sessions examining the work of key individuals or bodies), although in practice many inquiries straddle all three areas. \nIn addition to the pre-legislative scrutiny referred to above, the Committee has carried out post-legislative scrutiny of the \nFreedom of Information Act 2000 and the \nSerious Crime Act 2007 and is considering activities in connection with the Mental Capacity Act 2005\n and the Government’s review of the system of legal services regulation brought in by the Legal Services Act 2007\n. The Committee’s European scrutiny is also detailed above. The Committee has conducted pre-appointment hearings for those appointments on the Cabinet Office list which have been made during the period under discussion.\nFinally, the Committee has ensured that its reports have been tagged on relevant business papers to inform debate in the House, for example, the delegated legislation committee considering the Order to abolish the Administrati\nve Justice and Tribunal Council and consideration of the Children and Families  Bill. \nThe Committee aims for its work to be as accessible to the public as possible; its work on legal aid and family justice in particular has generated a significant public following. \nc. any obstacles encountered \nWhile the Committee and Department have worked well together in facilitating pre-appointment hearings for those public appointments on the current list, the \nSecretary of State\n has not responded positively to requests to \napply the pre-appointment scrutiny process to\n further appointments, although it seemed to the Committee that the posts met the relevant criteria. \n&#xa0;\nThe sheer volume of policy proposals currently emanating from the Ministry of Justice, and the speed in which they are sought to be achieved, has sometimes made it challenging for the Committee to undertake worthwhile scrutiny.\n&#xa0;\nDespite raising this matter with the Department on several occasions, the Committee has continued to receive insufficient notice of Ministry of Justice statements to the House or of key publications, which has inhibited its effectiveness in scrutinising\n the Ministry’s work, although the Ministry seems to be making greater efforts to contact the Chair. \n&#xa0;\nFollowing anecdotal evidence to suggest that \ncourt staff\n were being denied an opportunity to submit formal evidence to the Committees inquiry into the court interpreting contract, the Committee set up an e-consultation specifically to allow their voices to be heard. \nThe court service then issued an edict forbidding staff to contribute. There were also allegations that the Ministry had interfered \nwith written evidence from the magistracy. As we noted in our Report, we considered that the Ministry’s actions may have constituted a contempt.\nd. any examples of innovation or good practice for others to consider\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee was the first Commons Committee to trigger the enhanced scrutiny mechanism for an Order under the Public Bodies Act 2011. Although the eventual outcome remained unchanged, pressure from the Committee (as well as others) strengthened the arrangements which have been put in place to replace the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, and for this reason the Committee considers it to have been a worthwhile exercise.\nAs a result of Committee Members’ opinion that it could discharge its function as a statutory consultee for sentencing guidelines in a more useful manner, the Committee has adopted the practice of inviting key stakeholders to participate in a seminar to debate aspects of the guideline which the consultation has indicated are particularly interesting or potentially problematic, rather than taking formal evidence from the Sentencing Council. It has now undertaken three such seminars, which have helped the Committee come to a more considered view of the guideline and therefore been better able to add value to the process. \nTogether with the European Scrutiny and Home Affairs Committee Chairs, the Chair tabled an amendment to a Government motion on the Justice and Home Affairs opt-out, to ensure that the aforementioned joint committee scrutiny was not undermined. The Committee considers that this practice of de facto “committee amendment”—which in this instance had a useful outcome—could be a useful tool.\nLike other committees, the Justice Committee now uses e-circulation, the written evidence portal and Twitter.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
