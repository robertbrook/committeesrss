&#xa0;[bold]Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]              [bold]Preamble[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The first Call for Evidence is an open call that also contains 23 specific questions.  These are largely of a technical and legal nature and either address specific aspects of the legislative process or focus on areas that are not of direct relevance to the role of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham as a local authority or to the exercising of its functions.  However, there are elements of the draft legislation that are of concern to us and our specific comments in relation to these are below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]              [bold]Comments[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1[bold]              [bold]Erection of public statues in London – Clause 19[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]There is not a substantial demand for this in Hammersmith &amp; Fulham and so this is not considered by the authority to be a major issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold]              [bold]Right to Buy – Clause 20[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council is a long-standing supporter of the Right to Buy scheme and actively lobbied Government to increase the maximum discount in London, first to £75,000 and then to £100,000.  The Council therefore supports the proposal to reduce the qualifying period from five to three years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council believes that increasing the eligibility criteria could kick-start Right to Buy and help thousands of hard-working people who could not otherwise even dream of owning a home.  Home ownership confers a sense of pride and empowerment.  However, for too long home ownership has been nothing but a pipedream for most of our tenants.  This Council has therefore long argued that, for the scheme to truly take-off in London, a £100,000 discount is needed, as well as opportunities to encourage other forms of shared ownership
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This borough has the fourth most expensive housing in the country and like the rest of the capital, needs to be treated as a special case for Right to 
[normal]Buy
[normal] to benefit a greater proportion of council tenants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are also working on a proposal to enable council tenants to purchase a share of their home. The intention is that this ‘Right to Buy Part 2’ will enable council tenants to purchase a percentage of the property below the minimum level offered as part of Social Home Buy and receive a proportionate discount.  The tenant would then pay the Council rent for the part of the home they do not own.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Right to 
[normal]Buy
[normal] receipts are spent on other affordable housing projects in the borough, such as low cost home ownership schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold]              [bold]Reduction of duties relating to energy and climate change – Clause 27[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The repeals/amendments (with out-of-date elements being removed) and changes in relation to reporting requirements are supported by this authority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4[bold]              [bold]Household waste: decriminalisation – Clause 29 and Schedule 10[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Hammersmith &amp; Fulham is one of the most densely populated local authority areas in the UK.  Section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 provides a Council with powers to serve a statutory notice on a residential occupier.  This notice provides stipulations regarding the presentation of waste receptacles.  This can cover the receptacle, receptacle positioning, timing, recycling, contamination, etc.  Once a notice has been served upon an occupier they are bound by the terms. There is a 21 day period for the person in receipt of a notice to appeal to the magistrates’ court. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Once bound by the terms of the notice, an occupier can be subject to prosecution or have liability discharged via the payment of a fixed penalty notice (FPN).  The current FPN level is £80.00 and the Council offers a £40 rate if the FPN is paid within 10 days.  The maximum fine, if found guilty in a magistrates’ court, is Level 3, which is £1,000.00.  In the view of this Council:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current process is extremely efficient and effective, viz.:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The clause and schedule in the draft Deregulation Bill will, if enacted, lengthen this process and render it almost unenforceable.  The process would become as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is used in a proportionate, justifiable and transparent way by this Council and it has led to success in improving waste presentation throughout the Borough.  It also provides a strong educational vehicle to promote correct waste presentation and reduce contamination in recycling.  Responsible use of Section 46 means all parties benefit and our objectives of cleaner streets are achieved.  These changes to Section 46 will adversely affect the ability of local authorities to tackle waste offences in a robust manner.  Accordingly this Council objects to the proposed changes to Section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5[bold]              [bold]Reducing burdens on schools – Clause 33[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The changes in the responsibility for setting school dates may lead to difficulties for parents with children in more than one school.  Hammersmith &amp; Fulham’s experience has been that schools and families welcome a local authority co-ordinated approach and will probably continue to seek this advice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6[bold]              [bold]Housing strategies – Clause 21[bold]Sustainable Community Strategy – Clause 44[bold]Local Area Agreements – Clause 45[bold]Duties to consult and involve – Clause 47[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council also supports the proposals to remove the requirements to produce the sustainable community strategy and housing strategy and the removal of the duty to consult and involve.  In September 2010, the Council suggested to central Government that it should remove the strategy requirements in a bid to free local authorities from onerous reporting requirements.  This Council has long argued that top-performing local authorities need to be given greater freedom to concentrate on delivering value for the taxpayer and providing excellent services, rather than getting bogged-down producing lengthy, technical and bureaucratic documents.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Draft Deregulation Bill briefing[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The draft Deregulation Bill was published on 1 July 2013 by Kenneth Clarke, the Minister without Portfolio, and Oliver 
[normal]Letwin
[normal], the Minister for Government Policy.  The draft Bill amends or repeals 182 different pieces of legislation, removing unnecessary burdens on three key groups: businesses, individuals and public bodies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Joint Committee on the draft Deregulation Bill, chaired by Lord Rooker, was appointed by both Houses of Parliament on 17 July to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny into the draft Deregulation Bill and the policies underpinning it.  The Joint Committee comprises six MPs and six Peers.  It will take written and oral evidence and is required to make its report to both Houses by 16 December 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Its first Call for Evidence, focusing principally on the generic provision and general questions about the draft Bill, was published on 29 July.  The deadline for responses is 16 September.  The call is attached as Annex 2 to this briefing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key relevant provisions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The key provisions of interest to local government are as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are also provisions of indirect interest to local government, such as:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]September 2013
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex 1 to this briefing considers the provisions of direct interest to local government in more detail.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex 1 – Clauses and schedules of direct interest to local government[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Rights of Way – Clauses 12 to 18 and Schedule 6[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Section 53 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”) provides for the extinguishment, immediately after 1 January 2026 (the “cut-off date”), of unrecorded rights of way created before 1949, subject to certain exceptions.  Clauses 12 to 18 of the draft Bill deal with rights of way but not all apply to Hammersmith &amp; Fulham; those that do are detailed below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 12 inserts a new section 55A into the 2000 Act.  This will protect the status of certain public rights of way by preventing modifications of the definitive map and statement after the cut-off date, even where evidence emerges that the right of way had been wrongly recorded.  It will therefore reduce the burden on local authorities that arises from having to consider in detail applications for modifications which require an investigation of historical evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 13 inserts a new section 56A in the 2000 Act. It enables the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling a local authority to designate, during a period of one year after the cut-off date, public rights of way extinguished immediately after that date under section 53 of that Act.  The purpose of the new provision is to enable local authorities to wait until after the cut-off date to assess what research has been carried out by individuals and voluntary organisations. There will be a one-year period after that date within which they can act under the regulations to prevent rights of way being permanently extinguished. They will therefore be able to avoid duplicating any work done by individuals and voluntary organisations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 14 addresses situations where public rights of way are used by individuals to gain access to their own land.  The extinguishment of such a right of way could prevent landowners from obtaining access to their land.  It inserts a new section 56B in the 2000 Act, which applies where a public right of way would be extinguished under section 53 of the 2000 Act immediately after the cut-off date.  If the exercise of such a right of way is reasonably necessary to enable a person with an interest in land to obtain access to it, a private right of way is created so that the person may continue to access the land.  The new section 56B therefore protects the person with the interest in the land from the burden of the loss of access to it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Currently, sections 118ZA and 119ZA of the 1980 Highways Act (“the 1980 Act”) allows landowners of certain types of agricultural land to apply to local authorities for extinguishment or diversion orders.  The process is cumbersome and inflexible.  Clause 15 therefore will amend the above sections of the 1980 Act to enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to allow for public rights of way over other classes of land to be extinguished or diverted.  Clause 17 will allow the Secretary of State to use the power under section 150 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to authorise charges to be imposed in respect of applications under sections 118ZA and 119ZA.  Under this power, it would be possible for the Secretary of State to authorise a charge the amount of which would be at the authority’s discretion, provided it does not exceed the actual cost incurred.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 18 introduces Schedule 6, which makes changes to the procedure for ascertaining public rights of way in England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Erection of public statues in London – Clause 19[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 19 repeals section 5 of the Public Statues (Metropolis) Act 1854 (the
[normal]“1854 Act”).
[normal]  This section requires the consent of the commissioners of works to be obtained before a public statue can be erected in a public place in the Metropolitan Police District of London.  The functions of the commissioners of works are now vested in the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.  In practice, the Secretary of State only considers an application for consent under section 5 of the 1854 Act after planning permission has been granted by the local planning authority.  The effect of the clause would be to repeal section 5 of the 1854 Act, which would remove the requirement for the consent of the Secretary of State in these circumstances.  The clause will come into force 2 months after the enactment of the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reduction of qualifying period for right to buy – Clause 20[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This clause amends Part 5 of the Housing Act 1985, which enables tenants of a local authority to exercise the right to buy their home provided they meet the eligibility criteria set out in the 1985 Act. To qualify for the right to buy tenants must currently have spent at least 5 years as public sector tenants. The clause amends section 119 of the 1985 Act to reduce the qualifying period from 5 years to 3 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The clause does not change the discounts available to tenants under the right to buy. Tenants will continue to receive a starting discount of 35% for houses and 50% for flats. The increase in the starting discount for each complete year of the 
[normal]qualification period will continue to apply only when the qualifying period exceeds 5 years.  The clause will come into force on a day to be appointed by the Secretary of State in a commencement order.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Removal of power to require preparation of housing strategies – Clause 21[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Section 87(1) of the Local Government Act 2003 (the “LGA 2003”) affords a discretionary power to the Secretary of State to require a local housing authority to have a strategy in relation to certain specified matters relating to housing.  Clause 21 removes this power as it has never been exercised, and there is no intention for it to be exercised in the future.  The clause will come into force 2 months after the enactment of the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reduction of burdens relating to the use of roads – Clause 23 and Schedule 8[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 23 introduces Schedule 8, which makes changes to the regulation of the use of roads.  In the Traffic Management Act 2004, Chapter 18 of Part 3 introduced the ability for local highway authorities to develop permit schemes.  Before such permit schemes can be brought into operation, currently they must be submitted to the Secretary of State for approval.  The government has decided that there is no longer a need for the Secretary of State to approve future permit schemes, and this requirement will cease by 2015.  Instead permit schemes are to be approved by council order.  However, the Secretary of State will retain powers to make regulations with respect to permit schemes, including the power to make regulations covering the fee structure for permits.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The schedule also removes a requirement in section 23 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 that the Secretary of State is informed in writing before certain pedestrian crossings are established or removed.  This repeal will mean local traffic authorities will no longer need to notify the Secretary of State if they wish to install or remove a zebra, pelican or puffin crossing.  This repeal will come into force 2 months after the enactment of the Bill.  The remainder of the clause and schedule will come into force on a day to be appointed by the Secretary of State in a commencement order.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reduction of duties relating to energy and climate change – Clause 27[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This clause repeals certain sections of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”) which require the Secretary of State to publish reports and targets and to take certain other steps relating to energy matters.  Section 3 of the 2006 Act requires local authorities to have regard to any energy measures reports published by the Secretary of State under that section when exercising their functions.  The government considers that this section is no longer required as the only report thus far was published in 2007 and is now out of date.  The government does not intend to produce another report under section 3 as it considers that section 19(1A) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and informal arrangements between government and local authorities enable the relevant objectives to be pursued in other ways.  The clause will come into force 2 months after the enactment of the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Household waste: decriminalisation – Clause 29 and Schedule 10[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (the “EPA”) a waste collection authority may by notice require occupiers of premises to present their household waste for collection in a specified way.  Failure without reasonable excuse to comply with such a requirement is an offence under section 46(6) of the EPA.  Under section 47ZA, a fixed penalty may be offered as an alternative to prosecution.  This clause amends the EPA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The clause inserts new sections 46A to 46D into the EPA to provide for waste collection authorities in England to issue a fixed monetary penalty for any such failure to comply.  By replacing a criminal offence with a civil penalty, this clause reduces a burden on householders in England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Schedule 10 makes amendments to the London Local Authorities Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”) that 
[normal]are
[normal] based on new sections 46A to 46C of the EPA.  This is so as to ensure consistency of approach.  Civil penalty charge procedures were introduced in the 2007 Act for a number of areas, including those related to household waste collection.  The 2007 Act provides for its own system of penalty notices relating to the presentation for collection of household waste, and there are differences from the system set out in the EPA, e.g. requirements as to the placing of household waste for collection may be made by London borough councils in regulations rather than by individual notices (although nothing in that Act prevents the ability of a borough council to serve notices under section 46 of the EPA).  There is no criminal offence for a failure to comply with a requirement made in regulations; instead, a penalty charge is payable.  The system of appeals is also different.  Whilst making some consequential changes to the appeal procedure, the amendments made by this section do not alter the existing right of appeal or the tribunal determining the appeal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The schedule will come into force on a day to be appointed by the Secretary of State in a commencement order.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Schools: reduction of burdens – Clause 33 and Schedule 14[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This clause repeals the Secretary of State’s power, through regulations, to require local authorities in England to set annual targets in respect of the educational performance of pupils at schools maintained by them.  Schedule 14 moves all responsibility for determining term dates in community, voluntary controlled and community special schools and maintained nursery schools from the local authority to the governing body.  The governing body of all such maintained schools will be responsible for determining their school’s term and holiday dates each year.  The clause and schedule will come into force on a day to be appointed by the Secretary of State in a commencement order.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Repeal of duty to prepare sustainable community strategy – Clause 44[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This clause repeals section 4 of the Local Government Act 2000.  The effect of these provisions is to remove the duty for local authorities to prepare a Sustainable Community Strategy and the linked duty to, when preparing or modifying their Sustainable Community Strategy, consult with and seek the participation of their 
[normal]partner authorities and such other persons as they consider appropriate.  The clause will come into force 2 months after the enactment of the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Repeal of duties relating to local area agreements – Clause 45[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This clause repeals legislation relating to Local Area Agreements (“LAAs”).  The decision to “decentralise” existing LAAs and not to require LAAs in future years was announced on 13 October 2010.  As there are no longer any LAAs in local areas, Chapter 1 of Part 5 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 will also be amended.  The clause will come into force 2 months after the enactment of the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Repeal of duties relating to consultation or involvement – Clause 47[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 47(1) and (2) repeals section 3A of the Local Government Act 1999 so as to remove the duty for best value authorities to involve local representatives in the exercise of any of their functions, where they consider it is appropriate to do so. The intention to repeal this duty was announced in April 2011, on the basis that local authorities should be trusted to engage with local people without a duty being imposed on them to do so.  The clause will come into force 2 months after the enactment of the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex 2 – Clauses and schedules of direct interest to local government[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Joint Committee on the draft Deregulation Bill, chaired by Lord Rooker, was appointed by both Houses of Parliament on 17 July to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny into the draft Deregulation Bill and the policies underpinning it.  The Joint Committee comprises six MPs and six Peers.  It will take written and oral evidence and is required to make its report to both Houses by 16 December 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Its first Call for Evidence, focusing principally on the generic provision and general questions about the draft Bill, was published on 29 July.  The deadline for responses is 16 September.  This is an open Call for Evidence on any issues about the draft Bill.  Questions are provided below on the issues the Committee has initially identified as interesting but further, more specific, Calls may be published later as other lines of enquiry emerge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Questions [bold]General [bold]1. The draft Bill covers a broad range of specific activities and a large amount of legislative provision is amended by it. Could the same result have been achieved using existing secondary legislative procedures? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of including specific deregulatory provisions amending existing legislation and providing additional or amended order making powers within primary legislation rather than considering them through existing deregulatory mechanisms? 
[normal]3. Are the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Will the draft Bill generally benefit businesses by offsetting other regulatory burdens? Are there indirect impacts on other businesses from reducing regulation in specific sectors? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. How does the provision in the draft Bill affect: 
[normal]i
[normal]. protections afforded to individuals under human rights and equalities legislation? 
[normal]ii. 
[normal]employment
[normal] law, skills and the labour market? 
[normal]iii. 
[normal]the
[normal] environment, particularly in the management of waste? 
[normal]iv. 
[normal]the
[normal] provision of education? 
[normal]v
[normal]. the effective administration of justice? 
[normal]vi. 
[normal]social
[normal] wellbeing or health inequalities? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Have the measures set out in the draft Bill been subject to adequate cost-benefit analysis on the basis of consultation with those affected? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. Will any or all of the proposals have any significant economic or financial impact? Do you have any evidence of the impact that will aid the Committee in their scrutiny? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Power to [bold]disapply[bold] legislation no longer of practical use [bold]10. Is a new “power to 
[normal]disapply
[normal] legislation no longer of practical use” necessary or are there existing procedures which could be used to achieve the same effect?” 
[normal](Clause 51)?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. Is the 
[normal]meaning of the phrase “no longer of practical use” clear
[normal]? In this context, what is meant by “practical”? 
[normal]Should it be defined and, if so, how?
[normal] Will removing any of the provision proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill have implications for any other areas of regulation? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. Are the safeguards regarding the use of the “no longer of practical use” power (set out in Clauses 54 to 56) adequate and appropriate? 
[normal]13. Other deregulatory mechanisms such as Legislative Reform Orders or Public Bodies Orders have specific tests set out in the parent Act - should there be similar tests set out in the draft Bill? What should they be? 
[normal]14. Are the mechanisms set out for parliamentary oversight (Clauses 55 and 56) of deregulation orders adequate and appropriate? 
[normal]15. Are there other changes to deregulatory powers, procedures and parliamentary oversight which you think should have been included in the Bill and, if so, why? 
[normal]16. What are the risks associated with the proposed new power to 
[normal]disapply
[normal] legislation that is “no longer of practical use”? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth [bold]17. To what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. Will the introduction of a duty to have 
[normal]regard
[normal] to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19. How is a duty to have regard to the desirability of economic growth likely to affect those regulators to which it is applied? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20. Where is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21. How might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22. How can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Devolution [bold]23. What are the consequences of the draft Bill for the devolved administrations? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]
