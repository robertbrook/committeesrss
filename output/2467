default&#xa0;defaultCase A -  defaultFamily Y defaultv Home Office defaultA family with
default two young children
default were detained
default for
default 
defaulttwo
default 
defaultperiods
default 
defaultat
default 
defaultYarl’s
default 
defaultWood IRC in April 2009 for 
default11
default 
defaultdays
default 
defaultand September 2009 for 15
default 
defaultdays. The adults are 
defaultforeign 
defaultnationals who met in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultThe
defaulty
default were 
defaultseeking leave to remain on the basis of Article 8 and/or the Imm
defaultigration Rules and 
defaultwould not, therefore, qualify under any exception to the residence test.  
default&#xa0;
defaultOn t
defaultwo separate occasions the parent
defaults
default’
default immigration applications were refused unbeknown to them and certified, thereby precluding any in country right of appeal.
default On both occasions, without notice and in breach of policy, dawn raids were conducted on the family home. They were told to pack their
default belongings for removal and taken with their children in a caged prison-like van to for detention in 
defaultYarl’s
default Wood Immigration Reception Centre. The children vomited in the van. The second enforcement action took place despite compliance with release conditi
defaultons.
default&#xa0;
defaultRemoval
default 
defaultwas halted by a judicial review, which was ulti
defaultmately settled by consent with the
default 
defaultgrant of 
defaultan in country right of appeal. 
defaultT
defaulthe family 
defaultwas finally released following an 
defaultopposed application for bail
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA claim was brought for
default false imprisonment 
defaultas well as b
defaultreaches of human 
defaultrights including Articles 3, 5 and 8
default ECHR
default. 
defaultIt settled with
default 
defaultsignificant sum
defaults
default 
defaultfor all Claimants for both detentions. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCase B - defaultImmigration detention of seriously ill woman for 17 monthsdefault&#xa0;defaultKB is a 51 year old woman, apprehended at a 
defaultUK
default airport and sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment for drug
default importation. In prison she suffered a stroke leading to paralysis of the right side as a result of which she has permanently limited mobility, eventually able to walk slowly with a stick and paralysis of the right arm. She also suffers a range of other se
defaultrious medical conditions and is dependent upon a strict medical regime for her survival.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the conclusion of her criminal sentence the 
defaultUK
default Border Agency detained KB for deportation despite medical evidence from her treating hospital doctor that she was un
defaultfit to fly. UKBA spent over a year obtaining its own medical evidence on fitness to travel which eventually confirmed the earlier stated position.
default&#xa0;
defaultKB spent almost one and a half years in immigration detention at 
defaultYarl’s
default Wood Immigration R
defaulteception Centre. 
defaultShe alleges
default a false imprisonment and a breach of article 5 ECHR given the lack of any imminent removal and the fact that she did not present a risk of re-of
defaultfending or absconding due to
default her medical condition.
default&#xa0;
defaultKB would fall foul of the residence test, havin
defaultg no leave to be in the 
defaultUK
default at any time. 
default&#xa0;defaultCase C - defaultDetention due to difficulties in obtaining travel documentationdefaultMr D
default 
defaultis not
default lawfu
defaultlly resident
default in t
defaulthe 
defaultUK
default and does not
default object to returning to his country of origin. However, there have been significant difficulties in obtaining travel documentation from the relevant High Commission, rendering his return impossible to date. He is effectively stuck. There is a dispute betwe
defaulten the parties as to the level of Mr D’s co 
default-
defaultoperation with the re-documentation process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHis arrest took place when he went to report to the Home Office pursuant to the conditions of his temporary admission, with which he had been complying for a signif
defaulticant period. 
defaultHe was 
defaultthen 
defaultdetained under immigration powers
default pending his deportation for a total of 
default2.5 yearsdefault. He was 
defaultreleased following
default an application for bail which was opposed.

default detained at HMP Holloway for two and a half years pending extradition to the 
defaultUS
default after being stopped in transit at a 
defaultUK
default airport.
default 
defaultShe
default would fall foul of the residence test, having no leave to be in the 
defaultUK
default at any time. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJS suffered on-going sexual 
defaultharassment over many months by two male members of staff. The men exposed themselves
default to her and demanded oral sex, 
defaultordered her to undress in her cell and grabbed at her genitals when she came out of the showers. She was also subject to repeated obscene ver
defaultbal sexual harassment during this period on frequent occasions.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen JS finally reported the events
default internal prison investigations found no case to answer in respect of one officer.
default The second member of staff faced an internal disciplinary hearing over a 
defaultyear later. The allegat
defaultions of JS were found unproven and 
defaultJS was not informed of the outcome of the hearing for five months.
default&#xa0;
defaultJS issued proceedings for b
defaultreaches of the Human Rights Act (articles 3 and 8 ECHR),
default breaches of the investigative duty on the part
default of the prison in the way in which her complaints were handled. 
defaultS
defaulthe
default also
default claimed sex discrimination under article 14 ECHR and under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 as well as race discrimination due to her treatment being the result of stereotyping of her 
defaultas a Thai woman being a prostitute/ promiscuous. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA settlement of the civil claim was reached at £30,000
default 
defaultwhich included 
defaulta series of steps to be taken by the prison as 
defaulta result of the lessons learnt, requiring 
defaultthe prison authorities to re-examine the way i
defaultn which very serious misconduct had been handled.
default&#xa0;
defaultCase E - defaultForeign national mother in prisondefault&#xa0;
defaultBB was a foreign national who gave birth to a baby with disabilities while on remand.  She spoke no English. After her sentence she was informed that the baby would be removed as they did not know if she would be allowed to remain with her baby when she 
defaultwa
defaults eventually returned to 
defaultSpain
default.  After taking legal advice it was possible to establish that the Spanish authorities would accept her home to serve her sentence and would allow her to remain with her baby.  The decision was reversed.  Aside from the human 
defaultcosts of an unnecessary separation of mother and child, the cost to the public purse would have been enormous.
default BB would have fallen foul of the residence test because, although an EU citizen, she was not present in the 
defaultUK
default 
defaultas a result of 
defaultexercising EU right
defaults and had no other 
defaultright of residence.
default&#xa0;
defaultCase F - defaultUnlawful arrest and police cautiondefaultKA is a 29 year old man from 
defaultBangladesh
default with no previous convictions, cautions or arrests
default. 
defaultKA had been living in the 
defaultUK
default on a spouse visa for less than 12 months
default. His relationship broke down leaving him without leave in the 
defaultUK
default and
default he
default would therefore have fallen foul of the residence test.
default&#xa0;
defaultKA suffered an assault and attended a police station to report this. Instead of his allegation being dealt with KA was arreste
defaultd on the basis that his assailant had attended the station a few hours previously and made an allegation of assault against him. 
default&#xa0;
defaultKA consistently denied committing an assault. Officers told him that if he admitted it he could go home but if he did not he 
defaultwould have to stay in custody for two to three months. KA signed a document which he later discovered had been a consent to a police caution.
default&#xa0;
defaultKA successfully challenged the lawfulness of the caution by way of judicial review proceedings. As a result of hi
defaults complaint the officers were disciplined and issued
default 
defaultwith
default 
defaultwritten
default 
defaultwarnings for unprofessional 
defaultbehaviour
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe police communicated incorrect information about the caution to the 
defaultUK
default Border Agency, seriously 
defaultjeopardising
default KA’s application for indefinite leave
default to remain. Upon KA’s challenge the information was rectified.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe claim settled for £20,000 plus an apology. KA was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase G - defaultDeath in custody defaultWW was a 32-year old man from the 
defaultRepublic
default of 
defaultIreland
default. He ha
defaultd a history of drug, alcohol and mental health problems, including self harming. WW was arrested in 
defaultLondon
default and remanded in custody pending extradition to the 
defaultRepublic
default of 
defaultIreland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn arrival at HMP Brixton, WW was displaying signs of alcohol / drug withdra
defaultwal and referred by a doctor for a mental health assessment which never took place. During five weeks’ detention WW was never seen by a member of the mental health outreach team, despite two referrals being made, nor by the substance misuse team. When he r
defaulteported that he would rather be extradited dead than alive he was made subject to self harm procedures which were withdrawn within 24 hours and he was found hanging the following morning.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn inquest jury found that WW hanged himself whilst the balance of 
defaulthis mind was disturbed and that his death was contributed to by neglect.
default&#xa0;
defaultWW’s family were citizens of the 
defaultRepublic
default of 
defaultIreland
default and therefore not lawfully resident in the 
defaultUK
default. A claim was brought under the Human Rights Act for breach of article 2 ECHR, the 
defaultright to life, which was settled for £15,000.

defaultUK

default 
defaultto
default 
defaulther
default 
defaultteachers
default 
defaultand local Social
default 
defaultServices who sent a social worker to speak to AS but took no further steps to investigate the abuse. In 2012 AS reported the abuse 
defaultto the police who closed the investigation a week later. AS claims violation of her rights pursuant to Articles 3 and 4 ECHR, on the basis that the police and social services have failed to protect her from inhuman and degrading treatment and from being he
defaultld in servitude.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn September 2012 the Home Office decided that there were reasonable grounds to believe that AS was a victim of trafficking. She then began a claim for asylum. She has a strong connection with the 
defaultUK
default by virtue of being a victim of abuse i
defaultn the 
defaultUK
default over a five-year period. Nevertheless AS would appear to fall foul of the residence test because the reasonable grounds decision was not made until after the commencement of her civil claim and her claim for asylum was brought after that decision.
default Had the civil claim been postponed until after the decision the limitation period under the Human Rights Act would have expired.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default27 September 2013
default 
defaultThese detentions occurred prior to the coalition government’s change in policy in 2010 (which reduced but did not end the detention of children under immigration powers).
default A wealth of material regarding the harm caused to children by these practices is available in the public domain. It includes reports such as ‘State Sponsored Cruelty’ by Medical Justice in 2010 which records, inter alia, children experiencing the use of 
defaultforce themselves, children witnessing the self-harm and suicide attempts of others, witnessing their parents’ mental health deteriorate and suffering deterioration in their own physical and mental health. See also Royal

default In the event, the Claimants

default may have fallen within the residence test exceptions (although this is not entirely clear).
default 
defaultMr Justice Collins gran
defaultted the injunction
default in 
defaultfavour
default of the claimants with the following comments
default: ‘I hope that the defendant 
defaultwill 
defaultrecognise
