"Written evidence submitted by Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science (FSS016)&#xa0;Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science’\n mission is to conduct influential interdisciplinary research on forensic science theory and practice in order to improve its contribution to criminal justice and the safeguarding of human rights. Its membership consists of \nfive\n members of academic staff including Professors of sociology and\n forensic science, and practitioners who contribute over fifty year\ns’ \nprofessional experience to the Centre\n’s activities\n. It hosts four full-time postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers, and is supported by Leverhulme Trust, EU Framework 7 and other international research grants and contracts.\nThe following comments are offered in response to the request for written evidence. They represent the views of the Centre’s members and are not necessarily those of our employer.\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe present Government’s measures for forensic science look like an \nad hoc\n \nreaction\n \nto\n \nthe\n decision to close the Forensic Science Service\n (FSS)\n \nmade \non\n the basis of\n external drivers. This is not a strategy.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe issues of research and development, and support for criminal justice are complex.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n \nFSS\n enjoyed a\n substantial capital and recurrent expenditure budget for research, \nunderpinning its \noutput\n—as measured by publications in peer reviewed international scientific journals, for\n example. \nThe FSS research budget and facilities would have impressed the science faculties of many research Universities, and it needs to be asked whether the FSS delivered value for money in research—by comparison with a large science department in a research University, for example. \n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn any event, however, government funding has essentially evaporated and focused research on this scale has ceased. In its place, it is proposed that \nthe Research Councils (RCUK) and Technology Strategy Board (TSB) fill the vacuum. RCUK, however, have a very disappointing track record whe\nre\n forensic scie\nnce funding is concerned and it would be naïve to assume this situation will improve significantly. The TSB route may favour near-to-market activities, but\n not more innovative ones and\n is also yet to be proven.\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupport for criminal justice presently relies on an evidently unstable commercial market and\n newly-expanded\n police forensic science \nlaboratory activities\n.\n While it is easy to attribute \nthe \nerrors in\n some recent cases—\nthe Gareth Williams and Adam Scott cases\n, for example—\nto fundamental\nly\n \nflawed standards and regulation\n, the\ny\n \nmay be\n a\n \nmore \nsuperficial\n consequence of ‘bedding in’ a new structure\n—\nindefensible though they may be\n.\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe subsuming of forensic science back into the police service represents a fundamental risk to the justice system. While the FSS derived its income overwhelmingly from prosecution or police work, it was at least a nominal step away from the investigation and hence had a measure of independence, albeit a small one.\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe police laboratories handling forensic work prior to the establishment of the FSS were considered too close to investigations and prosecuting authorities. Indeed, o\nne of the reasons the FSS was established was because police laboratories were seen as potential or real causes of wrongful convictions. In this respect, the current measures are a dangerous step back to the days of the Guildford Four, Birmingham Six, Judith Ward and other all too numerous cases of miscarriages of justice.\n1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA further substantial threat to the justice system is an overall reduction in the frequency of analysis of physical evidence\n. This may tend to favour the prosecution, \nbecause\n it is the result of cost-based measures amounting to a disincentive to search for further evidence which may have the power to exonerate an innocent suspect\n.\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAny answer to this question must be largely subjective as it depends on what is meant by ‘smoothly’ and ‘within budget’. \nInadequate investigation of physical evidence in criminal investigation and miscarriages of justice\n whether\n \npotential or real \nare clearly unacceptable, but given such radical restructuring undertaken in the context of a global economic downturn it might be argued that\n the transition\n—although not without substantial problems—has been relatively smooth as far as the justice system is concerned, and not as disastrous as \nmany\n may have predicted. \nWas there\n ever\n a budget for closure?\n The cost of closure may presently exceed the losses the FSS had \npersistently \nsustained\n, but a more realistic and pragmatic measure of financial probity may be whether forensic science is delivered reliably\n,\n efficiently, and \ncost-\neffective\nly\n in the medium term. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Gareth Williams and Adam Scott cases offer evidence that the restructuring of the market has affected the justice system and standards. Equally, however, it may be noted that the FSS also made rather inexcusable errors from time to time and the current difficulties may be more superficial than fundamental.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe restructuring has led to a cost-burden for staff training and retraining, as well as development of new research.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe present structure of the Forensic Science Regulator’s Office is fundamental to the on-going problems in the forensic science sector. It lacks independence from the police, affecting both the financial viability of the commercial market\n (see (5))\n and the judicial impartiality of forensic science service delivery—in particular, via the retrograde step of the reintroduction of poli\nce laboratories (see (6)) and an overall reduction in testing (see (1)).\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\narket regulation\n,\n and standards and accreditation functions should be separate, and \nentirely independent of the Home Office.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\narket regulation activities should\n follow the model of other regulatory bodie\ns such as OFWAT, OFTEL or OFCOM and \nbe responsible for:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.3.1.\n \nLicencing forensic science service providers\n4.3.2.\n \nBalancing costs to the taxpayer against the need to have a viable market\n4.3.3.\n \nEncouraging investment\n, research\n and innovation\n4.3.4.\n \nEncouraging competition where it benefits the taxpayer and the justice system\n4.3.5.\n \nBalancing the interests of the Home Office against the interests of the provider\n4.3.6.\n \nEnsuring the market works in the interests of justice and the rule of law\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegulation accreditation of forensic science practices should be conducted by another independent body that might be likened to the Drinking Water Inspectorate and might be called the Forensic Science Inspectorate. It is important that this body has the authority to be proactive in ensuring ethical and effective use of forensic science technology and procedures.\n              \n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForensic science standards and proficiency testing should be the responsibility a third body. It might be subsumed within the wider\n activities of a\n scientific standards and proficiency testing\n body similar, for \nexample, to the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is part of the US Department of Commerce.\n Presently LGC, a commercial company, undertakes many such activities in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe body responsible market regulation might be called OFFOR. \nOFFOR would hear representation from the Home Office / Police, the forensic science service providers, and the Forensic Science Inspectorate (who would in turn ensure providers meet independent scientific and proficiency standards).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe estimate the\n \ne\nxternal forensic market \n(\ni\n.\ne\n.\n work done by non-police forensic suppliers\n)\n was running at about £170 million per annum until about 2010.  The market \nthen \nshrank rapidly\n. \nACPO were suggesting \na\n likely\n \nexternal market of £110 million \nin the years following\n FSS closure\n.  \nWe\n suggest that the curr\nent market is\n a lot\n smaller than this—\npossibly around £\n60\n million. \nThe\n Home Office tendering mechanism \npushes\n providers to be even more competitive\n on price and it is questionable\n whether the provision of forensic science to the UK is financially viable\n under Home Office policy\n.  \nWhile\n police provision \nmay appear\n cheaper\n, substantial costs—for buildings, utilities, management and capital costs—may be hidden, and ACPO appears to be unable to cost these expenses, which will be considerable.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe closure of the FSS and unpredictability of the outcome of tenders for regional contracts have badly affected financial viability and \nstaff complements—cycles of recruitment and redundancy—\nof forensic science providers.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe present procurement structure favours driving down police costs at the expense of stability, investment, innovation and judicial probity. This may risk favouring internal institutional agendas over the rule of law. The structure \ncould \nbe\n better\n organized\n, such as\n according to the model outlined in (4) above, for example\n, or some other viable model\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe closure of the FSS has dispersed its staff. Many former FSS forensic scientists find themselves in employment with the commercial forensic science providers and in the newly-expanded police laboratories\n, only to find themselves subject to further retrenchments. O\nthers have collaborated to establish bureaux services\n and a very\n small number have joined the University sector\n. M\nany have left the profession altogether.\n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgain, the question invites a subjective response. What exactly is meant by ‘a loss of intellectual wealth’? Undoubtedly, many experienced forensic scientists have left the profession, but not all of them, and although somewhat diminished a wealth of knowledge—it might be argued—remains in the system.\n The ‘institutional’ knowledge of the FSS is undoubtedly lost.\n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne place known to develop, nurture and disseminate knowledge is the University. The FSS might have taken a more constructive role in fostering forensic science as peer science in the academy in order that a ‘wealth of knowledge’ might have been developed and sustained more widely\n in the first place\n.\n In future, better integration of the policing, commercial and academic research is necessary, and an academic sector could provide expertise independent of the commercial market as and when required.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe overall arrangements are quite unsatisfactory. Piecemeal storage of evidence in the FSS archive and in the archives of individual police services \nmay\n lead to \nphysical\n deterioration, mix-ups and loss. The uncertainty regarding the organisation of the forensic science market and the structure of police services and police laboratories indicates on-going archiving of evidence should be insulated from inevitable further changes and restructuring. There is a propensity for evidence to ‘go missing’ in investigations of police malpractic\ne.\n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is essential that physical evidence is archived centrally, securely and independently. Such measures are also essential for proper investigation of cold cases, use of as yet unanticipated new technologies, and potential developments in national or international legal frameworks.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
