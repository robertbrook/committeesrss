It is the largest learned microbiological society in Europe with a worldwide membership based in universities, indust\nry, hospitals, research institutes and schools. The SGM publishes key academic journals in microbiology and virology, organises international scientific conferences and provides an international forum for communication among microbiologists and supports th\neir professional development. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, through a comprehensive framework of communication activ\nities and resources.\n \nFurther information about SGM is provided in Appendix 1.\n&#xa0;\n3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverview of microbiology R&amp;D4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK’s R&amp;D landscape in microbiology 4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMicrobiology’s \nUK-wide \nreach\n \nMicrobiological \nresearch is UK-wide.\n \nThe Google Map \non the left\n gives a \nsnapshot\n of \nwhere \nm\nicrobiology research \noccurs \n(r\ned is for universities, \ngreen\n for public sector \nresearch establishments\n, and \nblue\n for\n \ncompanies\n). T\nhe map i\ns\n \nbest viewed \non\nline\n.\n&#xa0;\nUniversities strong in microbiology are distributed throughout the country (see section 4.2). \nLooking at the private sector, \nfirms\n conducting microbiology R&amp;D\n are also found throughout the UK: some are associated with former ICI or Big Pharma sites, such as Billingham in County Durham or Alderley \nEdge\n in Cheshire; others co-locate with universities; others still locate in scienc\ne par\nks, or strike out on their own.\n&#xa0;\nIn July, the Sheffield-based vaccine discovery start-up\n Absynth received £850k funding from \nFusion IP\n, The North West Fund\n (European Union-backed), and the\n Technology Strategy Board\n.\n \nIn the chemicals and fuels sector, large enterprises with microbiology activities are based in \nTeesside\n;\n and microbiology-based \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (\nSMEs\n)\n in Oxford, Guildford, Hertfordshire, Edinburgh, inter alia.  Increasingly\n,\n traditional\n chemical companies (e.g\n.,\n \nINEOS\n at\n \nGrangemouth\n) are becoming interest\ned\n in the applications of Synthetic Biology to create “microbiological factories”\n \n(see section 4.4)\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere is a real possibility of \ngrowing \nsignificant research, development, and produc\ntion processes across the country, with clear translation of benefits to the economy, environment, and public health.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nicrobiology\n’s vitality \nin the universities\nWe\n live in\n \nexhilarating\n times\n, in terms of research and innovation\n in microbiology. \nGenomics, the metagenome, the microbiome, microbial ecology, synthetic biology\n, \nindustrial biocatalysis, fermentation technology, biochemical engineering \nand new developments in\n \nbioinformatics, all imply a range of opportunities that have emerged from micr\nobiological research\n in universities\n, or \nare \nhaving significant impacts upon \nthe\n productivity and inventiveness\n of university research\n.\n These present opportunities to tackle\n \nwider problems such as climate change, biofuels\n and chemicals\n, food and water secu\nrity, infectious disease, \nand \nantibiotic resistance\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe universities \nhave particular\n \nstrengths\n for effective R&amp;D\n, notably\n:\n&#xa0;\n4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEmerging \nopportunities to\n fight infectious disease\nM\nicrobiology research\n concerned \nwith \n‘\nanti-infective\ns\n’\n technology (to detect\n, prevent, and treat \ninfectious disease)\n is an emerging source of private sector innovation\n. \nThere are critical \ndevelopment\ns across three areas, namely\n (\n1\n) \nantimicrobial drugs aimed at bacterial and fungal \ninfections (particularly vital due to the rise of antibiotic resistance\n in bacteria\n)\n; \n(\n2\n) \ndiagnostic devices\n; and (\n3\n) vaccines\n.\n Collectively, these measures have the potential to solve infectious disease\ns, such as \nthose in the\n globally-important\n aged care \nsector (e.g., \nhospital-acquired infections\n)\n, and also represent significant opportunities in the global healthcare\n market\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nChief Medical Officer\n has drawn attention to the problem of antibiotic resistance. \nWe\n \nwelcome \nwider\n \ng\novernment\n \nmoves\n on this top\nic\n, \nsuch as\n recent\n \ninvestments \nmade by\n the Technology Strategy Board \n(\nvia the Biomedical Catalyst\n)\n,\n and\n the Ministry of Defence\n.\n There is significant potential in\n \nan emerging commercial sector: o\nur own survey indicates that there are now at least 20\n small\n firms across the \nUK actively\n involved in research \non antimicrobial resistance\n (see the Microbiology Research Map, online\n)\n.\n These firms deploy a range of different approaches, from \ninvestigation \nof natural products, to development of vaccines, and other m\nethods.\n \nDiverse approaches represent a richness of endeavour.\n&#xa0;\nBut f\nurther commitment is critical \nif we want \ntake-off for \na wider range of measures including antimicrobial therapies, diagnostic devices, and vaccines (\nas is \nsupport for \nskilled\n, \nmotivated, i\nmaginat\nive and well-trained scientists\n in this field\n)\n.\n \nD\nifferent, but complementary, approaches\n \nc\nould usefully be \ndriven forward\n \nby\n a\n new\n \nCatalyst Fund \nfocus\ned\n on \nAnti\n-infective\ns\n \nT\nechnology\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nB\niotechnology in the green economy\n – opportunities, and challenges\nIt is estimated that over 30,000 different chemicals are now in commercial use. \nU\nnstable oil prices – and emerging green technologies – are prompting a transition\n from oil-based chemistry\n towards alternative, renewable starting materials. \nFirms involved range from the very large\n, \nto SMEs.\n Microbiological research \nplays\n a pivotal role, as the yet-to-be-developed production processes depend on bacteria and fungi to convert sugars into useful\n chemicals.\n&#xa0;\nThere are \ntwo\n interrelated aspects to government support \nfor science in this\n \narea\n. \nThe first concerns research and development to establish viable production processes\n using pre-existing knowledge (\nknowledge \ntranslation)\n; good progress is bein\ng made here\n. \nThe \nsecond\n concerns basic research on \nthe \nmicrobi\nal\n physiology\n \nneeded to \noperate\n these processes\n on an industrial scale\n; \nin this area\n there is\n significant\n weakness.\n&#xa0;\nG\novernment\n support\n \nfor knowledge translation \nhas helped the UK into\n the\n top \nfive\n of \nEU\n countries for commercialisation of research in this \nfield\n.\n \nG\novernment \nrecently expanded its backing\n for applied research\n \nthrough the\n \nBiological Sciences and\n Biotechnology Research Council (BBSRC)/Technology Strategy Board (TSB)-funded Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst\n.\n \nThis scheme, which launches in 2014, should be encouraged.\n \n&#xa0;\nOn the second aspect, however, there appears to be less progress\n. \nOne significan\nt scientific issue for R&amp;D expenditure is scaling-up production. When moved to large scale – as is needed for industry – useful end products kill the micro-organisms producing them. Yields are therefore too low. \nW\ne are yet to develop an ‘off-the shelf’ ind\nustrial biotechnology.\n&#xa0;\nAs noted in a policy research paper from NESTA – and widely acknowledged elsewhere – creative solutions will emerge from greater collaboration between chemical engineering \nand\n microbiology.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Engineering and Physical Sciences R\nesearch Council (EPSRC) supports\n relevant\n research but the funding is targeted at the engineering\n side\n. The BBSRC is the major Research Council \nof relevance\n to the microbiological \nside\n; BBSRC funding\n for ‘industrial biotechnology and bioenergy’ amounts to \n£26.2\nm in 2012/13, but this is split between 18 often eclectic areas ranging from tissue engineering to biomass crops.\n The \nfocus\n \nis therefore\n diffuse\n,\n with \nrelatively little opportunity for \nthe \nscientific\n \ncommittees\n that allocate\n research\n \nfunds\n to ma\nke \nmajor investment in one area.\n&#xa0;\nThere is, as a consequence, a huge funding gap for applied microbiological research in technology readiness levels 1-4 (discovery, research\n,\n and proof of concept)\n for key areas of\n basic science underlying\n industrial biotechno\nlogy\n.\n \n \nThe BBSRC \nNetworks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy (NIBB)\n \nwill \nusefully \nlink together interested researchers for the purpose of knowledge exchange\n, but \nthey are not\n \na\n research\n funding mechanism\n.\n \nIt would therefore be worth examin\ning\n the \nvalue of a ring-fenced \nfunding\n pathway for synthetic biology, targeted at microbial physiology for \nindustrial application. This could go some way to supply the\n research needed\n in terms of scaling-up production processes.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe importance of Public Sector Re\nsearch Establishments\n (PRSEs)\nWe \nlooked at\n the Chief Scientific Advisor\n (CSO)\n’s recent list of PSREs\n \nto determine where microbiological research \nconcentrates\n.\n \nThe CSO does not make the conventional distinction between ‘PSREs’ (taken to mean institutions d\nirectly under a ministerial department), and ‘research institutes’ (government-funded, but held at arm’s length through the Research Councils). \n&#xa0;\nIn our analysis, there\n are a total of about 30 research establishments\n and research institutes\n with significant microbiological interests\n (see map\n;\n detailed\n list available on request from \nthe Society for General Microbiology\n)\n. The majority\n are located in England\n; o\nne is \nin\n Northern Ireland\n (not included on the CSO’s list)\n; and two in Scotland\n.\n&#xa0;\nT\nh\ne\nse\n institutions\n \ncover the gamut of microbiological research, from the most applied, to \nthe bluest skies;\n \nbut sharing a clear \nfocus on\n \n(i) \ninfectious disease\n;\n \nand\n (ii) agriculture\n.\n W\nith their specialist infrastructures, \nthey \nsupport\n significant research st\nrengths in \nUK \nmicrobiology\n, covering vital topics for future public health\n, food production, and the \nagricultural economy\n. The\ny\n \nprovid\ne\n essential frontline services\n,\n such as p\nredicting\n and controlling\n disease\n outbreaks\n.\n \nThey\n \nhave potentially enormous value\n in\n link\ning\n basic\n,\n strategic and applied research\n, with a longer time-\nhorizon than \nthe shorter-term\n grants \noffered to universities\n, and acting as nuclei for innovation\n.\n \nDeveloping more effective synergistic relationships\n between researchers in universities\n and public sector research establishments should be a\n \nfuture goal.\n&#xa0;\n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuggestions for future inquiries on UK R&amp;D funding&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSociety for General Microbiology – President &amp; Chair of the Policy Committee:&#xa0;\nSociety for General Microbiology – Policy Committee:&#xa0;\nThe Policy Committee \na\ndditionally\n sought the views of\n \nDr Mike Dawson (Novacta Biosystems Ltd.), Professor Laura Piddock (University of Birmingham), \nDr Malcolm Rhodes\n (University of Manchester)\n, \nand Dr Rebecca Wood (Chemical Innovation Knowledge Tr\nansfer Network)\n \nin preparing this response.\n \nMr \nJonathan Fuhrmann (Society for General Microbiology) contributed significantly to \ndata gathering and analysis\n.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\nA world in which the science of microbiology provides maximum benefit to society.\n&#xa0;\nTo promote \nhigh-quality microbiological science, both nationally and internationally, to a diverse range of stakeholders.\n&#xa0;\nThe potential socio-economic benefits arising from microbiology are substantial.
