"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Ground Source Heat Pump Association (HOT09)&#xa0;Introduction to the Association &#xa0;\nThe Ground Source Heat Pump Association (GSHPA) aims to encourage the growth and development of the ground source heat pump industry in the UK and help to set and safeguard standards. For more information about the GSHPA visit www.gshp.org.uk \n1. Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand? The range of incentives and schemes to encourage increases in energy efficiency and the onsite generation of heat are \naiming to \nwork towards the behaviour change needed \nand \nto \ncontribute towards a reduction in heat energy demand. \nResearch indicates that be\ntween the years 2000–2011 there has been a 20% reduction in domestic gas consumption (Ricardo-AEA: \nhttp://www.politics.co.uk/comm\nent-analysis/2013/05/23/comment-cutting-demand-is-the-blind-spot-in-britain-s-great\n). \nTools such as the \nNational Heat Map\n give a good indication of the heat density across the UK; it would be a \nuseful addition if this map was able to illustrate reductions in the heat use over time. \nIt would also appear though that more time and effort is being invested in supply side management than in demand side management – i.e. heat (and energy) demand reduc\ntion. Domestic and commercial users of energy are interested in reducing the use of heat energy as it in turn reduces their fuel bills but this is proving to be challenging for many. \n&#xa0;2. What progress is the government making on reducing the demand for heat? It is clear that steps are being taken in the right \ndirection;\n however, with heat still accounting for \nnearly\n 50% of the UK’s energy use\n, it is difficult to \nsee\n how quickly t\nhe demand for heat is reducing or if it is government policy which is behind \nthe reduction.\n3. Biomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives.&#xa0; What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture? No comment. \n4. There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough? No comment. \n5. What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units? There is zero local environmental impact from the u\nse of ground source heat pumps in urban areas (no emissions, no noise, no visible impact, as ground source heat pumps provide invisible heating systems and\n \nare the most unobtrusive heating (&amp; cooling) technology available on the market.\n6. What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? This depends on the efficiency of the power station in converting gas to electricity (normally around 50%) and the Co-efficient of Performance (CoP) of the domestic heat pumps (normally around 400%). If heat pumps are poorly installed there is a danger tha\nt the CoP could fall to 200% and, at that level, there would be no merit in using heat pumps. \n With the planned decarbonisation of the electricity grid the case for well installed ground source heat pumps gets stronger and stronger.\nGround source heat pump\ns in well insulated buildings can be set to provide background heating at night (when electricity supply is significantly cheaper).\n7. Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK? Heat Networks in the UK currently provide less than 2% of the UK\n’s heat demand (DECC), although an assessment in 2009 suggested “that in the right conditions heat networks could supply up to 14% of the UK’s heat demand.”\nLegal problems and custom have held back district heating schemes in the UK, as well as issues of m\neasuring heat used by\n customers of district heating even though meters specifically for this purpose have been available for many years in mainland Europe.\nCHP has advantages in the heating season – but only marginal advantage in summer, unless connected t\no Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage.\n8. What are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution? No Comment.\n9. Should the government take any further any specific actions in relation to cooling? We know that DECC are opposed to the idea of subsidising cooling by air conditioning: we are very much in sympathy with the idea that standard air conditioning should not be encouraged – because there are large carbon emission implications. This is because\n the standard approach to cooling – heat exchange with hot air – is expensive in electricity [and therefore carbon emissions].  \nHowever in warmer parts of Europe (and the World) where building cooling is recognised as being important to maintaining productivity, considerable work has been invested in developing Renewable Energy driven cooling systems and in balancing heating and co\noling loads which if correctly executed can be the most energy efficient solution. Thermal Energy storage is at the heart of the systems and in this context providing heating can be considered as recharging the store with coolth and cooling as recharging t\nhe store with warmth.  In either case the heat is moved and stored rather than created.\nThe CoP (Coefficient of Performance) of a roof-mounted chiller can be as low as 1.5 on a hot day [1 kilowatt of electricity is needed to provide 1.5 kW of cooling].  Ho\nwever, some cooling is necessary, and there is a very much more effective way of achieving this – by employing ground source energy and allowing heat to escape to cold ground instead of forcing heat into hot air.  The CoP of “free cooling” (heat exchange w\nith cold ground by means of a circulation pump) can be as high as 25. The CoP of Renewable Cooling (heat exchange with cold ground assisted by a reversible heat pump) can \nfrequently achieve a CoP of 8.\n Further this has the additional benefit of improving h\neating CoP the following winter as the ground has been recharged and is therefore warmer. Improvements in heating CoP can be dramatic lifting the annual heating CoP from around 4 to around 5 in many cases.\n \nThe carbon emission savings of using Renewable Co\noling, instead of standard Air Conditioning, are huge and we believe that DECC will come to see that these should be encouraged\n as part of the fight to reduce carbon emissions\n.\nThere will need to be appropriate safeguards, which could be defined in terms o\nf requiring a high CoP before Renewable Cooling is recognised and requiring a high temperature set point so that Cooling is only used when necessary (rather than as an indulgence).\nDECC has been inclined to reject subsidy for renewable cooling as their int\nerpretation of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is that it would not count as “renewable” although it would save significant CO2 emissions. We think that DECC, which frequently claims that the RHI is a “world first”, should be making the case to Brusse\nls, rather than following DECC’s own timid interpretation of the RED.\n10. Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully? The practical effect of DECC policy (although not the intention) has been to suppress the heat pump market:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFive years \nof discussion on RHI, but no RHI yet in place for domestic heat pumps.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFIT\n (Feed in Tariff)\n subsidies from \n1\nst\n April 2010\n diverted attention to PV cells, with initial subsidies \nat 43\np/kWh.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommercial RHI for heat pumps was introduced in Nov\nember\n 2011, w\nith\n initial subsidy at only 3.5\np/kWh (at the same time RHI for biomass introduced at 9.2p/kWh).\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDECC also introduced the unscientific idea of “naturally occurring energy” which confused the market and prevented Ofgem from accrediting any ground source heating\n and cooling systems for over a year.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDECC ha\ns\n overlooked th\ne\n ability of ground source heat pumps to provide invisible heating systems with zero on-site environmental impact.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGround source heat pumps can also recycle energy from summer to winter and, throu\ngh thermal energy storage, can balance the limitations of those technologies which suffer from intermittent renewable energy supply.\n- \n              \nThe RHI provides an annual subsidy to reduce the annual cost of using renewable heat. The barrier to installing a ground\n source heat pump is not the annual running cost (which is small) but the up-front capital cost (which is large).\n11. How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?This may depend on the efficiency with which the RHI is administered by \nOfgem. This, in turn, may depend on the complexity of the regulations Ofgem is asked to administer.\n12. Thermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.&#xa0; What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?Thermal storage using seasonal thermal energy storage is a simple and practical method of balancing energy demand which is already in use in the UK. Government policy has not yet recognised the merits of this approach in saving carbon emissions. The miscon\nceived policy of “naturally occurring energy” held back market developments in this innovative technology. DECC has recognised that this was inappropriate, but the Statutory Instrument of 28 November 2011 has not yet been updated. \nGovernment policy urgent\nly needs to recognise and promote Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage as a means of saving carbon emissions. The Government should also encourage all forms of Heat Recovery where this can be used in conjunction with thermal storage in order to save carbon emis\nsions.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
