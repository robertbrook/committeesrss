"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Zero Emissions Platform (CCS07)Founded in 2005, \nthe Zero Emissions Platform (ZEP) \nserves as an advisor to the European Commission on the research, demonstration and deployment of \nCO\n2\n Capture and Storage\n (CCS). \nZEP is a\n coalition of over 200 members from 19 countries – representing academics, scientists, \nEuropean \nutilities, petroleum \ncompanies, equipment suppliers and environmental NGOs\n.\n&#xa0;\nSUMMARY&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nZEP \nalso \nrecommends \nestablishing up to six new CO\n2\n storage pilots\n across Europe to complement demonstration projects\n and \naccelerate state-of-the-art technology\n. This \nwill \nenable meaningful R&amp;D on a range of issues\n, \nwhich may then be used generically – on- \nand \noffshore. \nQualifying and improving knowledge of \nrepresentative\n geological storage conditions will also greatly benefit the planning of a trans-national, European CO\n2\n transport infrastructure. \nIn certain cases, the storage pilot may even be used to explore\n industrial scale-storage in the same reservoir.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n “Redrawing the energy-climate map.
