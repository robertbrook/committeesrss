Improving the utility of surveillance data for antibiotic usage and resistance defaultmonitoring defaultand for healthcare associated infectiondefault prevention and controldefault&#xa0;
defaultA group of experts in antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infection
default&#xa0;defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;defaultThere is a renewed focus on the risks posed to public health by antimicrobial resistance. The Chief Medical Officer’s 2013 report warned that antimicrobial resistance
default 
defaultis a more serious issue than global warming and 
defaultcalled for it to 
defaultbe included on the Government’s National Security Risk Assessment.
default Recently we have also seen the publication of the Government’s Five Year AMR Strategy.
default This aims to improve knowledge and understanding of AMR, conserve the effectiveness of existing treatments and stimulate the development of new antibiotics.  Although the strategy is welcome, there is still a great deal of work to be done to ensure these ambitious aims are achieved. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2007, the NHS has focused on measures to reduce two healthcare associated infections (HCAIs), MRSA blood stream infections (BSIs) and 
defaultClostridium 
defaultdifficile
default 
default(
defaultC. 
defaultdifficile
default) infections, and has implemented strict targets and objectives to help drive down rates. A multi-faceted approach that has included both infection control and antimicrobial prescribing measures has been associated with declining rates of these infections, though the effect of specific interventions remains subject to debate.
default However, there have been some unintended consequences to these control measures, which require a modified approach to maintain improvements and to address emerging infection and antimicrobial resistance threats.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring the period of successful control of MRSA BSIs and 
defaultC. 
defaultdifficile
default 
defaultinfections, Gram-negative infections, including 
defaultE
defaultscherichia

default 
default(
defaultE.

defaultBSIs
default, have become a greater 
defaultchallenge. R
defaultecent Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) figures show that 
defaultE. coli 
defaultBSI
default 
defaultrates increased by 35% in the last five years
default,
default and there were  32,307 mandatory reported cases in England between July 2012 and June 2013. 
default Consequently, the CMO called for an expansion of the focus on HCAIs to include other significant infections, which could help reduce resistance to critically important antibiotics, including 
defaultcarbapenems
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn order to address the need for further improvements, 
defaulta group of experts in antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infection
default, supported by Astra Zeneca UK, have come together to consider improvements that can be made. This group of experts
default defaultagreed
default defaultthe following recommendations in order to improve clinical practice and patient safety.
default&#xa0;defaultNeed for changedefault&#xa0;defaultWe
default defaultbelieve that there is a real need to improve the utility of data available to the NHS and clinicians, so that there is greater understanding of current antibiotic prescribing practice with clearer links to patient outcomes.
default&#xa0;defaultWe are concerned about perverse antibiotic prescribing 
defaultbehaviours
default that are being driven by existing MRSA BSI and 
defaultC. 
defaultdifficile
default 
defaultinfection objectives/targets.  Whilst avoiding the use of certain antibiotics is sensible in patients at high risk of MRSA or 
defaultC. 
defaultdifficile
default 
defaultinfection, antibiotic prescribing has become too concentrated on a limited number of drugs.  There is evidence that such intensive use of few antibiotics, rather than using a wide range of agents, can lead to the emergence of resistance, particularly in prob
defaultlematic Gram-negative pathogens (particularly 
defaultpiperacillin-tazobactam
default and 
defaultcarbapenems
default.)
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that changing the focus of the current HCAI targets can improve patient care.  The
default following measures would refine
default current implicit and explicit restrictions on antimicrobial 
defaultprescribing.  If supported by high quality data, this would empower specialists to recommend the most appropriate antibiotic for patients at the most appropriate time, while still taking into account HCAI and antimicrobial resistance challenges. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe therefore call for 
defaultthree
default measures to drive high quality antibiotic prescribing, which aim to improve patient outcomes and to protect the efficacy of existing antibiotics:

defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
defaultAntimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest public health threats.

default defaultcalling for changes to establish an environment whereby infection specialists can make the best prescribing decisions for patients.  Diverse (but appropriate) antibiotic prescribing can reduce the selection pressure for resistance and can improve outcomes for current and future patients.
