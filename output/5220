[normal]The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) is the professional body representing over 29,000 members and fellows. The RCP sets standards of healthcare as well as providing physicians with education, training and support throughout their careers. The RCP's primary interest is in building a health system that delivers high quality care for patients. Many RCP members and fellows work in Acute Medical Units across the country. The Acute Medical Unit (AMU) is the first point of entry for patients referred to hospital as emergencies by their GP and those requiring admission from the Emergency Department.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In September 2013 the RCP published the final report of the Future Hospital Commission, which set out a radical new vision for the acre of acute medical patients.
[normal]Current pressures[bold]The challenges facing Emergency Departments are the most visible manifestation of the pressures facing the system as a whole system, cause by a number of factors.
[normal]Increasing clinical demand [bold]During the past 10 years there has been a 37% increase in emergency hospital admissions and a 65% increase in secondary care episodes for those over 75 in the same period (compared with 31% increase for those aged 15–59) 
[normal]The impact of increasingly frail patients presenting to hospital cannot be underestimated. Patients over the age of 85 years spend longer in hospital than those under 65. Community health and social care systems have been unable to prevent these patients presenting to hospitals and the proportion of bed days used by this group inexorably rises, leaving many hospitals at maximum capacity.
[normal]Out-of-hours care breakdown[bold]Emergency activity at the weekend is around a quarter lower than during the rest of the week.
[normal] Patients admitted at the weekend do not get diagnostic tests as quickly as those admitted during the week, there are significant falls in the number of procedures performed at the weekend, including emergency procedures, and fewer people are discharged. Analysis of ‘system stress’ (when admission to hospital exceeds discharge) shows a progressive rise from Sunday to Wednesday and ‘recovery‘ (discharges exceeding admissions) from Thursday to Saturday. 
[normal]System fragmentation and lack of alternatives to hospital admission[bold]Despite the high cost of hospitalisation, there is a lack of alternatives across 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The drive towards seven day services in secondary care has not been matched in the 
[normal]community. As stated by the RCP during evidence to the committee’s inquiry into Emergency services and emergency care, patients will go where the lights are on.
[normal]Evidence also suggests that the increase in the supply of newer types of emergency care facilities appears to have led to increased patient demand,
[normal] known as supply-led demand.
[normal]'Vicious circle' of emergency and outpatient care[bold]Most hospital consultants spend most of their time in outpatient and elective 
[normal]daycase
[normal] settings. The increasing demands of urgent and emergency care have resulted in decreased availability for such activity. This reduces hospital income as the net tariff income for out-patient and elective activity is greater than that for emergency work. As well as putting further financial stress on hospital trusts (which limits investment in emergency and urgent care) this results in delays to diagnostic tests and outpatient management, which leads a proportion of patients to present to the emergency services. Thus a 'vicious circle' is established where emergency and outpatient care negatively impact on each other.
[normal]Handover and flow[bold]As well as demand issues at the ‘front door’ there are capacity/flow issues internally through the hospital. If patients who require further in-patient care are unable to be transferred out of an emergency department or acute medical unit after their condition has been stabilised both they and subsequent arrivals may be disadvantaged. 
[normal]The successful discharge of frail older people following an emergency admission to hospital relies on effective joint working between NHS, social care partners and the independent sector. 
[normal]Acute and geriatric bed closures[bold]Acute trusts have often targeted acute and geriatric bed closures
[normal] to meet savings targets. There is a risk that reducing admissions and beds will lead to a small bed base with high occupancy rates which cannot respond safely to fluctuations in demand. 
[normal]Recruitment and staffing[bold]Recruitment into emergency medicine is becoming increasingly difficult, with gaps in training schemes, an increasing reliance on locums, and unfilled consultant posts. In addition to this, three successive years of only 50% fill rates for Emergency Medicine (EM) trainees has resulted in a 'lost cohort' of over 200 potential consultants.
[normal] 
[normal]The majority of emergency medical care is delivered by trainees. There is little flexibility to increase the amount of work delivered by this sector of the workforce due to the constraints of both UK and European working time regulations. There is no plan to increase trainee numbers and consultant expansion is limited by output of training and, more importantly, finances. The situation is exacerbated in smaller (often rural) hospitals where gaps in training rotas are common. Locum costs and arguably quality of care delivered by locum staff result in further financial pressure on the service. 
[normal]Many hospital trusts are now exploring cheaper parts of the healthcare workforce, such as advanced nurse practitioners and physician associates, to deliver emergency and urgent care. This workforce needs time to develop and be trained. There are significant limitations placed on developing such a workforce due to lack of regulation.
[normal]RCP recommendations[bold]The challenges facing Emergency Departments are the most visible manifestation of the pressures facing the system as a whole. As such we need whole-system solutions to relieve the pressure on emergency care services.
[normal]The RCP recommends:
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Specialist teams assessing patients at the ‘front door’ and patients being ‘fast-tracked’ to specialist wards where necessary.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Care coordinated by a single named consultant, supported by specialists.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More doctors participating in general internal medicine and equipped to treat increasing number of patients presenting with multiple complex conditions.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The hospital no longer being seen as a building, but instead as a set of skills that can be deployed across different settings, with medical teams working in the community.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Patients having the same access to treatment at a weekend as a weekday, with arrangements for 
[normal]leaving hospital
[normal] [bold]across seven days.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Supported early discharge (including adequately equipped and resourced services in the community over seven days, and strong links between in-hospital and community teams across primary, secondary and social care).
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Greater regulation of physician associates.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The introduction of patient-focused electronic records, written to common record standards, and viewable in hospital and in the community. 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More flexible commissioning and funding arrangements to allow for greater integration through budgets being used across primary and secondary care.
