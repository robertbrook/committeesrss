It has been reviewed by at least two internal referees before publication. The views expressed in this paper represent those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the host institutions or funders.1.              This submission is based on the latest research on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and professional opinions of experts at Imperial College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science. It emphasises that there is a clear environmental and economic case for a much greater investment by the UK public and private sectors in the development of CCS.2.              A range of large demonstration projects will be needed by 2020 in order to explore whether CCS can be commercially viable at large scale and to minimise the risk of wrong or late investments. This will require a number of economic and institutional issues to be addressed relating to costs and liabilities, as well as the building of confidence amongst investors and the general public.3.              We welcome and support the Government’s approach set out in its CCS roadmap (DECC, 2012), including the emphasis on research and development in order to reduce costs reduction, and on the creation of an appropriate regulatory framework. However, progress towards full scale demonstration appears to be falling behind schedule.4.              Deploying CCS on a large scale will require policy certainty through a combination of carbon pricing, direct financial support for research and development (particularly for more advanced capture technologies for gas and biomass power plants and for industrial applications), managing risk and liability, and appropriate regulation, such as mandatory requirements for power plants.5.              Overall, we support the view if the International Energy Agency that CCS will be a critical component in a global portfolio of low-carbon energy technologies by 2050. This is a key area of climate change mitigation in which the UK can build on significant expertise and lead the way. For this to happen, it is crucial that the Government provides clearer CCS policy objectives, including in relation to the liability regime and network infrastructure plans.6.              Our submission seeks to contribute analysis that is relevant to the following topics highlighted by the Committee in relation to carbon capture and storage (CCS): technology development, contribution to the UK decarbonisation targets, potential benefits to the UK economy, barriers to development and potential solutions, safety issues, and the consequences of failing to develop at large scale.7.              This submission draws on the latest research on CCS and professional opinions of experts at Imperial College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science.8.              The information in this submission has been provided from our ongoing policy study on the challenges of achieving a significant CCS deployment in the European Union by the 2030s, the result of which we expect to publish in early 2014.&#xa0;9.              CCS is an integrated suite of technologies which can capture around 90 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions from large stationary sources (typically power plants or large industrial installations) before it is emitted into the atmosphere. Captured carbon dioxide is then transported to selected sites for permanent storage. The three major stages involved in CCS technology are: a) capture; b) transport; and c) storage.10.              Capture is the separation of carbon dioxide from other gases produced at large industrial process facilities, such as (but not limited to) coal and natural gas power plants, oil refineries, natural gas processing plants, steel mills and cement plants. Currently this can be achieved with three alternative technologies: post-combustion; pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion (for further details see: Florin &amp; Fennel, 2010; MacDowell et al., 2010).11.              Transport is the transfer of the captured carbon dioxide from the CCS plant to a selected storage site, which may be located several miles apart. Transport can take place via pipelines, either onshore (using a well-established technology already developed for enhanced oil recovery) or offshore (currently the subject of further research); or via shipping (building on experience from the transport of liquefied natural gas).12.              Storage is the permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide away from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is injected into porous rock, either aquifers containing salty water or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. In the UK, storage capacity in oil and gas fields could range from 7.4 to 9.9 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. The storage potential of saline fields is more uncertain, and could range from 6.3 to 62.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (for further details see: Blunt, 2010; Senior CCS Solutions Ltd, 2010).13.              Currently there are about 20 CCS projects in operation across the world, of which only one is in Europe (the Snøhvit capture and storage project in Norway). Only eight of these projects have been developed at full commercial scale (EC, 2013).&#xa0;14.              An analysis by the UK Energy Research Centre (2013) of low-carbon electricity potential reviewed nine different scenarios which have been developed by a number of institutions (including the Committee on Climate Change, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the UK Energy Research Centre) to model ways of meeting the UK 2050 decarbonisation target set out in the Climate Change Act 2008. These scenarios vary greatly in terms of the development of electricity generation capacity using CCS. Coal CCS ranges from 0 to 38 gigawatts (GW), gas CCS ranges from 0 to 2.3 GW, co-firing is up to 51 GW, and biomass CCS is up to 5 GW. While the combination of CCS sources (gas, coal, co-firing or biomass) varies significantly between scenarios, all of them include at least some CCS capacity. The scenario with the lowest CCS capacity estimates at least 12 GW will be in operation by 2050. The scenario with the highest capacity envisages up to 57 GW. Overall, CCS is expected to meet between 12 and 37 per cent of total electricity demand in 2050.15.              Nevertheless, considerable work remains to demonstrate CCS at large scale and across all of its stages, both for power generation and for application to other industrial sectors. Widespread deployment is unlikely before 2020, by which time capacity could range between 1.5 and 5.0 GW (LCICG, 2012).&#xa0;16.              According to the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG, 2012), the areas of innovation which could provide the biggest potential benefits to the UK are (i) deep sea storage and related monitoring; and (ii) advanced capture development (especially gas and biomass) and demonstration of integrated conversion-capture. There is also a case for broad support for leading ideas with ‘breakthrough’ potential, such as novel capture or compression concepts.17.              CCS development in the UK could be worth between 4 per cent and 6 per cent share of the global CCS market, with potential cumulative gross added value of between £150 billion and £750 billion up to 2050, contributing between £3 billion and £16 billion to UK GDP (LCICG, 2012).18.              Innovation also has the potential to drive down the costs (excluding fuel) of conversion with capture by 15 per cent by 2025 and 40 per cent by 2050, and to reduce the long-run costs of transport by around 50 per cent and of storage by more than 50 per cent. Overall, innovation could reduce the costs to the UK of CCS deployment by between £10 billion and £45 billion upto 2050, and lead to more than £100 billion in systems savings, by reducing the need for more expensive alternatives (LCICG, 2012).&#xa0;19.              A number of obstacles currently hamper the scaling up of CCS. These are mostly associated with the economic costs of CCS and related research and development, liability issues associated with storage, policy uncertainty and public and political perceptions.20.              

[[[Costs.]]] A fundamental barrier to CCS deployment is cost. Carbon dioxide capture is the most expensive phase, regardless of the process used (see Figure 1). For state of the art technology, costs currently range from £1.1 million per megawatt to £3.6 million per megawatt, with gas CCS at the low end, and biomass applications at the high end (LCICG, 2012). Costs are generally high in the early stages of a new technology, and CCS is no different, but they could decrease with further development and refinement of existing technologies and innovative breakthroughs. So far, however, the carbon price in the European Union Emissions Trading System has been too low to stimulate sufficient investment in research, development and deployment.

[[[Policy uncertainty and investors’ ]]]

[[[confidence.]]] While we welcome the progress that the Government is making, as set out in its CCS roadmap (DECC, 2012), we are concerned that, following the collapse of the Longannett  project, progress towards a first demonstration plant appears to be behind schedule. Currently there are no commercial scale projects which can provide financiers with confidence in the CCS business model (CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce, 2013). Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty about CCS policy objectives and potentially unintended consequences from the interaction of different policies (for example, policy that accelerates CCS deployment could lower the price of carbon allowances in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The level of financial and political support for CCS in the medium to long term is also unclear.  Lack of clarity regarding safety regulations and liability issues, as well as national and international storage and transportation, also adds uncertainty to future investment decisions. 22.              

[[[Liability issues.]]] Commercial and technical liabilities associated with the CCS value chain create large risks for the storage providers. There is also large uncertainty around the extent of liability of the CCS installations and carbon dioxide storage in case of accident and/or leakage. While insurance mechanisms can help to mitigate some of these risks, some liabilities are essentially uninsurable and would require some form of government guarantee (ClimateWise, 2012).23.              

[[[Public and political perception.]]] CCS is viewed by some as being incompatible with key elements of a low-carbon economy, as it could lead to potential moral hazard, for example, if used as an excuse for continued investment in unabated fossil fuel infrastructure in the short term. It is also associated with centralised energy systems, which can be perceived as harmful to investment in smart grids and interconnection. Until more is known about the operation of storage facilities, the risk of accidental leakage is likely to be perceived as high.&#xa0;24.              Given the obstacles noted in previous sections, it is essential to provide a package of finance and regulation to advance CCS from demonstration to deployment at scale. This includes a strong price signal through the European Union Emissions Trading System, as well as other complementary policies.25.              First, for policies to be effective it will be crucial to 

[[[understand where funding support is needed most, and therefore ]]]

[[[where]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[funding resources]]]

[[[ should be prioritised]]]

[[[.]]]26.              Arguably, funding should target the areas of research, development and deployment that can best deliver reduced costs. These should include next generation technologies that improve plant efficiency and reduce the cost of capture, such as post-combustion carbonate looping and chemical looping (Florin &amp; Fennel, 2010). 27.              A prudent approach would be to prioritise support for gas CCS, as opposed to coal CCS, since the cost per kilowatt-hour of ‘clean’ electricity is expected to be cheaper (although this will also depend on the relative price of coal and gas) and as lifecycle emissions of gas power plants are significantly lower than for coal (CCC, 2013a). This would also suit the UK ambition to exploit its shale gas resources, should they prove to be commercially viable and socially and environmentally acceptable.28.              Biomass energy with CCS (BECCS) is also an important area of research as it is one of the most mature ‘negative emissions technologies’ (see for example McGlashan et al., 2012). BECCS should be integrated within the general CCS strategy, and early demonstrations projects should be encouraged. An important potential constraint is the sustainability of the biomass chain, which needs to be thoroughly investigated, including direct and indirect impacts on land use change.29.              CCS funding, which so far has mostly been focused on power plants, should also be used to address more industrial applications. CCS is currently the only technology available to achieve large scale reductions of carbon dioxide emissions in much of the industrial sector. According to the International Energy Agency (2013), almost half of the carbon dioxide that would need to be captured via CCS between 2015 and 2050 will be emitted from industrial applications. There can be large gains in emissions reduction by applying CCS to large energy intensive sectors, such as iron and steel and cement production and refineries. Some sectors, like ammonia production and natural gas processing, already routinely apply carbon dioxide separation, and in these cases the additional cost of carbon capture could be half those of power plants. There is also scope for reducing operating costs in industries such as cement production, where waste heat could be used for carbon dioxide capture (Brown et al., 2012).30.              It is crucial to speed up the mapping, assessment and verification of storage opportunities, as well as broadening the collection of data from potential sites, especially in the North Sea. It would be sensible to prioritise demonstration when it comes to the lowest risk options, such as storage in depleted gas fields (Senior CCS Solutions Ltd, 2010). Saline aquifers, especially in the southern North Sea and offshore Scotland may offer large potential capacities, but there is a long lead time and significant risk in assuming their use as a specific storage option, so they should be investigated further.31.              Second, once the key areas of investment are identified,

[[[ and designed]]].32.              There is a case for re-directing subsidies currently allocated to fossil fuels in order to increase funding for CCS research, development and deployment. The G20 countries have already agreed to “rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption”. In the UK, fossil fuels are mostly supported financially by the Government via tax exemptions or reductions, especially through a reduction in the value added tax applied to households’ fuel and power consumption. Overall, this support is estimated to represent more than £4 billion in the UK in 2011 (OECD, 2012). While the removal of households’ subsidies would be politically challenging, diverting some of these resources to support CCS could make their reform less controversial, as funds would ultimately be re-allocated within the fossil fuel industry and would potentially reduce the need for direct funding for low-carbon technologies, which could otherwise result in higher energy unit costs.33.              Furthermore, consistent guidance or targets applied across the European Union would be helpful. For instance, Littlecott et al. (2013) suggest the introduction of a European Union CCS milestone target or, should this prove to be to contentious, an adjustment of the current target for renewable energy target to allow it to be at least partly met through CCS.34.              It would also be helpful to consider the potential for adjusting European state-aid rules affecting CCS deployment. The issue of how to ensure compliance with state-aid rules was raised many times during the preparation for the CCS commercialisation competition in the UK, and could have significant impact on investment decisions.35.              The cost of demonstration projects can be reduced by commercial sale of captured carbon dioxide, particularly for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). The prices paid in the United States for carbon dioxide for use in EOR are in the range of $15-30 per tonne (Brown et al., 2012). Some research projects are already underway (e.g. the EOR Joint Industry project in the North Sea, funded by the Scottish Government and some private companies), and similar initiatives could be explored at other sites. The timing of EOR is important because there is only a specific window of opportunity during the lifetime of an oil field when EOR can be implemented efficiently. Missing the window could mean that a CCS project loses its potential for profitability. There are also a number of emerging technologies that could utilise and permanently store carbon dioxide, such as for chemical uses, concrete and plastic production or algae fertilisation (IEA, 2013). While the amounts of carbon dioxide which could be stored via utilisation are orders of magnitude lower than that released, these technologies could have important applications. Further research is necessary to determine if a business case can be made for new commercial applications of captured carbon dioxide - including scoping studies of lifecycle emissions, storage time, cost and total market potential.36.              Third,

[[[.]]] This, in turn, could help improve public perception and understanding of CCS risks and potential. We welcome the progress that the Government has been making in this area and the emphasis that DECC places in its CCS roadmap on developing the regulatory regime (DECC, 2012).37.              Storage management and property rights should be clarified, as well as the role of government in storage exploration, appraisal and development. Monitoring should be appropriately regulated, as a failure to do so could damage public trust in storage facilities and operators.38.              Some liability issues could be addressed with new forms of ‘innovative’ finance, for example where traditional insurance products are modified to transfer, using tightly defined criteria, a subset of the risk of carbon dioxide leakage during the injection phase (for a full description see ClimateWise, 2012). Some risks, however, will remain uninsurable. Ultimately, neither insurers nor storage operators will be able to bear unlimited liabilities. In these cases, risk sharing with the Government will be required. Learning from the experience of nuclear waste could also help to define the responsibilities of the Government and private companies for liabilities that are not limited in size.39.              It will be also important to clarify the role of CCS in balancing an electricity system with an increasing capacity of intermittent renewables, in reducing emissions in carbon-intensive industrial production, and in creating ‘negative emissions’ when applied to biomass. On this latter point, there is evidence that implementing BECCS could potentially reduce ‘NIMBY’ complaints (for example, see Wallquist et al., 2012).40.              Finally, it should also be noted that the implementation of CCS, together with other low-carbon energy technologies, will ultimately lead to an increase in the unit price of electricity and industrial output.

[[[.]]]&#xa0;41.              The main elements of CCS technology – capture, transport and storage – have already been developed and are being applied in several industrial sectors. Capture technologies are at an advanced stage of industrial development. In the UK, methane is already routinely transported at higher pressures than those required to transport carbon dioxide (7.39 megapascals). In several countries, carbon dioxide is already transported via pipelines, ship and road tanker, in some cases in relatively large amounts, primarily for use in the food industry or for oil and gas recovery. For example, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects in the Permian Basin in Texas each year process, transport and re-inject around 23 million tonnes of recycled carbon dioxide, with more than 2,200 miles of high pressure (10-15 MPa) pipelines. As for storage, four large-scale CCS projects have carried out sufficient monitoring to provide confidence that injected carbon dioxide can be permanently retained. Collectively they have stored about 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to date (IEA, 2013).&#xa0;42.              According to the International Energy Agency (2012a), failure to develop CCS will increase by 40 per cent the capital costs of reducing power sector emissions to a level consistent with avoiding a rise of more than 2°C in global average temperature compared with pre-industrial levels (IEA, 2012a).43.              In the UK, a ‘No CCS’ scenario for 2030 produced by the Committee on Climate Change (2013b) indicates that the carbon intensity of the UK power system would only fall to 100g, instead of a desired 50g, of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour by 2030. Even this could only be achieved with significant components of nuclear and offshore wind power (around 15 GW and 25 GW respectively).44.              The UK would also fail to exploit a likely lucrative export market for CCS (see section 4 above). Some of the major technology providers are already keen to open up this market and exploit ‘first mover’ advantages.&#xa0;45.              As the Select Committee has recognised, CCS has the potential to play a major role in the global effort to combat climate change. In its low-carbon energy scenario (2 Degrees case), the International Energy Agency (2012a) shows CCS as the technology with the greatest potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. CCS would account for 22 per cent of reductions, or 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (equivalent to more than two-thirds of Europe’s emissions today). This makes CCS a genuinely strategic option for global climate change mitigation.46.              Although the viability of the component technologies has been demonstrated, there are many uncertainties, as described above, about the technical and commercial implementation of CCS at a large scale. The UK still has significant advantages in terms of well-understood offshore reservoirs where carbon dioxide could be stored, a strong oil and gas sector with relevant expertise, and a capable engineering and research base. While investment in CCS faces a number of policy, legal and insurance challenges, this is a key climate change mitigation area in which the UK can lead the way. A key technical challenge is to integrate all of the various sub-systems, and to ensure that they operate efficiently together and, subsequently, within a network. In particular, an understanding of how CCS can operate most effectively within a diverse energy system will be of particular value.Blunt, M., 2010.
