Written evidence from Derek Clapp [PHS0056]&#xa0;INTRODUCTION.&#xa0;In December 1993 a specialist confirmed that my wife Mrs Clapp had Parkinson’s disease and her condition was monitored by her G.P. until April 2000, when she was referred to the Professor Lees Parkinson’s Clinic, which she attended at the appropriate intervals until her death on the 15th December 2012.Apart from periods of respite in the latter years and short periods in hospital I cared for my wife at home. &#xa0;BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PATIENTS MEDICAL HISTORY  JUST PRIOR TO  AND DURING HER STAY  WARD.&#xa0;On 14.02.08 my wife became distressed and was having an acute psychotic episode. I telephoned the Parkinson’s Specialist that saw her in clinic seven days earlier and his opinion was, “such an acute deterioration over a few days is likely to be related to an underlying medical problem such as infection and this should be actively sought for”. So my intention was to send a urine sample for testing prior to starting her on an antibiotic for a UTI, since this was the most likely cause of the psychotic episode. However, I was persuaded by her Psychiatric nurse and others present to allow my wife to be admitted to hospital for treatment. &#xa0; ADMISSION TO DISCHARGE FROM WARD, WHICH IS PART OF THE LISTER HOSPITAL COMPLEX BUT, MANAGED DIRECTLY BY THE TRUST.&#xa0;My wife was admitted to the Ward at approximately 17.00hrs on the 14.02.08 and the admitting doctor was provided with my wife’s medical history, and details of her daily medication.She was also told about my telephone consult with the Parkinson’s Specialist earlier that day, who also saw Mrs Clapp in clinic on the 7.02.08, and of his request that they keep him informed about her treatment etc. I also made it clear that a UTI was considered to be the most likely cause of the sudden deterioration. The doctor’s notes concluded with “Urine examination to be repeated as the test done in the afternoon says possible infection, bloods to be done. 5 mins obs. To be reviewed by the team tomorrow”.&#xa0;Despite repeated requests, I was unable to see a doctor subsequent to my wife’s admission to to discuss her condition and treatment prior to her being transferred to another hospital six days later.  &#xa0;On the 19 February I received a phone call from the Parkinson’s Specialist I consulted on the 14.02.08, enquiring as to my wife’s state of health. I explained that she had been admitted to hospital on the day we last spoke. At his request I provided the necessary information and he contacted the Manager of Ward who informed him that my wife had been seen earlier in the day by Dr.During that conversation he was also told “her urine was found to be quite offensive and the working diagnosis is a urinary tract infection. She had been started on Imperical Trimethoprim (200mg bd) until culture of the exact organism is known”. This was confirmed in a post-script to his clinic report of the 7.02.08.&#xa0;SUMMARY OF THE COMPLAINT PROCESS WITH THE HERTFORDSHIRE PARTNERSHIP NHS FOUNDATION TRUST.&#xa0;&#xa0;My original letter of complaint dated the 19th May 2008, made the following points:&#xa0;1. I was unable to speak with a doctor about my wife’s condition and treatment subsequent to her admission to the Ward on the 14th February 2008, until she had been transferred to The Stewarts, Harpenden Memorial Hospital on the 20th February 2008.&#xa0;2. I made the point that testing for a UTI was delayed and treatment not started before the 19th February 2008, and requested an explanation.&#xa0;RESPONSE BY THE TRUST.&#xa0;Reports from Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust dated 11th June and 5th August 2008 by Mr xxxx Service Manager – Dementia Services Hertfordshire.&#xa0;1. The first report can best be described as mainly a work of fiction because the daily   ward routine described, where a doctor visited the ward each day was not being followed during the period in question. This was because the ward doctor was on annual leave. (Letter from CEO of the Trust dated the 10th August 2009, confirmed that no doctor was allocated to ward while Dr     was on annual leave.)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2. On the subject of my many requests to see a doctor, it is implied that because none were recorded in the patient’s notes I made no request, thereby suggesting that the records were sacrosanct. There was an apology for the poor quality of their records. In the letter from the Trust’s Risk Manager, of 13.10.08 it is recorded that Dr      said he “also apologises for the apparent unavailability of his medical team in his absence, although I do suspect that the medical team were not aware of your request to see them.”   &#xa0;3. The all important urine sample could and should have been taken for testing on the night my wife was admitted to hospital and the statement “Once at the Lister a catheter specimen of urine was sent for culture” implies that it was taken promptly after admission, whereas the records show that the sample was not available to be collected for the path lab before the 18.02.08, four days after my wife was admitted to the ward. &#xa0;4. It is stated that, “once your letter was received by the Modern Matron the relevant steps were taken to ensure that your concerns were discussed with the care staff involved as quickly as possible.” If that was the case I consider it reasonable to assume that she could have identified the doctor who admitted my wife. &#xa0;5. Faecal impaction was never considered a contributory factor in respect to the acute psychotic episode, because it is recorded that my wife opened her bowels the previous evening.&#xa0;6. The following were not in the patient’s notes, the admitting doctor could not be identified, and at the local resolution meeting Dr       stated that, if my wife had physical problems she should have been sent to ward because the staff had not received the necessary training to deal with a patient with physical problems. So   what was the source of these quotes:-&#xa0;&#xa0;LOCAL RESOLUTION MEETING ON THE 22nd SEPTEMBER 2008.&#xa0;In the letter of 13.10.08 from the Trust’s Risk Manager, enclosing the Minutes, it is recorded that Dr      said “he also apologises for the apparent unavailability of his medical team in his absence, although I do suspect that the medical team were not aware of your request to see them.”   &#xa0;The points of the discussion which I wish to record were:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;REPORT BY LEAD NURSE SPECIAL SERVICE.&#xa0;She states that “There was no other entry in either records systems of Mrs C being seen by a doctor on ward between admission and discharge to The Stewarts on the 20th Feb. However blood samples were taken on the 16th and medications were prescribed on the 19th both of which would require the involvement of a doctor. However, without proper written records, I can only make an assumption that she was seen by a doctor on these dates.”&#xa0;On the question of the blood and urine tests, both were requested by the admitting doctor without any instruction to delay either of them. Therefore, excuses for not arranging these tests within a reasonable timeframe are not acceptable. The medications given on the 19thFebruary were prescribed by Dr       .” The above is recorded in the patient’s notes so assumptions were unnecessary.&#xa0;It was recorded that my wife opened her bowels during the evening prior to admission so it is ridicules to suggest that constipation was a possibility&#xa0;The comment that “Mrs Clapp was not displaying other physical symptoms, such as a raised temperature, general malaise or pain and tenderness” is not something that should not be stated because the doctors were unable to examine her, and are no records. However, it is generally accepted that elderly people do not necessarily have a raised temperature and the other symptoms pain and tenderness would indicate that the infection is serious. This is a particular concern with the elderly, as kidney function may already be declining with age. It is well known an untreated infection can cause further cognitive decline.&#xa0;It is stated that “Mrs Clapp’s Food and fluid intake were poor -- this could be an indication of constipation and poor fluid intake could have resulted in concentrated, strong smelling urine.” However, only comments such as “ate &amp; drank well.” appear in the patient’s notes. &#xa0;It is recorded that “In speaking to the Consultant manager of the IOT she advised me that “the advice to referring GP or other by other professional, would be to treat the infection or constipation at home”&#xa0;There was the normal note on the lab report “Do not treat unless systemically unwell” However, the ward had indicated that the patient was mentally ill, not that she was elderly with advanced stage Parkinson’s and had suffered an acute psychotic episode etc.&#xa0;It is also stated “I am unable to add to previous responses that it is unlikely any deterioration in Mrs Clapp’s condition would be due to a delayed treatment of a urinary tract infection.” In the 20 years since my wife had the Parkinson’s diagnosis all the Specialists, hospital doctors and GP’s who I have consulted would definitely disagree with that statement. Furthermore, the opinion which was expressed by a Neurology Consultant who had not been involved in my wife’s care, stated “In view of the risk, medical professionals have extra responsibility to treat such patients promptly, as even a temporary cognitive decline cause great distress to the patient, carer and family.”&#xa0;Staff claiming to recall conversations with the microbiologist prior to 20.02.08,  are of no consequence, because even when a sample was sent for testing the patient was said to be mentally ill, when Parkinson’s is a multi organ disease, progressive in nature and incurable.&#xa0;I consider that the author of this report is not qualified to state “I do not believe the timing of the antibiotics would have made a great deal of difference for the outcome of Mrs Clapp’s treatment and length of stay in the Stewarts.” However, the judgement of a Consultant Neurologist who had not been involved in my wife’s case, gave a perfect scenario of my wife’s history in this connection. That is a three months spell in hospital, after which I was told that she should be discharged into a home for the mentally ill, whereas it took six months special care at home before she was returned to a reasonable state.&#xa0;In conclusion I would point out that although the Trust CEO fully endorsed this report in his letter of  23.03.12 he included the sentence “We are confident that the overall care provided to your wife was appropriate in such circumstances,” 

[[[So much for we]]] 

[[[learn by our mistakes]]].      &#xa0;CORRESPONDENSE WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE TRUST.&#xa0;This correspondence was extensive, so I limit my observations to the most important items not included elsewhere:&#xa0;The explanation by the CEO for the delay in the prescribing of an antibiotic, was that the over prescription of these drugs made it necessary to establish the actual bacterium involved prior to prescribing this medication. This was proved not to be the correct, because Dr      prescribed Trimethoprim the day he returned from leave, prior to test results being available.&#xa0;&#xa0;1)  &gt;10^5 cfu/ml  Proteus species       2)  &gt;10^5 cfu/ml Enterococcus species&#xa0;              Trimethoprim is not effective against either of the above, so further       course of another antibiotic was required to clear the infection.&#xa0;COMPLAINT POSTED TO OMBUDSMAN ON THE 5th FEBRUARY 2010.&#xa0;In addition to the standard complaint document I included copies of the Parkinson’sClinic reports for my wife’s consultation on the 7.02.08, included a post script confirming the specialist’s conversations with me on the 14.02.08, in addition to the conversation with the ward Manager and me on the 19.02.08. In addition to one for the 17.04.08 which indicated the deterioration in my wife’s condition between clinic sessions.I also attached a section of an article by Bhanu Ramaswamy &amp; Victoria Goodwin which contained a précis of a medical paper by Douglas G. MacMahon &amp; Sue Thomas 1998, which detailed the clinical management necessary when a patient with Parkinson’s has complications such as a urinary infection.  The original medical paper was published in the Neurological Journal and included the following passage:

[[[“The nursing roles have been assumed to be of a generic nature, rather than     specifically related to the nature of the disease, and its consequences”]]]Nevertheless, the PHSO selected a Consultant Geriatrician as their clinical advisor on my complaint.  &#xa0;PHONE CONVERSATION WITH PHSO CASE WORKER. &#xa0;During this phone call various aspects of the complaint were discussed and I requested that they select a clinician with a detailed knowledge of Parkinson’s disease. &#xa0;THE PHSO REPORT DATED 23rd APRIL 2010.&#xa0;It was confirmed that they had decided not to investigate my complaint against Hertfordshire NHS Foundation Trust.&#xa0;They explained the Ombudsman’s Roll and said they had considered a number of factors and listed them:-The poor quality of the records cannot be denied, but I do not consider them an excuse for the failure to have a doctor available to discuss my wife’s care and treatment or for the misleading and false statements made by the Trust in both reports and correspondence.&#xa0;It appears that considers she is well enough informed to make the statement “I do not believe the timing of the antibiotics would have made a great deal of difference for the outcome of Mrs Clapp’s treatment and length of stay in The Stewarts.” Because if you consider the conversation between the Ward Manager as recorded by Dr    xxx   and included as a post-script to the report of my wife’s visit to Professor Lee’s Parkinson Clinic a few days earlier, a different conclusion appears to be obvious.&#xa0;Finally I consider it important to point out that, in this last report it is made clear that, with the benefit of hindsight the professionals involved would have recommended the treatment of the infection at home. Since constipation was not considered a problem, but mentioned as something that should be kept in mind. A UTI was established as the most likely cause of the psychotic episode, necessitating treatment with a suitable antibiotic after first taking a sample for further testing. The action which I proposed without the benefit of hind sight and a step the admitting doctor was not prepared to take. I must say that I consider a large proportion of the responses by the Trust were devoted to making a case for not giving an antibiotic until the actual bacterium had been established and then failing to give reasons for delaying the test necessary to establish the facts which they considered an essential first step in the process.&#xa0;SPECIAL NOTE.  &#xa0;In view of the obvious mistakes in their final report dealing with the complaint, it was surprising that it was endorsed and issued by the Trust.&#xa0;Three of the clinicians who are named in the above notes were either involved in my wife’s case or produced medical papers on the subject of Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, they were also on the panel of advisers involved in the preparation of the NICE Guidelines on Parkinson’s.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
