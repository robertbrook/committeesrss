defaultIs cycling safe?
defaultAll the statistics tell me cycling is safe, and that’s what I tell our members. But this reflects only cycling as it is carried out today. In 
defaultevery school in Richmond
default, many more children 
defaultwantdefault to cycle to school than currently do so. What’s holding them bac
defaultk? In general, it’s safety: no parent would allow a primary school child to cycle in a cycle lane on an A-road or A-road equivalent – when asked, parents generally list safety concerns as the reason for them not allowing children to get on a bike to school
default.
defaultMy daughter wants to cycle to school, and is capable of making the journey, but I can’t allow her to ride in the gutter with cars, trucks and vans passing by a foot away at up to 30 mph. The only way to make cycling both *seem* and *be* safe for these ve
defaultry vulnerable transport users is to provide safe places to cycle where they are not required to interact constantly with dangerous vehicles.

defaultWhat can central / local 
defaultGovt
default do to improve cycling safety …
defaultGovernment across the country needs to provid
defaulte safe, continuous, direct routes which make it possible for people to get on their bikes without the need for expensive lighting or clothing: in countries where lots of people cycle, it happens because they can do it without having to continuously interac
defaultt with motor vehicles.
defaultWe’ve tried, for too long, telling people how useful it is to get training, or legislating for safer HGVs, or making cars nicer for when they inevitably drive into people or things. Now let’s try the thing that we know – from plentif
defaultul evidence in Cambridge, as well as 
defaultAssen
default, from Bristol and from Copenhagen – cycling is something everyone can do, if we give them somewhere nice to do it.

defaultIs it desirable / feasible to separate cyclists from other road users, including prohibit
defaulting HGVs in peak hours …
defaultProhibiting HGVs in rush hour isn’t going to make a primary school child any safer on an ordinary urban or sub-urban road: she still has to interact with buses, vans and cars in our current environment.
defaultCycling in the UK is a safe 
defaultthing to do. However, most people rightly perceive:

defaultbuilding somewhere safe to cycle
default will do.
