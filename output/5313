[normal]To simply answer your key questions:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is cycling safe?
[normal]All the statistics tell me cycling is safe, and that’s what I tell our members. But this reflects only cycling as it is carried out today. In 
[normal]every school in Richmond
[normal], many more children 
[normal]want[bold] to cycle to school than currently do so. What’s holding them bac
[normal]k? In general, it’s safety: no parent would allow a primary school child to cycle in a cycle lane on an A-road or A-road equivalent – when asked, parents generally list safety concerns as the reason for them not allowing children to get on a bike to school
[normal].
[normal]My daughter wants to cycle to school, and is capable of making the journey, but I can’t allow her to ride in the gutter with cars, trucks and vans passing by a foot away at up to 30 mph. The only way to make cycling both *seem* and *be* safe for these ve
[normal]ry vulnerable transport users is to provide safe places to cycle where they are not required to interact constantly with dangerous vehicles.

[normal]What can central / local 
[normal]Govt
[normal] do to improve cycling safety …
[normal]Government across the country needs to provid
[normal]e safe, continuous, direct routes which make it possible for people to get on their bikes without the need for expensive lighting or clothing: in countries where lots of people cycle, it happens because they can do it without having to continuously interac
[normal]t with motor vehicles.
[normal]We’ve tried, for too long, telling people how useful it is to get training, or legislating for safer HGVs, or making cars nicer for when they inevitably drive into people or things. Now let’s try the thing that we know – from plentif
[normal]ul evidence in Cambridge, as well as 
[normal]Assen
[normal], from Bristol and from Copenhagen – cycling is something everyone can do, if we give them somewhere nice to do it.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is it desirable / feasible to separate cyclists from other road users, including prohibit
[normal]ing HGVs in peak hours …
[normal]Prohibiting HGVs in rush hour isn’t going to make a primary school child any safer on an ordinary urban or sub-urban road: she still has to interact with buses, vans and cars in our current environment.
[normal]Cycling in the UK is a safe 
[normal]thing to do. However, most people rightly perceive:

[normal]And, most frequently, the minor inattentions that might result in a small scratch to another vehicle but potential death or serious injury to a cyclist
[normal]As th
[normal]ings that make them feel cycling is too dangerous or just isn’t worth it. No amount of telling people ‘cycling is safe’ will fix these things, but 
[normal]building somewhere safe to cycle
[normal] will do.
