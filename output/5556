default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultGood afternoon and welcome to the first meeting of the Economic Affairs Committee’s Finance Bill Sub-Committee in 2014. We have decided this year to look into selected aspects of the draft Finance Bill, which was published in December. In particular, we are focusing on the taxation of partnerships and are looking at how the current process is working. We aim to publish our report in early March so that it is public and available to the House of Commons and in particular for the detailed Committee stage of the Finance Bill there. Lists of Members’ interests declared as relevant to this inquiry are on our record and available to the public and to witnesses.
defaultMr Whiting, welcome back to the Finance Bill Sub-Committee and thank you once again for coming. You are a fairly regular participant and we are very grateful for the evidence you have given, particularly at the beginning, which very often sets the scene. I also congratulate you on the Chartered Institute of Taxation award you received last week, for which some of us were present
default. W
defaulte are delighted that you did so. Would you like to make a short opening statement? This is obviously a very technical area, so perhaps you could do so with a brief overview of the taxation of partnerships as it stands. We know that you have been producing an Office of Tax Simplification report, which I understand will be available soon. Perhaps you might like to comment on progress with that.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Thank you very much, my Lord Chairman. I am very grateful for the opportunity to appear today. If I may, I will spend two or three minutes updating you on where we have got to with the Office of Tax Simplification’s work on partnerships, and will perhaps give just our initial thoughts.
defaultAs you and your colleagues know, the OTS was set up to study areas of the tax code and to develop recommendations for simplification, technical and administrative. We are a very small team—we number about six full-time equivalents—but we pride ourselves on going out and about and gathering evidence, talking to a wide variety of people. I stress that that includes businesses, advisers, representative bodies and HMRC staff, so we try to go all the way around. With the project that we have been doing on partnership tax we have probably attended around 50 meetings and spoken to close to 1,000 people. This is how we have gathered evidence, and some of the points I will be making are based on 
defaultthe 
defaultsort of evidence 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have gathered.
defaultYou asked how partnership tax works and
default, in a sense,
default why we have done this. As I am sure you are aware, it is in some ways wrong to call it “partnership tax” because in some ways partnerships are not taxed. A principle of the tax system is that partnerships are in general transparent, and it is the partners that are taxed. That obviously raises its own stress points. We have gone on to look at it because it is a bit outdated, as various people have said—the basic law on partnerships dates from 1890. Tax law is not coherent: there is no partnership tax Act or anything like that. Many people have suggested that partnerships are used for avoidance, while many other people have suggested that they are very definitely not used for avoidance. 
defaultFor
default all those sorts of reasons, we thought we had better look at it.
defaultW
defaulte have been studying this area
default for
default 
defaultthe past four or five months
default. Some immediate findings might interest you. The first point, which almost took me aback, is the size of the partnership market, which is about 10% of the business population in the 
defaultUK
default. I will be honest
default:
default that quite surprised me. There is a variety
default. O
defaultbviously the great bulk are two or three-partner firms—perhaps 90% are in that category. That could be husband and wife, just two people, or whatever. There are a body of medium-sized partnerships with five to 20 people such as doctors, architects, or whatever. Then, of course, there are the very large firms, be it ones like my o
defaultld
default firm PricewaterhouseCoopers or large law firms, and similar ones. Interestingly, you also identified a fourth type of partnership, which is becoming more prevalent. That is what we refer to as perhaps the City type of partnership, which is used for investment and venture capital. That is a notable and growing use of the City offerings.
defaultIn terms of other findings, probably a lot stems from the first point I made
default:
default that this is 10% of business. That is usually quite a surprise, because our sense is that partnerships are not much thought about. They are an afterthought. Tax policy seems to think about companies—understandably—and about individuals, be they employees or sole traders. Partnerships do not seem to get much attention, which can mean that things can fall through the gaps and that perhaps HMRC does not focus on them as best it can. 
defaultThat leads into the stance. There is undoubtedly a bit of a mistrust on all sides. I think we all know that partnerships have been used for avoidance; many people talk about things like film partnerships and the like. Equally, partnerships are a very valid and important part of business, and it is a question of getting the balance in.
defaultOn the recommendations we will be coming out with in our report, just to give you a flavour of them, there is a number of what we will term “quick fixes”, which are things that we think can be done fairly quickly such as better publication of guidance material, and making it easier for partners to get unique taxpayer reference numbers. Some medium-term ones might help, such as more even penalties for late filing, so that if a partnership is late in filing its return, that would not lead to a penalty for every partner. For the larger firms, that might be a bit more attention to the international implications of partnerships. So there is quite a variety. Ideas that we are going to come up with are things such as, frankly, whether we can eliminate the partnership return for the smallest partnerships, which very often see it just as a little bit of extra bureaucracy and paperwork. Can we allow partners to claim expenses on their own return rather than just through the partnerships? Should there be a sort of standing committee—a group that is got together to monitor some of the ways in which partnerships are being used, particularly in the City environment that I alluded to?
defaultThose are some of the highlights. Most of what we are coming up with is what you would call administrative organisational rather than any suggestions that will cost or yield vast amounts of money. We have regard to cost and yield, but certainly that one is more aimed at organisation, making it easier, smoother and simpler all round. I hope that that is helpful by way of an introduction.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much. I think that both the size of the area we are looking at and the importance of some of the issues you have raised make it appropriate that we have selected this subject for this year as part of our general inquiry. 
defaultGiven all the points that you have been making, and to some extent that this is not an area that gets huge attention on the tax front, perhaps not even from HMRC, would it be appropriate to have a separate tax code for partnerships?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Our answer to that—
defaultand it
default is a question that we have thought about and asked people quite a lot about—is yes in theory, but probably no in practice. If we were starting out with the proverbial blank sheet of paper and designing a tax system from scratch, you would say that we ought to have a code for partnerships. It would be an absolutely fair challenge to say, “Well, in a sense we have a blank sheet of paper
default. We
default don’t have a partnership tax code
default, 
defaultso why not design one?”. I think the answer to that is that frankly it would take an awful lot of doing. Perhaps 
defaultI can pick up on one component. A
defaults you may be aware, the partnership capital gains tax rules are essentially within a statement of practice issued by the then Inland Revenue back in 1975. So we have quite an important chunk of partnership tax that is dealt with by a near
default 
default40 year-old statement of practice. We have used that as a bit of test piece, if you like, because to have a 40 year-old statement does not sound right. What would it take to turn that into legislation? The best estimate is about 50 or 60 pages of legislation. If you extrapolate that to the whole of the code and the idea that you would have a complete partnership tax Act, that is potentially a lot of legislation, and obviously it is a lot of work for the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, HMRC and commentators. So I come back to the answer to your question, which is undoubtedly yes, in theory, but in practice maybe it is just not worth it.
defaultThe Chairman:default But in order to get greater up-to-date clarity and certainty and to deal with some of the issues that you have clearly identified need dealing with, does that not require quite a lot of legislation anyway?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: That, of course, would be the great benefit, because if we do go through the process of writing down all the legislation, in principle you get clarity and certainty. We are going to come up with a number of recommendations and suggestions for rule changes and evolution, so you are right
default: 
defaultit will require a certain amount of legislation and a certain amount of practice change as well. It is a judgment call as to how far you wish to push this idea of developing an entirely separate partnership tax code. Undoubtedly, if we had a partnership tax Act, you would in principle get a more certain, clearer set of rules. That certainty, clarity and consistency is something that in many ways we think 
defaulthas been 
defaultlacking in some areas. As we have gone round, we have often found that different partnerships have different results for the way they have operated in certain areas, and different answers from the tax man.
defaultThe Chairman:default Putting the question in a slightly different way, the tax law rewrite programme has rewritten most of the tax legislation in recent years, but not in this area. Was a trick missed in not including this, and does that
default slightly lead to needing to do 
defaultsomething like that now?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Of course, the tax law rewrite did indeed rewrite the tax code in certain areas that were there. For example, it came up with three Acts on corporation tax. You are back to the fact that, in a sense, they could not rewrite what was not there, because there is not much partnership tax. It was not really within their brief to try to collate and find the gaps. I would say that the tax law rewrite did not miss a trick. It would have required a bit more than their remit to have gone off and said, “We ought to construct a partnership tax Act”.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default A fundamental question, if you were starting with that blank sheet of paper, is: do we need partnerships? Would it be in the interest of simplification just to apply company law to small companies with two people?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: That is a very good question. Partnerships are essentially a very simple device. If you and I wish to get into business together, we could just say “We’re in partnership—we don’t need any formalities”. It would make sense to have a partnership agreement between us so we could regulate, but it is essentially simple and easy. For that reason I would say that partnerships are still very valid. That very simplicity is attractive, not just to you and 
defaultme 
defaultgoing into business
default 
defaulttogether. At the opposite end of the scale I have been struck by how that simplicity
default,
default ease of formation and dissolving is attractive in major City investment opportunities, where people can come together, run a project for a while, in effect, 
defaultand 
defaultthen easily dissolve it without the formalities of the company. Partnerships are still a very valid way of doing business. 
defaultIt is an interesting question as to whether you would say, “Okay, we will recognise the partnership as a thing, just like we do a company, and we should tax the partnership rather than this look-through”. We have looked at that idea briefly and concluded that that would be a complete and major policy upheaval. We cannot see enough in it to warrant our coming at it from a simplification point of view. In our reports we have touched on and will at least note the idea that with a limited liability partnership, for example, which is more of an entity, there is an argument that perhaps you should tax that thing in some way, and possibly once it distributes its money then you go back to taxing the partners as partners. But maybe you start by taxing this entity. I am afraid that we are getting rather away from what the OTS is supposed to look at and far more into pure policy.
defaultThe Chairman:default It raise
defaults
default an interesting question, though.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default I declare my interests, which have all been declared, including being a partner in partnerships. On the global situation, have you looked at the existence or not of partnership Acts in other countries and how effective they have been, particularly in Commonwealth countries, and in the United States
default, in dealing 
defaultwith partnerships?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I cannot say that we have looked at every country, as you would expect, but we have certainly looked around a good range of countries. Yes, we have looked at some of the old Commonwealth countries such as 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default, and have looked at 
defaultAmerica
default and at some of the European countries. We always try to do that in our projects, because you always have this hope that somebody out there is doing it better and that we can draw some lessons
default from it
default. If I am honest, I am not sure that we have found anyone doing it better. Undoubtedly, you find some territories that treat partnerships as entities
default—
defaultas
default 
defaulttaxing entities on themselves, to go back to Baroness Wheatcroft’s question
default—but most
default tend to look through them, much as we do.
defaultThe Chairman:default I am afraid that we must stop there, because we have a Division. I am so sorry
default. W
defaulte all have to go and vote, but we will be back as quick as we can.
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Joffe:default I declare an interest as a supporter of individuals and organisations 
defaultthat 
defaultresearch tax evasion and tax avoidance, and that I provide financial support to some of those organisations and carry on with such support. Picking up on the question raised by Baroness Wheatcroft, what is the rationale for treating partnerships differently from sole traders, assuming that it is a sole trader with a husband and wife? Why should there be special rules for partnerships as opposed to rules for them?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: In some ways there are not that many special rules. If you want to compare a sole trader—just me in business—with 
defaultme
default and my wife in partnership, the way the partnership rules work is essentially that the partnership is broadly ignored, and my wife 
defaultand I 
defaultare taxed. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultbecause the partnership is a 
defaultsort of 
defaultconvenient entity and because it exists, putatively the Whiting partnership would have to make a tax return of the partnership profits and a certain amount of data about the partnership, but then my wife 
defaultand I 
defaultwould be taxed. So it is more that there is a certain amount of extra burden, because if you compare my wife 
defaultand I as 
defaultsole traders with our respective own businesses with our being in partnership and carrying on a business together, you are actually requiring the Whiting partnership, in my analogy, to put in an extra tax return to have an extra administrative burden. Probably, if we are just a small business, we would start to get slightly confused as to whether I, John Whiting, and my wife are doing our own tax, or whether the partnership is being taxed. That is at the hub of a lot of the concerns 
defaultthat 
defaultwe find about small partnership tax.
defaultLord Joffe:default Does that naturally extend to large partnerships?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: At the other end of the scale, as no doubt you know, I was a partner for 
defaultm
defaultany years in PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is to all intents and purposes the biggest in the 
defaultUK
default. That still very much tried to run itself as a partnership to maintain something that I believe is important, which is the partnership ethos and the “We’re all in it together and we’ve got to combine” stance. However, when all is said and done, of course that is a very different beast 
defaultfrom 
defaulttwo people operating in partnership. It is recognised at various levels that they certainly have to be treated differently. For example, HMRC operates a very different stance and approach to taxing firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers compared to the two-person partnership. You would expect that, and the whole compliance cycle tends to be very different. That is partly a response to the sheer size and amount of money that is going through.
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default If that is the case, and there is such a difference betwee
defaultn the treatment of the Deloittes
default, KPMGs and PWCs of this world and the small partnership
default,
default which may
default have 
defaulta turnover of only a few thousand pounds a year, is it right that there should be one tax system for partnerships, irrespective of what they are like? Should that difference not be recognised by having a difference in the systems for partnerships?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: That is a very interesting challenge. The response is partly that the company tax system basically 
defaulttries 
defaultto tax companies
default 
defaultin the same way, be they a one-man band or a mega
default 
defaultplc, although there are a few points of adjustment throughout the system—group relief
default,
default group provisions, and so on and so forth. The reason 
defaultwhy 
defaultwe still try to tax partnerships all in the same way probably comes back to the fact that there is strictly 
defaultno 
defaultsuch thing as 
defaulta 
defaultpartnership tax. It is 
defaulta 
defaultlook-through, so you are broadly taken back into the sheer mechanics of it more than 
defaultinto 
defaulta technical system. The rules under which PricewaterhouseCoopers or Deloitte arrive at their partnership profit are in principle the same as Whiting and Whiting, in the same way as MegaCo would be the same as a single-person company. The underlying rules are the same. On 
defaultthe question of 
defaulthow it is handled and administered, HMRC operates them differently, as I was saying to Lord Joffe. So there are differences there. 
defaultOf course, the issues that the different types of partnership come up with are very different. For the smallest two-person partnership, it really is the administrative effort and the confusion that is caused by the question, “Hang on
default, 
defaultam I a partnership or an individual?”, and you can see a lot of that coming through. If you go up to the PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte size, the big issues, given that they have good advice and help from HMRC, are the international dealings and the problems created when they try to have operations in all sorts of other countries. Somewhere in the middle, with a 10-partner medical practice, it tends to be about the sheer organisation of the partnership and arguments about how expenses are relieved. The rules are the same, but their impact tends to be different, simply because of the size.
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default But it is not just the size
default. T
defaulthere are also differences in character. You mentioned property partnerships, for instance. The way in which some partnerships operate is very different 
defaultfrom 
defaultthe way others operate. Whether the basic principles are the same throughout, I think you somewhat opened 
defaultthe 
defaultquestion
default: c
defaultan the tax system cope with those differences efficiently and effectively?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: The tax system copes, but there are signs of strain. You are absolutely right—I keep coming back to 
defaultthis
default—because the small two-partner firm is a very different entity from the financial operation 
defaultof
default Deloitte or whoever, not least because the latter will have sophisticated advisers and helpers who
default are 
defaultbasically probably doing all the necessary technical work and making sure that the systems are done, and at the same time HMRC is giving them a lot of help and support. The paradox, perhaps, is that down at the bottom end, where about a third of the smallest partnerships do not have advisers, tax agents and accountants, they are trying to do it all themselves and they can find that a lot of extra administrative effort is needed, there is a lot of struggle, and a lot of confusion is coming in. That is why I keep coming back to this administrative effort
default and the fact 
defaultthat maybe HMRC needs to think differently as to how it supports this large number of two or three-partner firms—400,000—which are doing a lot of good basic business but struggling with the system.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default One of the big differences between companies and partnerships is in the treatment of retained profits. I wonder what your thoughts are on whether any changes should be made in the way in which the retained profits in partnerships are treated by the Revenue. I suppose it could be argued that one likes to see businesses, whether they are partnerships or companies, retaining profits for investment. Do you think that the tax system should recognise that retaining profits should not attract the same taxation as dividends or payments being made?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: As you can imagine, we have had a lot of people saying that there should be some recognition of the need to retain profits. One has to come back to the principle of partnership taxation that 
defaulta 
defaultpartnership can opt not to distribute all the profits and can retain money. My old firm used to do that. But of course those profits will have been subject to tax. So, yes, there have been a lot of suggestions that there ought to be a mechanism whereby, for example, the partnership was taxed at, say, 20%, which will shortly be the corporate tax rate, as it is of course basic rate income tax, and only when that money is advanced to the partners is it tax at the appropriate rates, with national insurance added, class 4, et cetera. We have noted that in the report that we will publish, but without wishing to duck the issue it really gets into such a big policy matter that it is beyond what we have a brief to think about. It is undoubtedly a possible matter. As I am sure you are all very well aware, the Finance Bill, not least because of the way it operates, is trying to police the use of corporate members in a partnership, which were often put in to give a vehicle to retain some money to provide the working capital.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default  Thank you, Lord Chairman. I declare my interests, as in the Register of Members’ Interests, which include being a partner of a number of LLPs, a member of the 
defaultInstitute
default of 
defaultChartered Accountants
default, a member of the Chartered Institute of Tax and the BBCA, and an alumni of your previous firm Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, which became PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the tax department therein. 
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Excellent. I am very pleased to hear it. I pass over to you to answer all the questions then.
defaultThe Chairman:default We are very glad to hear it.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default  My knowledge culminated in 1988, but anyway. There are, as you say, a wide range of businesses and firms in a partnership. Do you perceive that they are speaking with a single voice? Is any representative voice speaking to you?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: The honest answer is no.  There is no partnership grouping, really. There is an association of partnership practitioners, 
defaultwhich is 
defaultperhaps a relatively small group. One can fairly easily identify the now big four accountancy firms. We had a couple of very good meetings with the large law firms, but is there a partnerships voice that we can detect? No there is not. I wonder whether that is 
defaultperhaps 
defaultbecause the partnership sector, if we can call it that, does not realise how big it is. At the same time, a lot of initiatives go down the route of, “We’ll talk to the oil sector or the IT sector”, but the mindset for discussions is to talk to companies or sole traders and forget that there could be a lot of partnerships in there. There is undoubtedly scope for more attention
default&#xad;
default—more clout, if I can use that term—to be given to partnerships, both by businesses and probably by HMRC in how it organi
defaultses itself to deal with partner
defaultships.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default  I look at things another way. I suspect that this figure of 10% might be undercooking it. If you look at the amount of income tax raised and try to establish how much income tax is levied on people in partnerships
default,
default I suspect that it is much greater than 10% in fact.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: It could well be. We did not have those statistics, although I think there is a figure of £150 billion that we talked about in terms of the amount of turnover that we have generated, but you could well be right. 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default  That takes me to this point: do you have any worries that the sector is overrepresented, by which I mean 
defaultthat 
defaultnearly all the private equity firms, PPI firms, chartered accountancy firms, other accountancy firms, tax advisers, lawyers are benefitting from any advantages there might be from being in a partnership? Have you concerns that because they are so dominant in their representations to government and their influence they might have some sort of favoured nation status here?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: No, I do not think so. If anything, I think it is almost the reverse, because I am still not sure that most favoured nation status has been conferred on partnerships. Sometimes it seems the reverse. I will give a couple of examples. As is well known, we have an objective in this country of becoming the most competitive tax system et cetera. One of the manifestations is a reduction in the rate of corporation tax. To some extent that has been paid for by a reduction in the rate of capital allowances available to business. The latter affects partnerships and sole traders, but they have not benefitted from the reduction in the rate of corporation tax. Some allowances—intangibles allowances—are not available to partnerships in the same way they are to companies. When you come down to it, I am not sure that partnerships have had proper treatment and have been properly considered, which possibly comes back to the first half of your question about whether they are speaking with a coherent voice.
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default I would just like to come back to a point that you mentioned about it being not just the partnership sector that is perhaps more effective in its lobbying. You suggested that HMRC might be more effective in the way it deals with partnerships. I wonder how you might envisage that happening. Would there be a separate partnerships division, for instance? What would you advocate?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: HMRC has some very good ways of dealing with partnerships. The large business service deals with the biggest, and the large partnerships unit deals with the next tier, but we feel there might be a gap in that there is no director of partnerships or whatever that might cut across all partnerships. There is no obvious partnerships expert team that is available to all partnerships. One good example that we came up with was cited to us by a practitioner who had a problem with partnerships. He had gone to the agent helpline and the HMRC, and went round the houses trying to get an expert to answer his relatively complex question, but the firm was only small so it was not dealt with by one of the specialist units. Eventually, to HMRC’s credit he got routed round to the large partnership unit and got a good answer from it. Eventually he got there. You start to think, “Should that route into specialist help be available to all?”. Obviously there should be a little filtering to stop the trivial. Equally, you wonder whether somebody in HMRC should have the title of director of partnerships, just to make sure that there is that co-ordinated attention 
defaultto 
defaultpartnerships.
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default That sounds like a sensible idea. Thank you.
defaultLord Joffe:default You say that there is nothing in your experience that suggests that all the organisations—the major companies, lawyers, accountancy firms—have a coherent view on what needs to be done in relation to partnerships. When it comes to an issue like corporate partners, do you not think that there must be a tendency to want to influence events in a way that will enable taxation on corporate partners, general partners and others to be more favourable to them? Would that not be a factor in assessing the balance of the lobbying that takes place on behalf of industry, business and the various major firms?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Yes, I am sure it is, whether the partnerships are large or small. Many of the organisations that involve corporate partnerships are relatively small agricultural partnerships. It is very common for an agricultural partnership, particularly in 
defaultScotland
default, to involve a corporate for landholding reasons, so I am quite sure that separately those partnerships have tended to look at the possibility of using a corporate partner, and possibly putting partnership profits in there to take advantage of the lower rate available in tax to that entity.
defaultMy point was that I am not conscious that there is a really collective group—what one might call a CBI or 
defaultInstitute
default of 
defaultDirectors
default equivalent—for partnerships. That is what I am suggesting does not really exist.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Do you think there are areas of partnership law that encourage avoidance and so necessitate changes, such as those we see in the current draft Bill?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I am not sure I would say that they encourage avoidance. It is certainly the nature of partnerships that have at least given some openings. You are possibly thinking of various loss planning and loss creation schemes, which almost comes back to something that Baroness Wheatcroft talked about: the nature of partnerships. Certainly that feature has led to a certain amount of avoidance, which certainly in terms of loss planning has been well and truly policed over the years. 
defaultOne thing in the current Finance Bill, which in a sense derives from a particular aspect of partnerships
default—
defaultthe LLP
default—
defaultis the way in which LLPs have been set up such that any “partner”—we should really call them members
default—of an LLP will be treated as if
default they are a partner. That has led various people to see that as a route to avoidance. We were cited one so-called LLP partnership that had 20,000 partners in it, which, even in PWC terms, is a little mind bending. Equally, I was told by one practitioner of occasional fruit pickers being officially partners in an LLP.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Are the current problems with LLPs and salaried partners a function of the approach to LLPs that was taken around 2000?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I think they probably are. The way LLPs were set up is that a member of an LLP is to be treated as a partner and taxed accordingly, if I can use that shorthand. At the time, I remember myself and my firm thinking, “This seems to be a bit loose”. Even in some of the discussions that were going on, there were questions as to whether that was really intended. There is a bit of an obvious loophole here in that anybody could be made a member with salaried status, and that might lead to some avoidance. 
defaultTo come back to your first question as to whether there is a partnership law that encourages avoidance, I suppose I have just talked myself into saying that perhaps it does.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Would you therefore say that there has been a large growth in LLPs since they were created? Based on what we have been saying, would you say that this growth has been for commercial reasons or has been motivated by tax?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: If you will forgive me, the only way I can answer that in some ways is to say
default “
defaultboth
default”
default. 
defaultW
defaulte got some interesting figures 
defaulton 
defaultthe numbers of LLPs. For example, in the most recent tax year 10,375 were registered and 5,850 dissolved, which is quite interesting. The figures will be published in our report shortly. When LLPs were envisaged they were seen mainly as an answer to the large accounting firms
default and 
defaulttheir worri
defaultes about being sued as auditors, 
defaultand 
defaultas 
defaultgiving them an opportunity to get a measure of limited liability. 
defaultA
defaultctually, it is quite a far-reaching measure, and it has been a very useful mechanism for all sorts 
defaultand sizes 
defaultof profession. But when you look at the 10,375 that were formed in the past year, you will probably say that they cannot all be firms of accountants, architects, estate agents, et
default 
defaultc
defaultetera
default. There must be some avoidance in that.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Can you confirm the number of large partnerships? Are there not just 100? There are very few very large partnerships.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: There are approximately 200 partnerships with over 100 partners.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default So that would cover the Ernst &amp; Youngs and PWCs—the big firms, and the legal firms.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Correct
default, a
defaultnd indeed the major law firms. In numerical terms, the number of big partnerships is very small. According to the Revenue figures, there are about 1,800 partnerships with over 20 partners.
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default We are probably all aware of companies that have become partnerships for tax avoidance purposes. Is
default not
default the real problem that if you have an advantage—if you 
defaultdo not 
defaulthave a level playing field between companies and partnerships—people will switch from one to another in order to gain the advantage. It is perfectly legitimate for them to do so. Is
default not
default the only real way to solve it to overcome the anomalies and have a level playing field between the two?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I am a great believer in the idea that if the tax system 
defaultsays to 
defaultyou
default,
default “If you go down that route you get tax one way
default. I
defaultf you go down the other route you get tax another way”
default, 
defaultand you have a free choice and definitely go down one route or the other
default, 
defaultyou should be free to choose. I have been a practitioner for many years, and if anybody starts in business at the smaller end of the scale, one of the inevitable questions is, “All right, how are you going to operate—as a sole trader, a partnership or a company?”. Of course there are different tax consequences, and that flows all the way up. If you are offered the chance to have your profits taxed at 20% versus whatever the rate is—47% if you include national insurance, perhaps—and that helps you, to go back to Lord Leigh’s question, to retain working capital
default, 
defaultif you definitely go down that route it is a choice. It is hard to say that you should not be allowed at least to go down that route if you definitely go down it and you do not put up some sort of structure that does not really exist to pretend that you are going down that route.
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default Chairman, I was not really suggesting 
defaultthat they should not go down that
default route
default. 
defaultI was suggesting that the solution to the problem is to make sure that the anomaly between the two does not exist.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: That may come back, as I think you are alluding
default, to levelling the tax rates or 
defaultthe ability to retain profits. That would be very interesting.
defaultThe Chairman:default Why was it thought inappropriate to apply to LLP members the same employment status tests as apply to general partnerships?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: If I am honest, my Lord, I do not know. Are you referring back to the lead-up to the 2000 Act?
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I do not know. It was discussed, and of course what was envisaged—and certainly what firms who are interested in the status wanted—was that if
default, for example,
default I was a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers, I would be a partner, or member, in the LLP. That is where I think most of the firms began and ended rather than expecting that it would be somewhat wider, in effect.
defaultThe Chairman:default I am afraid that we have another vote, so we will have to go to vote and then get back again as quickly as we can.
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House
defaultThe Chairman:default In the interests of time, perhaps we should start, although we are not all here. To follow up on the answer you gave before the Division, the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 includes the test of whether an LLP member is a true partner by testing whether they would be a partner in a general partnership. I gather that this applies for employment law purposes, for example. Why could it not apply for tax purposes, to solve the current problems?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Again, I do not know why it was not taken down that route. As I commented beforehand, I think that it was simply done in the way it was done because it seemed at the time to be opening up possibilities of avoidance or planning. Could it be used as a route now? Yes. I suppose that what the various anti-avoidance provisions try to do in the current draft Finance Bill is in some ways to write those down a little more precisely and in effect try to 
defaultset out some rules
default 
defaulton 
defaultwhat a salaried member
default 
defaultis. I suppose it is trying to go a little further than that original rule, although I am not privy to the drafting of it—I have not been involved in that—so to a degree I am speculating as to why it is not being done along 
defaultthose lines
default.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default This goes to the nub of the issue. If one is going to claim that one is in a partnership, that needs to be demonstrably the case rather than just announcing it, particularly when you talk about instances of 20,000 or so
default. I
defaults that what you said?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: That was the biggest we found.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default But I have seen instances even of where 20 out of 22 people working in the enterprise were deemed to be partners. One of the conditions that does not seem to be addressed anywhere is whether the individual has contributed and continues to contribute capital to the enterprise. Would you regard this as a defining rule to determine whether someone is a partner or an employee?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: With respect, there is a capital contribution, because there are the three tests, broadly, of variable profits, influence over the management, and capital contribution. 
defaultT
defaulthose three are there, and I would agree with you that all three are potential factors, although probably to my mind the two key ones are that you put in capital to the firm and your reward is linked to the success of the firm and, to a degree, yourself. To me, the simplest acid test is what happens if the firm makes no profit
default this year
default, or indeed makes a loss
default.
default What do you or I get out of it? If the answer is broadly that I get nothing if the firm has made nothing
default. T
defaulthat is a reasonable indicator that it is a partnership and not some sort of disguised salary. If the answer is, “I’m still getting my £50,000 or £100,000”, that is far more like a salary.
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default Do the economic risks and reward tests identify correctly an employee rather than a partner, and might they not produce rather odd results?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: There is a risk with almost any of these rules that you will get some slightly odd results. In a sense, I am sure that we are all sitting here thinking, “Well, we can recognise a partner or an employee”, and frankly, we probably can. It is when trying to write it down precisely that you will get some odd results or some hard cases either side. In a sense that almost brings us back to the way we try to operate in simplification. We accept that if we simplify the system, that might lead to some odd results, and it is a bit of a judgment call as to whether it is worth those odd results—those hard cases either side—to get a certain amount of precision. It is difficult. 
defaultOne thread that is interesting is
default whether
default, if someone is recategorised as an employee, if we term it that
default, and is 
defaultno longer a partner
default, 
defaultthey get their employment rights
default. The answer is 
defaultprobably not. Here we have a bit of an over
defaulttone of 
defaultthe inquiry
default, which 
defaultsome of your colleagues are involved with
default,
default into IR35 and personal service companies. That is another factor
default:
default that we can see the mischief and potentially remedy it. 
defaultBut
default I am not sure even there 
defaultwhether 
defaultthe remedy is whole
default. If 
defaultsomeone is recategorised as an employee, do they get all the consequences?
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default Can we move on to the rules for taxing partnerships where there are corporate partners? I declare a further interest in that the LLP of which I am a member has a corporate member therein. Presumably there are problems here for understanding in some instances why there is a corporate partner in an LLP.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Yes. 
defaultO
defaultne concern 
defaultthat 
defaultmany people have 
defaultexpressed 
defaultto us as we have gone 
defaulta
defaultround 
defaultis 
defaultthat HMRC has 
defaultthe 
defaultstance that if there is a corporate partner in the LLP or the partnership, that must be for avoidance reasons. We have also talked to HMRC, which stresses and has demonstrated that that is not the case. Everybody recognises that there can be perfectly valid commercial reasons for having a corporate partner
default. 
defaultI mentioned
default 
defaultScotland
default 
defaultearlier
default, where 
defaultfor
default various reasons
default 
defaultagricultural rights 
defaultare held 
defaultthrough a company, which landlords will often require. 
defaultBut 
defaultundoubtedly the reason for having a corporate partner in some instances is to accumulate profits—to provide working capital. An interesting question is when that goes from commercial into avoidance. The draft law tries to put down that if it is a reasonable reward—a reasonable amount
default, 
defaultan appropriate notional profit to this corporate partner—that is fair enough. However, one of the difficulties will be judging when you have gone beyond what is reasonable into what is excessive.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default Can we push you a little as to whether you think the proposed legislation is workable and fair?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I have to come back to something I said, which is that we in the OTS have not studied the anti-avoidance legislation in detail
default. I
defaultt is outwith our remit. So I do not claim an expert knowledge of it. I would answer your question
default by saying
default that I can see plenty of scope for argument
default 
defaulton where the boundary is, what will be reasonable, et
default 
defaultc
defaultetera
default. I can also see some practical difficulties. To give one instance, perhaps inevitably these new rules will come in on 6 April. Many people have said, “Why will they not come in at the start or the end of an accounting period, which might be a bit cleaner?”. 
defaultT
defaulthere will also be difficulties with the salary partner route until, frankly, experience is accumulated and we perhaps know where the boundaries really are.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default Yes
default,
default and as you say, there are quite a few bona fide commercial reasons. I think that the most common reason outside 
defaultScotland
default is the lease.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Yes. That sort of landholding and leaseholding is very often the reason
default. 
defaultI mention 
defaultScotland
default in particular because 
defaultit 
defaultseem
defaults
default to be very keen on the idea, but it is prevalent throughout the country that it can be just a way of operating.
defaultLord Joffe:default You mention that corporate members can be a way of accumulating profits. I do not quite understand how you can accumulate profits and pay tax at the same time, except that perhaps you have less money to accumulate. However, that cannot be a fundamental reason for condoning or creating the opportunity to avoid tax, so that you can make further profits than you would if you had paid tax.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I take slight issue with that
default. You might 
defaultsay, “I am going to accumulate profits in my corporate partner. I will pay the tax that is due on that”—potentially 20% or 23%, which is the corporation tax rate—“and of course, when I withdraw the profits from there, I will have further tax to pay at income tax rates”. A lot of firms have used that simply to build up a certain amount of working capital that is, shall we say, lightly taxed rather than fully taxed at the 45%-50% tax rate and retained after that. You are absolutely right that it is a way of retaining more profit perhaps, but it does not really avoid but perhaps delays the tax charge. Of course, 
defaultyou cannot do that 
defaultif it is in the corporate
default. C
defaultertainly in the firms I used to be in I could not get that money out
default. I
defaultt was not my money. If and when it was given to me, I would have paid tax on it.
defaultThe Chairman:default Are there any other questions on partnerships? I will now turn to the other area I want to discuss with you, which is the new approach to tax policy-making.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default Mr Whiting, you are better qualified than most to talk about the Government’s approach to tax policy-making
default. Y
defaultou have seen it from both sides now, I suppose. Do you think that the new approach is working as the Government would like it to work? Is it a change for the better?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Yes, I think it is very much a change for the better, and the Government are to be congratulated on introducing the new approach. To put 
defaultthat into 
defaulta bit of context, not just the current Government but the previous Government deserve credit for introducing far more consultation than used to be the case, so consultation is now the norm. The tax policy-making new approach has been a good development of that. You probably sensed that a “but” is coming, and there is, in the sense that it works well if it is allowed to. There are obviously occasions where the full process is not allowed to work. The idea is that we come up with the idea, consult 
defaulton 
defaultit, then refine it and consult 
defaulton 
defaultthe next one, so there are three stages, which takes a bit of time and effort but generally gets a good result. The “but” comes where we potentially jump to stage 2 or even stage 3. Sometimes that is very necessary. Government must always have the power to say, “No
default, 
defaultwe need to take quick action there”
default. O
defaultf course that is the case
default, but
default sometimes you think that things could have benefited from going through the whole process properly.
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default Certainly in a previous report from this Committee there was criticism of the Government’s failure to consult in the detail they might have done when time was not of the essence. Do you think that happens, not regularly but often enough to cause concern?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Any occasion where it happens and you look at something and think, “Come on, that could have been done a lot better
default. Y
defaultou had the time”, must be a cause for concern. 
defaultBut
default let us be clear: in context, we are in a much better position than we used to be in. Comparing notes with opposite numbers in other countries, 
defaultwe can see that 
defaultmany of them are immensely jealous of the process that we go through and think it is a much better process. So we are in a pretty good place, but sometimes you appreciate that 
defaultonly when you 
defaultalmost see the wheels come off the machine. If 
defaultyou 
defaultlook at recent Acts or the current Bill, you can see some good things
default, such as
default insurance companies a couple of years ago, CFCs, last year’s general anti-avoidance rule, this year’s share schemes and loans to participators, trusts for vulnerable beneficiaries
default. T
defaulthey were all worked out carefully.
defaultBut then a couple of years ago the VAT on food changed—obviously we are not so good—and last year there were income tax losses, which are not so good. You feel that if we had taken a bit more time, it could have been better. You even see that at the last minute; we know that the parliamentary counsel—the draftsmen—are put under immense pressure to come up with amendments at the last minute. The time is not there to really think through the provisions, and you worry that at the end there will be some gaps.
defaultThe Chairman:default In some of those cases it may be the result of some political pressure or something of that sort, or a desire for the Chancellor to introduce a lollipop, or whatever—all those little things. Do you think that is mainly where the problems have arisen so far, not in the wider tax reforms?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Undoubtedly, we always recognise that politics has to play a part here and that it has to be up to the Government to have the power to change the tax law. However, in a sense, we come back to the fact that our annual Finance Bill cycle is both a curse and a blessing. It enables the Chancellor to bring through a change very quickly and to be certain that it will go through. It requires a bit of self-denying ordinance to say, “Actually, we ought to slow down and take it through carefully”, to take the time to build things up. However, we have to recognise that politics will dictate that sometimes changes have to be made. It would be very nice if the rules in the tax policy-making document were, if not a law, at least something that had to be perhaps formally explained to Parliament when they were not gone through
default and
default why it was necessary to breach them.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Joffe:default On the question of how the existing policy partnership is working—and I think you have outlined that you think that it is working reasonably well—what, if anything, do you think needs to change?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: The policy partnership between HMRC and the Treasury works pretty well. It is very interesting to be more on the inside, as it were, and seeing it in evidence, going to meetings where—certainly on our own products—there are always Treasury and HMRC people and there is a pretty good liaison. I still have some concerns
default, such as
default whether the Treasury people have the tax experience, and indeed the commercial experience, that they would
default 
defaulthave 
defaultideally. They tend to move on very quickly. I still have concerns as to whether policy work in HMRC has the status that it might, but the appointment of Edward Troop as the Tax Assurance Commissioner and leader of the tax profession is quite an important step forward. So it is positive and it is going in the right direction. Is it perfect? No
default,
default but then few things are. There is always scope for making sure that it is working. It works tolerably well. You can sense that there are frustrations and strains all around HMRC, which is instinctively cautious
default. S
defaultometimes it says, “Hold on”. Is that the right thing? Not always, but sometimes it can be quite helpful to have it say that.
defaultLord Joffe:default Arising from this, part of the Government’s policy is that all interested parties should be consulted: business, practitioners, and individual taxpayers. How successful has it been at considering the views of individual taxpayers, individuals and organisations that are concerned about tax evasion and tax avoidance?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Again, it has been pretty good. This comes back to the amount of consultation that goes on. It is far better than it was
default. T
defaulthere is a very open attitude to consultation, and most of us who contribute, whether we are from bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which I am still involved with, or firms or individuals, are wil
defaultling to put things in, provided
default that we know that they are being listened to. There is at times a slight concern that a lot of consultation goes on, but are our views being listened to? The real thing that consultation should add to the process is practical experience and knowledge. What is really going to happen? HMRC may think that it knows what happens in practice, but it does not necessarily know, and there is a similar situation with the Treasury. Therefore part of that consultation process—going out to talk to businesses and individuals—should be to gather in what happens. In a sense, going back to our work, that is certainly something 
defaultthat 
defaultwe try to do. It is then incumbent on HMRC and the Treasury to sit back and say, “Right
default, 
defaultwe now know what people think is the case
default. L
defaultet’s try to synthesise this and give it proper weight”.
defaultThe Chairman:default But you suggested earlier on that many other countries look on our process of consultation now as well in advance of what they do. Despite your criticism, is that still your view
default:
default that we are making faster progress?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I think we are doing well and that we have a pretty good process. Again, I regret that I have been in practice long enough to remember when things just arrived on Budget day in March, we were in the Finance Bill three weeks later, and that was that. We would think, “This is jolly interesting
default. 
defaultI wonder what it means”. Life has moved on constructively since then. Is it perfect? No. This comes back to the idea, “
defaultI
defaultf consultation were really enshrined as the norm”. I come back to the idea that we were really sure that what we were saying was being taken into account, because at times you think, “We’ve put a lot of comments in, but have they really listened? I’m not sure that they have”. It would be quite interesting if, for example, Finance Bill Committees routinely took evidence from experts. I am obviously alluding here to the Committee in the other place that might usefully and constructively call in experts to ask them, “On the partnership provisions, do you think you’ve had a fair hearing, in effect?”.
defaultThe Chairman:default Here you are talking in particular about systems, processes—not just the tax rates or anything of that sort. You are talking about major tax reforms and things of that sort.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Yes. On tax rates, I do not think that there is an expectation that there would be consultation about the rates, although consulting just to make sure that we understand the impact is maybe occasionally necessary
default. O
defaultil taxation was a case in point a few years ago. However, I do not expect anybody to consult on whether to do anti-avoidance. I might expect them to consult as to whether the law is going to work, so the decision is taken
default. J
defaultumping to stage 2 or 3 is fair enough, but let us at least consult about the letter of the law on it.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default On the policy partnerships, are there any specific things you would still wish to see done that are not being done at the moment
default, such as
default an audit of tax skills in the two departments?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I do not think so, because I know that certainly in HMRC, Edward Troop, who I mentioned as the leader of the profession, is trying to increase skills, so action is being taken there. If I have a concern it is at the Treasury end
default and 
defaultwhether the knowledge of tax practice and theory
default 
defaultis as in-depth as it should be. That concern is no criticism of the people there, who are extremely bright and able
default. I
defaultt is just the way they tend to move on. An 18-month posting can be quite a long time at the Treasury.
defaultThe Chairman:default But if the relationship is extremely close, would Treasury officials 
defaultnot 
defaultask HMRC for the detailed tax advice?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Exactly so, my Lord, and that is how it should operate. I cannot honestly say that it always operates like that, because I am not privy to them all. If I have alluded to one or two things where it did not go well, I do not know why it did not go well, and it would be interesting to investigate further.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Just to build on this, there is an argument that the Treasury makes all the policy but does not have the knowledge, or as much of the knowledge, and does not have the sharp-end experience that HMRC has, and that HMRC sees itself as just an operational arm and 
defaultis 
defaultlooked upon as such by the Treasury. There is a complete disconnect
default. W
defaulte are not making the most of the sharp-end experience of HMRC in policy-making, and the two operate in silos. Also, with hindsight, do you think it was a good idea to put together the Inland Revenue and Customs, and has that made this problem worse or, looking back on it, has it helped?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I recognise the description of silos, to pick up on the first half of your question. However, it is not happening. I am quite encouraged by the way things are operating together. As I have alluded to, I am not sure that it is perfect
default. A
defaultt times you can see 
defaultHMRC saying
default, “No
default, 
defaultthis won’t work”, and I am not sure that HM Treasury has the skills and knowledge to challenge
default 
defaultwhy something will not work. 
defaultSo y
defaultou need knowledge on both sides. On the second half of your question whether it was right to put Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise together, I still believe very much that it was. I supported it at the time, and it was the right method, not just because that gives us one tax authority, although that is a major factor, but because it offers the chance to combine all the skills and look again at how things should operate. It makes sense to have one tax authority. If there was a fault, that was possibly in how quickly it was put together and how the potential staff savings and efficiencies were banked, as it were, before everything had been followed through. Current management is still dealing with some of the issues that could have been picked up a few years ago. I suppose that at this point I should declare my own position as a non-executive director of HM Revenue &amp; Customs.
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default I have a question that brings together the two strands of our inquiry this afternoon: consultation and partnerships. One member of this Committee who is not here this afternoon 
defaulttold 
defaultme that he had asked a partner of one of the big four accounting firms if they would come to give evidence to this Committee. The response was a very prompt, “Absolutely not. It works far too well for us for us to want to say anything that might destabilise it”. Do you recognise that?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I presume they are saying that they end up with the partnership result with national insurance advantages as much as anything, and that they would have concerns that if it was stirred up, it could only get worse. The counter to that is of course, as we have discussed at the Committee, the possibility of getting a more benign regime for retaining profits and perhaps solving some of the other issues that are around. I would not be surprised if equally the partner in question was motivated by the fear of the unknown
default, 
defaultworry about change and 
defaultthe 
defaultfeeling that it is difficult enough as it is and is bound to get worse if there are changes. However, I would hope that he or she had their tongue slightly in 
defaulttheir 
defaultcheek when they said that, although I do not know.
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default I think it may have been, but only in the wrong way.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Our report of 2011 recommended that the policy framework should include a more formal commitment to post-implementation reviews of significant tax changes. As I am sure you know, that recommendation was not taken up—the Government decided not to adopt it. Do you think that events since then have strengthened the case for mandating such reviews?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Yes. I am a great fan of the post-implementation review. Coming from a private sector business background one is used to either one’s clients or the firm doing something and then seeing how it went, whether we can learn lessons from it, whether it worked as we intended, 
defaultand 
defaultwhether there are still problems. In some ways I find it hard to see why we would not want to do post-implementation reviews of tax changes. Has it worked as we intended? Are there gaps in the legislation? Is it raising the money that we thought it was? Crucially, what about the admin burden, because these days it is one of the most important things. Obviously this brings me right back to my own patch. Changes always come with a tax impact assessment, a tax information impact note, which says that the burden will be such and such. Should we not look to see whether that was actually delivered and that was the burden on business? Did we get it right? Was it worth putting on a burden of so much to raise so much? The one slight caveat I would make is that I do not think it would be right to say that every provision should be reviewed after a set number of years or whatever, because I think you would want to tailor it a bit. 
defaultI do think that anything major should be reviewed. For example, as of last year we now have a statutory residence test. That is a very major thing. Surely we should be looking in two years’ time perhaps to see how it has gone. Other things you might want to review more quickly or more slowly. Just to prove that we practise what we preach, when we recommended a disincorporation relief we said that it should have a five-year life and be reviewed after five years to see whether it was worth continuing with. If it is not worth it or if it has done its job, it can go, but you do want to make sure that things do their job.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Therefore, do you consider that the Government’s normal monitoring and evaluation arrangements have proved adequate to the task of assessing whether an implemented tax change has met its policy intent?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I am not sure that they have. It comes back to whether something such as a statutory residence test is properly evaluated. That ought to involve a good repeat consultation exercise. “How was it for you?”, “What has the impact been on business”, et cetera. I am not sure that the Government just doing a simple evaluation and probably just checking that the revenues have been delivered is wide enough in scope.
defaultThe Chairman:default There are post-implementation reviews in other policy areas, apart from tax, that are accepted. Do you think there is anything peculiar about tax that prevents post-implementation reviews?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I see 
defaultno
default justification for it, no.
defaultThe Chairman:default Could the answer be that if there is sufficient public or professional concern about the way a particular tax is operating, that can be expressed through the political process by arguing for changes in a future Finance Bill?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: That is an absolutely fair point. Of course, if you do want to evaluate something, there is always the risk that you go out and say, “What did you think of that change?”. Everybody who has benefitted will either say, “That was quite nice”, or keep quiet, and anybody who has been disadvantaged will be on the barricades again. The Government might predictably feel, “Oh dear, we can’t go through all that again”. I can see 
defaultthat 
defaultthat is an argument, and that therefore perhaps the best way is to allow people to write to their MPs or whatever about it, but it should be possible to get past that and do a proper evaluation of how it has gone. If I can keep using the statutory residence test as an example, it would be difficult to do that just by expecting letters to MPs, because you ought to be 
defaultasking
default major businesses, or indeed modest ones, whether it has helped them in the way they bring in people, send people out, perhaps talk to some high net worth people and ask whether they get greater certainty. You want to direct the evaluation rather than perhaps just standing back and getting it slightly at random.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default  Post-implementation reviews and consultation undoubtedly take time and resource. Is there a resource problem with HMRC and the Treasury in carrying out such consultations and reviews in these days of cutbacks?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: There is certainly 
defaultthe 
defaultrisk of a resource problem, not just in HMRC and the Treasury but in the private sector
default,
default with bodies such as my own or my old firm. We all want to contribute, and a certain element of people feel that consultation fatigue is setting in because there is so much. You can almost have too much of a good thing. The counter to that—if I can go back to what I said earlier—is that if it really is being listened to and if we are getting a better result, then we are all willing to contribute, and I am sure that goes for HMRC and the Treasury as well. At the end of the day, we all want a better system that works better for the country and minimises the burdens on businesses and individuals.
defaultThe Chairman:default Which suggests using your subjects for consultation carefully and not just spreading it across the board as a general principle.
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: Yes, but then you should not duck a difficult issue, should you? If there has been an unpopular tax change, the Government should still have a look and say, “We had to do that”. The high-income child benefit charge might be an example. It had to be done. That was a decision, but was it done as well as possible?
defaultThe Chairman:default Mr Whiting, are there any other points that you want to make to us on both subjects?
defaultJohn Whitingdefault: I think not, my Lord. You have given me a very fair hearing, and thank you.
