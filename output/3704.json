"&#xa0;\nThe Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP – Supplementary written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAt the evidence session on 6 November, you asked me to consider\n the evidence of Lord Norton and others relating to the order-making power in clause 51 to disapply legislation that is no longer of practical use.  You also asked for examples of the potential use of clause clause 49(1)(b) (power to spell out dates descri\nbed in legislation).\n&#xa0;\nI have considered the evidence presented to and by the Committee on the power in clause 51.  Whilst I remain strongly of the belief that the power is both modest and appropriate, I recognise that further reassurances are required to a\nddress some of the concerns that have been expressed.  In response, therefore, I would be content to consider amending the drafting of clause 51 in the following ways if it would provide the reassurances that the Committee and others seek:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI hope that the Committee will accept that if a suitable definition of ‘no longer of practical use’ is set out on the fac\ne of the Bill (as in option one, above), that the perceived need for increased levels of scrutiny would no longer apply.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, I recognise that members of the Committee had concerns that the reference to ministerial determination of ‘no longer of p\nractical use’ could lead to an abuse of the intended purpose of the power.  I am therefore content to remove the reference to the Minister in this instance if i\nt would alleviate this concern.\n&#xa0;\nI note also that concern was expressed over reference to the co\nnsent of Scottish Ministers as opposed to the Scottish Parliament in the exercise of this power.  Consultation with the devolved administrations is continuing and we will consider the appropriate level of consent in light of that engagement.\n&#xa0;\nFinally, you \nasked for examples of the potential use of clause 49(1)(b).  I hope that the following two examples are suitably illustrative:\n&#xa0;\nExample 1:\n&#xa0;\nBefore\nSection 4(7) of the Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009 says:\n&#xa0;\n“This Act expires at the end of th\ne period of 10 years beginning with the day on which it is passed.\n&#xa0;\nAfter\nClause 49(1)(b) of the Deregulation Bill could amend the provision to say:\n&#xa0;\n“This Act expires at the end of the period of 10 years beginning with 12 November 2009 (the day on which \nthis Act was passed).”\n&#xa0;\nExample 2:\n&#xa0;\nBefore\nSection 73(1) of the Charities Act 2006:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n“The Minister must, before the end of the period of five years beginning with the day on which this Act is passed, appoint a person to review generally the\n operation of this Act.”\n&#xa0;\nAfter\nClause 49(1)(b) of the Deregulation Bill could amend the provision to say:\n&#xa0;\n“The Minister must, before the end of the period of five years beginning with the 8 November 2006 (the day on which this Act was passed), appoint a \nperson to review generally the operation of this Act.”\n&#xa0;\nIn my view, this simple change is a great step forward in providing clarity for the reader of legislation. Acts of Parliament often contain numerous references to commencement dates and other related \nevents.  These references are of little use to the reader unless they are familiar with the date on which that event occurred.  If they are not, further research is required before they can understand when certain provisions come into force or related even\nts occur.  The proposed power will be of great assistance to users of legislation in that the information can now be clearly presented in the text of the Act.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
