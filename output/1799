defaultWritten evidence submitted by Amy Boyd (WSC083)defaultDeclaration of interests
defaultI am a postdoctoral researcher so it is in my interest to see some of the changes outlined below realised. Otherwise no competing interests.
default The views expressed are my own and are not a reflection of the views or policies of my employer.
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA clich√© but I believe mainly this is due to the 
defaulttime and energy 
defaultdemand
defaults of 
defaultchildcare (even if children are at nursery etc)
default and other domestic 
defaultresponsibilities
default.
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAcademic contracts are generally short term which does not provide 
defaultfinancial
default security.
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch positions are not particularly well paid so if a family has 3 children
default 
defaultthis will mean that practically all one parents salary may go towards childcare
default.
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTaking time out to have children can negatively impact upon publication rate which is a major consideration in academia. I believe some funding bodies now take this into 
defaultconsideration when assessing applications.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAllow flexible working. Perhaps make it compulsory 
defaultto have a trial period before a final decision is made to ensure that flexible working is a realistic solution in any given instance.
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMake it easier for funding arrangements to be altered to part time work or job sharing if acceptable to employer.
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsure t
defaulthat flexible working is also an option for men in STEM careers and that their funding arrangements can also be altered easily. This allows men to support their partners careers. Partners of many scientists I know are married to other STEM professionals.
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMa
defaultke some kind of allowance for days taken off sick with children. At the moment there is parental leave but this needs to be booked in 
defaultadvance in 
defaultblocks of a week, requiring you to know when you child will fall 
defaultill!
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe University of Oxford Zoology department 
defaultgenerally supports 
defaultflexible working. This generates goodwill between employee and employer, as the employee is incentivised to show that they can be as productive while using their time in the most efficient way 
defaultpossible. On a personal note, my supervisor supports flexible working. This allows me to (for example) start work early when I am most productive and leave early to do household tasks, freeing up the evening for me to work more if required. I have worked f
defaultor people who insist on attendance to a strict timetable and this does not make me feel like going the extra mile. In those situations I would work my hours but not a second more.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLegislate to support points 2.1. to 2.4.
