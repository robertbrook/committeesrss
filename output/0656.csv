defaultResearch Councils UK is a strategic partnership set up to champion research supported by the seven UK Research Councils.  RCUK was established in 2002 to enable the Councils to work together more effectively to enhance the overall impact and effectiveness of their research, training and innovation activities, contributing to the Government’s objectives for science and innovation.

defaultOverview default&#xa0;default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe RCUK Public Engagement with Research Strategy outlines a strategic commitment to identifying public attitudes and values to be considered throughout the lifecycle of research, and
default to
default foster debate that will enable public aspirations and concerns to help inform Councils’ policies and research strategies.  The term ‘public understanding’ is considered an outdated term
default. Instead 
default‘public engagement’
default 
defaultencompasses the notion of ‘two way dialogue’ with the public
default.
default It is important that the public can access the knowledge generated and have their say. 
defaultEngaging the public in this way helps empower people, broadens attitudes and ensures greater relevance, accountability and transparency to society and wider social concerns
default. It
default is therefore more likely to have a positive impact.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThrough their network of science communications professionals, the Research Councils and their component institutes develop and deliver strategic science communication
defaults
default designed to 
defaultinform and engage the public on 
defaultglobal environmental i
defaultssues including climate change. This is alongside two-way engagement and dialogue with the public. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany Research Council-funded climate scientists are actively involved in climate change communication, engagement and dialogue with the public and wider stakeholders. Those scientists regularly provide specific expertise to Government departments to inform policy development. The RCUK led Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research has over 50 signatories and supporters and provides a single unambiguous statement regarding the importance of public engagement from the UK funders of Research, including the Research Councils. It sets out clear expectations to ensure that researchers are recognised,
default 
defaultrewarded and supported for their public engagement. 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Beacons for Public Engagement
default and RCUK Catalysts
default also aim to facilitate culture change to embed public engagement and science communication within the Higher Education (HE) sector.  Practical support is available through the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE) and researchers can apply for resources to support their public engagement as part of their Pathways to Impact within research grant funding. 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRCUK, their component institutes and researchers keep abreast of how issues are reported in the media, within parliament and in wider society. They exchange knowledge and ideas about public attitudes to and engagement with climate science by working with Government departments, the media, the science media centre, science centres, museums, NGOs, learned societies and the public. They analyse and discuss public surveys and academic reports, carry out public dialogues and engagement activities, commission focus group research and hold internal workshops on communicating climate science.  These help shape climate engagement and dialogue strategies and activities.
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSeveral UK and US surveys have captured information about this issue, including the 2012 
defaultLiving with Environmental Change
default-sponsored report “Climate Science, the Public and the News Media” by Shuckburgh, Robinson and Pidgeon.  Findings are reasonably consistent across these surveys, indicating a range of public understanding of what is meant by climate change and an increase in scepticism regarding the human causes and the risks of climate change in recent years. For example, the UK Polling Report April 2013 – “
defaultGlobal Warming” or “Climate Change
default”’
default summarises as follows:
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2008
default, 55% thought human activity was making the world warmer, 25% thought the world was getting warmer, but not because of humanity, 7% thought the world was NOT getting warmer. 13% weren’t sure.
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn
default 2013
default 39% think human activity is making the world warmer, 16% think the world is getting warmer, but not because of humanity, 28% think the world was NOT getting warmer. 17% weren’t sure.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2011 ‘Public Attitudes to Science’ (PAS) Survey (carried out by Ipsos Mori for BIS) reports that:
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOf the science topics explored in the survey, people felt most informed about climate   
defaultchange, with 16% feeling very well informed and 59% feeling fairly well informed.
default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of weighing up the benefits and risks of Climate Change research, the number who felt that the benefits are greater doubled between 2005 and 2011 and the number who felt that the risks are greater almost halved in the same period.
defaultii. Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment must draw on the advice and expertise from within the research community to contribute to evidence based policy making.  The 2012 RCUK review of Public Dialogues showed that successful public dialogue can play a key role in supporting more open research governance and decision making, which is recognised to be a condition of wider public confidence in the research system.  Therefore, government departments, scientific advisors and individual researchers have a key role and responsibility in communicating and engaging with the public on climate science issues in order to inform research and policy.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) research synthesis on “Public Attitudes to Environmental Change: a selective review of theory and practice” (Upham et al 2009)
default showed that:  
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe literature on UK public attitudes to environmental change is highly variable in quantity. Notably, there is substantially more literature on UK attitudes to climate change and energy infrastructure than on UK attitudes to landscape and species change. The literature is not organised in terms of an environmental change or adaptation theme: it is scattered across disciplines, with a wide variety of theories or no explicit theory at all.
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClimate change is perceived as a remote issue, with other issues more pressing; impacts befalling future generations and other regions; others’ actions as primary causes; responsibility for tackling it assigned principally to government.
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no simple relationship between attitudes, engagement and behaviour change. If engagement is undertaken for the purpose of changing attitudes and/or encouraging behaviour change, a wider range of contextual factors will need to be addressed.
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile public support for mitigation action is high, willingness to change personal behaviour (particularly travel) is limited by various perceived individual, social and structural barriers.
default(e)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn respect of specific climate change impacts, most existing research relates to public perceptions of flooding. There is very little research on
default public attitudes to sea
default‐
defaultlevel rise or abrupt climate change.
default(f)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe existing research literature suggests that place attachment, environmental values and ideas of what is ‘right and normal’ are closely involved in the formation of attitudes to ecosystem, lan
defaultdscape and species change.
default(g)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWell
default‐
defaultknown renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are viewed positively by the general public. Although public attitudes to lesser
default‐
defaultknown renewables tend to be less favourable, they are still more positive than attitude
defaults to fossil fuels and nuclear power.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to national surveys and focus group research a reasonable number of people trust independent scientists and climate scientists.  For example: ‘
defaultClimate Science, the Public and the News Media
default’ (Shuckburgh et al. 2012) indicated that views on whether climate scientists can be trusted were quite polarised in 2011 with just over one-third of the UK public agreeing that they could trust climate scientists to tell the truth about climate change and about one-third disagreeing. A recent poll by the British Science Association
default has indicated a significant increase in trust in 2013 with 52% agreeing that climate scientists can be trusted and only 19% disagreeing.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs part of the Ipsos MORI 
defaultClimate Week poll on public attitudes regarding climate change (February 2012)
default, i
defaultn response to the question ‘ 
defaultWhich of the following, if any, would you trust the most if they were giving views on climate change
default’ 66% said ‘
defaultScientists
default’.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese polls (and others) suggest that there is scope for climate scientists and their Research Councils to continue to build on this trust. However, whilst most publicly-funded climate scientists will acknowledge that their research is relevant to society, engaging in what can often be a challenging dialogue about controversial issues can be a daunting task. Continued support from RCUK will be essential in encouraging researchers to overcome these barriers. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the aims in the RCUK Public Engagement with Research Strategy is to support researchers to engage with the public. The RCUK-led Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research provides a single unambiguous statement regarding the importance of public engagement and sets out clear expectations to ensure that researchers are recognised, rewarded and supported for their public engagement. The Beacons for Public Engagement and RCUK Catalysts also aim to facilitate culture change to embed public engagement and science communication within the HE sector.  Practical support is available through the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE) and researchers can apply for resources to support their public engagement as part of their Pathways to Impact within research grant funding.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSpecialist media training and support from communications teams to ‘translate’ complex and complicated scientific knowledge into a language and form that is meaningful and relevant to different sectors of society are other examples of activities that facilitate the flow of climate science into the public domain. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt would be beneficial if Government Departments and science advisors to Government continued to emphasise strongly the importance and value that it places on ‘independent’ climate knowledge generated by publicly-funded scientists, and that the effort that climate scientists make to explain their findings to the public and to engage in dialogue is vital and valued at the highest level. 
default&#xa0;
defaultiii. How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch Councils (RCs) and their component institutes and many RC-funded researchers within the university sector engage in science communication and public engagement activities targeted at all sectors of society from school children to MPs.  There are many examples of successful partnership working between RCs and leading UK museums, science centres, learned societies where the common goal is public awareness, engagement and understanding of climate science.  For example the ‘Atmosphere’ exhibition at the Science Museum
default involved many publicly-funded researchers in the preparation of exhibition content and online interactive resources.  
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith regards to improving public understanding of Climate Science, the LWEC research synthesis on “Public Attitudes to Environmental Change: a selective review of theory and practice” (Upham et al 2009) found that:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a need for targeted communication about climate change, to dispel misperceptions and highlight the benefits of specific behavioural changes, mitigation and adaption options, as well as to open up debate around change to infrastructures and societal arrangements.
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a priority there should be focus on improving understanding amongst key groups and there is potential for addressing specific behaviours.
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a major gap in the understanding of attitudes to small
default‐
defaultscale renewable energy and the decision
default‐
defaultmaking processes involved in purchasing small scale renewable energy systems.
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPositive experiences of renewable energy projects and development processes should be investigated so that both support and opposition ar
defaulte more fully understood.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe media has an important role to play in this debate. Evidence from polls and surveys reveal that most people get their information about climate science from the media. One of the barriers for many publicly-funded scientists is the challenge of competing with the voice of the sceptic. The media may try to report a ‘balanced’ view of a topic, by ensuring the voice of the sceptic is included equally even though the balance of scientific evidence may not be equal.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRCUK and its component institutes invest resources in proactive media engagement.  Media training for scientists (including dealing with climate-skeptics), briefings at the Science Media Centre and direct dialogue with journalists and editors take place continuously
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The BIS-commissioned expert report on science and the media
default Action Plan makes many recommendations to 
defaultsupport the accurate reporting of science
default that provide an effective framework for improving public understanding of and engagement in climate science.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe issue of how inherent risk and uncertainty are handled in scientific research (i.e. that it’s not always about having definitive answers) is highlighted within the BIS Science and Trust report. The report calls for greater openness, transparency and a greater acknowledgement around the risks and uncertainty of the scientific process. This issue is being addressed, for example by, Sense about Science
default. NERC contributes to their work on ‘Making Sense of Uncertainty’. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultiv. How important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy? default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is common to assume that the root of public distrust is a lack of understanding. However, there is a body of evidence to suggest that this is not the case. The public, alongside other key stakeholders should be consulted within policy. 
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome of the positive impacts of public dialogue are reported as:
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBetter policy solutionsdefault that are more robust, legitimate, socially informed and socially acceptable as they are based on a richer and wider evidence base. Dialogue has provided ‘political’ confidence to policy makers by clarifying public views on difficult decisions (e.g. stronger regulation), and by identifying and testing levels of public concerns and aspirations, why they hold those views and what affects them. It has also provided ‘practical’ confidence by drawing on public knowledge and experience to find new ideas for policy and services that better meet public needs.
default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBetter policy and decision-making processesdefault that are more open and transparent, and subject to public scrutiny. Public input can help improve communications planning (identifying more appropriate messages), risk management (identifying potential areas of conflict and consensus early) and better internal communications by providing a focus for considering how issues can best be discussed with the public.
default&#xa0;default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSavings of time and moneydefault in launching and implementing policy solutions by finding appropriate and acceptable policies that can be easily and quickly implemented with minimal conflict and controversy.
default&#xa0;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSpreading public awareness and understanding of science issuesdefault. Dialogue has provided a depth of learning and understanding through which participants internalise and effectively retain the knowledge they develop. It has enthused participants so they spread their new interest in the subject to others. They also often develop a better understanding of the practical and political pressures on policy makers.
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is similar to the findings of the 2012 RCUK Review of Public dialogues. This review looked at lessons learned from RCUK dialogues and found that found that Research Council public dialogues with research have been carried out to high standards and have led to important and productive impacts on Research Council work. It also highlighted international recognition for RCUK’s commitment to public dialogue and innovation in upstream engagement. The review identified six main areas where public dialogues have provided value and made tangible positive impacts to the work of the Research Councils:
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBetter understanding of public attitudes relating to an emerging area of research; 
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBetter understanding of publics as potential end-users or consumers of research; 
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearchers stimulated to reflect on the social implications of their research; 
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDirectly inform Research Council thinking, strategy and decision making; 
default(e)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPromote stronger stakeholder engagement with NGOs and civil society; and 
default(f)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultContribute to wider public debate about emerging research and technologies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultv. What evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNo specific input from RCUK. Government Departments will be in a better position to comment in detail on policy implications.
default&#xa0;
defaultvi. Does the Government have sufficient expertise in social and behavioural sciences to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policies?default28.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Sciencewise Expert Resources Centre (Sciencewise-ERC) provides co-funding and specialist advice and support to Government departments and agencies to develop and commission public dialogue activities in emerging areas of science and technology. This
default defaultGovernment funded centre which also provides advice to policy makers, should be used by more Government Departments. 
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Research Councils have worked directly with Sciencewise to run public dialogues in areas of high potential public interest. The NERC-sponsored geoengineering public dialogue – ‘Experiment Earth?’ - was helpful in influencing further research in this area, and highlighting the need for continued public engagement in it. It informed the Government position on geoengineering research going forward, published by DECC in 2012.  It also revealed how participants viewed climate science, the scientific method and scientists.
default 
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRCUK also supports the researchers it funds to communicate and share their findings with Government Departments.  The Economic and Social Research Council’s (ESRC) recent Climate Change Leadership Fellows showcased their research findings with various Governments Departments.  For example, Professor Nick Pidgeon, Cardiff University specifically focussed on ‘Risk perception, Climate change and public engagement’ and Professor Simon Caney researched ‘Equity and Climate Change’.  They presented their work at policy symposiums, policy network conferences and policy seminars.
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRCUK also supports high level policy placements which enable individuals to feed their particular scientific expertise into the work of Government Departments and other organisations, for example the ESRC has placement opportunities between social scientists and government departments with the most recent to start in May. The Fellowship is a partnership between ESRC, DEFRA and the Environment Agency and Professor Frances Bowen of Queen Mary, University of London will be considering ‘Regulating for a sustainable economy’. NERC has also placed a number of scientists in Government Departments under its policy placement scheme, the most recent being Professor Lorraine Maltby of Sheffield University who is working directly for Defra’s Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Boyd.
default&#xa0;defaultvii. Can lessons about public engagement with climate change policy be learned from other countries?default&#xa0;default default32.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Sciencewise report ‘Evidence Counts: Understanding the Value of Public Dialogue’
default states that Research Council public dialogues with research have been carried out to high standards and highlights international recognition for RCUK’s commitment to public dialogue and innovation in upstream engagement.
default&#xa0;
default33.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the issue of engaging the public in climate science is global and many countries have developed tools and guidance for scientists and citizens (e.g. the American Chemical Society Toolkit) 
default 
defaultwhich may offer different perspectives on the issues.
