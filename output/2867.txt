[[[Written evidence to the Enquiry into Democracy and Development in Burma, submitted by the Burma Relief Centre]]]

[[[Summary]]]This submission by Burma Relief Centre, an NGO with 25 years’ experience in capacity building of civil society and currently receiving DFID support through Christian Aid, contains the following key points:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To enable them to raise community concerns and input policy recommendations into political negotiations so that just, sustainable solutions can be achieved to end the conflict.   -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To ensure that humanitarian needs in these conflict areas continue to be met, and existing community social service structures are built upon and not ignored and replaced. &#xa0;

[[[Detailed submission ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ability to address critical health needs in remote conflict areas. In 2012, indigenous health organizations reached a target population over half a million in conflict affected areas of Burma, and trained almost 3,000 community health workers. b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Promotion of women’s rights among ethnic communities which are traditionally extremely patriarchal. This has included extensive programming against sexual and gender based violence, including documentation and advocacy against the Burmese military’s use of rape as a weapon of war. c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Development of a broad media network in the ethnic states, enabling access to information for remote marginalized communities in their own languages, and providing unique reporting on the ongoing peace process.  d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Widespread community awareness of the need for environmental protection and sustainable development, which has led to the stopping of controversial development projects, such as the Myitsone dam on the Irrawaddy river in 2011, and the Tamanthi dam on the Chindwin river in 2013. e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Development of grassroots ethnic farmers’ networks to address issues of widespread land grabbing. f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Development of inter-ethnic alliances in many sectors, which are promoting ethnic reconciliation, for example the Women’s League of Burma, Burma Rivers Network, Burma News International, Ethnic Community Development Forum. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
