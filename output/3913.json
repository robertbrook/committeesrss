"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence\n f\nrom Scottish Public Services Ombudsman \n[PHS0041]\n&#xa0;\nThis\n note is intended to \nprovide some background to the C\nommittee in areas where the SPSO remit and power\ns\n are most different from that of the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman. \n These relate to the decision of the Scottish Parliament to create a sin\ngle Ombudsman and also to a\n new role we have around setting complaints standards \nand designing and imp\nlementing standardised procedures \nfor organisations under our jurisdiction. \n&#xa0;\nOur jurisdictionThe SPSO’s jurisdiction broadly covers devolved and local areas of government and related bodies.  This includes local authorities; prisons; the health service; \nregistered social landlords; the Scottish Government, \ncolleges and u\nniversities \nand most Scottish NDPBs.  We can take complaints by private companies providing \nservices on behalf of one of these public sector bodies\n.  We also take complaints about one utility, water. \n There are exceptions to our remit, there are separate bodies \nin Scotland \nfor complaints about police; information requests; breach of standards \nof specific codes of conduct; \nand social care. \n \nLast year \nwe received, a little over 4,100 complaints of which 37% were about local authorities and 30% about health. \n&#xa0;The “one-stop-shop” concept and review of complaints The roots of our broad jurisdiction can be traced back to \n2002, \nwhen \nthe Scottish Parliament\n endorsed the idea of a “one-stop-shop”. \nT\nhe aim was to make it easier for the public \nto access the ombudsman \nand to be able to deal with complaints where more than one\n organisation was involved.  \nThis led to the merger of the Scottish parts of the P\narliam\nentary and \nH\nealth \nS\nervices \nO\nmbudsman\n, Housing Ombudsman and Local Government Ombudsman.  \nThere \nhave been \nadditional \nsignificant \nchanges follow\ning\n two reviews of complain\nt handling across the Scottish public s\nector\n in the last few years\n.  Full details \nof th\nese reviews \ncan be found in the Crerar Report\n (2007)\n and the Sinclair Report\n (2009)\n.  Broadly speaking, these\n reports\n called for significant changes in complaints handling by public organisations and simplification of the complaints handling landscape at the next level.  \nIt was \nas \na direct results of these reports that we\n took on a role in relation to prisons and w\nater c\nomplaints\n and that the bodies previously dealing with complaints in these areas were abolished\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs an organisation with a broad jurisdiction we need to ensure we can bring the benefits of being a \n“\none-stop-shop\n”\n in terms of ease of access; consistency of \napproach and learning across the sector with the requirements to understand the diverse range of public services.  \nWhen taking on new jurisdictions we have set up small teams of staff who specialise in those complaints for a period to build up our internal\n knowledge and only moved to integrating them with our mainstream process when we believe we have sufficient \nexperience and expertise to do so.  We also have a bank of specialists advisers we can draw on when we need to supplement our knowledge. \n&#xa0;\nThe Complaints Standards AuthorityThe other statutory change to our remit\n as a result of these reviews was that we took on a new role in \n2010\n.  \nThis role gives us specific powers and imposing duties on organisations under our jurisdiction around complaint standar\nds.  \n&#xa0;\nIn line with the new legislation we underto\nok a public consultation on\n principles of complaints\n handling and\n seven\n complaint handling principles were \napproved by \nthe \nScottish Parliament in January 2011\n.  \nAll organisations under our jurisdiction are\n required to comply with these principles.  The legislation also encouraged us to create standard\nised\n complaint handling procedures \nwhich meet these principles.  We can require organisations under o\nur jurisdiction to implement the\nse procedures. \n&#xa0;\nWorking i\nn partnership we have led a programme of reform \n \nto \ndevelop a \nstandardised \nmodel complaint\ns\n handling procedure for each sector\n \nunder our jurisdiction \nwhich \nit \nis \nnow \na statutory requirement for bodies to adopt. \n \nThe\nre are\n currently\n \nstandardised\n \nprocedures \nin place for\n all local authorities, \nr\negistere\nd \ns\nocial \nl\nandlords\n,\n \nc\nolleges\n,\n \nu\nniversities and the Scottish Government and \nGovernment sponsored\n \nagencies and other public authorities\n.  They \nall follow the same simple model\n process\n.  A quick, frontline resolution stage which should normally be completed \nwithin\n five working days and a single investigation stage with a target response time of 20 working days.  \nAlongside that simple process, there are requirements for organisations to \nlog, monitor and learn from \nall \ncomplaints\n.  \nWhile very similar, the mo\ndel for each sector does take into account\n specific issues that reflect the individual needs of each sector and there is room for local flexibility\n, not in terms of the process and stan\ndards the public receive, but in how their organisations meets these\n.  This is another example of the way we need to balance being a single Ombudsman with the need to reflect \nand respect \nlocal conditions.  \n&#xa0;\nWhile there were some initial concerns from orga\nnisations\n in implementing this new model\n, particularly those for whom this would be a significant change, there are now hundreds of organisations across Scotland operating this model and organisations are increasingly reporting that they are finding the ne\nw model is \nacting as a cultural catalyst not only in relation to their complaints handling but in \nimprov\ning their wider approach to customer service\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe CSA \nalso provides \nsupport \nto \norganisations using the model.  They \nhave established complaints handl\ners networks for the\n \nsectors to\n help\n share best practice \nand\n \nlearning from complaints\n and to benchmark performance\n.  \nWe have \ndevelop\ned standardised \n performance indicators \nfor each sector which they will be required to publish meaning that, for the first \ntime, the public will have access to consistent detailed information about complaints at a local level and organisations will be able to compare and benchmark against each other\n on the basis of consistent detailed information\n.  \nWe are not seeking to \nbecome\n a regulator but \nhave worked with regulators who now \nhave access to \ncomplaints data \nin the course of their\n regulation and inspection\n activities\n.  \n&#xa0;\nIt is worth noting that the complaints process for the Health Service \nin Scotland \nis set out in separate leg\nislation and regulations.  The process consists of a single investigation stage of 20 working days and this was used as the basis for the other sectors to mean that, as far as possible, anyone complaining to any public organisation in Scotland should meet \nsimilar standards\n and procedures\n.  This should also make it easier for organisations working together to deliver services to co-ordinate their responses to any concerns. \n&#xa0;Making \nthe process easier and recording\n and  monitoring complaints is o\nnly the start of the process.  The process is \n also designed to help staff in public organisations focus less on the process and more on responding well.  The\nre is a strong emphasis \nin the procedures \non empowering \nall \nfront-line staff to resolve problems \na\ns close to the frontline as possible. T\nhe\n CSA \nalso seeks to share\n good practice and has \nestablished \nforums for complaint handlers\n to meet to discuss improvements and common issues.  Additional support is given by our training unit. \n&#xa0;The SPSO Training Unit Th\ne SPSO training unit predated the reviews and\n was created in \nresponse to requests from organisations \nin our jurisdiction \nfor help and \nwas initially influenced by a similar unit at the Local Government Ombudsman.  \nThis has since evolved considerably as \nrequests \nfor training increased following the Sinclair report in 2009 which recommended that public organisations invest in training for staff and also that the status of complaint handlers be improved within organisations.  \nWhen the \nmodel \nprocedures were \ndeveloped there were \nfurther requests for us to \nsupport the process with good complaint handling skills\n training\n. \n&#xa0;\nOur website SPSO \nT\nraining\n now hosts several e-learning modules.  These are free t\no members of staff in the organisations\n under our jurisdic\ntion. \n The modules\n currently available on the site are desi\ngned for front-line staff\n to help them understand their role and emphasise the benefits of resolving complaints quickly\n. \n We have had 2,5\n00 staff sign up direct through our own website and know org\nanisations who have chosen to directly host the e-learning on their own internal websites have signed up many more. \n&#xa0;\nWe \nalso deliver direct training for staff who unde\nrtake the investigation stage\n and in 2012/13 \ndelive\nre\nd\n 71 courses\n.  \n We are currently wo\nrking closely with NHS Education Scotland \n(NES) \nand \ne-learning \ntraining for frontline NHS staff launched in\n May 2013\n.  We are \nproviding \n training\n direct\n to GP practice managers \nalongside\n NES and expect to have an investigation skills training e-learning mo\ndule \nfor NHS staff \navailable early next year.  \nOur e-learning modules have attracted considerable interest and we have had requests from organisations outside our jurisdiction to access these, including some international contacts\n to use them\n. \n To give an \nexample, w\ne have had a direct request from a local authority in New Zealand\n.\n \n We know NHS England have considered our modules as they look to develop their own approach. \n&#xa0;While we do not charge for e-learning \nwe do for direct delivery\n training and do so on a cost-recovery basis.  \nWe sought and received\n Scottish Government \nfunding \nfor the technical side of the e-learning and the NHS have funded their own e-learning. \n&#xa0;\nLooking ahead There is currently an impetus around complaints handli\nng as a result of the \nreviews, and the implementation of the new models.  \nHowever, culture change and leadership remain the most significant factors in improving complaints handling.  \nWhile\n tr\naining seeks to support this,\n \nI have \nalso \nbeen meeting Chief Exe\ncutives and others to encourage \ngreater visibility \nand reporting \nand \nprovide \nadditional guidance and support for the way governance structures \nacross the public services \nshould be responding to complaints.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/82980/0053065.pdf\nHttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/PublicServiceReform/IndependentReviewofReg/ActionGroups/ReporttoMinisters\n  \n \nhttp://www.valuingcomplaints.org.uk/wp-content/media/principles.pdf\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.spsotraining.org.uk/\n"
