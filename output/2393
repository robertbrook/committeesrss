defaultOur young people are the future of the nation.  Without them there
default is no future.  How careful we need then to be in caring for and educating them so that a generation emerges that the country can be proud of.

defaultThe internet has brought considerable benefits to children, society and the business world
default.  However it can, and
default is
default, 
defaultbeing used to corrupt society and the very children that it should benefit.
default  
defaultIt is a sorrowful statistic 
defaultas stated by
default 
defaultOfcom
default, 
defaultthat 81% of children aged 14 to 16 have viewed adult material online, whilst only 46% of parents have filters 
defaultin place on thei
defaultr home internet.

defaultPornographic images can be viewed 
defaulton the internet 
defaultby young persons, so warping their minds
default. 
defaultThis can only lead to a rapid decline in moral standards, increased delinquency, dysfunctional families, and a proliferation of adults with no mor
defaultal structure or ability to discriminate bet

defaultight and wrong, good and evil.  Because they see adults engaging in such actions it must be OK.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government needs to act now and decisively
default,
default to address this extremely serious problem. 
defaultDefault blocking of
default all adult content should be the standard setting on all equipment sold in the UK that is able to access the internet, combined
default with robust age verification.  Without this, children will continue to be damaged
default irretrievably.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also 
defaulta 
defaulttremendous
default increase in child pornography
default polluting the internet, and r
defaultesearch by the Child Exploitation and Online P
defaultrotection Centre (CEOP) has alleged
default that more than half of those who
default view child abuse images go on to commit abuse themselves.  
defaultThis is a proof of the
default vicious spiral of moral decline that sets in 
defaultwhen such activity is allowed.
default 
defaultInternet Search Providers
default should be held
default responsible to track do
defaultwn child pornography and
default remove such images from the internet.

defaultIt is well to remember that the decline and fall o
defaultf the Roman Empire was not due to 
defaultany lack in the
default military might, by which the
defaultir
default empire was formed, but by moral decline and degeneracy.
