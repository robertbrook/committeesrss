[normal]Our young people are the future of the nation.  Without them there
[normal] is no future.  How careful we need then to be in caring for and educating them so that a generation emerges that the country can be proud of.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The internet has brought considerable benefits to children, society and the business world
[normal].  However it can, and
[normal] is
[normal], 
[normal]being used to corrupt society and the very children that it should benefit.
[normal]  
[normal]It is a sorrowful statistic 
[normal]as stated by
[normal] 
[normal]Ofcom
[normal], 
[normal]that 81% of children aged 14 to 16 have viewed adult material online, whilst only 46% of parents have filters 
[normal]in place on thei
[normal]r home internet.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Pornographic images can be viewed 
[normal]on the internet 
[normal]by young persons, so warping their minds
[normal]. 
[normal]This can only lead to a rapid decline in moral standards, increased delinquency, dysfunctional families, and a proliferation of adults with no mor
[normal]al structure or ability to discriminate bet
[normal]w
[normal]een 
[normal]r
[normal]ight and wrong, good and evil.  Because they see adults engaging in such actions it must be OK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government needs to act now and decisively
[normal],
[normal] to address this extremely serious problem. 
[normal]Default blocking of
[normal] all adult content should be the standard setting on all equipment sold in the UK that is able to access the internet, combined
[normal] with robust age verification.  Without this, children will continue to be damaged
[normal] irretrievably.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is also 
[normal]a 
[normal]tremendous
[normal] increase in child pornography
[normal] polluting the internet, and r
[normal]esearch by the Child Exploitation and Online P
[normal]rotection Centre (CEOP) has alleged
[normal] that more than half of those who
[normal] view child abuse images go on to commit abuse themselves.  
[normal]This is a proof of the
[normal] vicious spiral of moral decline that sets in 
[normal]when such activity is allowed.
[normal] 
[normal]Internet Search Providers
[normal] should be held
[normal] responsible to track do
[normal]wn child pornography and
[normal] remove such images from the internet.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is well to remember that the decline and fall o
[normal]f the Roman Empire was not due to 
[normal]any lack in the
[normal] military might, by which the
[normal]ir
[normal] empire was formed, but by moral decline and degeneracy.
