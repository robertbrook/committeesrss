[normal]Naomi [bold]Houlclushew[bold] – Written evidence[bold]              [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I should like to support the application by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group, Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance to have two proposals concerns Green Lanes added to the Deregulation Bill
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Proposals:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs)
[normal] should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I walk regularly in the Yorkshire Dales and have on various occasions encountered noisy and smelly off-road vehicles which have spoilt that section of the walk, and have seen the destruction of the surface of sometimes historic tracks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope it will be possible to add these proposals to the bill.
