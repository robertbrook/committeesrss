defaultI should like to support the application by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group, Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance to have two proposals concerns Green Lanes added to the Deregulation Bill
default&#xa0;
defaultProposals:
default&#xa0;
default1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs)
default should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
default&#xa0;
default2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI walk regularly in the Yorkshire Dales and have on various occasions encountered noisy and smelly off-road vehicles which have spoilt that section of the walk, and have seen the destruction of the surface of sometimes historic tracks.
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope it will be possible to add these proposals to the bill.
