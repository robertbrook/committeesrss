"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Paul Arditti&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSark\nDear Sir,\n&#xa0;\nIn his evidence to your committee Lord McNally, the UK minister with responsibility for Crown Dependencies, said that he felt \na \nsense of failure with Sark. This failure in my submission stems from a lack of attention to your committee\n’s comments in their\n eighth report; in particular their comments about how individuals wielding very significant economic, legal and political power in a very small jurisdiction may skew the operation of democratic government there. \n&#xa0;\nLord McNally’s department has not manifested \nin their dealings with Sark \nany policy directed at combating this combination of power. Instead, since your eighth report, the department has continued, wittingly or unwittingly, to encourage Sark to learn how to appease rather than cope with the Barclays’ combination of powers. \n&#xa0;\nThe result is that the threat to the ability of democratic government in Sark to operate fairly and robustly is now greater than ever. No Conseiller is willing to chair the General \nPurposes \nand \nAdvisory Co\nmmittee, there are four vacancies in Chief Pleas itself and there are difficulties persuading people to stand in the by election to fill those vacancies. \n&#xa0;\nInevitably this combination of powers perpetuates a division between \nthe \nBarcla\nys on the one hand \nand\n the\n rest of Sark \non the other hand. However the \ndepartment has tried (unsuccessfully) to characterise this division as a\nn even spread \nof opinion between \nSarkees; \nmodernisers and luddites. The department’s characterisation is not\n supported by the\n evidence\n; not least the \nresults of\n the\n three general elections\n in Sark. \n&#xa0;\nThe BBC’s Today programme and Panorama have both done much to spotlight this combination of power but this has not brought about any change of policy in the department.\n&#xa0;\nThe minister’s acknowledgement of \nf\nailure with Sark would be refreshing if it heralds a change of policy by the department. If not, the need for intervention is closer than it was at the time of your committee’s eighth report, in my view.\n&#xa0;\nYours sincerely\n&#xa0;\nPaul Arditti \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;11 November 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
