defaultOxfam
default welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Committee’s inquiry on DFID's 
defaultprogramme
default in Burma. Oxfam works with partners around the world to find lasting solutions to poverty and injustice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs part of Oxfam International, a confederation of 17 Oxfam affiliates around the world we work in more than 90 countries and respond to an average of 30 emergency situations each year. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOxfam believes that people are entitled to five fundamental rights: a sustainable livelihood; basic social services; life and security; to be heard; and equity. We work to support people in realizing these rights and fight poverty and suffering through campaigning, long-term development work, and emergency response. This submission has been informed by consultations with key Myanmar based issue networks and partners of Oxfam in Myanmar.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultOxfam welcomes the commitment of the UK government to double DFID's spending in Myanmar. DFID has made a clear contribution to development and poverty reduction in Myanmar as well as strengthening capacities of core government institutions. With up to one third of Myanmar's people living in poverty, the ongoing presence of protracted humanitarian conflicts, and continued limited democratic space for people to engage in decision making, it is vital that DFID continue to play a leading role in development in Myanmar.

default2.default Oxfam has worked in Myanmar since 2008, when 
defaultprogrammes
default were set up to support people affected by the devastating impact of cyclone 
defaultNargis
default in Myanmar's Delta region. Oxfam works across a number of regions and states in Myanmar including the Dry Zone, 
defaultAyerwaddy
default Delta, 
defaultRakine
default, 
defaultKachin
default, Karen and 
defaultKayah
default. Our work in Myanmar still has a strong humanitarian focus but we have expanded to include long term development support to develop livelihoods and secure greater economic opportunities for small scale farmers and fisher folk, tackling gender inequality, creating democratic space, raising awareness on natural resource rights, and disaster risk reduction. Oxfam is also responding to the humanitarian crises in both 
defaultRakhine
default and 
defaultKachin
default. Oxfam in Myanmar works with local communities, directly and indirectly through our partners, as well as with local government to strengthen the capacity of authorities to deliver core services accountably.

default4.default The ongoing reform process and growing political space as a result of reform commitments offer promising opportuni
defaultties for development in Myanmar. H
defaultowever whilst leaders have made progress with democratic reforms, much more is still to be done. The military continues to occupy a firm position in Myanmar's institutions, inside and outside of government and whilst some progress has been made on increasing transparency and accountability through commitments in the new Framework for Economic and Social Reform
default, the Nay 
defaultPyi
default Taw Accord
default and the government's willingness to move forward with the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), political space for people to engage with decision making still remains extremely limited at all levels.
default&#xa0;
default5.default Whilst real GDP growth is predicted to accelerate to 6.5%
default in 2013, up to one third of people live under the poverty line, the country’s under-5 and infant mortality rates are the highest among ASEAN member countries
default, and the public health system is severely under-resourced, with the result that patients have to shoulder 81% of healthcare costs
default, making out of pocket expenditures one of the highest in the world. Although growth projections are 
defaultoptimistic
default, without the right policies, the benefits of new investments and rising growth are likely to be concentrated in the hands of a few. Experience from across the region has shown that it is the quality not the 
defaultquantity of growth that matters
default yet so far, 
defaultpolicies to promote equitable and inclusive growth have not been effecti
defaultvely outlined by the Myanmar government. There is a danger that
default new investment opportunities, without the necessary regulation
default,
default could undermine rather than support progress on reduction of poverty and inequality.
default&#xa0;
default6.default The reform process also continues to be hindered by humanitarian emergencies and Myanmar's propensity to natural disasters. Despite progress on ceasefire agreements, conflict remains an everyday feature of many peoples' lives. Estimates suggest that there are up to 650,000 internally displaced in Myanmar
default. The protracted nature of the displacement of many of these people means emergency aid and long term development assistance must be scaled up to ensure their humanitarian needs are met and to support longer term development plans to rehabilitate those affected by crises. Myanmar's geographical exposure and lack of infrastructure and essential services also make it one of the most vulnerable countries in the region to climate change and natural disasters. Despite this, efforts to develop preparedness for and build resilience against disasters in Myanmar has been insufficient and uncoordinated, and greater action and leadership must be shown by the 
defaultMyanmar 
defaultgovernment on ensuring disaster risk reduction and resilience approaches are built into key national policy processes.

defaultThe future development of DFID's defaultprogrammedefault in Burmadefault&#xa0;default7.default Oxfam welcomes the commitment of the UK government to double DFID's spending in Myanmar, and 
defaultrecognises
default the clear contribution which DFID has made to development and poverty reduction as well as strengthening capacities of core government institutions.
default&#xa0;
default8.default DFID is a key donor in Myanmar, and it is vital that DFID takes leadership within the donor community on inclusive and consultative programming as well as ensuring its institutional support to
default,
default and engagement with
default,
default the 
defaultMyanmar 
defaultgovernment supports the opening up of democratic space. This means ensuring that new aid coordination mechanisms are developed inclusively in consultation with civil society, and that there is civil society representation at each level of aid coordination engagement with the government. Where this is not possible, there should be pre-meetings between the 
defaultMyanmar 
defaultgovernment and civil society, as well as a mechanism established to provide feedback to civil society on concerns raised and input given. DFID sh
defaultould also work closely with the Myanmar 
defaultgovernment to ensure civil society is consulted on the development and implementation of key national policy processes such as the National Comprehensive Development Plan.
default&#xa0;
default9.default Given the rapidly changing environment in Myanmar, DFID's future programming should maintain a good balance between humanitarian and development aid in terms of spending. DFID's programming should also focus on 
defaultboth emergency response assistance, particularly in 
defaultRakhine
default and 
defaultKachin
default, where humanitarian needs remain significant, as well as on transitional programming to support people affected by humanitarian crises to rehabilitate their lives. This must be coupled with DFID working closely with the government to ensure that greater leadership and more decisive action is taken on delivering durable solutions for displaced communities across Myanmar. DFID assistance to support humanitarian needs should be both longer-term and more flexible to allow aid for emergencies to factor in resilience building for natural disasters. Crucially, DFID's programming should work towards building a bridge between short-term response work and longer-term development aid by working closely with the humanitarian community on strategic planning and coordination.
default&#xa0;
default10.default Rural agriculture forms the backbone of Myanmar's economy, accounting for 36% of GDP, and between 60-70% of employment
default. It is dominated by smallholders and its importa
defaultnce as a sector for the economy
default means that support for small scale farmers should be a central pillar of DFID's future programming in Myanmar. There is growing evidence to suggest that small scale agriculture has the potential to deliver growth and 
defaultmaximise
default poverty reduction. We welcome DFID's strategic and financial contributions to the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT). It is important that DFID ensures its future support to LIFT helps improve LIFT's accessibility to local civil society 
defaultorganisations
default and networks. We encourage DFID to expand its programming on small scale agriculture, including through working with the government to produce inclusive agricultural growth strategies that clearly set out how new investments will be leveraged to empower and benefit the small scale farmer. DFID's programming on small scale agriculture should seek to address power inequalities in markets that prevent small scale farmers from participating in the market on fair terms. This should include programming that supports investments in local value chains which can be captured by poor communities. DFID's programming should also focus on addressing key governance issues in agriculture, including effective implementation of agricultural policy in line with 
defaultdecentralisation
default plans to ensure small scale farmers have access to essential resources such as technical inputs, land, water and credit, and to ensure that the policy enabling environment in which they operate supports rather than constrains their activities.
default&#xa0;
default11.default Inclusive growth is severely hampered by lack of access to natural resources. Conflict around land access and ownership is a visible and grow
defaulting problem in Myanmar. C
defaulturrent legislation does not meet the requirements of internationally accepted standards and is failing to protect people's rights to land. DFID's future programming should explicitly support reforms to deliver improved governance and implementation of land policies in line with the UN Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure. This should be clearly communicated to civil society networks. It is vital that DFID's programming supports civil society 
defaultand farmers to participate in the development of a national implementation plan to roll-out the UN Voluntary Guidelines, to ensure that the process is owned and understood by the people it is designed to protect, and also to ensure that no gaps are left within the legal and regulatory frameworks.
default&#xa0;
default12.default Private sector investment has the potential to make a decisive contribution to reducing poverty and inequality, if policies and a legal framework which support responsible investment are in place. We welcome DFID's efforts to date on responsible investment in Myanmar. It is vital that the responsible investment work is shared and consulted on widely with civil society and tied to effective reform of natural resource regulation and rights protection, to ensure that mechanisms are in 
defaultplace that 
defaultrequire
default 
defaultcompanies to invest responsibly, and to ensure that new investors uphold 
defaultlabour
default, land and human rights
default,
default in line with internationally accepted standards.
default&#xa0;
default13.default Gender inequality is deeply embedded in Myanmar, and the exclusion of women from roles of economic leadership, decision making and political processes threatens to undermine Myanmar's progress on social, political and economic reform. The forthcoming election offers an important opportunity to broaden the space for women to participate in public decision-making and take positions of public office. Research by Oxfam and partners has repeatedly shown that women in Myanmar are excluded - often systematically - from decision making at all levels of society. DFID's future programming should provide support to raise awareness on women's rights and encourage political parties to put in place measures that ensure greater numbers of women are represented in their ranks. This will be 
defaultkey
default to having more women participate in the forthcoming election, and in the longer term to reducing gender inequality across all spheres of activity and securing a brighter democratic and economic future for Myanmar. DFID's future programming should also support the government to fully implement the National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women and provide support to civil society to monitor the government's progress on the implementation of this strategy. Gender Based Violence is widespread in Myanmar and has also a deeply limiting impact on women's capacity to engage in economic activity. DFID's future programming should work to support the efforts of the government and civil society on drafting and implementing Anti-Violence 
defaultAgainst
default Women legislation.

defaultDFID's work on assisting Burma's move towards democracydefault&#xa0;
default14.default Whilst progress on 
defaultdemocratisation
default is being made, there is still limited political space in Myanmar for the public and civil society to engage in decision-making. DFID's 
defaultprogramme
default should seek to ensure its investments in Myanmar are targeted towards supporting local activism and advocacy. All 
defaultprogrammes
default need to ensure widespread awareness raising and public education on rights, including those on global standards for business, human rights and land tenure. Investments by DFID 
defaultprogrammes
default should also create space for civil society to 
defaultengage in a 
defaultdialogue with government.
default&#xa0;

defaultDecentralisation
default is not yet being effectively implemented across Myanmar and there is limited government capacity at region/state and local levels to perform core service delivery duties. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDFID 
defaultprogrammes
default should provide support to local and regional governance work, both to the government to build capacity and to civil society to monitor government actions and increase their engagement on decision making with different levels of government. DFID should also work closely with the

default16.default DFID has made an important contribution to the provision of support for education and healthcare in Myanmar and it is vital that DFID continues to play a leading role in supporting work in these sectors both through direct funding and through strengthening core government functions, using country systems where possible, and supporting the government to improve its public financial management to work towards delivery of free, universal and tax financed health and education.

defaultDFID provision of funding and advice to civil society defaultorganisationsdefault in Burmadefault&#xa0;
default17.default The organizations which have the potential for delivering the greatest democratic change in Myanmar are the farmers unions, 
defaultpeasants
default networks, lawyers networks, social movements and civil society 
defaultorganisations
default that will work to open up democratic space and hold the government to account. As above, DFID's 
defaultprogramme
default should seek to ensure its investments in Myanmar are targeted towards supporting local activism and advocacy wherever possible. DFID should also make increased funding available to local civil society in small, easy to access grants to enhance their capacity to grow as watchdog and monitoring bodies.
default&#xa0;
defaultDFID economic governance work (extractive industries transparency, natural resource management more widely)default&#xa0;
default18.default Oxfam welcomes DFID's support on working with the government to commit to the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative. This is an important step forward and a clear recognition by the government that transparency and accountability in this sector are of real importance. But the effectiveness of this process will be determined by what happens next. Involvement of civil society is a requirement of the EITI and the government will need to ensure that it communicates clearly and transparently with civil society and the public on every 
defaultstage of the process. DFID should work closely with the government to ensure that its process of engagement with civil society on the EITI is as broad, deep and inclusive as possible. Whilst the EITI as a process works to achieve greater transparency in the extractives industry as a whole and of the contractual payments by companies in particular, it does not address the concerns around the contract content and the fairness of the agreed contracts, nor does it necessarily provide a vehicle for political solutions to those problems. As above, DFID must work with the government to ensure that people’s rights to access natural resources are protected by bringing in-country regulations in line with internationally accepted standards, and in particular by closing loopholes in land legislation, and supporting civil society to engage with an inclusive and consultative process on the national implementation of UN Voluntary Guidelines.
default&#xa0;
defaultDFID's role in helping to resolve ethnic tensionsdefault&#xa0;
default19.default Community dialogue is central to resolving ethnic tensions in Myanmar. In 
defaultRakhine
default state, little work has been done on building community dialogue to overcome tensions, or working with the government at different levels to ensure it is able to demonstrate greater leadership on this issue. DFID's future programming should make increasing funds available to support work on building dialogue across communities to reduce communal tensio
defaultns and resolve conflict. 
defaultDFID should work closely with other donors and international actors to support the government to take action on resolving communal tensions and building community understanding. Greater investment in longer-term programming in humanitarian contexts will help to provide incentives for resolving ethnic tensions
default.
default 
defaultA
defaults above, DFID's programming should work towards building a bridge between short-term response work and longer-term development aid by working closely with the humanitarian community on strategic planning and coordination. More broadly on peace and development, the peace negotiation processes have not been sufficiently transparent or consultative with civil society. Future DFID programming on supporting the wider peace process should focus on increasing th
defaulte involvement of civil society - 
defaultparticularly women who are often e
defaultxcluded from peace negotiations - 
defaultin a transparent process, and on bringing learning from international transition contexts and facilitating ethnic groups and government to be exposed to these experiences.
default&#xa0;
defaultDFID's efforts to improve donor coordinationdefault&#xa0;
default20.default Lack of donor coordination has been raised as a major issue with huge potential impact on the effectiveness of development interventions. The development of aid coordination mechanisms is welcome but as above, DFID must work closely with the government and other donors to ensure that they are inclusive of civil society, particularly local actors, and work to open up democratic space and support greater engagement of civil society in decision-making processes. This will mean developing new aid coordination mechanisms in 
defaultconsultation with civil society, and ensuring that there is civil society representation at each level of aid coordination engagement with the government. Where this is not possible, there should be pre-meetings between the government and civil society, as well as a mechanism established to provide feedback to civil society on concerns raised and input given. DFID should also work closely with the government to ensure civil society is consulted on the development and implementation of key national policy processes such as the National Comprehensive Development Plan.
