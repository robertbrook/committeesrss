defaultWritten evidence submitted by the CJD Support Network (BTO0007)default&#xa0;defaultThe CJD Support Network is the only registered UK charity to support families affected by all strains of CJD.  As part of our work we run a 24 hour helpline receiving calls from people asking for information, emotional support and advice with CJD issues. We also hold an annual Family Support Meeting and publish an annual newsletter. We provide a range of information publications, which are used by families and professionals and are all available on our website 
defaultwww.cjdsupport.net
default .  Our membership database currently stands at 486, all of whom have had experience of one strain or other of the disease.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe currently receive around 400 helpline calls per year.  Between July 2011 and October 2013 we have received 28 calls specifically from people with issues about the support and information received when they had been informed that they are at higher risk of CJD through secondary transmission. In addition to those calls we have received in the same period 15 calls from health facilities who were asking about uncertainties in dealing with CJD incidents.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur work supports the two UK centres of excellence for CJD, The National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit and the MRC Prion Unit, also the Department of Health and Public Health England. These agencies also provide vital support for our work.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CJD Support Network welcomes their views being sought in this important consultation and is pleased to submit this response. We feel fully qualified to comment on issues related to communication with and support of patients, families and carers as well as giving a general response in support of an effective blood test for all strains of CJD. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Network does not however feel qualified to comment on scientific or statistical elements, but believes that those with this expertise and experience of the disease will ensure the science is soundly applied, to the maximum benefit of those directly involved and public health in general.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe will therefore confine our concerns to a “lay” perspective.
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Knight (Chairman) and Simon Mead (Executive Committee Member) are both members of the Executive Committee of the CJD Support Network. As a consequence of their conflicts of interest, due to their professional roles and memberships of related committees, both have seen but have declined to contribute to this response.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CJD Support Network would welcome a valid test for vCJD which would benefit infection control and help to protect public health. I addition to this, a test for all strains of CJD would have the effect of supporting early diagnosis and earlier access to appropriate care and support, as well as early application of potential future treatments.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough appreciating that costs will always be an issue and will be balanced against current and future benefits, we ask that costs are not the limiting factor in the decision making processes.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe assume that once an effective blood test is available and in use, some current precautionary medical procedures may be able to be relaxed, thus reducing costs as an additional benefit of the testing. We 
defaulthowever urge that until a test is in place, that all current precautions to protect public health are fully applied and monitored with utmost diligence.
default&#xa0;
defaultDue to our role supporting patients, families and carers, over the past twenty years, including more recently, those who have been told they are at a heightened risk of CJD, this is the area that the CJD Support Network feels most qualified to advise on.
defaultStatistics already published indicate that if a blood test is in wide use, many more people will be informed that they are at risk from CJD. Follow-up support to these people is particularly difficult as the actual level of risk and their future prognosis is unknown. It can therefore be seen that the way they are first informed is vital as is subsequent support.
defaultOur work reveals the devastation in families when people are given a wrong diagnosis or are informed wrongly of a higher risk of such a fatal, rapidly deteriorating disease.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have seen figures that suggest that if 1% of blood donors were informed wrongly through a false positive test result, there would be 20,000 people given this devastating news per year.  Whilst some could accept this news pragmatically, many would struggle. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would hope however that any test developed for widespread use will only be approved if false positives represent a much smaller percentage of positive results, but we realise that some false positives are inevitable. All people testing positive would need support and counselling as our experience shows that such diagnosis, particularly if no follow-up test is available, can be very traumatic for the patient and can also result in discriminatory issues discussed further below.
default&#xa0;
defaultA current example of this is a Network member who continues to ring us on a regular basis, with anxiety. They saw a careless statement in a MRI report that suggested their neurological symptoms, due to family history, could be the first signs of CJD.  The family history was that their spouse had died of Sporadic CJD.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs I am sure you are aware a case of Sporadic CJD is naturally occurring and not genetic or passed on by contact or diet. When a family member has nursed a loved one with any strain of CJD, they never want to see it again, but it still leaves a traumatising image and to be told wrongly that you could have the early signs yourself, without any evidence, is unimaginable.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis person has been reassured by several medical experts that she does not have CJD and this should not have been on the report, but she is now unwilling to accept this assurance, hence her continuing phone calls to our helpline.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is clear that confirmation of new risk factors would have major implications for strategies aimed at minimising risks in invasive procedures and treatments. This will impact on those identified as at risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is essential that when people are told they are at risk, they should not be discriminated against in any health or social care setting. We however have evidence that this occurs now, mainly due to a lack of understanding of the disease by practioners (eg. dentists and doctors)
default&#xa0;
defaultThese new risk factors have implications in other fields, such as insurance and mortgages, where discrimination has been reported to us.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as the direct psychological and physical effects of being informed they have a positive test result of a fatal, rapidly deteriorating disease, with no treatment available, previous cases inform us that there may be a stigma attached to the disease and its circumstances. The following two short case studies illustrate this:
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study 1defaultDue to lack of education in the general public and media arena, many believe that all strains of CJD are variant CJD.  At our recent family support meeting a family reported that they had recently lost a family member through CJD. Sadly the death was soon followed by a press release from their local hospital reporting that twenty patients could be at risk of CJD as they had been operated on with surgical instruments that had been used on a patient who later went on to die of CJD.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately, it was known by people in the area that they live in, that their loved one had been taken for post mortem examination at about the same time and speculation and rumour resulted in them being asked whether their relative was the patient reported in the local press.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe family spoke about finding this very difficult to deal with. Not only had they had to deal with the grief of losing a loved one, but were made to feel guilty about the nature of the disease they had died from and to defend themselves from their neighbours about a disease that might have implications for others treated at the same hospital.
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study 2defaultAn example of un-necessary worry to a patient was when they had to go into hospital for a pre-op assessment at their local hospital.  It came to light that their father had died five years ago of probable Sporadic CJD.  The patient was asked whether they had had a blood test to test his status. They said no and so were advised that the hospital would have to take further council.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe patient heard nothing further and was admitted to the hospital at 7am for the operation.  They were told that they should not be alarmed but that they would have to be last in theatre.  The surgeon joked that she had drawn the short straw for the operation.  They were also told that the staff would be wearing double gloves, use disposable instruments and there was talk of a £250,000 insurance risk if there was damage causing leak of spinal fluid.  They were also moved from a four bedded cubicle to a room on their own.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese are two examples of a number of cases of discrimination and stigma we have heard from families. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of the calls to our helpline have concerned when and how a person has been informed that they are at higher risk of CJD through a CJD incidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultTiming seems to have been a problem with some notifications. Several people have been informed of their “at risk status” on Christmas Eve and others on a Friday, when there was no or little support available. Again we have examples where patients have been informed by a GP’s letter pushed through their door.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese are all clearly inappropriate ways to hear bad news and show a lack of thought and empathy.  From the many calls we have received, there would often appear to be no guidance used  and a distinct lack of consistency and empathy in considering when and how to deliver bad news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the examples above show, our experience has shown that communication, empathy and care has in the past been applied by statutory agencies in a range extending from excellent to frankly appalling. Although this has generally improved over time, we are still hearing of cases where the standards fall well short of reasonable expectations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is therefore essential to develop a protocol where this is comprehensively addressed in a consistent and structured way, as those being informed that they are “at risk” will increase enormously. These people will of course include those with positive test results and those with false-positive results, as well as those affected indirectly by these tests, such as those who may have previously received blood donated by these people. As discussed above, positive and false-positive results might involve large numbers of people.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs stated above, follow-up support to these people is particularly difficult as the first question they ask is their actual level of risk and their future prognosis, both of which are currently unknown.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAssuming those advised that they are ‘at risk’ are going to be in the thousands, a clear protocol, covering communication and support is required and must be understood and used by all agencies involved. We would ask that the CJD Support Network is involved in the development of such a protocol.
