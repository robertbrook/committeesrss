&#xa0;&#xa0;              1.1 The links between disability, poverty, and exclusion are irrefutable. People with disabilities form a significant proportion of those most affected by emergencies.  As such, disability inclusion must be addressed as a core issue.  Inclusive programming has been shown to be achievable through active participation by people with disabilities in all aspects of development and through the provision of specific inputs that empower and provide opportunities for people with disabilities.  &#xa0;1.2 Since 1982, Handicap International has sought to mainstream disability, with the support of specialist services, rather than build hermetically separate approaches. Nevertheless, actions specifically targeting people with disabilities remain essential to reach inclusion objectives.  As one of the only NGOs with a dual focus on humanitarian and development actions and inclusion of people with disabilities in such settings, Handicap International seeks to highlight the importance of inclusion in all aspects of humanitarian work (particularly access to relief services and specific programming) and in longer term development work such as education, supporting the reduction of armed violence, and improving equitable access to health services, including rehabilitation. &#xa0;1.3 A cross-cutting theme through all these areas is value for money (VfM). The contribution of VfM analysis and monitoring in development and humanitarian practice is appreciable. However, there is a risk that negative effects on disability and inclusive programming can arise if the VfM approach relies too heavily on economic considerations (leading to narrow, reductive views of programme efficacy) at the price of attention on equity, impartiality, and other qualitative measures.&#xa0;1.4 Handicap International recognises and commends the positive steps DFID has taken to improve disability inclusion in its policies and work.  However, our experience demonstrates that further steps are necessary before this become systematic. For example, while DFID’s Rwanda education approach (where one pillar focuses on inclusive education) is an excellent example of DFID’s commitment to disability inclusion, the opposite is true in countries like DRC where the DFID country team admitted overlooking disability when developing its health strategy.&#xa0;1.5 In ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the UK committed to ensuring that UK aid is inclusive of and accessible to people with disabilities, but there is still much to be done before programming equally benefits all people.  The development of policy and programming involving people with disability is vital to a participatory and proactive model of inclusion.  As such Handicap International calls on DFID to implement a strategic approach to disability inclusion through:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A Disability Theory of Change&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A central and country level Disability Results Framework of accountability&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Tools for inclusive funding mechanisms  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Improved data disaggregation  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Participation of people with disabilities at all stages of programming.&#xa0;2. Humanitarian Response   &#xa0;2.1 With approximately 80% of the world’s disabled population living in developing countries, Handicap International calls for 

[[[an inclusive approach to emergency response and development initiatives in line with international obligations]]].  

[[[The exclusion of people with disabilities from humanitarian assistance is a fundamental breach of the principle of impartiality and a violation of human rights.]]]  In emergencies, people with disabilities face additional barriers and vulnerabilities linked with their condition and the disruption of their environment which put them at increased risk. The CRPD outlines that States Parties, including the UK as a 2009 signatory, are obliged to take all appropriate additional measures to secure the safety of persons with disabilities (Article 11) .  &#xa0;2.2 People with disabilities and older people are disproportionately affected by disasters, yet less than 

[[[1% of international humanitarian aid is dedicated to people with disabilities]]].  A 2011 study of submissions to the Consolidated Appeals Process found that only 1.6% of projects included targeted activities for people with disability and only 0.7% were funded. Data from the current Syrian crisis highlights that approximately 18% of refugees in Jordan and Lebanon live with at least one impairment, be it physical, visual, auditory, or intellectual.&#xa0;2.3 

[[[Disaggregated data on ]]]

[[[people]]]

[[[ with disability, injury, and chronic illness are insufficiently gathered and shared to inform response.]]]  DFID has identified Handicap International, with HelpAge, as the inclusion focal point among Rapid Response Facility partners for the Philippines response.  This is a welcome step, but to effect real change this focus by DFID on inclusion must be systematically applied in all crisis contexts and with all implementing partners to avoid substantive information gaps and programming exclusion.&#xa0;2.4 In emergencies, 

[[[people]]]

[[[ with disabilities]]] (and other vulnerable groups) are rarely consulted about their needs and 

[[[face significant difficulties accessing humanitarian goods and services]]]

[[[.  ]]]When they do, goods and services are often inappropriate.   &#xa0;2.5 A recent global study shows that only 20% of people with disability could evacuate immediately and without difficulty during a sudden disaster, the remainder only with a degree of difficulty; 6% would be unable to do so at all.&#xa0;However, with sufficient time, preparation, and warning, those able to evacuate without difficulty rises from 20 to 38%, underscoring the importance of 

[[[developing and implementing inclusive early warning systems that can reach all ]]]

[[[people ]]]

[[[through adapted messages and communication tools]]].&#xa0;2.6 

[[[Ol]]]

[[[der women and women and girls with disabilities experience heightened risk of sexual]]]

[[[, physical, and domestic violence, especially during emergencies and conflict]]]

[[[.  ]]]As DFID takes forward its’ Call to Action, all approaches to combatting violence against women and girls must include these groups and specific protection programming be established to address this issue.   &#xa0;2.7 DFID has taken multiple steps to improve its inclusive approach, including specifically mentioning older and disabled people as vulnerable groups in their humanitarian policy. However, the single mention of disability in this policy highlights the need to build DFID’s commitment to targeting the most vulnerable.  Appreciating that disasters affect different people differently, 

[[[understanding the dynamic nature of risk is key to planning and implementing inclusive and effective humanitarian response and development ]]]

[[[programming.]]]  DFID’s challenge to make inclusion systematic can be facilitated by: developing specific inclusion indicators for measuring project success; requiring partners to include action points that target people with specific needs in their operations; and disaggregating data by age and disability.&#xa0;2.8 Recommendations to DFID’s humanitarian team to improve disability inclusion into a consolidated and structured approach are:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Require that all DFID proposals include specific consideration for the inclusion of people with disabilities and ensure that funded emergency responses meet the basic and specific needs of people with disabilities, older people, and people with injuries.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Require DFID implementing partners to disaggregate data by disability.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure that all assessment, monitoring, and response activities are inclusive.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure responses are informed by evidence which includes input from people with disabilities.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Include people with disabilities (and other vulnerable groups) proactively in the development of disaster resilient communities through emergency and disaster risk reduction programming. Consult and involve people with disabilities in the development of all DFID supported disaster risk reduction programming.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Promote a VfM approach that focuses on equity and inclusion and encourage stakeholders to develop innovative, contextually adapted, and multi-scaled operations that cover the needs of all disaster affected people.&#xa0;3. Armed Violence Reduction   3.1 

[[[Armed violence threat]]]

[[[two million people liv]]]

[[[e]]]

[[[ with firearm injuries sustained in non-conflict settings over the past decade]]]. Research indicates that 80% of victims consulted developed a severe disability as a result of their injury and need long term medical and social care. Their injuries generate considerable direct and indirect costs, including those incurred through treatment, recovery, and lost productivity.  Many injuries negatively impact households, disrupting social relations and creating severe gender inequalities.&#xa0;3.3 An estimated 740,000 people die every year from armed violence. 

[[[Armed violence is one of the ]]]

[[[top ten causes of death ]]]in over 40 countries and the fourth leading cause of death for people aged 15-44 globally.

[[[ ]]]For every person who dies, thousands more are injured.  Only by integrating armed violence reduction into development activities in a multi-sector process involving multiple and diverse actors can stakeholders address the combined local, national, and regional factors which drive armed violence. &#xa0;3.4

[[[ ]]]Women and girls with disabilities are twice as likely to experience gender based violence as non-disabled peers.  In settings where arms are readily available, 

[[[risks to women and children increase]]]  with weapons used to both threaten and implement violence.&#xa0;3.5 In 2011, over 4,000 people were killed or injured by landmines and explosive remnants of war. 

[[[Victim assistance is an essential component of all mine action programming]]].  Meeting survivors’ needs demands a holistic approach that addresses social, economic, livelihoods, and health and rehabilitation services, access to which improves the quality of life of victims and their inclusion in society.  Whilst DFID’s newly-published Mine Action Strategy has taken a complete view on the ‘five pillars’ of Mine Action, it has directed responsibility for responding to victim assistance outside the immediate remit of its own Mine Action response, making it incumbent on DFID country programmes to ensure that provision is made for victim assistance support. Handicap International’s own experience of mine action programming across all five pillars demonstrates that a mine action programme is only successful when victim assistance is fully integrated.&#xa0;3.6 Handicap International 

[[[recommend]]]

[[[s]]] that DFID:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Increase evidence on the impact of armed violence by gathering disaggregated data on the magnitude, scope, and characteristics of armed violence to inform policy and practice. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Build capacity to implement National Injury Surveillance Systems. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Integrate victim assistance into broader human rights, disability, and development frameworks beyond health and rehabilitation interventions.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Examine how victim assistance can be effectively supported beyond mine clearance completion. DFID’s support to mine action will fall short of achieving its VfM potential if clearance and mine risk education does not connect to victim assistance efforts.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ratify the UK Arms Trade Treaty.   Support States to consider the risk of arms diversion and assess how export of conventional arms, ammunition, or components could undermine peace and security or be used in facilitating serious violations of international human rights.   &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Reduce and prevent the risks, impact, and incidence of armed violence by promoting comprehensive responses to the issues of Community Safety and Security and Small Arms and Light Weapons Control and improving services that provide immediate and longer-term health, psychological, social, and economic support to include direct and indirect victims of armed violence.4. Rehabilitation and access to Health across humanitarian and long-term programming&#xa0;4.1

[[[ ]]]

[[[People]]]

[[[ with disabilities are more likely to have health needs, but are less likely to access health services and have these needs met]]].  They are twice as likely to find health care providers’ skills and facilities inadequate, thrice as likely to be denied health care, and four times more likely to be treated badly in the healthcare system.  Achievements in health mean that people are living longer, but lack of equitable access to a full continuity of care means that people of all ages experience preventable disabilities. Health services must better address accessibility, affordability, inclusiveness, appropriateness, and quality for people with disabilities.  &#xa0;4.2 

[[[Inclusivity in health initiatives and programmes aiming to reach the ]]]

[[[ populations cannot]]]

[[[d]]]

[[[ without meeting the needs of ]]]

[[[people]]]

[[[ with disabilities.]]]&#xa0;4.3 More disaggregated information is needed about the health and health access of people with disabilities (and injuries and chronic illnesses) to ensure solutions to implement 

[[[universal access to health and rehabilitation for people with disabilities]]] are cost-effective.&#xa0;4.4 In many low-income and middle-income countries, only 

[[[5%–15% of people who require assistive devices/technologies receive them]]]. Health services such as rehabilitation therapies are perceived as a luxury and are woefully limited.  Ensuring full continuity of care, including access to appropriate rehabilitation services, for people with disabilities and people experiencing new impairments due to illness or injury is critical.&#xa0;4.5

[[[ Costs of health services exacerbate the poverty level for people with a disability]]]

[[[.  ]]]Health services and systems should increase involvement of people with disabilities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of services to ensure their accessibility and viability for populations at risk.&#xa0;4.6 

[[[Rehabilitation services must be an integral part of health services]]], especially in humanitarian response and development.  DFID is supporting Handicap International to develop the rehabilitation component of the UK International Emergency Trauma Register enabling deployment of medical professions in disasters such as the Philippines typhoon.  DFID’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation professionals in trauma response, and as an integral part of the health service package, is lauded both for universal access and to improve holistic humanitarian response in major disasters. Rehabilitation services are key to avoiding permanent impairments for people with injuries. In longer-term global health and development initiatives, however, the focus on reduction in mortality (aligned to current MDGs) has meant that rehabilitation services have been largely overlooked. &#xa0;4.7 

[[[Survival needs to be redefined to go beyond the process of preventing death to preventing impairment and promoting meaningful]]] 

[[[lives]]].  Advances in global health, highlighted in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease reported and published in the Lancet, have created new challenges of chronic diseases, longer life expectancy, and increasing rates of disability.  Health partners have a duty to respond to and address these emerging trends multi-dimensionally through prevention, rehabilitation, and treatment. &#xa0;4.8 

[[[Recommendations]]] for inclusive health provision include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Prioritise universal access to health services, including for people with disabilities.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Require DFID funded global health interventions to include targets which better address morbidities and disability within the health sector&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Fund health research that examines rehabilitation services and barriers faced by people with disabilities, injury, and chronic illness when accessing health services, and strategies which overcome such barriers. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Support DFID health and disability partners to achieve universal health coverage in humanitarian and development programming, thus ensuring the right to health as per the CRPD.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure that all DFID funded health programs consider the need for integration of immediate and long-term rehabilitation&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Advocate for and lead global development agencies and donors to include programming to ensure the needs of people with disabilities within health are met. &#xa0;5. Education   &#xa0;5.1 The MDG of achieving universal primary education by 2015 is not on track, according to UNESCO: 57 million primary aged children are still out of school. Of these, one third are children with disabilities, and an estimated 

[[[90% of children living with a disability in low and middle income countries do not attend school]]].  Of those who are in school, an estimated 250 million children are failing to learn.&#xa0;5.2 

[[[Inclusive education is both a right in itself and the means for realising the civil, political, and economic rights of all ]]]

[[[children ]]](as stipulated in the CRPD).  It is the central means for achieving the goals of Education for All, fulfilling the second and third 2015 MDGs and is mentioned explicitly in goal 3 of the proposed sustainable development goals post-2015. By promoting a child-centred approach to teaching and supporting the rights of all learners to access and benefit from formal and non-formal education, Education for All promotes education that is inclusive, child-friendly, and gender sensitive.     &#xa0;5.3 

[[[Prioritising inclusive education should not be thought of in terms of an additional cost burden.]]] The cost of failing to invest in the education of children with disabilities has been estimated to be much greater than the estimated cost of implementing inclusive education

[[[. ]]]By one estimate, US$135–192 billion is lost from the GDP of low-income countries per annum as a result of disabled people’s exclusion from employment. The World Bank concluded that educating children with disabilities reduces welfare costs and increases potential productivity and wealth creation, in turn helping to alleviate poverty.&#xa0;5.4 DFID’s September announcement by Parliamentary Undersecretary of State Lynne Featherstone that 

[[[all school construction DF]]]

[[[I]]]

[[[D supports is designed to allow disability access]]] is a welcome step.  However, this must be followed by a comprehensive inclusive education approach.  Reproducing DFID’s Rwanda country programme focus on inclusive education would be an excellent first step. Handicap International is committed to partnering with DFID to define clear targets and accountability measures to ensure the effective implementation of future commitments to inclusive education, such as ensuring DFID-supported teacher-training incorporates inclusive teaching methods respecting the diversity of learners. &#xa0;5.5 With the 2014 Global Campaign for Education theme being Disability and Inclusion, this is an ideal time for DFID to increase its efforts

[[[ on Inclusive Education.]]] 

[[[R]]]

[[[ecommendations]]] include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Developing a strategic approach to equity and inclusion of children with disabilities and a coherent policy towards inclusive education (including accessible school design, child friendly environments, and inclusive teaching methods) across all countries where DFID operates.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Making the inclusion of disabled people a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding in all education programmes an urgent priority.  A strategy alone will be insufficient without effective implementation and accountability.   &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Investing in research (especially participatory research involving children and teachers with disabilities) in inclusive education focussed programmes and encouraging the support of civil society to promote equitable and inclusive education.  Provide funds and materials to support such initiatives.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensuring that all programmes focus on scaling up national plans rather than implement fragmented small scale projects.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Advocating internationally for inclusive education with other donors and governments and ensure effective coordination amongst all stakeholders.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Implementing effective and transparent monitoring and evaluation across all inclusive education programmes.  &#xa0;6. Recommendations for DFID6.1 Handicap International seeks to build a vision of inclusive development based on:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Active participation of disabled people in all aspects of development and emergency response/recovery, including basic needs, health, rehabilitation, protection, education, mine action, socioeconomic empowerment and reduction of armed violence.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Targeted measures that support the development of and meet the specific needs of people with disabilities.To facilitate this, Handicap International has gathered examples of good practice for disability inclusive development on their Making it Work project’s website.&#xa0;6.2 Based on Handicap International’s experience, to ensure that the UK achieves compliance to the CRPD to promote the rights and full participation of people with disability and ensure fully inclusive development and humanitarian practice, Handicap International calls on DFID to implement a strategic approach to disability inclusion through:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Developing a Disability Theory of Change through active collaboration with civil society. Handicap International commits to supporting this process which would enable DFID to demonstrate its advanced thinking on the critical issue of disability inclusion. As the key process from which all other DFID commitments stem, a robust Theory of Change will create a natural flow to the following commitments: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A Disability Results Framework implemented at central and country level against which DFID and partners are accountable. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Tools for inclusive funding mechanisms and data disaggregation, supporting all steps throughout the development, roll out, and training of the tools.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Data disaggregation in all DFID’s humanitarian and civil society programmes.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mechanisms that ensure the effective participation of people with disabilities at all stages of programming.&#xa0;6.3 Further, Handicap International asks DFID to:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Influence the UN agencies it funds via the multi-lateral system to ensure they include disability, age, and injury concerns in their work.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Strengthen existing internal disability inclusion advisory work across humanitarian and civil society DFID teams and identify senior focal points.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Review the strengths and learning from applying the Gender approach and mirror best practices for mainstreaming disability and inclusion.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; World Health Organization and the World Bank 2011.  World Report on Disability, WHO Press, Geneva. http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/index.html  UNESCO 2005.  UNESCO Guidelines for Inclusion:  Ensuring Access to Education for All.
