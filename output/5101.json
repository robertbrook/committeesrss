"&#xa0;\nWritten submissionName withheldI write from the luxury of retirement to defend or at least to express a viewpoint for the private animal keeper and breeder. I have the greatest respect for the integrity of the Parliamentary Committee system but, nevertheless, a few intelligent men and women asking rigorous questions of a few chosen or self-elected bodies behind closed doors does not exactly speak to the heart of the matter. \nMy husband and I have made our living by breeding exotic and endangered species of animals and birds for breeding and display in parks, zoos and private collections. Over a period of 13 years we also collated and ran a large primate breeding centre; initially only New World primates, (Marmosets, Tamarins and Monkeys,) with the later addition of several species of Lemur.  At its height the collection comprised over 250 specimens of more than 15 species.\nThe Enquiry’s decision to investigate the keeping of primates as “Pets” poses a dilemma over meaning. None of our primates were ever considered as “Pets” by ourselves or our staff, to do so would have been detrimental to their natural instincts and affect their behaviour and general well-being. However, I assume that the intention of the debate is to permanently restrict or proscribe the keeping of all primates in captivity.\nIn order to address the question of the prohibition of keeping primates in captivity sensibly we must also consider the keeping of any species in captivity. Is it right or wrong? Good or bad?\nAs to whether it is right or wrong, we can only make personal judgements, but we can truthfully acknowledge that humans and animals have been inter-dependent throughout our history. Wealth and ease in recent centuries have allowed us to celebrate the beauty, rather than the taste, of our fellow species; they have been captured and studied and loved for their intriguing and interesting differences to ourselves. Until recently this nurture of nature has not been considered in any way wrong. It is still not illegal!\nAs to whether it is good or bad, we can accept that much good has come from science, to the benefit of both humans and animals, in respect of behavioural studies and medical research, (no matter how reluctantly we may accept the latter.) In addition, innumerable people have derived enormous pleasure from observing and coming close to living animals. In Evolutional terms many species happily surviving in captivity would be extinct in their natural habitat and many have only escaped this fate through breeding and re-introduction programmes. It may be thought a good thing that they are still in existence, or a bad thing to interfere with Natural Law.\nIt is another matter to look at “good” or “bad” conditions for keeping animals. These are already addressed by animal welfare laws and all decent keepers would agree that the ignorant, careless or aggressive mistreatment of animals must always be prevented, either by education or sanction. It should be noted \nthat a happy, healthy animal is the unquestionable aim of any sensible keeper and breeder. But, it is also an expensive business to nurture and to protect the stock, which in most cases can only be funded by the sale of surplus youngsters. It is this matter of market value which persistently brings attack, not only from the recognised “anti’s” but also from the Zoo world. The latter are only recently beginning to stand firm with the private breeders and acknowledged not only that that zoos are commercial too in charging a viewing fee, but also the debt they owe to private breeders for keeping the gene pool active and dispersed. It may be too late to rectify the damage done to many species by the Zoos’ original self-protective response to antagonism, which was to seize the moral high ground and to distance themselves from their former allies in Conservation. \nOur attempts to join the Zoo Federation were always rebuffed without valid explanation. It was suggested that our reliance on sale of our breeding progeny, rather than on donations and entrance fees, put us beyond the pale. We adopted the slogan ”Conservation through Commerce” to demonstrate that only their market value would ensure the survival of many species. Our excellent results in breeding tens of thousands of birds and animals could not assuage the Zoo Fed.’s tangible fears of attack from the Animal Rights movements. This fear has dictated the pattern of behaviour in zoos, in politics and the legal system all over the country for decades. It has also resulted in a steep decline in animals bred in zoos. To avoid accusations of overcrowding they deliberately established same-sex groups or active sterilisation methods to prevent breeding. Realising that this would threaten the viability of the gene pool certain Zoos were allowed to continue to breed only allocated species. To avoid accusations of profiting from trade in livestock, only inter-zoo exchanges were permitted. A dangerous stagnation of exhibits has inevitably ensued.\nTo anyone wishing to breed birds or animals successfully it goes without saying that the blood lines must be pure and specimens not too closely related, in order to avoid inbreeding and concurrent defects in behaviour or physique. This patent logic eludes those who have no knowledge of, or regard for, the delicate business of instituting and maintaining a good breeding programme. Regardless of whether the details of the breeding animals are meticulously recorded in triplicate or remain solely in the breeder’s head, the required outcome of a healthy vigorous specimen is the same. While zoos and laboratories may take great care to document their attempts at breeding, it is an accepted fact that this is not in any way indicative of a successful outcome. Conversely, the naturally gifted private breeder, with the benefit of constant contact and observation of his stock, (and often strongly prompted by the financial need to support them by aiding their reproduction,) is in general highly successful. However, the persistent encroachment of what he sees as an unreasonable and unreasoned invasion of his privacy and rights can only lead to two outcomes; the first, a cessation of all breeding programmes and the second, albeit rare, a determination to continue as best he can within a black market. This is a forced rather than a chosen decision. Forced by the piecemeal implementation of laws which have no relevance to the Natural World, either in situ or in captivity, and can only lead to its slow demise. It has led to a situation where no one can be certain how many animals are actually kept in private collections.\nWhen we entered the world of bird and animal collectors and breeders in the 1970’s a very different atmosphere prevailed. There was huge enthusiasm for building and maintaining good, representative collections. Their acquisition was not illegal or devious and certainly not difficult.  No smuggling forays into foreign lands were required, as this country had inherited an extraordinary and rich collection of exotic specimens from Victorian and Edwardian collectors, which had been conscientiously maintained through careful breeding. This inheritance is now being squandered by a generation unintentionally consigning all responsibility to the unconscious repository of the computer. No public debate has been held. No defence of the keeper/breeder been elicited, yet a deliberate and determined vilification of their ideals and methods has been promoted by a few zealots, who would rather see animals dead than in captivity. This is an extremist view projected often with such venom that it engenders real fear in those involved with animals and birds. The effect such views have had on all those engaged in the keeping and breeding of livestock cannot be overstated. It has led to a fearful and sometimes irrational response from those who interact most with the general public.\nThis Draconian view of animal keeping would not appear to be shared by the general public, who hold a fondness for the animal kingdom and mistakenly believe that it is flourishing all around them. Almost every newspaper, magazine or advertisement includes images of birds and animals; the television devotes many hours to wildlife programmes. It is all an illusion. The National ‘Zoo” is shrinking almost beyond the capacity to maintain viable bloodlines for many species. Private collections have been abandoned owing to the intolerable pressure of keeping up with the ever-changing legislation and those who survive do so with a diminished selection of “non-sensitive” species or simple domestic breeds, (derived from the original “wild” form.)\nIt has been suggested that obligatory membership of a governing body could be a way forward, but this ignores the very nature of most good breeders who, in their dedication to their stock, are not wholehearted “joiners and participants” of  societies but rather, and necessarily, uniquely single-minded individuals who are more inclined to “Do” than to “Deliberate.” Moreover, with regards to our experience of being BALAI registered, yet again it was a question of bureaucratic compliance rather than any appraisal of breeding programmes or animal welfare. In fact, we had to \ninsist \non a viewing inspection of our animals as part of our annual check visit, when all that was apparently required was a thorough investigation of our record keeping to ensure documentary accuracy, rather than excellence in breeding or care.\nThe proposal to prohibit the keeping of primates in private collections will inevitably be succeeded by the prohibition of further species. Primates have cynically been chosen as the first test because they appear to have intelligence and physical characteristics close to our own, which make it easy to anthropomorphise and draw comparisons to our own enslavement and captivity. We are all captives in some ways. Our survival, and that of many of the species maintained in captivity, depends upon an evolutionary adaptation to our cage. \nWe must face the fact that many species, which are highly successful in captivity, face inevitable extinction in the wild. As holders of the Living Ark we need to decide whether we can accept their permanent demise in order to make life easier for those who face the fury of the extremists or whether we have the energy and foresight to overcome opposition and proudly encourage the captive collections to flourish.\n&#xa0;\nWe have two stark choices:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOr, we can continue the inevitable achievement of choice 1. by means of the ardent prosecution of the current cumbersome and illogical legislation, the fear of which has already proved an effective deterrent to many breeders. It is chilling to bear in mind that the ultimate aim of many radicals is to abolish the keeping of all animals and birds in captivity; domesticated and farming stock will eventually face this ‘final solution’. \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
