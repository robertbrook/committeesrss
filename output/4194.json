"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nSevenoaks Cycle Forum (CYS0088)\n&#xa0;\nDebate continues to be based on the\n widely shared but erroneous \nassumption that road safety is accurately defined by crash and casualty statistics.  \nDuring its 2012 inquiry\n your\n committee notably failed to ask the basic question ‘What is road safety and how \nshould it be measured\n?’ The current inquiry should make amends\n by revisiting this question\n and should make clear that road safety includes \nmuch \nmore than just casualty reduction\n.   The \nexclusive \nreliance on \nStats19 data\n \nto measure safety for cyclists and pedestrians \nis flawed for at least three reasons: a) it leads t\no an assumption that an absence of crashes and casualties \non \na particular road means that \nroad \nis ‘safe’\n,\n when in fact \nit is \noften \nso unsafe that pedestrians and cyclists are forced to avoid it. \nb\n) crashes involving cyclists are often un\nder-\nreported \nc\n) ann\nual reductions in \noverall \nKSI figures owe\n more to improved\n NHS casualty treatment and\n better\n vehicle design to protect motorists\n than to real improvements in road safety \n for vulnerable users\n.\n  Road safety is a complex area of social policy, like public he\nalth\n, child protection\n or community safety, but \nthe conventional wisdom among road safety professionals does not reflect this.  Nobody would measure public health\n outcomes\n by looking solely at statistics for acute episodes such as heart attacks and strokes\n.  Nobody would measure crime by looking solely at murders and serious assaults. \nNobody would measure child welfare by counting only children who are taken to hospital.\n But road safety is \nstill \nmeasured solely by looking at KSI statistics.  The DfT should \ncopy the Home Office which supplements police statistics of recorded crime by publishing the British Crime Survey.  A British Road Safety Survey using opinion sampling would be an overdue innovation and your committee should recommend it.  \nIt is not enough\n just to tell people that cycling is statistically safe; for inexperienced cyclists and potential cyclists, an individual risk assessment based on their own perceptions\n \nis what counts.\n \nThis is \nparticularly important \nwhen parents are deciding whether or not\n to let their children ride bikes on the road.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI think these recommendations would help give your report a broader national perspective on the issue of cycle safety outside major cities.  \nThat is not to say that the issues emerging from the London debate (HGV safety, segregation, cycle training and redesign of junctions)\n are not also relevant in rural and suburban areas.  We would just like a tiny fraction of the attention (and the generous\n funding) which is being directed towards cycle safety in London to be channelled in our direction as well.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
