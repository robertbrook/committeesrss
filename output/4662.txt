[[[(LTD0037)]]]&#xa0;CIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,500 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT members plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems and infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.&#xa0;CIHT welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Committee’s call for evidence. CIHT responses are based on inputs from members of the CIHT who have experience from across the local government H&amp;T sector.

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]      Investment in infrastructure to support UK economic growth is essential and business investor confidence that can be placed in the delivery of that infrastructure is vital. Uncertainty in this regard could place the UK at a competitive disadvantage in global markets.&#xa0;      Clarity and certainty on the timing of infrastructure investment comes less from change in the decision making process itself, but from having a clear vision of the strategic priorities for the UK.  The identification of those strategic infrastructure priorities has to be driven by an understanding of the key spatial priorities for the UK economy.&#xa0;    Progress with the preparation of the National Policy Statement on National Networks is therefore welcomed by the CIHT, providing the potential opportunity to set out a clear long-term framework for the development of the country’s transport infrastructure.  However, it is essential that such a policy statement sits within a broader spatial strategy for the country, including, housing, jobs, environment and infrastructure. One that takes account of, and builds upon, the economic strengths and potential of key sub-national areas.  CIHT will be responding to the government’s consultation in due course.&#xa0; Such a framework at the national level would provide a clear strategic framework within which detailed proposals could be developed by partners at the local level: for the purposes of this submission the argument assumes that the most appropriate ‘local level’ is the functional economic area.&#xa0; Such considerations become all the more pertinent with the establishment of the Local Growth Fund.  Lord Heseltine’s report ‘No Stone Unturned’ identified the critical importance for the UK to target investment in infrastructure to support economic growth and the need to prioritise that investment if the UK economy is to be globally competitive.&#xa0;

[[[Q1. ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local decision making on transport expenditure?  What are the advantages and disadvantag]]]

[[[es of the Government’s approach?  Are there better models?]]]&#xa0;

[[[1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The government’s proposals to devolve decision making on expenditure ultimately fits in with their localism agenda – devolving power and responsibility from a national to local level.&#xa0;

[[[1.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The over-riding consideration for any decision making process is the need to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of the outcomes being sought.&#xa0;

[[[1.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The timescales associated with the identification, development and subsequent implementation of major transport schemes are lengthy: a factor that needs to be taken into account whenever reviewing the need for change to the decision making process for prioritising and allocating funding.&#xa0;

[[[1.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Within the last five years the decision making process for allocating funds to invest in transport infrastructure has undergone repeated and fundamental change – from the prioritisation of schemes on a regional/sub national basis, to centralised decision making, to devolution to Local Transport Boards and now to non-statutory partnerships led by the Local Enterprise Partnerships working in partnership with local authorities and other partners.&#xa0;

[[[1.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Change to the decision making process is in itself not inherently a bad thing.  However, it needs to be remembered that any change temporarily adds inertia to the delivery process.  The Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) is of the view that the profession’s collective ability to improve the efficiency and speed of delivery of infrastructure is inextricably linked to the extent to which there is a degree of continuity and certainty in the basis of the decision making process.  The creation of the Single Local Growth Fund should assist with certainty of the funding stream.&#xa0;

[[[1.6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Devolution of decision making to the local level has been accompanied by a simplified approach to planning policy.  Whilst the introduction of the National Planning Policy Framework has simplified the overarching policy framework, there remains an expectation within the profession, as to the need to retain and reference technical guidance and/or advice.&#xa0;

[[[1.]]]

[[[7]]]   The establishment of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), followed by the opportunity for local partners to work on the development of City-Deal proposals, and now the prospect of Growth Deals, have led to the development of stronger working relationships between public sector organisations, the business community and academia.  There remains a need to ensure the same level of duty to cooperate (consider neighbouring authorities) applies to LEPs and Planning Authorities as the Traffic Management Act places on Local Highway Authorities to address cross boundary concerns&#xa0;

[[[1.8]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Such initiatives can encourage the development of a single narrative for a functional economic area – potentially enabling local partners to better articulate the inter-relationship between investment in transport infrastructure, environment, housing and skills in support of economic growth across their area.  Whilst agreeing with the government’s move towards devolution, there is a danger that local response could be very local and not joined up, leading to inconsistencies.   

[[[1.9]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local partners should be allowed to build upon this by continuing to be allowed to develop bespoke governance and working arrangements for their area that best reflect their local circumstances.  However, it is accepted that the governance and working arrangements should be subject to the approval of Government: to ensure that devolution of funding (with the potential for being held accountable to Parliament) is vested in an appropriately constituted set up.&#xa0;

[[[Q2]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterpri]]]

[[[se partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes?  What would the optimum delivery body look like?]]]&#xa0;

[[[2.1]]]  It is difficult to make a complete assessment of the new arrangements as not enough time has yet passed to make a proper evaluation. Some local bodies are also further ahead and working more effectively than others.&#xa0;

[[[2.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CIHT argues that a discussion on the governance and working arrangements at the local level should differentiate between the forum in which decisions on investment priorities are made and the arrangements in place to deliver that investment on the ground.  &#xa0;

[[[2.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The previous attempt to devolve decision making on the allocation of investment in major transport schemes – through the process of Regional Funding Allocations – enabled local decision makers to use their knowledge to prioritise the available transport funding and to co-ordinate that investment with the funds available for housing and economic development.&#xa0;

[[[2.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CIHT argues that the importance of adopting a co-ordinated approach remains as valid today as it did then – travel is a derived demand.&#xa0;

[[[2.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A key issue that needs consideration as part of this Inquiry is that of the availability of the technical and political skills required to enable the decision making process to operate efficiently.  Local Highway Authorities continue to be the main repository for these skills within the local area.  It is therefore unsurprising that many Local Enterprise Partnerships look to their Local Highway Authorities to provide the technical support on transport related matters.  &#xa0;

[[[2.6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CIHT argues that the role of Local Highway Authorities and Integrated Transport Authorities in this regard should be acknowledged more explicitly across Government.  &#xa0;

[[[2.7]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the absence of such acknowledgement, a consequence of the on-going financial pressures within the public sector is the loss of existing skills.  This removes capacity and capability within the authorities at the very time when there is an increased need for the public sector to provide strong leadership in the development and delivery of major transport schemes.  An added threat to the skills base is the contraction in size and scope of local authority activities.  Change of this type reduces the opportunities and capacity of local authorities to train and develop the skills required to maintain the skills base in the longer term.&#xa0;

[[[2.8]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As is the case with many other professions, that of transport planning faces the challenges of an aging demographic.  As a professional body the CIHT is actively supporting the development of appropriate skills within the existing workforce as well as encouraging future generations to enter the profession.&#xa0;

[[[Q3]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?]]]&#xa0;

[[[3.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A ‘light touch’ national spatial strategy, supported by a National Policy Statement on National Networks, would provide such co-ordinated approach at the national level.  The CIHT argues that this would have two immediate benefits.  Firstly it would reinforce the need for increased cross-Departmental working within Whitehall, in the process supporting the establishment of the Local Growth Fund.  Secondly, it would provide local partners with a clear context within which to develop their local proposals: proposals that reflect local priorities and which are outcome focused.&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The issue of transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries has to be considered in the context of the issues that each scheme might raise.  Where a cross boundary scheme is of national significance in its own right, or forms part of a wider corridor approach that is of national significance, it would seem appropriate for that to be reflected in the national framework.&#xa0;

[[[3.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The key consideration for any potential scheme (not just ones that are cross boundary) must be an understanding of the outcome it delivers and how that relates to the agreed outcomes for the relevant functional economic area.   By focusing on the delivery of outcomes, schemes that cross local authority boundaries should not be disadvantaged.&#xa0;

[[[Q4]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Gover]]]

[[[nment departments and national transport agencies?]]]&#xa0;

[[[4.]]]

[[[1]]]              In a recent workshop hosted by CIHT on behalf of the DfT and HA and including Local Authorities and LEPs it became clear that there were some good or improving working practices between Local Authorities and the Highways Agency.&#xa0;

[[[4.]]]

[[[2]]]              It is important that this relationship is maintained and improved upon once the Highways Agency becomes a GoCo, ensuring that a duty to cooperate and the economic growth agenda are covered by any new holistic performance specification. &#xa0;

[[[4.3]]]               Improved certainty of funding for the newly formed Highways Agency should assist local areas better understand, inform and respond to the Agency’s plans. It should also improve local networks to meet the wider economic growth agenda.&#xa0;

[[[4.4]]]   The Agency should also have a better understanding on how it can and should involve local bodies.   Customers view the highway network as a whole and local bodies, the HA and other stakeholders need to recognise this.&#xa0;

[[[4.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many authorities are taking some if not all of the standard methodologies developed by the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP), a sector led, DfT sponsored programme.  This is a positive trend and should be encouraged by all.&#xa0;

[[[4.6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also important for the DfT to ensure that other government departments recognise the cross-cutting nature of transport and the cross-sector benefits that can result from transport investment (e.g. health, climate change, education, air quality and access to key services).&#xa0;

[[[4.7]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst the establishment of LEPs has led to stronger working relationships between public and private sectors there remains further room for improved and more effective working. &#xa0;

[[[4.8]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It will be essential that there is coordination and cooperation between local bodies.  Whilst there are some very good examples of good local working practices, there is a danger of uneven development and funding which could lead to inconsistencies. There can also be different skills levels and types between areas.  A higher skill level would be seen as a huge advantage to an areas ability to attract investors.&#xa0;

[[[Q5]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Do the current funding ]]]

[[[streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities?  How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?]]]&#xa0;

[[[5.1]]]   One aspect of private sector funding for transport that gives cause for concern is that secured through the planning system.  Whilst experience with the Community Infrastructure Levy is limited to date, there is a growing concern that the opportunity to secure an appropriate contribution towards transport infrastructure through the planning system is becoming more difficult.&#xa0;

[[[5.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This concern is compounded by the fact that up to 25% of Community Infrastructure Levy monies secured will be directed in accordance with the priorities identified by neighbourhood communities.&#xa0;

[[[5.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is an inherent inflexibility present within the Community Infrastructure Levy when compared with the previous S106 regime.  In the latter the need to secure an appropriate contribution towards transport infrastructure could be driven back into the land value if necessary.  That flexibility is lost as a result of the introduction of the Community Infrastructure Levy.&#xa0;

[[[5.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Failure to address the challenges associated with securing appropriate contributions for transport infrastructure through the planning system will inevitably increase the pressure on other funding sources.&#xa0;

[[[5.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A move from grants to competitive bidding rounds for pots of funding could be a drain on already scare resources&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q6 ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the Single Local ]]]

[[[Growth Fund have?]]]&#xa0;

[[[6.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Devolution of decision making on funding must be accompanied by extending the scope for local partners to determine the basis on which their local priorities are arrived at.  Variations in approach to reflect local circumstances should be encouraged, confident in the fact that the national spatial strategy provides an appropriate strategic context.&#xa0;

[[[6.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The closer one can align policy making with responsibility for the allocation of funds, the greater the opportunity to improve the efficiency and timeliness of the decision making process.&#xa0;

[[[6.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is essential that the local governance and working arrangements associated with the devolution of decision making and funding reflect the views of the public sector organisations, the business community and academia.  It is particularly important that the views of one sector do not dominant.  &#xa0;

[[[6.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is essential that the allocation of funds from the Single Local Growth Fund is not overly focused on investment in new infrastructure to unlock development opportunities.  Public sector organisations, and in particular the Local Transport Authorities, will be keen to ensure that significant investment continues to be made in maintaining the existing transport infrastructure.  The CIHT has consistently argued the case for investment in maintenance of the existing asset as being of equal, if not greater, significance when it comes to supporting economic growth in the round. &#xa0;

[[[6.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a danger that the delivery could be fragmented and lack overall cohesion which could lead to inefficiencies of scale.  As mentioned in 4.5 the use of HMEP, encouraging sharing of learning/best practices and set ways of operating will help to drive efficiencies into delivery at a local level.&#xa0;

[[[6.]]]

[[[6]]]              Better forward visibility of public sector funding (i.e. five years plus) would enable local bodies to better develop a clear strategy and provisional programme and therefore lever private sector contributions and other joint funding to deliver a more secure programme of infrastructure schemes.&#xa0;

[[[6.7]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Flexibility of Strategic public sector funding to enable more contributions to schemes that are not on the strategic network but contribute to strategic objectives&#xa0;

[[[Q7.]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for ]]]

[[[the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure?  What scope is there for the use of alternative funding schemes?]]]&#xa0;

[[[7.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many Local Transport Authorities have established long-term contractual arrangements with private sector delivery partners who support them in fulfilling their statutory duties.  Increasingly Local Transport Authorities are exploring with these partners the opportunity to develop more innovative approaches to financing the delivery of major transport schemes.  &#xa0;

[[[7.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The opportunity for local partners to leverage in additional funding (as opposed to financing delivery of schemes with funding already secured) is again something that Local Transport Authorities are exploring.  The covenant of local authorities in the UK remains very attractive to institutional investors.  Government support for innovative solutions led by Local Transport Authorities may enable additional funding to be leveraged more cost effectively than if led by the private sector.  &#xa0;

[[[7.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Such an approach could be seen as reinforcing the devolution of decision making and funding to local partnerships.  It could also be used to reinforce other Government initiatives designed to increase the extent to which funding raised locally is retained within the local economy.&#xa0;

[[[Q8]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[How c]]]

[[[lear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?]]]&#xa0;

[[[8.1]]]  The lines of accountability are unclear.  CIHT believes that LTBs, LEPs should be democratically accountable and representative, it is essential that the development of local scheme priorities fits with existing statutory plans. Elected members from district councils and, in the metropolitan areas, the Integrated Transport Authorities, should have a clear and prominent role in the process.&#xa0;

[[[8.2]]]  In our view, encouragement should be given for membership of the LTBs to be extended to other bodies, as relevant, including the Highways Agency, Network Rail, local Chambers of Commerce, key transport operators, and representative bodies in relation to public transport &#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]              The approach set out in this submission to establishing the local governance and working arrangements, if supported by Government through the publication of a ‘light-touch’ national spatial strategy would provide clarity in terms of the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure.&#xa0;The CIHT argues that clarity and stability in the decision making process is essential in order to provide certainty for scheme promoters to invest staff time and valuable revenue funding in the development of proposals.  It is also essential in order to provide confidence to business investors who are looking for a modern and efficient transport system to support economic growth.&#xa0;Constant change to the decision making process in recent years has not given scheme promoters and their delivery partners the confidence to make the investment in scheme development that would enable the required long-term investment programme for UK to come forward.  &#xa0;As a consequence, when opportunities to secure funding from Government have arisen so the likelihood increases that some of that funding is allocated to opportunistic schemes simply because they are ready.  The existence of an agreed programme of investment determined locally within the framework provided by a national spatial strategy would help ensure that the funds available are allocated to the most appropriate schemes.&#xa0;The CIHT submit that the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund affords the opportunity to develop a truly devolved decision making and funding arrangement.  However, in order to ensure that such an approach is efficient and delivers timely investment it is important that Government provides a ‘light touch’ national spatial strategy: one that is supported by appropriate national policy statements.&#xa0;December 2013  &#xa0;
