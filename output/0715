default              
defaultThe 
defaultHouse of Commons Science and Technology Committee (hereinafter the S &amp; T C
defaultommittee
default)
default has announced its intention to hold an enquiry into what the public understand about climate, where people look for their information, and how that may impact on climate change policy
default; and it has invited written submissions. Such is the nature of the present document.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultThe invitation requires that each submission 
defaultshould 
defaultinclude a declaration of interest
default.
default I served in the 
defaultForeign Office 
default(

defaultFCO

default from 1948 to 1973, and was

default and was for the last 5 of these years 
default- which included the period of the

defaultIn 
defaultits call for submissions
default,
default the Committee
default drew attention to its own Report "Devil’s bargain? Energy risks and the public"
default (Session 2012-13)
default. That Report was fundamentally flawed. At no stage did it attempt to define the extent to which climate change is man-made. This 
defaulthas to be
default the key 
defaultclimate 
defaultissue for anyone concerned with energy policy.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultThe published Terms of Reference of the S &amp; T Committee's Enquiry record that "In 2006, 81% of surveyed 
defaultUK
default citizens were fairly or very concerned about climate change
default,
default compared with 76% in 2,009 in an identical tracking survey". 
defaultEven more striking are the results of a survey by GlobeScan Radar
default, published in February, 2013,
default of nearly 23,000 people in 22 countries, including the UK, which found that, since 2009, the proportion of people viewing climate change as "very serious" has fallen from 62% to 49%. In these circumstances, one would have expected that the very first question the S &amp; T Committee would place 
defaultbefore the Enquiry would be "Is
default&#xa0;
defaultit time for the British Government - and the EU Institutions which 
defaultat present 
defaultbroadly agree with 
defaultthat Government's
default views on MM
defaultGW
default - to take a fresh look at the question to what extent climate change can 
defaultrealistically 
defaultbe regarded as 
default'
defaultman
default&#x2011;
defaultmade
default'?"
default.
default Instead, each of the seven questions in the Terms of Reference 
defaulttake it for granted
default that man 
defaultis 
defaultlargely responsible for observed climate change.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultThe British 
defaultGo
defaultvernment &amp; the EU Institutions 
defaulta
defaultccept without question that there is a direct and close correlation between the vo
defaultlume of man-made 
defaultGreenhouse Gases, especially 
defaultCO2 Emissions
default,
default 
defaulton the one hand, and global temperatures on the other. It was on those grounds that they accepted, first the Kyoto Protocol; and, second, the target set by the EU Heads of Government to source 20% of all the 
defaultUnion
default’s energy from renewable sources by 2020. The latter is held by the E
defaultU
default to require the 
defaultUK
default to increase the share of renewables in our energy mix from 1.5% today, to 15% in 2020.
default&#xa0;
default6. 
default              
defaultHowever, Parliament has chosen to go far beyond this challenging commitment
default,
default by imposing on the British Government the Climate Change Act of 2008, which lays upon the 
defaultSecretary of State a duty 
defaultto ensure
default that the net 
defaultUK
default carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultI would not for a moment argue that the human race has had no impact at all on the climate. But, in my submission, the whole idea of 
defaultMMGW
default has been grotesquely exaggerated, by too many
default people
default, 
defaulton the basis of highly questionable evidence, 
defaultover the last quarter century. The world has been warming &amp; cooling ever since it began, around 4.5
default&#xa0;
defaultBn BC. As the "Economist" has recently reminded us 
default- 
defaultsee article on “The Cambrian Explosion” on p 87 of the 23 March Issue
default -
default during "The Snowball Earth" Era, which lasted from around 725 Mn. BC to around 541 Mn BC, there were a series of Ice Ages, which were, at their maxima, among the most extensive glaciations in the world's history. They alternated, though, with periods when the planet's average temperature was sometimes as high as 50 Degrees C. None of this was due to MM
defaultGW
default. Man was simply not around in those days. The first Homo Erectus, predecessor of Human Beings (Homo Sapiens), emerged around BC 2 Mn. Homo Sapiens came into existence in 
defaultAfrica
default ca. 200,000 BC, and rapidly spread round the world. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultBetween 1975 and 1998, there was clearly a rise in world 
defaultaverage 
defaulttemperatures. In the latter year, therefore, it could have seemed reasonably logical to suggest that this was due to the rapidly increasing global emissions of CO2
default, which averaged 1.5 ppm per annum over that period (NOAA data).
default. In 1998, however, the increase of world temperatures halted. Since then, for 15 years, 
defaultglobal
default 
defaultaverage 
defaulttemperatures have been virtually static. During the same period, global CO2 emissions rose 
defaulteven faster, at 1.85 ppm per annum, or almost 8%. 
defaultThe argument that CO2 emissions contribute to an important extent to climate change has therefore been 
defaultsteadily 
defaultweaken
defaulting, year by year, for 15 years, and is no longer valid
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultMost 
defaultreasonably 
defaultwell 
defaultinformed 
defaultpeople are aware of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change of 9 May 1992. Its ultimate aim was declared to be the stabilisation of greenhouse gas [GHG] concentrations in the atmosphere at a level which would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. It was followed by the Kyoto Protocol (to the Convention) of 11 Dec 1997. This set targets, though for Developed Countries only: amongst the latter, moreover, there were notable exceptions from the ratification process, including the 
defaultUSA
default &amp; 
defaultAustralia
default. The key aim was that Contracting States should – over the period 2008 to 2012 – each reduce their GHG emissions by 5% compared with 1990.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultIn December 2007, there took place in 
defaultBali
default a Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, along with certain other countries, making a total of over 180 States. This Conference took into account the work of the 
defaultInternational Panel for Climate Change (
defaultIPCC
default)
default. It agreed two key documents. The first was the Bali Road Map. This envisaged the preparation of a new Agreement on Climate Change, intended for adoption at a similar conference in 
defaultCopenhagen
default in December 2009. The
default&#xa0;
defaultpreparatory work was entrusted to an Ad Hoc Working Group on Long
default&#x2011;
defaultTerm Cooperative Action [AHWG-LTCA]. The Working Group was asked to provide a progress report in time for consideration at a similar conference in 
defaultPoznan
default, 
defaultPoland
default, in December 2008. The second was the Bali Action Plan. This document is essentially a list of rather general ideas to be studied by the 
defaultAHWG-LTCA.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultIn December, 2009, there took place 
defaultin 
defaultCopenhagen
default 
defaulta
defaultnother 
defaultConference of the Parties, which achieved nothing much
default,
default except 
defaultfor agreement 
defaultto continue the work of the AHWG-LTCA. 
defaultThere were further such Conferences in Cancún (2010), 
defaultDurban
default (2011) and 
defaultDoha
default (2012). The last one 
defaultagreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol to 2020, and to set a date of 2015 for the development of a successor document, to be implemented from 2020.
default 
defaultOtherwise, 
defaultthe Parties have achieved remarkably little.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultThe work of all these Conferences has been prepared by the IPCC. 
defaultIts Reports have been the subject of much criticism by scientists, and other people in a position to understand climatological questions. In its 2007 Report, for example, the IPCC made the central claim that the world's glaciers were melting so fast that those in the 
defaultHimalayas
default could ‘very likely’ vanish by 2035. This was at once sharply contested by many scientists. And, in January, 2010, the IPCC itself released a Statement acknowledging that, in the case study on the Himalayan glaciers, ‘the clear and well-established standards of evidence, required by the IPCC procedures were not applied properly’. In other words, they
default admitted that the claim was unsustainable
default.
default It has been suggested that the figure resulted from the mis-reading of the figure 2350 from an earlier Report.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultattitudes of t
defaulthe IPCC have been criticised by
default, inter alios, 
defaultProfessor John Beddington, who was appointed in 2010 as the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser. In an Article published by "The Times" on 27 January 
defaultof that year
default, he said that climate scientists should be less hostile to sceptics who questioned the theory of MMGW. ‘I don’t think it
default'
defaults healthy to dismiss proper scepticism. Science grows and improves in the light of criticism. There is a fundamental uncertainty about climate change prediction that can’t be changed. Certain unqualified statements have been unfortunate. We have a problem in communicating uncertainty. ... All these predictions have to be caveated by saying: “there’s a level of uncertainty there”’.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultIn June 2011, the Global Warming Policy Foundation published a Report on climate change by Lord Turnbull. Few people could speak 
defaulton this subject 
defaultwith more authority: Lord Turnbull was, successively, Head of the Department of the Environment (1994-98), then Head of the Treasury (1998-2002), and finally Cabinet Secretary &amp; Head of the Civil Service (2002-2005).  In 
defaulthis Report
default he stated the following
default. 
defaultThere is huge controversy about the relative contribution of man-made CO2 versus natural forces such as the sun, cosmic rays, clouds and the oceans. Many scientists would support an alternative hypothesis that the globe has been on a gentle warming trend since the end of the Little Ice Age around two hundred years ago, with alternating periods measured in decades of faster and slower growth, or even periods of moderate decline. Such an alternative view would not justify the alarmism which characterizes much of the public debate.
default 
defaultThe Really Inconvenient Truth is that the propositions of the IPCC do not bear the weight of certainty with which they are expressed. However, 
defaulthe wrote, 
defaultthe purpose of 
defaulthis
default paper 
defaultwa
defaults not to argue that there is another truth which should become the new consensus, but to point out the doubts that exist about the IPCC viewpoint
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultserious flaws in its procedures. It 
defaultwa
defaults also to question why the UK Government has placed such heavy bets on one particular source of advice. The economic policy choices being made w
defaultould
default not minimize the cost of
default mitigation. The paper concluded
default with a call for more humility from scientists, more rational reflection from politicians, and more challenge from our parliamentarians.

defaultOn the other side of the Atlantic, i
defaultn the 
defaultUSA
default,
default 
default31,000 Academics have signed a petition 
defaultto the US
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment 
defaultrejecting the idea that man has been responsible for Global Warming.
default 9,000 of them hold Ph
default D Degrees, mostly in Engineering. The Petition was first adopted in 1998, and re
default&#x2011;
defaultadopted in 2007. 
defaultIssued by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine in response to Al Gore’s film on Climate Change, ‘An
default&#xa0;
defaultInconvenient Truth’, it says that ‘There is no convincing evidence that human release of GHG is causing, or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s Climate’.
default 
defaultA similar statement was made by over 500 scientists, researchers, economists &amp; policy makers
default,
default who attended an International Conference on Climate Change at 
defaultNew York
default on 
default4 March, 2008. 
default(The
default&#xa0;
defaultManhattan
default Declaration). It said
default,
default 
defaultinter alia, 
defaultthat, in the historical record, the rise in CO2 [levels] has always followed periods of warming (as the effects of disturbances on the Sun and the Earth created more CO2); and not preceded them, as the man made global war
defaultming (MMGW) theorists maintain.
default It likewise declared that ‘there is no convincing evidence that CO2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past, is now, or will in the future, cause catastrophic climate change’.
default&#xa0;

default.
default              
defaultIn spite of this widespread and increasing scepticism about MMG
defaultW
default, t
defaulthe British Government and the EU – which both subscribe
defaultd to the Kyoto Protocol – 
defaultcontinue to
default hold that GHG, &amp; notably CO2 emissions, should be reduced. 
defaultThey argue that 
defaultScientific Research has shown, after
default coring the Antarctic ice for 3
default&#xa0;
defaultkilometres, covering 740,000 years, that today’s greenhouse gas levels are the highest for 440,000 years; and that much smaller increases have been linked to a significant degree of global warming. CO2 levels hover around 200 parts per million [ppm] during ice ages
default,
default and 280 ppm during interglacial periods. Now they are around 394 ppm. 
defaultThey choose to ignore the 
defaults
defaultcientific theory 
default- see paragraph  15 - 
defaultabout the relationship between past rises in CO2 levels, and their having 
defaultfollowed periods of warming and not preceded them,.
default1
default7
default.
default              
defaultThe problem of GHG emissions of human origin must, in any case, be kept in correct perspective. The world
default's climate
default is always at risk from other causes - for example a meteor strike. GHG can emerge in nature – e.g.
default&#xa0;
defaultthrough massive volcanic explosions, as at Krakatoa. And they are by no means the only influence on our climate. Sunspots constitute another major one. For 12,000 years we have been in the run-down from the last ice
default&#x2011;
defaultage. Glaciers have been receding. But there have been speed
default&#x2011;
defaultups and slow
default&#x2011;
defaultdowns in the process - often very large. There were mini
default&#x2011;
defaultIce
default&#x2011;
defaultAges in the Dark Ages (540
default&#x2011;
default950); and again between 1300 and 1850. These produced intense cold, untimely frosts and widespread famine. The production of GHG 
defaultin that period
default was insignificant by comparison with today.
default It should also be borne in mind that fossil-fuel burning is not the only source of CO2 em
defaultissions. Currently 7,333 MT of CO2
default are released annually,
default as forests are destroyed. (The latter process
default is politely called ‘change of land use’).
default American researchers have 
defaultalso 
defaultdiscovered that the amount of water high in the atmosphere is far more influential on world temperatures than previously thought. A study, published in the journal Science [January 2010], says that a 10 % drop in humidity 10
default&#xa0;
defaultmiles above the Earth's surface explains why global temperatures have been stable since the start of the
default 21st 
defaultcentury, despite the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A rise in water vapour in the 1980’s and 90’s may also explain why temperatures shot up so quickly in the previous two decades, they say.
default&#xa0;
default1
default8
default.
default              
defaultIt seems clear that the last global cold spell ended in 1975. The argument for climate change is therefore based on only 3
default7
default years of experience. 
defaultBut 
defaultGlobal warming 
defaultc
defaulteased
default in 1997, and has not since resumed.
default 
defaultIn short, temperatures across the world are not increasing as they should, according to the fundamental theory behind global warming – the greenhouse 
defaultgas 
defaulteffect. Something else is happening, and it is vital that we find out what; or else we may 
defaultgo on 
defaultspend
defaulting
default hundreds of billions of 
defaultP
defaultounds, Euros or 
defaultD
defaultollars needlessly
default. 
defaultO
defaultne is led to the conclusion that either the hypothesis of global warming induced by carbon dioxide holds, but its effects are being modified in some unexplained way; or else the working hypothesis does not stand the test of data.
default That is what the S &amp; T Committee should be considering.
default19.
default              
defaultWriting as one who was the Senior Official in the European Commission's then Directorate-General of Energy. I would argue that neither the EU nor 
defaultt
defaulthe British Government 
defaulttoday have any 
defaultcoherent energy policy. It is blindingly obvious that - if the lights are to be kept on - 
defaultthe British Government 
defaultwill have to change direction. It is appalling that the 
defaultsaid 
defaultGovernment, which claims to accept the need for more nuclear power, 
defaulthas not brought about the 
defaultstart of building 
defaulta single nuclear power reactor since the last one was opened at Sizewell in 1995. 
defaultThe Government 
defaulthas also achieved no progress towards the creation of underground storage capacity for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. 
default20
default.
default              
defaultThe EU, the British Government, and all the 
defaultUK
default's main Political Parties have, ever since the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, committed themselves to the theory that CO2 emissions have a major impact on the world's climate. The Government has spent colossal sums of money on trying to reduce those emissions. Much of this money has been found by levies on British energy consumers. It is understandable that the Government should now be reluctant to admit that their claims regarding the impact of CO2 were grossly exaggerated. But it is 
defaultalso 
defaultinexcusable that 
defaultthe S &amp; T Committee
default should avoid even considering the issue at all, whilst 
defaultitself 
defaultrecognising that a massive &amp; growing proportion of the electorate 
defaulthave grave doubts about the matter.
