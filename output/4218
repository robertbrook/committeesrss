default 
defaultThis project employed the latest types of automated sensor sorting equipment to separate out a stream of PE-type plastic films which were then cleaned and recycled back into high-quality polymer pellets.  The output plastic was made into blown-film black refuse sacks at a &gt;50% addition level to virgin polymers, proving that the technology already exists to capture and recycle this huge waste stream in the UK market

default with WRAP, by demonstrating that PE pellets recovered from waste plastic films can be used in a wide range of other applications, such as 
defaultroto

default 
default One product of particular note was a moulding of a retail store clothes mannequin that was 
defaultsuccessfully 
defaultmade with 50% recycled polyethylene; we think this proves that the recycling of plastic from retail shopping bags and other packaging films should be forming a significant proportion of the UK’s plastic recycling tonnage as part of our effort to meet the high and increasing targets set by D

defaultrowth
defaultThe evidence from recently published data by RECOUP
default about the level of
default collected tonnages across the three
default main groupings of household plastic 
defaultpackaging 
defaultwaste: bottles; pots, tubs &amp; trays (PTT) and films, indicate that consumer
defaults
default will place a large proportion of used packaging items into the kerbside recycling system in their locality as soon as they are instructed to do so by their local 
defaultauthority
default.
default 
default This point is supported by the rapid growth in the collection of PTTs over the past 
defaultthree
default years, where we can see many 
defaultlocal authorities
default opting to include ‘all rigid plastic types’ in their collection system and an associated rapid growth in national tonnage.
default 
default

default 
defaultit is estimated that 
default19% of PTT
defaults are
default coll

default. 
default 
defaultThere is early evidence that plastic packaging films can follow the same upwards trajectory of growth as described here as soon as the infrastructure and sorting facil

defaultties come on-stream.
defaultAxion
default would therefore want to impress upon the members of the select committee the importance of ensuring that government interventions into the rapidly growing plastics recycling market are implemented in a manner that encourages ‘
defaultmore of the same’
default across all packaging types,
default that is
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is certainly not the right time to be creating more complexity on the mix of packaging film types being placed onto the market by introducing measures that encourage biodegradable films use in carrier bags.
defaultRdefaultesponse to the proposalsdefaultIn terms of how the proposed measures for plastic carrier bags will impact upon the UK’s recycling market we would
default state our opinions as follows:
default1)

defaultImpact of the 5p tax on single-use plastic bags
default&#xa0;
defaultAxion
default 
defaultis
default supportive of a taxation scheme that encourages the principle of ‘REDUCE’ in the waste hierarchy and clearly a tax on carrier bags at point-of-sale will have the effect of reducing the number of bags given out to shoppers.  However, the reduction in materials consumption for a particular purpose should apply across ALL materials (plastic, paper, textile, other) in relation to their total lifecycle impact per item used. 
default 
defaultIn fact, it can be argued that those product types needing the most urgent reduction are the ones that use the most materials with the highest carbon impact per unit of consumption.
default 
default It therefore seems wrong from 
defaultAxion’s
default viewpoint to single out ‘
defaultplastic
default carrier bags’ as a product that needs special tax measures to reduce the numbers used. 
default 
defaultIf this tax creates a switch over to other materials, then it is vital that each 
defaultunit of alternative product (for example
default, a paper carrier bag) does
defaultn't
default represent a change for the worse on a total carbon impact basis.

defaultThe K.I.S.S. Principledefault 
default-
default 
defaultt
defaulthe UK’s plastic recycling industry has developed in parallel with the implementation of vastly improved collection systems from all households across the country. 
default 
defaultThe waste 
defaultmanagement 
defaultsector and the plastic reprocessing sector are entirely dependent upon the continued gr
defaultowth in this collection method.  I
defaultn fact it is often called the ‘urban mine’ from which the above industrial companies are extracting material resources of significant economic value.
default 
default The future successful growth of this sector relies upon a long-term partnership developing between the organisations involved in the packaging supply chain.
default 
default The focus of all players involved in this circular materials flow should be to simplify and standardise on the selection of materials used to make different types of retail packaging products. 
default 
defaultWe have witnessed how this cross-industry approach can deliver huge success in the UK’s 
defaulttrack-record on
default plastic bottle recycling. 
default 
defaultThe water, soft drinks and the dairy sectors have worked together to create a very successful circular economy for HDPE 
default(high density polyethylene) 
defaultand PET 
default(polyethylene 
defaultterephthalate
default) 
defaultpolymer types used to make plastic bottles. 
default 
defaultSupported by the good work of WRAP, the drinks sector ha
defaults
default created clear guidelines for ‘good design’ of packaging that helps to simplify the range of material types used
default and improve the recyclability of these items
default. 
default 
defaultThis has enabled the sorting and separation plants handling these items to build efficient process plants yielding a high recycling rate and profitable commercial results. 
default 
defaultThe conclusion from this brief history of successful recycling must be
default -
default 
defaultkeep the mix of materials simple and then the industry can operate efficiently to deliver ‘defaultgdefaultreen growth’.default&#xa0;defaultii)

defaultIncompatibilitydefault -
default 
defaultt
defaulthere are many different types of polymer used to make packaging products. 
default 
defaultSeveral of these polymer variants are not compatible with each other in terms of blending and recycling by means of thermal melt processing. 
default 
defaultThis means that very sophisticated process plants have been developed to enable the rapid sorting of plastic polymer types to be carried out before plastic waste items can be sent for thermal extrusion processing.
default 
default Very small concentrations of incompatible polymer types in the bulk sorted plastic can have disastrous impacts upon the quality and usability of the recycled polymer compounds. 
default 
defaultThe plastic 
defaultreprocessors
default of Great Britain are constantly fighting against the inclusion of incompatible polymer types into any particular stream of sorted materials.  Flexible plastic packaging films are most often made from polyethylene 
default(
defaultPE
default)
default polymer type.
default 
default In the case of thin-walled, single-use carrier bags PE is almost exclusively the ‘material of choice’ as a result of it
defaults
default extraordinarily high strength for very thin film thickness. 
default 
defaultThe successful recycling of the UK’s carrier bags will be entirely dependent upon the ability of 
defaultreprocessors
default to sort out a high yield of PE polymer types.
default 
default Therefore, why would anybody propose creating an economic driver that encourages the use 
defaultof 
defaulta totally incompatible material into this waste stream?
defaultBiodegradable polymers are often based upon ‘natural polymers’ such as corn-starch and 
defaultPLA’

default (

default acids)
default.
default 
default These materials breakdown on exposure to moisture and oxygen to b

default 
default It would be very, very disruptive to 
defaultthe 
defaultquality of recycled plastics made from collected plastic films IF these biodegradable materials are allowed to be mixed into th

default collection system.
default  They are not compatible with polyolefin plastics and recent studies by Plastics Recyclers Europe have proven that even at very low levels of biodegradable contamination the physical properties of the recycled materials are severely degraded.

defaultoundation and other leading experts. 
default 
defaultThe book explains how natural systems in the Earth’s environment allow a circular flow of materials in, for example, the growth cycles of a tree. 
default 
defaultSince mankind learned how to extract and refine materials describe
defaultd as ‘technical nutrients’ (for example,
default steel, glass, plastic) another parallel,
default 
defaultcircular
default material flow exists -
default that of material recycling. 
default 
defaultThere is only one point from the book to repeat here:
default 
defaultDo not allow the mixture of biodegradable nutrients with technical nutrient
defaults

default.
defaultClearly the proposed exemption for the use of biodegradable bags would do just that

defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;defaultIn conclusion
default,
default

default Recycling can state that:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe wish to propose an alternative way in which 
defaultthe 
defaultUK 
defaultG
defaultovernment can have a positive influence upon the plastic carrier bag market. 
default 
defaultIt is our strong belief that legislative drivers should be ‘carrots’ as well as ‘sticks’ if they are going to reward those organi
defaults
defaultations that change their behavio
defaultu
defaultr in a desirable manner. 
default 
defaultFrom our detailed understanding of the technology used for sorting of waste packaging items and the extrusion of those sorted polymers via thermal processing, we believe that by far the best route here is to positively encourage the demand for recycled plastics to be used to make durable, thicker wall shopping bags designed for multiple use. 
default 
defaultTherefore we would strongly suggest that part of the ‘plastic bag levy system’ includes a clause that allows bags which have been made with a high percentage of recycled content to qualify for a pro-rata reduction in the bag tax in direct relation to the percentage of recycled content that they contain. 
default 
defaultThis would mean that a plastic bag with 50% recycled content (demonstrated in an auditable manner along the supply chain) would only have to pay 0.5 x 5 = 2.5p tax per bag.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis simple adjustment to the proposed levy would create a ‘carrot’ to reward those retailers who specify high recycled film content in their store bags, while leaving the ‘stick’ effect to drive down the use of virgin plastics in single-use carrier bags.
