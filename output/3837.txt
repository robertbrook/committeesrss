[[[Written evidence from Paul Arditti]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;SarkDear Sir,&#xa0;In his evidence to your committee Lord McNally, the UK minister with responsibility for Crown Dependencies, said that he felt a sense of failure with Sark. This failure in my submission stems from a lack of attention to your committee’s comments in their eighth report; in particular their comments about how individuals wielding very significant economic, legal and political power in a very small jurisdiction may skew the operation of democratic government there. &#xa0;Lord McNally’s department has not manifested in their dealings with Sark any policy directed at combating this combination of power. Instead, since your eighth report, the department has continued, wittingly or unwittingly, to encourage Sark to learn how to appease rather than cope with the Barclays’ combination of powers. &#xa0;The result is that the threat to the ability of democratic government in Sark to operate fairly and robustly is now greater than ever. No Conseiller is willing to chair the General Purposes and Advisory Committee, there are four vacancies in Chief Pleas itself and there are difficulties persuading people to stand in the by election to fill those vacancies. &#xa0;Inevitably this combination of powers perpetuates a division between the Barclays on the one hand and the rest of Sark on the other hand. However the department has tried (unsuccessfully) to characterise this division as an even spread of opinion between Sarkees; modernisers and luddites. The department’s characterisation is not supported by the evidence; not least the results of the three general elections in Sark. &#xa0;The BBC’s Today programme and Panorama have both done much to spotlight this combination of power but this has not brought about any change of policy in the department.&#xa0;The minister’s acknowledgement of failure with Sark would be refreshing if it heralds a change of policy by the department. If not, the need for intervention is closer than it was at the time of your committee’s eighth report, in my view.&#xa0;Yours sincerely&#xa0;Paul Arditti &#xa0;
