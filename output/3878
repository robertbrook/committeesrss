Written evidence submitted by the Prison Reform Trust (JRR 0030)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1) The 
[normal]Prison Reform Trust works to create a fair and decent prison system. We do 
[normal]this by looking at how a prison is working, giving information to prisoners, staff and people outside and by asking the government and officials to make changes. We welcome the work the Parole Board is doing to make the process clearer and fairer and the c
[normal]hance to response to this consultation. Alongside our media, research and policy work, we have an advice and information service that deals with over 5,000 queries from prisoners a year.  We do not give legal advice or 
[normal]represent
[normal] in court and therefore we h
[normal]ave not given detailed answers to the consultation questions. However, we answer general queries on the legal process 
[normal]from
[normal] people in prison, and monitor the impact of any potential changes and we therefore wanted to take the opportunity to raise some concerns.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2) 
[normal]Ac
[normal]c
[normal]ess 
[normal]to the legal process, including
[normal] j
[normal]udicial review
[normal],
[normal] is particularly
[normal] important to prisoners
[normal] becaus
[normal]e their
[normal] lives are
[normal] almost
[normal] completely regulated 
[normal]b
[normal]y 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]state. 
[normal]Prisoner
[normal]s
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]fundamental
[normal] rights cannot be 
[normal]safeguarded
[normal] without
[normal] an accessible
[normal] legal system. We are 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]extremely
[normal] 
[normal]concerned
[normal] about the 
[normal]government
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]judicial
[normal] review 
[normal]proposals
[normal]. 
[normal]If enacted
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]they will
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]ake it more 
[normal]difficult and more expen
[normal]sive to take a judicial review. I
[normal]t will be almost impossible to hold
[normal] the 
[normal]government
[normal] 
[normal]decisions 
[normal]to account
[normal], particularly for people from vulnerable groups who already have 
[normal]difficulties
[normal] accessing justice. 
[normal]It will deter 
[normal]ge
[normal]nuine claimants
[normal] from seeking 
[normal]redress
[normal]. It will 
[normal]limit
[normal] access to justice to 
[normal]those
[normal] who have the means to pay
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3) It is difficult to predict 
[normal]exactly
[normal] how the proposals
[normal] will 
[normal]impact
[normal] on 
[normal]prisoners’ convention rights
[normal] 
[normal]but
[normal] we 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]particular
[normal] 
[normal]concerns
[normal] about 
[normal]article
[normal] 8, article 3 and 
[normal]article
[normal] 14 
[normal]rights
[normal], which we 
[normal]believe 
[normal]are in 
[normal]grave danger of being breached. It is also foreseeable that 
[normal]rights under articles 
[normal]2, 9, 
[normal]10 
[normal]and 12 may
[normal] be affected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4) 
[normal]Overall
[normal], we 
[normal]are 
[normal]concerned
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]bout the cumulative impact of 
[normal]these 
[normal]proposals
[normal] on
[normal] people living in 
[normal]under
[normal] 
[normal]resourced and
[normal] 
[normal]pressurised
[normal] prison
[normal]s. 
[normal]We are already seeing 
[normal]deterioration
[normal] in conditions and treatment and have concerns about the needs of minority groups in prison and outcomes for them. 
[normal]This, alongside a lack
[normal] of access to 
[normal]legal
[normal] aid a
[normal]nd 
[normal]a 
[normal]reduction in 
[normal]access to 
[normal]judicial review
[normal],
[normal] is extremely concerning.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Standing and third party [bold]intervention[bold]5) 
[normal]There is already a test for who can bring judicial 
[normal]review
[normal] cases. All claimants have to show that they have ‘sufficient interest’ in the matter.  We do not 
[normal]believe
[normal] that
[normal] cases brought by charities, NGOs and interest groups should be classified as having no direct interest. 
[normal]Charities
[normal] have a right to 
[normal]represent
[normal] their
[normal] 
[normal]beneficiaries
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]particularly
[normal] when they are 
[normal]vulnerable groups who may not be 
[normal]able
[normal] to 
[normal]represent
[normal] themselves. 
[normal]Prisoners are a group of people that fin
[normal]d
[normal] it extremely difficult to access information and the means to take legal 
[normal]action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6) 
[normal]We are also concerned 
[normal]that particularly vulnerable groups in prison
[normal],
[normal] such 
[normal]as those
[normal] with a learning disability, the severely mentally 
[normal]ill
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]foreign
[normal] national prisoner
[normal]s, and children
[normal],
[normal] will be particularly disadvantaged. 
[normal]We are concerned about the implications 
[normal]for these people 
[normal]who
[normal] are 
[normal]often 
[normal]unable to access justice
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7) 
[normal]At 
[normal]the
[normal] moment
[normal] third parties
[normal] can 
[normal]interve
[normal]n
[normal]e
[normal] in cases where they have expertise
[normal] and the court gives 
[normal]permission
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]ntervention from 
[normal]groups
[normal] with expertise in th
[normal]e
[normal] needs 
[normal]of the groups 
[normal]they are working for can
[normal] 
[normal]assist
[normal] in 
[normal]a
[normal]voiding breac
[normal]hing 
[normal]article
[normal] 3 and 
[normal]article
[normal] 14 and help to make better policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8) 
[normal]Many people
[normal] who are
[normal] directly impacted by prison service 
[normal]policies
[normal] are unable
[normal] to make
[normal], or intimidated 
[normal]about taking
[normal] a complaint or 
[normal]a case themselves. 
[normal]Prison
[normal] is a 
[normal]specifically
[normal] coercive 
[normal]environment
[normal] and the loss of autonomy and liberty can create 
[normal]situations
[normal] where people are 
[normal]afraid
[normal] 
[normal]to take
[normal] action. HMIP’s inspection evidence suggests that the prisoner complaints system cannot be consisten
[normal]tly relied on. In their
[normal] surveys last year, 1
[normal]3% of 
[normal]prisoners said
[normal] it was hard to make a complaint, two thirds of those who did so felt it had not been sorted out fairly and nearly one in 
[normal]five said
[normal] they had been prevented from making a complaint.
[normal] People in prison may not take cases 
[normal]forward because
[normal] of 
[normal]fear
[normal] of retribution or 
[normal]repercussions
[normal] from a system or from 
[normal]people
[normal] 
[normal]who
[normal] 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]almost
[normal] 
[normal]total
[normal] control 
[normal]of their lives. 
[normal]In addition
[normal],
[normal] people who have very genuine grievances may not be able to 
[normal]take
[normal] cases because  of
[normal] a
[normal] lack of access to advice, solicitors, knowledge of rights, no automatic information 
[normal]about prison life,
[normal] 
[normal]limited 
[normal]access to phones or writing materials and
[normal] little
[normal] time
[normal] and 
[normal]opportunity
[normal] to find out about their rights. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9) 
[normal]S
[normal]ometimes
[normal] 
[normal]third
[normal] party 
[normal]groups
[normal] take action when the 
[normal]individuals
[normal] are unable to. This has
[normal] previously
[normal] included 
[normal]cases of 
[normal]removal
[normal] from the UK. 
[normal]This can mean that 
[normal]policies
[normal] are changed before the
[normal]y 
[normal]damage
[normal] 
[normal]vulnerable
[normal] 
[normal]individuals
[normal]. 
[normal]These 
[normal]proposals fetter
[normal] 
[normal]judge
[normal]s
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]discretion
[normal] and are unnecessary. It
[normal] is 
[normal]also
[normal] unclear how an 
[normal]organisation
[normal] might prove they have standing. 
[normal]A
[normal]s we have outlined above, m
[normal]any prisoners will be 
[normal]deterred
[normal] from taking their ca
[normal]se forward. A
[normal] 
[normal]proportion
[normal] of prisoners 
[normal]will not be 
[normal]deterred
[normal],
[normal] however, and 
[normal]will take cases forward themselves
[normal] and possibly on behalf of groups of other prisoners. 
[normal] 
[normal]Important
[normal] cases may be 
[normal]lost
[normal] (by 
[normal]prisoners
[normal] 
[normal]litigating
[normal] in 
[normal]person
[normal]) 
[normal]because
[normal] they have not be
[normal]en able
[normal] to 
[normal]prepare
[normal] adequately.
[normal] 
[normal]Solicitors
[normal] 
[normal]fulfil
[normal] a service by advising people when their cases are 
[normal]weak
[normal] and 
[normal]unlik
[normal]ely
[normal] to 
[normal]have
[normal] merit or be granted 
[normal]permission
[normal] for 
[normal]judicial
[normal] review. 
[normal]Without this safeguard 
[normal]in 
[normal]the system the courts may find 
[normal]their workload increases and the time taken for cases is longer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]C[bold]osts [bold]10) 
[normal]The 
[normal]proposed
[normal] changes 
[normal]would
[normal] mean that many
[normal] 
[normal]charities
[normal] 
[normal]and community groups 
[normal]would not be able to access the court. 
[normal]This
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] weight the justice 
[normal]system
[normal] in 
[normal]favour
[normal] of those with assets and finances. In the 
[normal]majority
[normal] 
[normal]o
[normal]f 
[normal]cases,
[normal] 
[normal]ch
[normal]arities
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] not be able 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]bring
[normal] a claim with a protective costs order.
[normal] Costs for t
[normal]hird party interveners 
[normal]make intervening a 
[normal]risky
[normal] 
[normal]prospect
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Public sector equality duty[bold]11) 
[normal]It is currently
[normal] 
[normal]against th
[normal]e law for the prison to treat a 
[normal]prisoner
[normal] 
[normal]less favorably because of their race, 
[normal]g
[normal]ender,
[normal] disability
[normal] 
[normal]sexual 
[normal]orientation
[normal], 
[normal]religion
[normal] or belief
[normal]. 
[normal]Everyone in prison should have equal access to facilities, including jobs, education, library services, exercise and accommodation.
[normal] 
[normal]However, we know that 
[normal]despite
[normal] 
[normal]current
[normal] 
[normal]protectio
[normal]ns
[normal] in law, the 
[normal]outcomes
[normal] for many groups 
[normal]with protected characteristics 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]less f
[normal]avo
[normal]u
[normal]rable
[normal]. 
[normal]We are extremely 
[normal]concerned
[normal] abut the 
[normal]different
[normal] 
[normal]government
[normal] 
[normal]proposals
[normal] that seek to erode 
[normal]this
[normal] duty. 
[normal]We note that black and 
[normal]minority
[normal] ethnic prisoners, Muslim 
[normal]prisoners
[normal] and 
[normal]young prisoners
[normal] consistently report worse 
[normal]experiences
[normal] of prison and treatment in 
[normal]HMIP
[normal] reports. We also note that the 
[normal]majority
[normal] of the 11 
[normal]treatment
[normal] case
[normal]s
[normal] granted legal aid last year were for 
[normal]conditions
[normal] for people with a 
[normal]learning
[normal] 
[normal]disability
[normal] or mental health 
[normal]difficulty.
[normal] 
[normal]Numerous 
[normal]reports
[normal] and 
[normal]research
[normal] identify tha
[normal]t 
[normal]the 
[normal]Prison
[normal] Service
[normal], 
[normal]despite some positive practice and sometimes considerable
[normal] 
[normal]efforts
[normal],
[normal] is 
[normal]failing
[normal] to 
[normal]mee
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]sufficient
[normal] outcomes for many disadvantaged 
[normal]groups
[normal] including, older
[normal] people with 
[normal]mobility
[normal] or care needs
[normal], and
[normal] 
[normal]people
[normal] who are 
[normal]physically
[normal] 
[normal]disabled or hav
[normal]e
[normal] sensory 
[normal]impairments.
[normal]  We are therefore 
[normal]concerned
[normal] that article 3 and article 14 
[normal]rights
[normal] will be 
[normal]further [bold]breached
[normal] without this protection.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Combin[bold]ed effect of these proposals and [bold]legal aid proposals [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Eligibility [bold]for legal aid[bold]12) 
[normal]The 
[normal]government’s
[normal] reforms to legal aid will mean
[normal] that only matters 
[normal]specific
[normal] to the 
[normal]decision
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]detain
[normal] will be funded 
[normal]and 
[normal]that 
[normal]other prison 
[normal]matters
[normal] will not be eligible. Many aspect
[normal]s
[normal] of a 
[normal]prison
[normal] sentence have an 
[normal]impact
[normal] on 
[normal]release
[normal] and ongoing detention,
[normal] 
[normal]particularly
[normal] 
[normal]discretionary
[normal] 
[normal]release
[normal] under parole or home 
[normal]detention
[normal] curfew. Without legal aid to cover risk 
[normal]assessment
[normal]s
[normal], 
[normal]access to 
[normal]offending
[normal] 
[normal]behaviou
[normal]r courses, recategorisation reviews and pre tariff parole 
[normal]hearings
[normal],
[normal] people are likely to stay in prison in longer. 
[normal]We beli
[normal]eve this has implications for article 5.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13) 
[normal]Regarding treatment cases with limited access to judicial review and no access to legal aid t
[normal]he most extreme 
[normal]situations
[normal] are when survivors of torture, children or people with very 
[normal]serious mental health
[normal] problems 
[normal]a
[normal]re concerned. 
[normal]This could engage prisoners
[normal]’
[normal] article 3 rights. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Residence Test[bold] for legal aid[bold]14) We are 
[normal]extremely
[normal] 
[normal]concerned
[normal] that 
[normal]people
[normal] will not be able to access 
[normal]legal
[normal] aid if they cannot 
[normal]fulfil
[normal] the residence tes
[normal]t. It 
[normal]can
[normal] be extremely 
[normal]difficult
[normal] f
[normal]or 
[normal]people
[normal] 
[normal]in prison to access immigration advice and renew their visas or regularise their stay. 
[normal]Many people’s immigration status wil
[normal]l
[normal] change while they are in prison. This could impact on article 3, article 5, article 8 and article 14 rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15) 
[normal]These proposals potentially impact disadvantageously on all prisoners. 
[normal]We would ask the committee to have 
[normal]particular
[normal] regard to the needs of the following groups of people and 
[normal]whose 
[normal]rights may be impacted by the 
[normal]proposals
[normal]:
[normal]trafficked persons who have entere
[normal]d prison because of coercion into criminal activity; people with severe lea
[normal]r
[normal]ning disability or mental health difficul
[normal]ties, people with dementia or
[normal] brain injury living in prisons; Muslim prisoners, children and young people in prisons and indeterminate sent
[normal]enced prisoners
[normal].
