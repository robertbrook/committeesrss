"BRC34\nWritten Evidence from Mr Carl Bennett, MD of Tradeskills4U LtdShort Summary of submission.\nThe electrical Workforce.1.Introduction.1.1 \nI’m Carl Bennett the Managing Director of \nTradeskills4U Ltd. We are the UK's largest educator of the electrical installation adult workforce and the country’s only specialist electrical IET ‘Centre of Excellence’, to put this into context, we\n’re\n actually a modest family run company employ\ning \n30 people. \n1.2 \nWh\nat we are is a business to business company with an enviable reputation and 98% \ncandidate \napproval rating. We are an independent company; \nnone\n funded organization. Chairman Clive Betts MP and other MPs have visited our facilities.\n1.3 \nWe train approximatel\ny\n \n3000 adult candidates each year in a full range of electrical domestic, commercial and industrial skills and adult vocational qualifications, many for continuing professional development. We also train adult apprentices and Domestic electrical installers\n to enable them to register on the various Competent Person’s Schemes. \n1.4 \nOur core candidates are \n75% existing electrical and other trade’s contractors and \n25% new entrants.  \n95 % of our candidates are micro business owners and employers, essentially the\n backbone of the industry. \n1.5 \nLike any good business, we constantly engage with our customers/candidates. Dozens are literally under our roof every day, many of them are electrical contractors and others not fully qualified electricians but are employed \nwithin the greater electrical industry because of their ability to work within the Competent Person Schemes, they have a wide range of experience in many other trades and also have competency in electrical installation to undertake that role as their main \noccupation \nrequires I.e. Heating engineers, kitchen fitters, home maintenance contractors, auto gate installers, gas engineer\ns\n, the list is too numerous to be exhaustive within this space\n1.6 \nAs M\nD\n it’s my job to gather evidence, engage with and listen to \nopinions from every aspect of the wider industry of electrical installation to ensure we supply the right training, qualifications and skills options for employers, electricians, associated trades, companies and new entrants into the industry. \n1.7 \nThese p\neople and their businesses are\n \nmy\n \nconstituency,\n and \nthey e\nnable \nme\n to \nhave a well rounded and perhaps unique view of the domestic electrical installation, repair, maintenance, improvement, upgrade and service industry and in fact the wider issue of the ski\nlls level of the electrical industry\n and \nshould \nentitle \nme\n to express opinions and suggestions in contribution to your debate.\n \n&#xa0;2. The electrical work force, from an industry trainer’s perspective.2.1 \nIt is worth noting, the wider world of the electrical\n installation industry does not belong solely to the institutions of the Electrical Industry. The heating engineer who wires in your boiler is not in the electrical industry, the kitchen fitter, landscape gardener or home maintenance contractor is not in t\nhe electrical industry but nevertheless, everyday they, and many others like them, work quite competently and diligently with electrics.\n \n2.2 \nThis large group of stakeholders,\n certainly in their tens of thousands, \nrival in numbers\n to any of the \norganizatio\nn\ns\n that has spoken to you so far, rarely ha\nve their\n opinions listened to by those with the power to steer the industry\n. These people must be considered in your deliberations.\n2.3 Perhaps because we are an independent educator of the workforce, \nwe are \nable to offer observations \nas educator\ns\n of the workforce \nthat seem quite contrary to some of the view \nI \nhave heard expressed to you so far.\n2.4 \nIn particular our view of the supply of future workers to small employers is very definitely not a positive one.\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n IET (Institution of Engineering Technology), o\nne of the world's largest organisations for engineers and technicians who have warned that proposed reforms to government funding could lead to a reduction in UK apprenticeships. We agree with IET claims \nthat the reforms are likely to reduce quality and deter SMEs from taking part in apprenticeship schemes and have criticised apprenticeship reforms, saying that the changes would incur higher costs that may prevent smaller businesses from taking on apprenti\nces.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nEdge Foundation, a leading independent education charity, pointed to the government's own research that suggests apprentice numbers could fall by \n73% when employers have to pay at least half the cost.\n \n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur views are also consistent with the views of Nigel Whitehead \nUKCES Commissioner with regard to the future of our adult workforce and the recommendations he has made in his report of 8\nth\n November 2013 to improve the vocational qualification structure of \nour adult workforce to better reflect small employer’s needs. \nOur op\ninion is that at the moment they do not.\n3. Shortage of workforce supply.3.1 \nIt may surprise you to learn that the person that comes to your door to undertake some electrical work for you in your home is almost certainly going to be a \nproperly qualified \nCompetent Person and a member of a Competent Person Scheme. They are probably u\nnlikely to be a so called ‘fully qualified electrician’. (That is a contractor who has served a full time traditional apprenticeship with a full set of qualifications\n i.e a Level 3 NVQ plus other qualifications\n) This is a fact that surprises many existing \nelectrical contractors who wrongly assume the ‘fully qualified electrician’ to be in the majority.\n It is certainly our experience that \nan increasing majority of \nelectricians are ‘fully qualified’\n,\n many hav\ning\n failed to keep up with current regulations, tec\nhnologies and changes in \nbest \npractices\n.\n&#xa0;4. Competent Persons keep the system working.4.1 \nIt is o\nur estimation\n,\n gained from experience of the thousands of small contractor companies with whom we engage and is compatible with\n many electrical education and workforce reports I have seen and other business and training leaders in our sector\n we\n have spoken\n with\n that\n less than \n50% of people who undertake electrical work in this country are what you might call ‘fully qualified elect\nricians’, the remainder are likely to be properly trained, qualified and experienced Competent Persons with a wide range of experience in many other trades who also have competency in electrical installations to undertake that role as their main occupation\n requires and I\n have\n no \nevidence to \ndoubt \nthey \ndo a proper and safe job.  \n4.2 \nFrankly if it were not for Competent Persons undertaking electrical work by the tens of thousands, the electrical infrastructure of this country would be compromised and poorly \nserviced. There are not enough so called ‘fully qualified electricians’\n. Many more experienced \nin the industry \nthan me I have heard\n,\n argue\n in fact there really never has been. Pre Part P we just didn’t monitor electrical work undertaken to any great degree\n, lots of this relatively minor and domestically defined work went \nunseen, compared with today, where electrical work is more visible due to Part P regulations.     \n4.3 \nIt\n i\ns my information and experience of our engagement with contractors that the \nnumbers of electricians with full qualifications are rapidly dwindling and set to reduce at alarming rates in the coming years. The JIB\n (Joint Industry Board)\n, state, in their latest Labour Report \n2012 \nof their 18,000 total membership, that only \n31% of the\nir \n‘\nexperienced members\n’\n have full qualifications. JTL \n(The industry’s largest NVQ trainer) \nwith whom we work closely stated to us\n,\n in a recent apprenticeships meeting\n,\n that they expect \n52% of the experienced workforce to retire in the next 8-10 years. We \nalso know that industry apprenticeships are down \n20% on last year\n.\n \nThe \nJIB itself completed only \n7 (\nseven) apprentices last year, staggering\n, but \ncertainly \nnot their fault in my opinion, it’s the qualification \nroute \nwith which they work \nis to blame\n.\n \n4.4 \nI’m sure and hope you’re aware that just over \n90 % of the electrical installation industry is made up of very small businesses, comprising typically of \nvery small teams of\n contractors, large employers account for no more than \n10% of the industry, yet seemi\nngly get much more than \n10% of the say in to how the industry is run.  \n&#xa0;5. The entry routes for employment in the electrical industry are ‘not fit for purpose’.5.1 \nThe purpose of apprenticeships and career routes into the industry are to secure and train the future workforce for the benefit of us all. \nThey are not working as they should and this is relevant for your committee to consider because electrical workforce that operates under Part P is set to dwindle rapidly in coming years. \n5.2 \nFrom a training provider’s perspective,\n a single qualification s\nystem to enter the industry is ‘not fit for purpose’. \nTh\ne\n \nentry to industry \nqualification\n system\n \nneeds\n to\n \nstart at a level that is achievable for the \nperson to which it is \nintended\n,\n more innovative\n in design\n,\n better reflecting the needs of\n modern society\n a\nnd \nthe small employer\n, enabling them to manage an appropriate qualification for the role the new entrant worker or apprentice would fulfill.  \n5.3 \nLarge companies and some of the traditional organization in the industry have a different view from small \ncontractors particularly with regard to apprenticeships\n and the training of their employees\n. \n5.4 \nI can tell you as the \nM\nD\n of an organization that probably trains more candidates for apprenticeships than m\nany\n others you have heard from, that the Small empl\noyers \n(the 90%) do not and cannot support the current \nqualification routes open to their potential staff. \n \n5.5 \nObviously\n large employers are supportive\n they\n \nhave \nlarge\n budgets and \nspare \nmanpower\n plus \nthe small contractor is competition\n,\n what better way to remove competition than to starve them of staff\n.\n5.6 \nThe small employer/contractor tasked with the actual job of training, paying for the training as well as paying and employing and paying \nthe majority of \napprentices\n in the UK\n \nare\n not \nsupportive\n. T\nhey can’t afford the time and cost\n, they do all they can do to keep their heads above water, never mind bear the responsibility of training up the future \nwork\n force\n. \n5.7 \nThe purpose of entry qualifications into the industry are to attract\n \nand\n secure a future workforce. At the moment they don’t\n. T\nhe modern face of the industry has changed since those supposed past halcyon days, big employers have gone in the numbers they once were. The training of the apprentices in any decent numbers now relie\ns on the hard pressed micro businesses that are not geared up, and are neither skilled, nor economically viable enough to support a traditional apprenticeship \nroute to entry\n \nwhich is seen by many in my sector as no longer ‘fit for purpose’, the numbers spe\nak for themselves. \n5.8 \nThe common reason for not supporting \nthe current entry qualification\ns\n  \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n one size fits \nqualification \nas entry to the industry \ndoes not \nreflect the needs of the small employer, \na full 3 year apprenticeship is too onerous a \ncommitment, regretfully the current qualification r\neflects the needs of the few big employers.\n \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current Electrical NVQ is academically challenging to the average person, as a result dropout rates are alarming.    \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is\n not suitable\n \nfor adults. Adult l\nearners can’t afford to live on the low wages an apprentice gets paid \nover a protracted 3 years. H\ne/she are likely to have dependents and commitments that don’t allow them to learn and work at the same time for a prolonged period.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSmall businesses, have di\nfficulty to support them giving cost,\n \nand the \nadministration\n plus \nthey\n are un\nlikely\n to have the \nrelevant\n \nskills\n or time\n to be able\n to convey knowledge to a student. \n&#xa0;6. Competent Persons qualification v Full NVQ qualification.6.1 \nThe training for full NVQ, please note, \nthe training\n, i.e \n the skills and knowledge that a person is taught in a college\n, not the \nworkbased a\nssessment \nand gathering of experience \nwhich follows\n \ntraining\n,\n commonly called ‘an apprenticeship’.\n6.2 The typical \ndelivery of\n training\n in centre by \nand\n FE \nCollege\n is one day a week for 3 years. For easy comparison if you took the same course full time, it would be of 16 weeks duration\n6.3 \nThis covers everything from installation of sockets \nin your home \nto \nthe \nsubstati\non\n down the road\n, domestic, commercial and industrial\n. H\nowever it’s a one size fits all \nand is designed for a 16-19 year old with zero transferable skills from other work experience. \n6.4 \nThe Domestic electrical element within an apprenticeship qualification is of 8 weeks duration; again assuming you did it as full time training. \n6.5 \nBy no coincidence the new \nqualification \n‘Level 3 certificate in Installing, Testing and Ensuring Compliance\n of Electrical Installations in Dwellings’ \nthat enables a person to become a Competent person comprises of 12 weeks full time \ntraining\n, so well over and above that of an \nNVQ\n qualification.\n6.6 \nThe assumption that Domestic Competency training is somehow inf\nerior to a Full \nNVQ\n is incorrect and misinformed. The training for the Domestic element is equal if not superior. Also usually because the demographic for this qualification is a 24+ years adult and they bring other relevant skills with them\n,\n their compete\nncy is likely to be higher\n.\n \n7. Summary.a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are not enough so called ‘fully qualified electricians’ in the UK to meet current and certainly not future \nincreasing \ndemand.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are not enough new entrants either younger persons or adults \njoining the\n industry\n to cover the current and future loss of labour. \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current entry level is set too high and needs intermediate level. \nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Competency schemes are all that keeps the electrical infrastructure repaired, maintained, upgraded, amended, functioning e\ntc. Remove these and there will be significant negative\n impact\n.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe training and qualifications for competency schemes is good and \nimproving\n and certainly up to the grade required for the job role. \nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Electrical design of our Domestic System is inherentl\ny safe and has become \nmore \nso as a result of Part P Regs. Though better monitoring and public awareness is necessary.\ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince inception of \nPart P regulations \nwe have been able to monitor the majority of\n electrical work, previously it was chaotic and invisibl\ne.\nh)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no evidence of Cowboys being an unequal part of Competent persons schemes compared to the traditional electrician. Cowboys are surely just dishonest people no matter what their status in the industry.\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is lots of evidence and expert opinion that the current \nroutes \ninto\n the industry are\n not ‘fit for purpose’. Is failing our new entrants, failing our small employers, failing our requirements of a secure \nwork\n force for the future. \nj)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany decision maker\ns in the industry I know agree with our opinions and suggestions, but fear expressing them in fear of alienating their traditional workforce.\n&#xa0;8. Our suggestion of a Domestic Electrician Grade to ensure constant supply of workforce and progression entry into industry.&#xa0;8.1 \nThe one size fits all \nroute into the industry\n is flawed, too expensive and too \nchallenging for the person for which it is intended \n. We suggest there should be properly understood and accepted multi grades of electricians. Each capable \nof progressing to the higher level above.\n \nW\ne suggest an additional grade of electrician \nto sit \nbetween the Competent person and the Full NVQ Qualified electrician as below. \n8.2 \nThis would have the advantage of people entering the industry with a \nqualification based on what job they would actually be doing\n and \nthen provides a \nmanageable\n \nand\n cost effective stepping stone to progression for the Full qualification\n and by design naturally upgrades safety &amp; best \npractice\n. \n8.3 \nWe suggest three grades of\n persons allowed to undertake electrical work. \nEach grade capable of progression.\n   \nGrades\n in \nascending \norder\n,\n   \nC. \nCompetent Domestic Electrical Installer.\n For allied \ntrades,\n Heating engineer etc. \n (As exists but with proper industry recognition\n and mandatory registration\n)\n B. \nThe Domestic Electrician. Domestic only work. (A shorter more defined competence qualification to better reflect the role, based on achievement not length)\nA. \nThe Approved \nElectrician (\nComprising of Domestic, Commercial and\n Industrial) \n          \n  \n8.4 \nToo many people are working in electrics with no training, no qualifications, little or no knowledge. \nWe need to u\nse the carrot rather than the stick\n. The\n structure above would encourage people to do the right, who might otherwise not take qualifications or proper training\n as they see it as too onerous and expensive\n.\n      \n Give them an entry level that fits their job role\n, pocket and people’s modern busy li\nves. A\n gradual progressive career path to higher levels solving our apprenticeship supply issue and is consistent with the goals of the Whitehead report.     \n8.6 \nWe \nalso \nsuggest there should be a mandatory registering system for anyone that works with ele\nctrics\n, therefore there being an advantage in doing the right thing. \n8.7 \nFinally please \nd\no not to fix what isn’t broke due to mischievous self interest lobbying disguised as a safety initiative. We are using electrical systems increasingly in our lives, f\nrom reliance on computer systems to car charging to smart homes to green energy\n.\n \nN\no cooker or boiler\n,\n heating system \nor computer network \nwill work without it. Electricity is becoming a greater part of our lives not less. If you restrict the numbers of peop\nle who are able to service our systems or\n \nplace too many hurdles in their way, they will simply ignore them \nand ignore what legislation you put in place \nand it will cause us all difficulty and affect the efficiency and economy \nfor\n us all.\n \nThis much more \nimportant than a tweak of Part P,\nWe certainly intend to \ncontinue to \nplay our part in \ndesigning new qualifications and \nencouraging people to do the right thing.\nSubmitted for your consideration. \n&#xa0;\nwww.tradeskills4u.co.uk\n \n&#xa0;\n3 December 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
