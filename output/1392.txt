[[[Written evidence submitted by The University of Manchester (WSC014)]]]1.               The University of Manchester has nearly 40,000 students and more than 10,000 staff. The University is committed to creating an environment where diversity is celebrated and everyone is treated fairly regardless of gender, disability, ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation, marital status, age or nationality.  2.               We are taking positive steps to achieve equality in the workplace and are committed to both meeting and exceeding our obligations under current legislation. As an academic institution we believe that women are vital to the world of academia, and therefore find it relevant to respond to this inquiry.

[[[ ]]]

[[[Why do you think the number of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? ]]]3.1              

[[[ ]]]

[[[Work-life Balance:]]] Whether we like it or not, women often carry the majority of childcare responsibility within the family and sometimes it can be difficult to maintain an academic career whilst raising a family or having other significant caring duties/obligations. Having children etc, does inhibit opportunity to go abroad to conferences, etc, (activity which helps CV and promotion prospects), particularly if the academic female does not have other support around (at home). Further, hours are often long and there is a lack of flexible/part time working opportunities giving the perception that there is not a healthy work life balance amongst academic staff. Where flexibility or part-time working does exist there is a perception that career progression is more difficult, as quantity is valued and quality alone is not enough. For those women who decide not to raise a family there are still issues which include structural issues, bias etc.3.2              

[[[ ]]]

[[[Recognition:]]] Women can be engaged in a disproportionate number of service activities that benefit the School, for example being an admissions/year tutor, and as a result may not have the capacity to work on activities that would better serve promotion prospects. The achievements of women can be left unrecognised because in general, women are often less good at marketing themselves than men. A recent study of research abstracts by Ohio State University demonstrates that both female and male students believe that papers written by women are of lower quality than papers written by men. Women therefore need to ‘outperform’ men to gain appropriate recognition.3.3

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Lack of Confidence:]]] Women generally take longer or are more cautious about applying for promotion as they want to make sure they meet every criterion fully before submitting an application.  3.4

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lack of Opportunities:]]] Recruitment processes can be problematic; especially the higher up the ladder one goes. For example, ‘search committees’ are often dominated by men who only access their own networks (which usually are made up of other men) so potential female candidates do not get identified or approached early on in the recruitment process. A bigger issue is that many senior academic roles do not even have search committees.3.5

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Career Breaks:]]] Any career breaks that do take place seem to affect career paths, and the working environment is not always sensitive or accommodating to individual circumstances. 3.6

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Lack of Role Models:]]] The number of female guest speakers and images of women on display is minimal or non-existent which means there is a lack of visible role models.  Women are often not encouraged by peers to network and be at the fore-front of the School. Further, there is a distinct lack of successful female role models with families which can create a perception that it is not possible for academics to combine a successful career with a family.3.7

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Unconscious Bias]]]: As a result of unconscious bias often similar people to that of the recruiter(s) are employed which leads to a culture where there is not a diverse range of people, often with white males dominating.  Many institutions are starting to deliver training on this but there can be a lack of take-up of this training by those who need it most. Unconscious bias also extends to matters including lack of invitations to speak at seminars or international conferences – such invitations are important to promotion. This is a common problem.3.8

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Leadership Style:]]] Women often perceive that aggressive political skills are required at the top of the career ladder or in positions of authority, as they may not want to adopt this style of leadership. Not always, but often the male dominated leadership style can be aggressive and riddled with unconscious bias.3.9

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lack of Mentoring Opportunities:]]]

[[[ ]]]Mentoring to early career researchers is often performed by senior academics on an informal basis. Senior academics are usually male, and either consciously or unconsciously they tend to choose people similar to themselves (i.e. males) to mentor.3.10

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lack of Career Structure:]]] Career progression, for example by publication, funding and collaborations are difficult if you have a career break (e.g. maternity leave) and it is important that institutions help women returning from maternity leave to get their research career back on track. Moreover, the structural problem whereby postdoctoral researchers are required to complete a series of fixed term positions before starting a permanent academic career track can dissuade women. Contracts that are offered to women are usually short term which means female academics have to move around Universities more often, which is not ideal, especially for those who wish to stay in one place so that they can raise children, or have commitments as family carers. Further, there is a perception that there is not a healthy work life balance amongst academic staff and that women are drawn to industry where the pay is much better.3.11

[[[              ]]]

[[[Examples of supporting STEM academic women at The University of Manchester:]]]3.12               The University of Manchester is committed to Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science and its principles. The University has held a Bronze Award since 2008 and so far, four awards are held by Schools. The other eleven STEMM Schools are currently working towards awards, with the support of the dedicated University’s Athena SWAN Coordinator and a commitment to making a long term cultural change which will benefit all staff.3.13               Publicity materials depict both men and women and, during Open Days for potential students, female staff speak at events, conduct interviews and show round candidates. 3.14               Faculty-wide Academic Promotions Masterclass workshops are delivered every year, and are advertised with a positive action statement to encourage women to attend, to support staff in submitting promotion cases. Furthermore Schools offer CV clinics for individually tailored support. 3.15               Unconscious bias training has been delivered for the benefit of those on recruitment/promotion panels, to raise awareness of this issue and for them to consider their own biases during recruitment/promotion processes. This is being developed to be included in mandatory recruitment and selection training for all recruiters.3.16               The University of Manchester has strong network groups for staff and students, including a Peer Support Group for Women Returning from Maternity Leave, International Staff Network Group and Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (WiSET). The groups organise events throughout the year and the University allows members up to eight hours per year to be dedicated to network group activities from their standard working hours. 3.17               The University of Manchester has a number of family-friendly policies including flexible working, career break and special leave. Family-friendly support includes childcare initiatives to help reduce costs with a salary exchange scheme for paying for childcare, childcare vouchers and two on site nurseries. 3.18              Our Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences has established a Fellowship Academy that provides concentrated support for those people wanting to secure fellowships.

[[[When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? ]]]4.1 Women often work in industry, the NHS or for a government agency after they leave academia.  Alternatively women tend to develop careers in communications and human resources.  

[[[5.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?]]]5.1              

[[[Loss of highly trained and highly ]]]

[[[skilled people:]]] Losing a high proportion of the bright and skilled population overall, often into jobs that do not take full advantage of their skills and training (there is strong evidence that women have pay that is on average much worse than men with equivalent qualifications)&#xa0;is bad for the UK economy.5.2

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Loss of]]]

[[[ role models in academia]]]

[[[:]]] There is already a distinct lack of successful female role models (including those with families) so female graduates perceive academia as somewhere not to have a successful career and a family. In addition graduates do not get the opportunity to talk to academics to see what it is like to pursue an academic career and with women moving into industry, the prevalence of advice from women would decrease further. It is often assumed that graduates have knowledge about career choices, but this is not always the case, and so career support is needed, including talks from female academics.5.3

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Industry will be]]]

[[[ seen as the natural progr]]]

[[[ession for women (not academia)]]]

[[[: ]]]If students are not able to identify themselves with

[[[ ]]]staff at the University they will choose to work elsewhere following their graduation. 

[[[ ]]]Many go into teaching or non-STEMM related careers.5.4

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Male domination:]]]

[[[ ]]]Statistics show that academia is often crowded by senior male academics. Losing women to different employment sectors will only make this situation worse and further will enhance the stereotype that only men are suitable for academic positions in STEMM.5.5

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lack of diversity ]]]

[[[in higher education:]]] Diversity is a business driver and there is real evidence around diverse teams leading to better organisational performance. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.6

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Decrease in ideas and innovation]]]: A diverse group of people is needed to progress and deliver the best. It has been proven that people from similar backgrounds have similar thinking patterns and therefore fail to produce novel policies and ideas. Diversity is a prime catalyst for new ideas and innovation and therefore the retention of women in academia is greatly needed.

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[To retain women in academia, The University of Manchester offers the following:]]]5.7

[[[              ]]]

[[[Equality and Diversity Training:  ]]]All members of staff are required to complete an online equality and diversity training module.  This is included as part of the induction for new members of staff. 5.8

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Unconscious Bias Training: ]]]Unconscious bias training has been delivered to those on recruitment/promotion panels, to raise awareness of this issue and for them to consider their own biases during recruitment/promotion processes. This is currently being developed to be included in the mandatory recruitment and selection training for all recruiters.5.9

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Research Time:  ]]]Academics returning from maternity leave are offered a 6 month period, in which they are relieved of teaching duties so that they can focus on their research work. 5.10

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Generous Maternity Leave]]]

[[[/Support]]]

[[[: ]]]The University offers a substantial maternity leave package which includes 6 months full pay, plus 3 months statutory pay. Whilst on maternity leave the University offers 5 ‘keeping in touch’ days, which are paid and not taken out of the maternity leave period.  The University also has a staff network group specifically for those returning to work after having a child for additional support. &#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and ]]]

[[[PhD]]]

[[[ students in academic careers?]]]6.1

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Career Support:]]] Clear career advice should be available which is sensitive to diversity and gender and a clear career structure should be provided detailing what career paths they can take so that they can make an informed decision about their career choice. Improved information and communication on internal jobs, and accessibility to positions is critical, to increase the chances of the graduate/PhD Student remaining at the institution.6.2

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[PI Support:]]] Principal Investigators should be better supported to understand and deliver mentoring &amp; career advice as this is often the person the graduates look to for support. It is important that PIs are involved with the Researcher Development Team so they are able to offer the graduates all the opportunities open to them. 6.3

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[N]]]

[[[etworking:]]] Improve opportunities for networking so graduates/students have the chance to meet early career researchers/lecturers and hear their stories about how they made the transition from student to staff. Cross-faculty and multi-disciplinary events open more doors across the University where they would be able to work based on their expertise in particular fields.  6.4

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Role Models:]]] Showcase and celebrate successful female academics.  Ensure that conferences, seminars and events include female speakers wherever possible.6.5

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Communication:]]] Ensure staff and students are aware of the policies in place to help support women so concerns from students can be answered quickly or found out easily. Running events where women graduates can see/hear that it is possible to be a mother and an academic and highlighting the support available following maternity leave is important. 6.6

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Work-life balance:]]] We need to look at the environment within higher education where the long hours culture still dominates.  If we want to encourage and retain women then we need to do more to support those who want to work part-time, flexibly or take a career break and for there to be opportunities for them to progress their career. We also need to stop the long-hours culture to show it is possible to work successfully whilst retaining a work-life balance.6.7

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[The University of Manchester supports females who wish to pursue an academic career in the following ways:   ]]]The University has forums and networks for graduates and students to share their experiences with each other and staff. There are also formal mentoring schemes where students are linked with an experienced member of staff and schemes where students can assist their peers. Other examples of good practice we have to ensure that women progress into academic careers are listed below in 7. 

[[[7. ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Have you any example of good practice? ]]]

[[[Forums for graduates and students to share experiences ]]]For example at The University of Manchester we have:7.1

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Women in Science, Engineering ]]]

[[[and Technology (WiSET):]]]&#xa0;A network for all female students, research and academic staff in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences.7.2

[[[              ]]]

[[[Women in Life Sciences:]]] A&#xa0;developing network for all female academic and research staff, administrative staff and students within Life Sciences at The University of Manchester.7.3

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Women in I.T.:]]] A networking forum for women at all grades working in IT across the University.7.4

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Networking ]]]

[[[: ]]]For example at The University of Manchester we have:7.5

[[[              ]]]

[[[School PhD and ]]]

[[[PDRA Forums:]]] Students &amp; Research Staff from different research groups in the School can meet regularly (usually once a quarter) to see what others are doing and share experiences. 7.6

[[[              ]]]

[[[EPS Ambassadors: ]]]PDRAs engage cross-faculty

[[[ ]]]which opens up opportunities for research in different Schools7.7

[[[              ]]]

[[[Research Staff Association:]]] Open to researchers across the University (4 Faculties) to share experiences about life as a researcher and to discuss topics of interest (for example: fixed term contracts, open access publishing and extended access). Manchester RSA actively engages with Vitae’s UK Research Staff Association (UKRSA). The first RSA Manchester Mini Sandpit was organised in 2012 which was a compressed version of the interactive, multidisciplinary workshops used by funding bodies to drive lateral thinking and radical approaches to research challenges.All research forums work with the 

[[[Researcher Development Team]]] at The University of Manchester and there are a number of funds available, such as the “School Research Conferences Fund”, the “Researcher Led Initiatives Fund” and the “External Training Fund” to support local initiatives. A recent event (March 2013) funded by the Researcher Led Initiative, “Life after post doc: What can happen next?”,

[[[ ]]]was organised by the

[[[ ]]]School of Physics and Astronomy Researcher Development Forum where researchers and fellows from the School heard stories from four speakers from academia, industry and the public sector to help researchers understand the different options open to them after their current positions finish.  7.8

[[[              ]]]

[[[Mentoring schemes]]]For example at The University of Manchester we have: 7.9

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Manchester Gold Mentoring Scheme: ]]]Students are matched on a one to one basis with an experienced member of staff (a mentor) and will be in contact with them over a nine month period. The programme aims to help students with career planning and decision making about their future options.7.10

[[[ ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS): ]]]A Student Learning Scheme

[[[ ]]]that is ran by students and provides a facilitated, group learning opportunity that uses the experiences of higher year students to support the learning of lower year peers

[[[.]]]7.11               The University of Manchester also provides a 

[[[‘Buddy System’]]] which links PhD students to a PDRA.  In some Schools PhD students and PDRAs in the same research group share an office to help facilitate this and allow for everyday interaction between staff and students.7.12

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Career service]]] The University of Manchester provides a career service to all students during their studies and for two years after they graduate. In 2011 the careers service won the 'Times Higher Education Award for Outstanding Support for Early Career Researchers' for their dedicated academic career website for PhD and research staff. Recently (February 2013) the Head of Post Graduate Career Development offered advice to students about PhD applications and career prospects in academic field, at the Faculty wide WiSET event, Is an Academic Career for You

[[[What role should the Government have ]]]

[[[in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?]]]8.1               The government must offer support and recognition for women who juggle academic commitments and family commitments. Better maternity leave support from funding bodies should be provided so that all the support does not have to come through the University. Women need see that they can have a career break, return to work and go on to further their career. 8.2               It would also greatly help if there was better support for partners in terms of leave so that a couple can jointly care for their child, without the woman missing out on key progression points in her career. 8.3               Programmes such as Athena SWAN should be more heavily invested in by the Government as they make a considerable impact on the number of departments that work towards gender equality.
