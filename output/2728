[normal]Summary
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]Horizon scanning exercises do not receive the attention warranted them for a variety of reasons by both Government departments as well as by those outside of Government involved with them.  Learned scientific societies have much to contribute to horizon scanning exercises but rarely do such exercises seem to result in policy or investment (funding) change.  This is illustrated with a past case history involving a number of learned scientific societies together with industry. One measure that might help is identified.

[normal]Response
[normal]2. 
[normal]              
[normal]Select Committee's questions addressed in this response
[normal]This response primarily addresses the Committee's question as to 'How effective is horizon scanning in Government? Do Ministers and senior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately?'  Having said that it also to a lesser degree relates to other of the committee's questions especially '
[normal]Horizon scanning in Government departments'.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]The view presented here is from a former member of the learned scientific society sector
[normal]The perceptions in this response arise out of viewing the issue very much through a learned scientific society prism. Having said that, this response is independent of any learned society and should be considered purely as the individual view of someone who has had to coordinate the life science learned society end of governmental horizon scanning exercises as well as learned societies' own horizon scanning, the results of which were meant for government, its departments and/or their agencies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]No longer being employed by the learned society sector affords this response candour otherwise often denied the committee
[normal]The independence of this response should be particularly noted as now, being semi-retired, I am able to respond more freely in a way that I never could, or would, as an employed member of a learned society's secretariat. Learned societies, and indeed others, do not tend to feel that they can speak with such candour.  This contrasts markedly with the political party, adversarial nature of policy-maker debate of which the Select Committee members will all too well aware.  Conversely, learned society respondents' nature tends to be characterised by deference to policy-makers; something that policy-makers, if not encourage, do not discourage.  Consequently this response would not be one that I would have submitted in my decades of learned society employment and I suspect it unlikely that any today would make the same points in such a forthright way, though the Select Committee might detect some of the following points in other responses albeit with a less plain-speaking nuance.  My one concern is that learned societies do not consider this response as presumptive.  I re-iterate that these are my views but they do arise out of decades of working in the learned society sector and making over a hundred consultation responses to Parliamentarians, Government departments and their agencies, together with a good number of horizon scanning exercises from Government Foresight exercises as well as those originated by the learned societies themselves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Barriers to horizon scanning for learned societies
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]Learned societies have limited resources and many are small. Together this means that they are not as valued as arguably they might be
[normal]Learned scientific societies, through their members, have access to a substantial body of considerable specialist expertise.  As such they are a resource that should be appreciated. 
[normal]Having said that, many learned societies have a small secretariat even if they have memberships run into thousands. Many are charitable (in the formal/legal sense) and have few staff. Learned societies (as are others such as industry-related bodies) have a busy secretariat.  These facts often go unrecognised by civil servants and policy-makers who have their own immediate concerns.  Indeed it might be that the lack of appreciation by large Governmental Departments and their agencies is due to the disparity in size and turnover between themselves and such societies.  There are few independent learned and scientific charities who can be considered comparable in size and turnover to Government Departments and/or their agencies.  Here, only the 
[normal]Wellcome
[normal] Trust springs to mind, and indeed if the 
[normal]Wellcome
[normal] Trust speaks then virtually certainly the Department of Health, Medical Research Council, the Science Minister, and even the Treasury will immediately sit up and listen.  This markedly contrasts with what is expected to happen when the majority of other (who are inevitably smaller) learned charitable scientific bodies speak.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]Consequently their horizon scanning contributions can similarly be undervalued
[normal]As such although Britain with its learned societies is very well equipped to undertake science and technology horizon scanning exercises (as the Cabinet Office a review of cross-government horizon scanning concludes), the nation does not make the most of this and indeed, arguably, squanders this resource (which again broadly reflects the Cabinet Office review's conclusions).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]              
[normal]There is a view that Governmental horizon scanning is not as meaningful as it might be
[normal]Part as a result of the above, and in part for separate reasons (cited later) participating in Governmental horizon-scanning exercises, and indeed in responding to other consultations there is a substantive view (among a range of perceptions within learned societies and their members) that such exercises only rarely conclude with meaningful policy change.  Often (not always) there is a feeling (rightly or wrongly) that the exercise is being conducted because:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]              
[normal]This and other priorities lowers the perceived value of horizon scanning. Nonetheless learned scientific societies may feel compelled to participate
[normal]If those within a learned society do have such (afore) perceptions regarding a particular exercise then they will not engage with the exercise as they might. Do not forget, learned societies have other priorities such as scientific publishing and establishing professional standards, and activities from defining specialist nomenclature to professional status conferred through 
[normal]designatory
[normal] letters. Having said that there is always the motivation to respond because it is part of the learned society's remit to represent that area of expertise irrespective whether or not anything meaningful will ultimately result. In addition – taking the null hypothesis – a learned society failing to respond means that their separate subsequent raising of the horizon-scanning issue is undermined as policy-makers can question as to why these matters were not brought to their attention when the policy-makers' focus was on the issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]              
[normal]Differing time frames also impede horizon scanning conclusions' implementation
[normal]Even if the horizon-scanning exercise has the appropriate Departmental and policy-maker (political) support, it is 
[normal]very likely
[normal] that the conclusions pertain to a different (invariably 
[normal]longer) time frame than the shorter-term concerns of a scale relating more of the order of magnitude of the economic cycle and/or Parliamentary term. Given this, any laudable conclusions will therefore be kicked into the long-grass. Here, when I say 'very likely' I really do mean far more often than not.  To extend the 'horizon-scanning' metaphor, this is because of the very nature of horizon-scanning exercises.  These are matters that by definition are sufficiently far into the future that they are over the horizon and so not matters currently on policy-makers' and civil servants' radar.  If the results of the exercise have (or are perceived to have) significant cost implications (and most do which is one reason why they are issues of concern) then short-term investment in a long-term dividend is not palatable to policy-makers who have short-to-medium term issue immediately on their plate, let alone those whose working days seem to be spent largely fire-fighting. (To take just one example, I have simply lost count of the number of Westminster and Whitehall consultation and horizon-scanning exercises that have taken place the past quarter of a century relating to our nation's energy supply. And yet here we are with an energy-infrastructure deficit while struggling to boost energy security, reduce reliance on fossil carbon imports and all the while lower greenhouse gas emissions…)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]              
[normal]Yet there remain reasons as to why learned societies participate in Governmental horizon scanning
[normal]And so it is easy to see that at best the most that is generally expected by many potential participants in a horizon-scanning exercise is that some laudably-worded report will result.  Having said that learned societies (and perhaps others) do feel that they should participate in horizon-scanning exercises for the following reasons:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other barriers to effective learned society participation in horizon scanning
[normal]11.
[normal]              
[normal]Government Departments do request learned societies to horizon scan
[normal]So far I have looked at horizon-scanning exercises that have been led by policy-makers and civil servants in Westminster and Whitehall.  However it needs to be remembered – and the Select Committee's brief for this consultation suggests that it might have been overlooked – that there are two ways Government Departments initiate horizon-scanning exercises.  The first is that they both initiate and conduct them themselves: I suspect that this type of horizon-scanning exercise is the one that is in the mind of this Select Committee.  The second is that a Government Department might request (either formally or informally) that others conduct horizon-scanning exercises so as to identify relevant concerns for the Department.  I cannot say how often whilst in my years of learned society employment I have heard a minister, or a departmental civil servant, informally ask of me (or of the learned societies I have represented in the past) to horizon-scan and so as to give them the heads up on forthcoming issues: it has to be more than several: 
[normal]i.e.
[normal] more than just an occasional isolated request, and tending 
[normal]towards a theme of inherent departmental background concern.  I have, though, noted that such requests are more often than not made during or shortly after an issue that has blown up with political repercussions be it: Brent Spar (sea disposal), salmonella (especially the eggs incident), GM crops, BSE/CJD, cryptosporidium, reproductive cloning (the old name for stem cell research), foot and mouth, 
[normal]etc
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]              
[normal]Yet a meaningful response in the form of policy change or new investment from a Government Department is rare
[normal]However, while a Minister or a Government department might ask learned scientific societies t horizon-scan, when they do, they rarely seem to take any meaningful notice.  My suspicion (purely personal perception and not in 
[normal]anyway
[normal] scientific) is that this is because neither the Minister of Government Department has had any financial/political stake in the learned society's exercise and so it is easy to ignore for all the reasons outlined in paragraph
[normal]s 5, 7 and 9. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]              
[normal]Indeed the nature of horizon-scanning itself lends itself to it being undermined
[normal]Finally, another barrier is a generic one that relates to the nature of horizon-scanning itself. This is that the future is unknown hence unverifiable, and any exercises whose conclusions are unverifiable can easily have its efficaciousness questioned, hence conclusions undermined. Now please do not dismiss this as a statement from the Department of the Obvious. True, it is obvious, but less obvious – or rather it lends itself to a policy-maker blind spot – is that it is all too easy an excuse to, not just ignore the results of a horizon scanning exercise but to, dismiss it (rather than critically analyse it with surgical precision).  One can only see that such failings have taken place with the benefit of hindsight.  Here a classic old example is the scorn heaped upon the 1972 
[normal]Limits to Growth 
[normal]report.  True, by today's standards it was based on little more than a back-of-an-envelope sophisticated computer model, but given the unknowns there was, and is, little merit bringing any more sophisticated a tool to bear on the problem. Yet today, with the benefits of four decades of hindsight, we can see that its conclusions were fairly accurate: for example see Turner, G., 2008.  Indeed, even without a detailed analysis such as Turner's, we can see that so far 
[normal]The Limits to Growth
[normal] standard run projection scenarios for population and food 
[normal]per
[normal] capita have tracked well, as does the pattern of 'resources' if considered as cheap oil (non-polar, terrestrial, shallow well reserve) exploitation.  Regarding the future, that the model predicts a period of global stress in the mid-to-latter half of this century happens to have over a third of a century on been echoed by others including quite recently by the former Government Chief Scientific Advisor (
[normal]Beddington
[normal], J., 2008).  Alas for the
[normal] Limits to Growth
[normal] team, we cannot go back in time and validate their horizon-scanning for them while they were being heavily criticised.  The bottom line is that it is all too easy to dismiss, if not actively rubbish, an horizon-scanning exercise.  Given that issues relating to the future are debatable, and that there are two sides to any debate, it is always very easy to see that any horizon scanning exercise can be easily dismissed and impossible to validate.  As such – and given the previous institutional hurdles – what chance do horizon scanning exercises have? (I'll return to this later.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An horizon scanning case history 
[normal]14.
[normal]              
[normal]Anti-
[normal]infectives
[normal] case history
[normal]I do not know whether you consider any of the above to have merit.  Certainly all of the above observations can be characterised as 'theoretical'. So what I would like to do now is to illustrate these points by providing a real-life case history: summarising the key stages of the horizon scanning exercise, some of its conclusions, the then British reaction and reaction 
[normal]elsewhere, and finally today's perspective on the issue. The topic is anti-
[normal]infectives
[normal] specifically antibiotic resistance.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]Planning the exercise and bringing together stakeholders
[normal]In 1999 the Institute of Biology's Science Policy Board encouraged its constituent committees to horizon scan. (The Institute of Biology being the then Royal Chartered body for British biologists and biology.) The Biomedical Sciences Committee responded identifying the eroding efficacy of anti-
[normal]infectives
[normal] as an issue of concern and it, together with a number of the specialist learned biological societies within the biological Affiliated Societies serviced by the Institute devised a strategy to take the issue forward.  It was decided that the Institute together with the Royal Pharmaceutical of Great Britain would take the lead together with a number of other societies within the Affiliation.  External support from industry was sought to fund policy presentation and while industrial supporters were invited to participate in the exercise they had no involvement in the exercise's planning so as to preserve learned society independence.  A Research Council and a Government Department also lent support granting permission for use of logo and they were kept informed of progress.  Finally a clinician, who also advised the said Government department on the issue, was invited onto the venture's steering committee.  In short, this venture's scientific validity was robust and it also had looser involvement of a number of the stakeholders involved with applying the relevant science. In addition Parliamentarians were notified and a Lords Select inquiry into antibiotic resistance was (coincidentally) slated.  The planning and fundraising through to execution took the best part of three years.  This was not a trivial venture. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]A symposium reviewed the science and elucidated scientific opinion
[normal]In July 2002 a two-day symposium was held on the topic that covered the relevant science from research through to clinical and agricultural application.  The purpose of the symposium was twofold.  First, to review the current state of the science and the growth in antibiotic resistance within both the human clinical and veterinarian settings. Second, it was to facilitate discussion to enable conclusions be drawn.  
[normal]Note
[normal] only was a firm point made for questions and answers after each paper, and each day ended with a question and answer sessions, in addition mid-symposium the speakers took part in a discussion dinner during which the comments made would be considered 
[normal]unattributable
[normal] (to ensure freedom of speech) but their content noted (for the record to facilitate horizon scanning conclusions).

[normal]Raising the issue with policy-makers
[normal]Having looked at the science and elucidated expert opinion, a six-page policy alert broadsheet, 
[normal]Anti-
[normal]infectives
[normal]: The Way Forward
[normal], was produced by the Institute of Biology &amp; Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (2002). This was launched at an evening reception in the Palace of Westminster.  In addition to the horizon-scanning literature from the biological Affiliated Societies, due to liaison with the World Health Organization who by sheer coincidence (honestly) were involved in a similar exercise in Congress in the United States, there was also US literature on the topic present.  Furthermore, as part of a mutual exchange, the Congress exercise also carried the 
[normal]Anti-
[normal]infectives
[normal]: The Way Forward
[normal] policy alert.  The policy alert made seven 'action required' points. Importantly only one of these called for more government investment in anti-infective research as the learned societies involved were all too aware as to how policy-makers tire of hearing the 'more funding required' refrain. And so all the other points were cost-neutral as far as drawing on tax-payers' money was concerned. Sadly nobody from the relevant Government Department attended. Finally, a week or so later a discussion dinner was held in the Palace of Westminster for the stakeholders, Parliamentarians with an interest in biomedical science concerns and 
[normal]Government departmental representatives.  Sadly none from this last group of invitees accepted.  Finally, and this last happened to be purely an accident of timing but was of minor concern, these latter delivery stages were too late to include into the then Lords Select inquiry on antibiotic resistance.  Where the disappointment lay was with the lack of interest shown by the principal relevant Government Department in the exercise's conclusions even though at the horizon scanning exercise's start it lent support 
[normal]via
[normal] use of its logo. One can lead a horse to water…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]              
[normal]There was reaction in the US to the issue
[normal]Meanwhile, as mentioned, similar antibiotic resistance concerns were being raised in the US by a number represented at the Congress event that had the British biological Affiliated Societies' literature. The debate then continued in the US (
[normal]Leeb
[normal], M.,2004) and so it was not surprising, for example, that the Infectious Diseases Society of America subsequent (2004) initiative on anti-
[normal]inffectives
[normal] included a number of the measures proposed in the 
[normal]Anti-
[normal]infectives
[normal]: The Way Forward
[normal] policy alert.  Britain had not taken the horizon scanning initiative seriously but the US continued to show concern.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]              
[normal]Subsequent development of the issue in Britain
[normal]Over the next few years pharmaceutical research into anti-
[normal]infectives
[normal] in Britain declined with some multinational pharmaceutical even ceasing antibiotic research in Britain altogether. Jump forward to 2013 and suddenly there is concern coming out of the Department of Health! In March 2013 the Government's chief medical officer for England declared that antibiotic resistance is 'as big a risk as terrorism' and that the matter be discussed at the G8 level meeting of world leaders that was then due to take place in London.  This story made the national news. (For example BBC News, 2013.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A way forward
[normal]20.
[normal]              
[normal]The government might identify value-stakeholders and have a protocol to examine their horizon scanning concerns
[normal]It would be very easy to conclude all of this with some bland statement that Government needs to take horizon scanning concerns more seriously.  A number of measures are possible, and no doubt the Select Committee will identify a way forward.  Meanwhile I provide one idea. Naturally if Government Departments listened to everyone with great attention then little else would get done.  Fortunately with regards to science and technology concerns there are a number of filters that a Government might deploy so as to focus on those that might make more meaningful horizon-scanning contributions.  Other than some educational establishments, there are just a couple of score or so Royal Chartered professional scientific and technological (including engineering and medicine) bodies.  As it stands an organisation having a Royal Charter seems to be little more than a nice frill – there is little substantive value.  Yet these bodies have in effect been vetted by Government and deemed worthy of Royal Chartered status.  Back in the 1990s the then GSA, Professor Robert May, produced a concise set of guidelines as to how Government Departments should handle scientific advice to Government. Now, while I am aware that some subsequent Governments have further developed these guidelines (sadly greatly expanding their volume). I do not know whether currently each new Government and its Departments sign up to these guidelines (or whether they could be condensed) but if so one thing the guidelines might include is the need for each department to have a protocol to consider 
[normal]and
[normal] respond to learned societies horizon scanning views irrespective of whether the horizon scanning exercise was initiated by the Department or the Royal Chartered scientific body.
