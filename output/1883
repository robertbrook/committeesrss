[normal]Written submission from The Prince’s Trust (LPG 53)[bold]Overview: [bold]The Prince’s Trust helps disadvantaged young people to get their lives on track. It supports 13 to 30 year-olds who are unemployed and those struggling at school and at risk of exclusion. Many of the young people helped by The Trust are in or leaving care, facing issues such as homelessness or mental health problems, or they have been in trouble with the law. 
[normal]The Trust’s programmes give vulnerable young people the practical and financial support needed to stabilise their lives, helping develop self-esteem and skills for work. The Trust supported 55,801 young people between April 2012 and March 2013. 
[normal]The Prince’s Trust Public Sector Team raises funds from
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]government, local authority, lottery and other statutory sources. In England the Public Sector team is made up of 30 people who work in three areas:

[normal]Each Region
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]This work is supported by a Bid Writing and Resources Team. 
[normal]In 2012/13 the Public Sectors Team’s raised £18 million and secured significant funds through Local Government Procurement. 
[normal]Executive Summary[bold]The main points of The Prince’s Trust
[normal]s
[normal] evidence are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Initiatives such as Passport PQQ’s and multiple Local Authority frameworks would increase efficiencies for Local Authorities and suppliers, whilst also encouraging the involvement of smaller organisations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local Authority staff are considered accessible and long term relationships have been developed that have withstood change.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]‘Meet the buyer’ events and opportunities to meet Commissioners and other suppliers are welcomed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further information under the topics suggested by the Committee is detailed below:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal] 
[normal]Do Local Authorities harness the power of the voluntary sector to involve local residents, philanthropy, corporate or charitable funding in their procurement?  Some solutions to their perceived problems are too narrowly specified to enable creative or good value solutions.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.2
[normal] 
[normal]Largely Commissioners are accessible and invite a wide enough cross section of partners to the table when exploring solutions to problems. In defence of Local Authorities, it must be incredibly hard to get a co-ordinated and cohesive voice from the wider sector – this is where local C
[normal]ommunity and Voluntary Service
[normal]’s can be helpful on occasions by acting as a conduit
[normal].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.3
[normal] 
[normal]The requirement to fund new ‘innovative’ solutions is often difficult for organisations (particularly third sector ones who may not have a lot of resource and flexibility) to respond to, particularly when they have proven track records of programmes that work and consistently deliver result to an identified local need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is this the best way of assessing delivery?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.4
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]Passport PQQ 
[normal]would save organisations having 
[normal]to do individual PQQs for each Local A
[normal]uthority. The idea is reflected here: 
[normal]http://www.europarl.europ
[normal]a
[normal].eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20110926IPR27495/html/Public-procurement-passport-could-make-it-easier-for-small-firms-to-bid
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.5
[normal] 
[normal]Could evidence of quality marks substitute questions or allow organisations to move onto the next section? For example a Pre tender Questionnaire published by Rotherham Borough Council allowed organisations to skip questions under sections such as The Environment if they could supply a certificate for an Environmental Management System 
[normal](such as ISO
[normal]1400).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]In general Local Authorities have developed long term relationships with The Prince’s Trust, even when significant changes have taken place. It is incumbent upon both parties to ensure that relationships can withstand organisational change.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2
[normal] 
[normal]In the current climate, where there are still significant changes taking place within Local Authorities, key personnel can, and have, often changed, resulting in new relationships having to be formed and historic events re-visited to ensure clarity. Do Local Authorities use any form of partnership Customer Relationship Management that they update on a regular basis?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Multi Local Authority Frameworks would increase efficiencies for Local Authorities and suppliers for example Manchester City Council Troubled Families Supplier Framework can be used by 22 North West Local Authorities. 
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.2
[normal] 
[normal]This is beginning to happen in some areas, for example in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and the North East Local Authorities worked together to bid for 2013-15 ESF NEET funding. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?[bold]4.1
[normal] 
[normal]‘Meet the buyer’ events would help Local Authorities to develop their strategy, understand local businesses and organisations and develop c
[normal]ost effective partnerships. T
[normal]o make ‘Meet the Funder’ events more useful
[normal], in addition to
[normal] going through bid documents, there could be a networking session 
[normal]for suppliers 
[normal]before or after.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2
[normal] 
[normal]As well as ‘Meet the buyer events’, commissioners could support providers to identify and form partnerships with other providers, particularly as for many services there is often just one contract available. Commissioners often favour partnership bids but, given the timescales, providers often have problems developing effective partnerships and submitting partnership bids. A previous example of how this 
[normal]could be improved is
[normal] Lambeth Borough Council C
[normal]hildren and 
[normal]Y
[normal]oung 
[normal]P
[normal]eople 
[normal]S
[normal]ervice Commissioning team
[normal] introduced a number of current providers via email and offered to host 
[normal]introductory 
[normal]meetings. This was to support smaller groups who were 
[normal]to 
[normal]introduce them
[normal]selves to larger organisations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.3
[normal] 
[normal]The voluntary and community sector could support C
[normal]ommissioners with access to their projects and programmes or link them into elected members who visit community projects
[normal]. This would support Local Authorities
[normal] in bringing policy and procurement ‘to life’.
