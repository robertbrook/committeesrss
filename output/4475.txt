[[[Unsafe abortion]]] that each year causes around 5 million women to suffer temporary or permanent disability, with rates highest amongst poor and rural women. One in four women who undergo an unsafe abortion is likely to develop temporary or lifelong disability requiring medical care. Women who are disabled as a result of an unsafe abortion can face particularly high levels of stigma or can lack access to appropriate levels of care and support. Disability resulting from unsafe abortion is preventable, and can and should be prevented through the promotion of sex education, family planning, safe abortion services to the fullest extent of the law and post-abortion care in all cases.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[bstetric fistula]]], a hole in the birth canal, has severe physical and social consequences and a devastating impact on women, particularly young women and girls who are at most at risk. The WHO estimates that more than two million young women live with untreated obstetric fistula in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases each year. Obstetric fistula is preventable and can largely be avoided by delaying the first pregnancy, preventing female genital mutilation/cutting and ensuring timely access to obstetric care. &#xa0;Persons with disabilities have the same SRH needs as other people. Yet they often face barriers to information and services. The ignorance and attitudes of society and individuals, including health-care providers, raise most of these barriers - not the disabilities themselves. In fact, existing services usually can be adapted easily to accommodate persons with disabilities. Increasing awareness is the first and biggest step. Beyond that, much can be accomplished through resourcefulness and involving persons with disabilities in programme design and monitoring.                                           WHO/UNFPA Guidance Note, 2009&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs352/en/ Promoting sexual and reproductive health for persons with disabilities, WHO/UNFPA Guidance Note, 2009 http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598682_eng.pdf http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs352/en/ http://www.unfpa.org/upload/lib_pub_file/741_filename_UNFPA_DisFact_web_sp-1.pdf http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70914/1/9789241548434_eng.pdf http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/obstetric_fistula/en/
