defaultWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Mercia [CST0074]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultI refer to your letter of 6 December 2013 and I apologise for the delay in my response. My answers to your questions are as follows: -

defaultWhat, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2013/14 I did set out a number of measures against which delivery of objectives could be judged. In a few cases I set targets. I only did this with the support and indeed encouragement of my Chief Constable. I am, however, considering reducing specific performance measures included in the Plan but adopting appropriate measures to be assessed against detailed delivery plans. This will enable them to be more readily adjusted and revised outside of the formal plan variation process.

defaultHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?
default&#xa0;
defaultReassurance of figures is provided in three principle ways. Both I and my deputy attend regular Force Performance Group meetings where performance is discussed in detail. In addition I am aware of the robust systems the Chief Constable has put in place to ensure the integrity of the figures. To assist you I enclose a recent report from Superintendent Sue Thomas in this regard. Thirdly I am reassured by the external oversight provided by HMIC. We are currently undergoing inspection and I shall be following up any recommendations or
defaultfindings with my Chief Constable when the Inspection report is available.
default&#xa0;
defaultOnce again I apologise for my slight delay in responding to your letter but I hope my comments will be of some use.
