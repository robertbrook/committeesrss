[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (ADEPT) Rights of Way Managers’ Group brings together all senior local government rights of way managers from across England and Wales. We had representation on Natural England’s Stakeholder Working Group on Public Rights of Way that produced recommendations now forming part of the draft Deregulation Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On behalf of ADEPT I write in full support and endorsement of the case for legislative reform of the processes for recording public rights of way on the Definitive Map in England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The package of proposals put forward by Stakeholder Working Group offers a sensible approach to removing unnecessary bureaucracy and cost from the current system in a manner which is acceptable to all stakeholders.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This has come about following significant effort and discussion to produce a negotiated and balanced package of proposals that the various stakeholders have felt able to support. It has been our aim to achieve a fair and workable amendment to the present processes. We, therefore, feel that the proposals now embodied in the draft bill will help provide: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Landowners[bold] with significantly more certainty about bringing to an end claims for historic, possibly long forgotten, public rights and enabling a degree of negotiation that presently 
[normal]cannot
[normal] exist.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local Authorities[bold] and the Planning Inspectorate[bold] with the ability to negotiate with owners and ensure that, where there remains contention, the process and regulatory burdens to resolve matters is greatly reduced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Public Users[bold] with a faster system both in terms of addressing current backlogs and the length of the process itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The elements of proposed rights of way reform contained within the draft bill are only those necessitating primary legislation but, without it, other facets of the proposed reforms cannot work, so their inclusion is necessary and will, in our opinion, reduce regulatory burden. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst welcoming any further discussions with other parties with the aim of making minor improvements to the proposals, we would not wish to see such hard-won progress towards legislative reform undone by changes that alter the balance of the proposals so that they no longer command across the board support.
