"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Star \nTraq\n UK Ltd (SLC 002)\nExecutive Summary:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are more than 6,500 level crossings in Britain. Every day they save thousands \nof lives by protecting us from one of the busiest rail networks in the world.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNetwork Rail invests in a wide-ranging \nprogramme\n, working with national and local \norganisations\n, to ensure that level crossings are safe and helping people use them correctly.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere have been a number of high profile and tragic incidents at level crossings over the years, suggesting more needs to be done to educate drivers about the risks at level crossings. Combining education with 'enforcement' will ensure compliance is maintained.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq\n traffic enforcement systems are designed to help the Police discourage individuals from breaking the rules.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome traffic offences are criminal and so enforced by the Police, others are civil offences and enforced by local authorities.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnforcement activity is also carried out by private contractors, for example controlling parking on private land.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq's\n history and core expertise stems from working with the Police and enforcement agencies to process traffic offences. Our systems are both secure and flexible.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq's\n modular system can provide Network Rail and BTP with an integrated solution, which can provide adjudication, document management and automated workflow allowing offenders to be processed according to the severity of the offence, offering educational alternatives to 'Fixed Penalty'.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction:1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq\n seeks to drive safety enhancements for all road users through \neducation and enforcement. StarTraq\n software solutions are designed for processing different \ntypes of offences and for delivering \ntargeted online education. 21 of the UK's Police \nForces use \nStarTraq\n systems to process their traffic offences, improving their efficiency \nwhile maintaining high road safety standards.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are many reasons why people commit offences on the road: understanding \nthese reasons is \nkey\n to changing driver \nbehaviour\n. For some, the certainty of \npunishment through effective enforcement of the law is the best deterrent to offending \nor re-offending. Others respond positively to education that raises knowledge and \nawareness of the potential dangers and impact of their actions.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq\n solutions support both \nenforcers who need to identify offenders and process \npenalties quickly and efficiently, and \neducators who require the ability to \nidentify,\n \nprofile and divert individuals to \nprogrammes\n that are relevant to their particular offence \nand psychological profile.\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq\n solutions cover:\nEnforcement: \nStarTraq's\n back office solution automates the processing of \noffences, improving productivity and compliance. It can be used for both police \nand civil enforcement;\nEducation: \nStarTraq\n software can be used to identify and divert appropriate \ncandidates onto driver education \nprogrammes\n.\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq\n has a strong 12 year track record in the international enforcement \narena. \nStarTraq\n pioneered a public/private partnership in the South African offence \nmanagement industry in 1999, and entered the UK market in 2001. A \nStarTraq\n \nmodular system is now used by over 50% of the Police Forces England, Wales and \nNorthern Ireland to automate traffic offence management.\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq's\n contribution to the UK transport industry was \nrecognised\n with a 'Highly \nCommended' in the Technology Category of the 2008 National Transport Awards and \nis shortlisted for the Transport Operator of the Year Award in the 2013 National \nTransport Awards to be held in October 2013\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq\n processes over 1 \nmillion traffic offences and handled over \n2 million documents annually.\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStarTraq\n solutions deliver a virtually paper free environment for our customers and the \ncompany was awarded ISO 14001 environmental accreditation.\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n Having all offences handled via one single platform provides the additional benefit of efficient and accurate reporting.\n&#xa0;Evidence for consideration:10.\n \nA \nStarTraq\n system has the ability to automatically read a vehicle registration mark and offence details using optical character recognition (OCR) and automatic number plate \nrecognition (ANPR) on both analogue and digital offences. Alternatively, if ANPR data \nis provided by the camera technology then this can be uploaded to a \nStarTraq\n system \nand displayed alongside the offence image.\n11.\n \nThe System can be deployed securely on the Cloud, so it is ideal for remote locations \nsuch as level crossings.\n12.\n \nWith a direct connection to the Police National Computer (PNC) a \nStarTraq\n system \ncan check the vehicle and keeper identity reporting back to the verifier the keeper's \naddress details and the current status of the vehicle (for example, if it has been \nreported stolen).\n13.\n \nThe \nStarTraq\n system can display multiple images and video clips to the verifier. Image \nenhancement tools allow the verifier to accurately record offences. Rejection codes \nfor exempt vehicles (such as police, ambulance and fire engines) can be used so that \nan outcome for every offence is achieved.\n14.\n \nThe output from \nStarTraq\n system is a comprehensive file of driver names, addresses \nand date of birth along with offence details ready for processing. This output file can \nalso be \ncustomised\n ready to export to a 3rd party system, such as education course \nprovider.\n15.\n \nTools for adding officer issued tickets to the database are also available.\n16.\n \nA \nStarTraq\n system will help Network Rail to:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProcess offences without the need for adding to headcount thereby keeping costs down and guaranteeing a return on investment.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCentralise\n processing of offences maintaining the flexibility to allow for multi-\nsite operations.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOperate a system that is flexible, user friendly and dynamic.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCustomise\n the workflow to map a process bespoke to Network Rail/BTP \nautomating much of the offence lifecycle.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGive confidence that a \nStarTraq\n system is camera vendor independent \nsoftware supporting interfaces from all camera types.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide a seamless diversion of offenders to court or driver education —\ndetermined by Network Rail.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide court files at the click of a button.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFuture proof\n a system protecting against any legislation and camera hardware \nchanges.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReduce on-going IT support costs.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSend correspondence in multiple languages to offenders and/or refer offenders \nto a website for trusted translation.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nView offence images online and any other details that Network Rail/BTP deem \nappropriate.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFully integrate with handheld devices or scan paper tickets supporting process \nofficer manually generated issued tickets.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOffer e-learning as part of an overall driver education strategy. \nRecommendation:17.\n \nStarTraq's\n recommended solution to support level crossing safety improvements is for \nNetwork Rail and its enforcement partner (BTP) to \nadopt an enforcement protocol that \nis fair, transparent, trusted and reliable. A \nStarTraq\n system will provide a sophisticated workflow and document management capability Network Rail to process level crossing \noffences from different camera types through to a successful outcome e.g. fine, \neducation or court.\n18.\n \nStarTraq\n recommends that Government looks to introduce an enforcement solution for \nlevel crossing safety, drawing on the results and benefits that have been gained by \nother enforcement agencies. By taking a targeted approach to casualty reduction \nwhere education and enforcement work together, compliance at level crossings will be \nachieved.\n19.\n \nLastly \nStarTraq\n recommends that the Office of Rail Regulator (ORR) works with the \nParliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety and Royal Society for Prevention \nof Accidents (\nRoSPA\n) to devise a comprehensive package of educational courses \naimed at Level Crossing offenders so that road users are offered a real alternative to a fixed penalty once an offence has been committed.\nJuly\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
