[normal]Joint Committee on Human Rights – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Draft Deregulation Bill[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Thank you for your message of 11 October inviting my Committee to comment on the human rights implications of the draft Deregulation Bill which is being scrutinised by the Committee you chair.  Following a meeting at staff level on 23 October, between our legal advisers and one of the lawyers advising your Committee, my Committee has asked me to write to you about the following issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](1)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Implications of the “growth duty” for compliance with the Paris Principles[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My Committee is concerned about the implications for the UK’s compliance with the UN’s Paris Principles if the proposed duty on regulators to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth in clause 58 of the draft Bill is intended to apply to national human rights institutions such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission (“the EHRC”).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 60 of the Bill provides that any regulator who is subject to the proposed new duty “must” have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State (clause 60(4)), and that guidance may include guidance as to the ways in which regulatory functions may be exercised so as to promote economic growth (clause 60(2)(b)).  Such a duty to have regard to ministerial guidance about how to exercise its functions would appear to be incompatible with the requirement in the Paris Principles that national human rights institutions must be independent of the Government, and may therefore imperil the “A” status accreditation enjoyed by the EHRC. This significant risk could be easily avoided if the proposed new duty did not apply to national human rights institutions such as the EHRC.

[normal](2)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations in discrimination cases[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The draft Bill would remove the power conferred on employment tribunals by the Equality Act to make wider recommendations in discrimination cases (clause 2, amending s. 124 Equality Act 2010).  The Government does not appear to have carried out any assessment of the recommendations which have so far been made by tribunals under this power since it came into force, nor does it appear to have provided evidence that it imposes unjustified burdens on employers.  The power to make wider recommendations in cases which reveal systemic problems has recently been conferred on coroners, in order to prevent future deaths and to provide greater protection for the right to life.  My Committee considers the same reasoning to apply in the context of discrimination cases which raise systemic issues: it will help to prevent further discrimination and so enhances the law’s protection for equality.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the absence of any clear evidence that such recommendations have proved disproportionately burdensome on employers, and provided tribunal procedures 
[normal]ensure that employers always get an opportunity to be heard on the substance and form of any proposed recommendation before it is made, clause 2 of the draft Bill should be deleted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Henry VIII Clause[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The draft Bill contains a Henry VIII clause of extraordinary breadth: a power for a minister by order to provide for legislation to cease to apply “if the Minister considers that it is no longer of practical use” (clause 51).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Delegated Powers Committee will no doubt wish to comment on this proposed power, but the Joint Committee on Human Rights has also criticised such clauses in the past because the power they purport to confer is so wide that it could be used to reduce legal protection for human rights without full parliamentary scrutiny.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the Committee’s view, legislation which is judged to be “no longer of practical use” should be repealed by statute not by ministerial order.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]I look forward to 
[normal]seeing a copy of your Committee’s Report.
[normal]&#xa0;
