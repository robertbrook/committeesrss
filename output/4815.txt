[[[Further written evidence from the Packaging and  Films Association (PAFA)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;I appeared before you and the environmental committee on the 18th of December to give evidence on carrier bags in the second of three sessions and I feel compelled to follow up on some of the assertions made by the minister in the third session which was directly after I gave evidence.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We look forward to receiving the details including the carbon figures used for each product. It is worth pointing out that a recent EC document overstated the impact of plastic bags by some 84 times!&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To not realise any environmental benefit at all due to the exemptions proposed in England&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To confuse consumers by encouraging use of bags made of paper that have more resource and  environmental impacts and to use biodegradable bags which do not offer the same benefits in terms of recapturing resource as would be the case if the bags were recycled.&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To continue to promulgate the message that litter associated with plastic grocery carrier bags is a significant issue when in fact it only makes up less than 1% of all litter by weight it is only found in 3.5% of all sites surveyed by KBT is a lowly 23 out of 26 items surveyed and finally is the only product  that has recorded a significant reduction in litter during the time of KBT surveys whereas other far more significant items that contribute to litter continue to grow.&#xa0;&#xa0;To close on a more sombre and immediate note immediately after the EAC enquiry the direct result of the ministers assertion that he proposes to continue pursuing the biodegradable option is that the biggest film producer and recycler of film in the UK has notified me and WRAP that it plans to suspend trials to use post-consumer recycled film in building membranes due to the risks associated and the membrane failing which would result in damp penetration. This will result in a loss of a potential to recycle tens of thousands of tonnes of post-consumer film which will make plastic recycling targets in the UK even more difficult to achieve, if not impossible, yet another unintended consequence of an ill thought out policy.   &#xa0;Barry TurnerCEO&#xa0;6 January 2014&#xa0;
