"Written evidence from Bosch Healthcare UK (LTC 95)&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRobert Bosch Healthcare offers a wide ranging portfolio of care products for chronically ill patients and the elderly which helps to bring significant quality, efficiency and financial gains to the UK healthcare sector.\n \nOur aim is to help people with long term conditions remain in their own homes and out of hospital wherever possible.\n \n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBosch’s telehealth spectrum ranges from \nin-home \npatient terminals to comprehensive software allowing healthcare professionals to efficiently evaluate \nrisk-stratified \ndata coming from the patient terminals and other connected devices. Bosch Telehealth strives to improve \nthe care and management of patients with long-term conditions \nthrough systematic patient \neducation, behaviour modification support, daily \nmonitoring \nof symptoms and vital signs \nand \npatient engagement techniques\n. The result is that health professionals are able to provide a higher quality of care for patients with chronic conditions, patients lead happier and healthier lives, and the cost of healthcare is reduced for funders. Robert Bosch Healthcare\n Systems\n, Inc. is a fully-owned subsidiary of the Bosch Group.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services\n and is represented in over 60 countries\n.\n The company was set up in Stuttgart in 1886 by Robert Bosch (1861\n–\n1942) as a “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering.” The special ownership structure of Robert Bosch GmbH guarantees the entrepreneurial freedom of the Bosch Group, making it possible for the company to plan over the long term and to undertake significant up-front investments in the safeguarding of its future. Ninety-two \nper cent\n of the share capital of Robert Bosch GmbH is held by Robert Bosch \nStiftung\n GmbH, a charitable foundation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe respected health \nthink-tank\n, 2020health, recently published the findings of its own study of a telehealth hub pilot in Yorkshire.\n \nIt found that \ntelehealth\n-enabled care co-ordination can reduce hospital admissions, provide care at home and improve patient outcomes.\n \nIt noted that for every 100 patients using technology, 10 hospital admissions are averted each month – that's up to £2,000 saved per averted admission, representing a return on investment of 48%.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department of Health (DH) believes that at least three million people with long term conditions and/or social care needs could benefit from the use of assistive technologies and telehealth services.\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImplemented effectively these technologies can alleviate pressure on long term NHS \nand social care \ncosts and improve people’s quality of life through better self-care in the home setting.\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBosch believes that\n the\n key to achieving this goal is a more integrated approach to health and social care. Bosch support\ns\n NICE’s new oversight role on social care and welcomes the opportunity to \nmake a submission to the Health Select Committee on the management of long term conditions. \nFor technology to work, it must be embedded in care pathways that are designed for patients with long term conditions. This means managing their conditions \nacross the continuum of care \n–\n \nat home\n,\n in the community and in clinical setting\ns\n.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur experience has told us that:\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is particularly relevant to NICE’s proposed guidance on \nm\nedicines management in home-based settings\n and \nReablement\n.\n \nBosch\n, whose systems support medication compliance,\n believes that this \nproposed guidance \nwill \nplay a significant role in managing long-term conditions\n.\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 3millionlives campaign was launched on the back of the initial results from the Whole System\ns\n Demonstrator\n (WSD)\n Project with the goal of bringing technology\n-\nenabled integrated care to 3 million people in the UK by 201\n5\n.\n \n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key part of this strategy is the first Mandate between the \nDH\n and NHS \nEngland\n, published in November 2012, setting out the \nrequirements\n for the\n health service in forthcoming\n years. \n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NHS Mandate is structured around five key areas where the Government expects the NHS \nEngland\n to make improvements:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTechnology has a vital role to play in meeting th\nese \nintrinsically linked objectives. The second stage findings of the WSD have unfortunately\n \n‘muddied the waters’ in terms of moving the technology agenda forward.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBosch was disappointed with the \nsecond stage results of the\n WSD and its apparent limited effect on quality of life and psychological outcomes. Bosch \ntelehealth \nsystems have demonstrated, in more than 40 publications, that its content-driven telehealth intervention supports integrated care and \nconsistently \nproduces significant cost savings in addition to improve\nment\n in both clinical outcomes and the quality of care.\n \n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBosch Healthcare’s Health Buddy System (HBS) was not part of the WSD project and provides \na\n more\n integrated solution \nthan the telehealth interventions used in the WSD.\n \nWhilst many systems focus on vital signs monitoring, Bosch systems utilise \nmore extensive education to support improved patient self-management, positive reinforcement of beha\nviour change which is personalis\ned to the patient\n.\n \n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst a significant study for telehealth in the UK, there are several mitigating factors that need to be considered\n when reviewing the results of the WSD\n.\n \nFor example, \ntelehealth\n devices and monitoring systems varied amongst the study sites and there were inconsistencies in describing exactly what the \ntelehealth\n interventions were.\n \nCrucially\n none of the systems used provided\n support for increased efficiency and effectiveness of clinician workflow\n or supported improved patient self-management\n.\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese latest results are understandably influencing the decisions of commissioners who are currently in the process of shaping\n \nthe\n composition of future service delivery\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith a\nn\n ageing population on the one hand and ongoing budget restrictions on the other, the results have called into perspective an ever-more-urgent need to look at how to create a sustainable delivery model for the future.\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTherefore UK health and social care services must also look abroad for the evidence base to support a more integrated approach \nto \nmanaging long term conditions\n. \nTo take the \nexample \nof a study from the USA \nMedicare system (which has parallels with the NHS) that\n focussed on Congestive Heart Failure \n(one of \nthis Inquiry’s \nterms of reference) \nBosch found significant reduced mortality for patients through \nthe use of its telehealth in combination with care coordination\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloping strategies to reduce readmission rates and improve outcomes for patients with HF has become a national health priorit\ny in the United States\n, as it has in other developed countries\n.\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData for 623 matched pairs of Medicare HF beneficiaries were \nanalysed\n. The results showed that care management combined with the Health Buddy System was associated with a 25 \nper cent\n reduction in all-cause mortality risk in beneficiaries with HF, who were offered the \nprogramme\n and a 57 \nper cent\n reduction in mortality risk for those HF beneficiaries who actively participated in the \nprogramme\n compared to the control studies\n.\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEmpowering patients does not only statistically influence health outcomes but has associated cost and social benefits too. Self-management helps reduce the cost burden on services through reducing the number of staff required per patient and in social terms the education component, common to many assistive technologies, greatly increases health literacy. The long term benefits of increased health literacy are exponential.\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese \"on the ground\" results are, more often than not, the product of integrated delivery systems being put into practice through healthcare and industry partnerships that handle populations with high numbers of people with chronic conditions.\n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor technology to work, it must be embedded in care pathways that are designed for patients with long term conditions. It should comprise of a range of interventions \n–\n including coaching and telecare. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBosch’s studies have demonstrated that, through giving patients an active role in their treatment, they can significantly influence their own health outcomes. Bosch believes that this will be vital to the future strategy of managing long term conditions. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n http://www.2020health.org/2020health/Publications/Publications-2013/Yorkshire-Telehealth.html\n http://www.bosch-telehealth.com/en/us/contact/clinical_evidence/clinical_evidence.html\n Chronic heart failure, Costing report, http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13099/51015/51015.pdf\n"
