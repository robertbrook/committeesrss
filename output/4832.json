"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Lancashire [CST0058]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWith reference to your letter \ndated 6 December 2013 seeking responses from Police and Crime Commissioners in relation to the accuracy of police recorded crime, \nplease find \nmy respon\nse to the questions asked in your correspondence as detailed below:\n&#xa0;1              What, if any, targets do you set for your police force?&#xa0;              The Police and Crime Commissioner's Police and Crime Plan agreed at the end of March 2013 does not contain any specific targets but I am committed to cutting overall crime, reducing re-offending and improving community trust and co\nnfidence in policing.  Although I have not set specific targets I take a robust approach to scrutiny and monitor performance both against most similar forces and against previous performance. I have recently carried out a detailed scrutiny of violent crime\n following high levels in Lancashire and have seen improvements in performance. My Office is actively involved with the Constabulary' performance team. I have asked the Constabulary to ensure that performance indicators mirror my priorities and we also mon\nitor performance against multi-agency targets. \n&#xa0;2              What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices ?&#xa0;              Accurate recording is a key\n driver of performance and the continued emphasis on performance means that there is no negative impact\n on police recording crime practices.  Focussing on wider outcomes supports the Constabulary in adopting a more victim centred approach without the need always to achieve a numerical target.\n&#xa0;\n3              How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct ?&#xa0;              I regularly discuss performance matters with the Chief Constable and his senior team.  I am fully involved in planning and decision making through  regular meetings with senior officers.  The Constabulary has recently undertaken \na review of its own recording processes which has led to a revised procedure and culture for the organisation which is monitored by a data audit team and overseen centrally.  My Office has been involved in this process and has reviewed the approach taken. \n&#xa0;\n              \nI have established a formal Strategic Scrutiny process which takes place on a quarterly basis.  A small joint working group consisting of OPCC / Lancashire Constabulary senior officers scan through relevant data sets, latest performance information, iQu\nanta and MSF data and identify items for scrutiny based on exception.  I have also engaged the input of a Senior Analyst to provide additional information relating to the multi-agency \ndata exchange (MADE) data in Lancashire mapped to my Police and Crime Pl\nan priorities and the force control strategy.\n&#xa0;\n              \nTogether with the Chief Constable I established a joint Audit Committee in November 2012.  Internal Audit undertook a review as part of the 2012/13 audit plan to offer assurance to \nmyself \nand the Chief Consta\nble that controls were in place to collate, analyse and report performance data that are adequately designed and effectively operated.  The review included consideration of customer satisfaction and service statistics as well as crime data.  The review rec\nognised that the appointment of the Police and Crime Commissioner had changed the performance reporting arrangements that had previously been in place.  Given that the revised arrangements were still being developed, the scope of the review was restricted \nto an examination of the accuracy with which the performance data is collated and reported.\n&#xa0;\n              \nInternal Audit was able to provide a substantial assurance opinion in the final report to Audit Committee in June 2013.\n&#xa0;\n4              To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area ?&#xa0;              The matter of data integrity is one that was discussed by the former Police Authority on a number of occasions, specifically at the Audit and Standards Committee.  This work has continued to flow through into the work of the jo\nint Audit Committee culminating in a final report to the Committee in June 2013.  The final report provided for a substantial assurance opinion and nothing of concern.\n&#xa0;\n              \nI have regular quarterly meetings with HMIC.  A recent HMIC inspection of Police Crime\n and Incident Reports in Lancashire (published in January 2012 found that:\n&#xa0;\n              \n\"There were strong arrangements at a senior level for securing the quality of incident and crime data, with helpful plans, policies and strategies in place to support them. The Co\nnstabulary had high standards when recording crimes and incidents in a consistent and accurate manner (so they correctly reflect the sequence of events as described by victims).\"\n&#xa0;\nI hope that the information provided is of assistance to your inquiry into c\nrime statistics. However, should you require anything further, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
