"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dyfed-Powys [CST0057]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThank you for your letter dated the 6\nth\n December 2013 asking Police and Crime Commissioners to respond the following questions:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI have answered each below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI believe this has begun to reduce pressure on the system to produce favourable figures and encouraged better professional judgment. This may result in cr\nime figures rising\n. I will monitor this very carefully\n. I \nam\n prepared to accept this if it provides a better reflection of reality.\n&#xa0;\nTarget-based performance culture is deeply embedded within the police. Changing it will take time and leadership. My Chief \nConstable is committed to improving \nleadership\n and I have agreed to investment\n to this end\n \nwhere necessary. \nI do not expect crime and detection recording practices to change fast\n, however.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSince taking up office I have sought to \nincrease the \ntransparency \nof police performance\n.Â  \nWe\n hold monthly performance boards and\n have established\n an Out of Court Disposal Scrutiny Panel, which assess\nes the\n use of cautions. The Chief Constabl\ne and I are \nexploring\n partnership\ns\n with academia, with College of Policing backing, to improve the quality of our performance work. This will bring greater independence, breadth and analysis to assessments of police and local criminal justice system perfor\nmance.\n&#xa0;\nCrime statistics will always be subject to political and organisational pressure. They \nare undoubtedly useful but \nmust be treated with caution and understood in context. They must also be considered alongside other information, particularly \nqualitative assessments.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
