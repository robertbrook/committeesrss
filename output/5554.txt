[[[ATL, the education union]]]ATL, the education union, is an independent, registered trade union and professional association, representing approximately 160,000 teachers, head teachers, lecturers and support staff in maintained and independent nurseries, schools, sixth form, tertiary and further education colleges in the UK. AMiE is a distinct section of ATL for leaders and managers in colleges and schools. ATL is not affiliated to any political party and seeks to work constructively with all the main political parties.&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the context of high achievement, Ofsted’s negative tone and the perception of an unlevel playing field undermine the inspectorate’s standing.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ofsted‘s main weakness is that it cannot guarantee the outcomes of its inspections process. Inconsistencies in the quality and accuracy of judgements persist.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ATL believes profession-led local systems of accountability and improvement would better serve young people’s education.1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission’s final section highlights specific issues HMCI must address.&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is disappointing that despite the vast majority of schools being considered ‘outstanding’ or ‘good’ after Ofsted raised the bar in its inspection regime that the overwhelming tone of messages conveyed by the organisation’s launch of its annual report is negative.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The patience afforded to academies (paragraphs 48, 50) does not appear to be matched by Ofsted with regards the non-acadamised maintained sector. The politicised nature of the inspectorate remains inappropriate. 2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In this annual report Ofsted repeats criticisms of teaching without acknowledging its own role in the proliferation of the characteristics listed (paragraph 37). This is symptomatic of constant moving of the goalposts and exemplifies both the pressure and mistrust the teaching profession feels in relation to Ofsted.&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The main weakness of Ofsted is that it cannot guarantee the outcomes of its inspections process. Inconsistencies in the quality and accuracy of Ofsted judgements persist.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ATL members have continued to report inconsistencies between inspectors, between inspections and between the experiences of different schools.3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our analysis of Ofsted’s subject surveys published in 2012 and 2013 highlights further inconsistency, suggesting outcomes are unreliable, possibly pre-determined, and potentially politically driven. Despite this annual report stating that almost eight in ten schools were found to be good or outstanding at their most recent inspection, only one subject report, citizenship, in ten published, found a similar level of quality in schools.3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are pleased Ofsted has required inspectors to have QTS but believe it continues to underestimate the challenge of maintaining an effective team of inspectors. The lack of quality control in the inspectorate is damaging not just to its own reputation but damaging to children’s’ education.3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ATL members find Ofsted’s public negativity towards teachers extremely demoralising. The flow of criticism raises stress rather than performance.3.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A member from the primary sector reports: “Previously graded consistently as ‘good’, we received ‘requires improvement’. We felt that some of the criticism was fair, but some unfair; however, we set to work hard and improve … The process since Ofsted has been extremely negative.&#xa0;It seems to me that&#xa0;a school with&#xa0;some faults has now been completely destroyed as morale is very low; teachers continue to work extremely hard but feel&#xa0;demoralised, depressed and exhausted and support staff are also affected by the oppressive atmosphere in the school … This punitive regime has done nothing to improve the school.”3.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An ATL secondary school member highlights the gap between effective accountability and the reality of Ofsted inspections: “It is 'all stick, and no carrot', but it should be about professional dialogue and improving the educational experience for children.”&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ofsted can’t be relied upon for its judgments and can’t be counted on to play a role in helping schools improve because of its two major problems: inconsistency in quality and accuracy; and having next to no respect amongst the teaching profession.4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An alternative must address these issues and ATL would like to see profession-led local systems of accountability and improvement.4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By being designed locally and with the involvement of current classroom teachers judgments would be respected, unique school circumstances better understood, and improvement plans would be relevant and effectively supported. A national body such as Ofsted would have the role of overseeing the processes to quality assure them and provide confidence that schools are properly accountable in these new, local structures.&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Are complaints and appeals against Ofsted inspection findings increasing?5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Does Ofsted acknowledge it has a significant problem with its own quality control?5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Why do so many of Ofsted’s subject surveys suggest teaching is considerably worse than is being found in school inspections?5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What is being done to improve Ofsted’s reputation with the teaching profession?5.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Can a national agency of inspectors really support children’s’ education and offer a better system of school and college accountability than local profession-led systems of inspection and improvement?&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
