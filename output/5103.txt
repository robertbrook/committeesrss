[[[Submission Date: 14 January 2014]]]&#xa0;Organisation overviewEurogroup for Animals is an international, non-governmental organisation that acts as the leading voice for animal welfare at the European Union level providing a voice for the billions of animals kept in laboratories, farms and homes or living in the wild. As a federation of 40 animal welfare organisations across Europe, we mobilise millions of citizens to defend the welfare of animals and act to ensure European, national and local decision makers take note and respond to our concerns.  &#xa0;Reason for written submissionAs an animal welfare policy organisation, we believe strongly that scientific evidence exists justifying the prohibition of primates as pets. Several of our member organisations operate rescue centres and sanctuaries for confiscated and unwanted exotic pets and are well-acquainted with welfare suffering of primates being unsuitably kept as pets. A few of these organisations (e.g. RSPCA, One Kind, Stichting AAP) will be submitting detailed evidence directly on this issue regarding the number of animals rescued and related welfare concerns. Therefore, we are focusing our submission of evidence to studies and statements by experts documenting the risks of primate pet keeping and related trade. Furthermore, we provide evidence of the regulatory actions by other European countries to restrict the keeping of primates as pets.&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;CommentsPrimates are highly intelligent animals with specialised dietary, social and environmental needs that are difficult, if not impossible, to meet in a household environment. Primates of all ages and size can pose a significant physical and health threat to owners. Many primates, including great apes, are still sourced from the wild, threatening wild populations and contributing to biodiversity loss. &#xa0;Health &amp; safety risks to humans&#xa0;Primates pose a significant health risks to humans due to their phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, they can inflict severe bites and injuries to humans. A bibliographic review of zoonotic disease risks from exotic pets commissioned by Eurogroup for Animals identified a number of zoonoses (diseases spread between animals and humans) documented in primates, including: rabies, monkey B virus, tuberculosis, Ebola virus, as well as zoonoses transmitted through bites and parasites.&#xa0;Endangered species &#xa0;The trade in primates for pets has been linked to wild population declines in many species. One of the most endangered primates, the Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) from North Africa, is suffering drastic declines due to habitat loss and the illegal pet trade to Europe,. The Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment of the free trade agreement currently being&#xa0;negotiated between the EU and Morocco documents this illegal trade.&#xa0;&#xa0;UNEP’s Great Ape Survival Partnership report, Stolen Apes, estimates that 3000 chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans are lost (either sold, killed during the hunt, or dying in captivity)&#xa0;from the wild in Africa and Asia each year. Examining confiscation records, international trade databases, law enforcement reports, and arrival rates from sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers between 2005 and 2011, the report estimates that for every chimpanzee confiscated or confirmed in illegal trade, 10 more animals died during the capture or trafficking. Markets for tourist entertainment, disreputable zoos and pets are generating the demand and illegal permits are often used to traffic wild animals. &#xa0;Legislative restrictions on the keeping of primates&#xa0;In 2012, Eurogroup for Animals conducted a comprehensive legislative review on the keeping and sale of exotic animals in 31 European countries. The analysis found that 22 countries restrict keeping of exotic animals as pets based on negative lists of prohibited species. Belgium is the one country that regulates keeping via a positive list of acceptable mammal species (this list does not include primates). The competent authority in Belgium has noted that a positive list has been a cost-effective and useful enforcement approach to regulating pets, as the public reports illegal sales online and in pet shops. People holding species not on the positive list at the time of its adoption were allowed to maintain their animals provided they registered them with the competent authority. The Netherlands has announced it will switch to a positive list for mammals in 2014 (primates are not allowed to be kept). &#xa0;Several countries have included primates (or certain groups of primates) on their negative lists of species which cannot be kept as pets, including: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Sweden. The report contains tables summarising restrictions on the keeping and sale of exotic animals across European countries, as well as one-page country summaries on legislative restrictions and future legislative plans. An Executive Summary brochure is also available.&#xa0;Scientific studies examine primate pet keeping and use in entertainment&#xa0;A University of Bristol study on the welfare and suitability of primates kept as pets concluded “it is unlikely that the welfare of pet primates can be adequately addressed in normal households” and argued the practice should end (Soulsbury et al. 2009). It noted that the majority of primate-related complaints received by the RSPCA between 2000-2005 concerned neglect. This might suggest owners are unaware and perhaps incapable of meeting the complex needs of primates in a household setting. &#xa0;A study by Schroepher et al. 2011 examining the use of chimpanzees in entertainment (e.g. movies, commercials, print advertisement) suggested a strong distortion in the public’s view of chimpanzees as endangered species and suitability as pets. It noted the use of media with chimpanzees interacting with humans as “pets” in non-range countries may encourage animal traffickers and poachers in range countries to capture infants for this market. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Scientists and veterinarians caution against primate pet keeping&#xa0;In 2013, the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe issued a policy statement calling on competent authorities to establish lists of animals to regulate the keeping of companion animals. It noted positive lists may be preferable and that lists should be based on scientific criteria including “risks for the animals itself, its owners and the society, the indigenous species and ecosystems.”&#xa0;In the United States, a consumer information program on exotic pet choices called PetWatch was developed by EcoHealth Alliance, an international organization of scientists focused on the conservation of biodiversity by examining the relationships between, wildlife, ecosystems and human health. A team of scientists conducted searches on general, popular, industry and academic databases to acquire information&#xa0;on four criteria (source sustainability, invasion threat, animal welfare and health threat) to generate a list of the Best, Fair and Worst choices of exotic pets. The primate species assessed (e.g. common marmoset, rhesus macaques, squirrel monkeys) were all classified as “worst choices” and not recommended for pet keeping. &#xa0;Confiscated and unwanted pet primates&#xa0;Several of Eurogroup for Animals’ member organisations facilitate the rescue of confiscated and unwanted pet primates each year. As stated above, some of these groups will be submitting written evidence directly and we would refer you to their submissions for data on the trade and keeping in the UK and related conclusions on the effectiveness of the current regulations and code of practice.
