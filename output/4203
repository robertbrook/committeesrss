[normal]Supplementary written evidence from Network Rail
[normal] (SLC 
[normal]045)
[normal]Further
[normal] 
[normal]to my a
[normal]ppearance before the committee on 4 November in connection
[normal] with the above inquiry I am w
[normal]riting to follow up on a number of issues raised during
[normal] the oral evidence session.
[normal]Ufton
[normal] 
[normal]Nervet
[normal]The Committee asked about the progress of plans for a bridge at 
[normal]Ufton
[normal] 
[normal]Nervet
[normal] to replace the automatic half barrier crossing currently there.
[normal]As the Committee may be aware, the crossing at 
[normal]Ufton
[normal] 
[normal]Nervet
[normal] pro
[normal]vides access from the A4 to 
[normal]Ufton
[normal] 
[normal]Nerv
[normal]et
[normal] village. This means that the closure of the crossing to facilitate the construction of a bridge
[normal] on the same 
[normal]alignment
[normal] as 
[normal]the road is 
[normal]not possible without effectively cutting the village off.
[normal]The lo
[normal]cal council and local community
[normal] have been
[normal] 
[normal]clear that this
[normal] 
[normal]approach
[normal] 
[normal]would not be acceptable and this means that we will need to purchase land in order to build the bridge
[normal] 
[normal]adjacent to the crossing.
[normal] 
[normal]At this stage we are actively engaged
[normal] 
[normal]in dialogue with
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]landowners
[normal] 
[normal]regarding
[normal] 
[normal]purchasing
[normal] 
[normal]this
[normal] 
[normal]land
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]outcome
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]these discussions
[normal] 
[normal]is essential to enable us to establish the location of the proposed bridge.
[normal]In terms of the bridge construction itself, we have issued an Invitation to Tender with a programme to award a contract
[normal] 
[normal]in the coming weeks.
[normal] 
[normal]The appointed designer
[normal] 
[normal]will then complete a detailed option selection
[normal] 
[normal]report that we envisage
[normal] 
[normal]submitting early in Control
[normal] 
[normal]Period
[normal] 
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal](2014-19).
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]indicative
[normal] 
[normal]delivery
[normal] 
[normal]timescale
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]bridge
[normal] 
[normal]is therefore
[normal] 
[normal]by
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]end
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]2015. If
[normal] 
[normal]negotiations
[normal] 
[normal]over
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]land
[normal] 
[normal]purchase
[normal] 
[normal]proceed smoothly it is possible we may be able to bring this date forward. 
[normal]As I am sure you will understand it is incumbent
[normal] 
[normal]on Network Rail to demonstrate why the bridge is our strongly preferred option given there is likely to be some potential for objection.
[normal]Third party contributions towards level crossing closures
[normal]During the evidence session the Committee also asked for examples of where development in
[normal] 
[normal]close
[normal] 
[normal]proximity
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]level
[normal] 
[normal]crossings
[normal] 
[normal]had
[normal] 
[normal]enabled
[normal] 
[normal]contributions from third parties towards crossing closures.
[normal] 
[normal]A number
[normal] 
[normal]of brief examples
[normal] 
[normal]are below.
[normal] 
[normal]As mentioned in the evidence session we often find it very difficult to secure these contributions but are keen for councils to continue helping us do so wherever developments
[normal] 
[normal]significantly
[normal] 
[normal]impact
[normal] 
[normal]upon
[normal] 
[normal]crossing
[normal] 
[normal]usage
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]therefore
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]level
[normal] 
[normal]of safety risk.
[normal] 
[normal]If the Committee would like further details on any of these examples
[normal] 
[normal]then we would be happy to assist.
[normal]Hawkes
[normal] Lane, Suffolk
[normal]A new
[normal] 
[normal]stepped
[normal] 
[normal]footbridge
[normal] 
[normal]at 
[normal]Hawkes
[normal] 
[normal]Lane
[normal] 
[normal]is scheduled
[normal] 
[normal]for installation
[normal] 
[normal]by
[normal] 
[normal]March
[normal]2014 and is being funded entirely by Suffolk County Council.
[normal] 
[normal]This is the result of the increased
[normal] 
[normal]usage
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]crossing
[normal] 
[normal]expected
[normal] 
[normal]from
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]local council's
[normal] 
[normal]new
[normal] 
[normal]academy which is under
[normal] 
[normal]construction
[normal] 
[normal]adjacent
[normal] 
[normal]to the railway
[normal] 
[normal]at this location
[normal] 
[normal]on the grounds and
[normal] 
[normal]Network
[normal] 
[normal]Rail's
[normal] 
[normal]objection
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]planning
[normal] 
[normal]application
[normal] 
[normal]on
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]basis
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]safety concerns.

[normal]Cottingham
[normal], Yorkshire
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]proposed
[normal] 
[normal]development at 
[normal]Cottingham
[normal] 
[normal]is estimated
[normal] 
[normal]to increase
[normal] 
[normal]risk
[normal] 
[normal]at the
[normal] 
[normal]level crossing by 20% because of increased usage.
[normal] 
[normal]The developer
[normal] 
[normal]is therefore making
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]20% contribution of £200,000 contribution towards a footbridge which will enable
[normal] 
[normal]the closure of the 
[normal]Bingham, 
[normal]Nottingharnshire
[normal]A supermarket development is contributing £650,000 towards a new footbridge at the station and improvements to a level crossing.
[normal]Sleaford, Lincolnshire
[normal]A level crossing at Sleaford is being closed with a developer
[normal] 
[normal]paying the full cost of a new road bridge over the railway.
[normal] 
[normal]The developer
[normal] 
[normal]is also contributing £450,000
[normal] 
[normal]for a footbridge nearby, with the local council contributing
[normal] 
[normal]the remainder
[normal] 
[normal]in recognition of the development's
[normal] 
[normal]regeneration potential.
[normal]Finally,
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Committee
[normal] 
[normal]asked
[normal] 
[normal]about
[normal] 
[normal]the number
[normal] 
[normal]of non-compliant level crossings. We carry out a number of relevant
[normal] 
[normal]level crossing
[normal] 
[normal]risk management activities
[normal] 
[normal]during routine maintenance
[normal] 
[normal]and operations.
[normal] 
[normal]This includes scheduled risk assessments and scheduled
[normal] 
[normal]inspections
[normal] 
[normal]of asset
[normal] 
[normal]condition
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]identify
[normal] 
[normal]defects. 
[normal]              
[normal]When
[normal] 
[normal]defects
[normal] 
[normal]are identified, a work order
[normal] 
[normal]is issued.
[normal] 
[normal]As of 26 November
[normal] 
[normal]2013
[normal] 
[normal]there were 793
[normal] 
[normal]level crossings with overdue work orders.
[normal] 
[normal]I would
[normal] 
[normal]however like to offer my assurance that identified
[normal] 
[normal]defects
[normal] 
[normal]are assessed and managed
[normal] 
[normal]based
[normal] 
[normal]on their
[normal] 
[normal]risk
[normal] 
[normal]rating
[normal] 
[normal]with high priority, high risk
[normal] 
[normal]defects
[normal] 
[normal]resolved
[normal] 
[normal]immediately or very quickly
[normal] 
[normal]within mandated timescales.
[normal]I hope the above information is of assistance to the committee.
