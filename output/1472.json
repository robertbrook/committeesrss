"&#xa0;\nGary Aldridge â€“ Written evidence&#xa0;\nRe: Clause 35 of the Draft Regulation Bill \nThis clause proposes to stop external reporting of Department &amp; Work decisions on\n&#xa0;\nthe Work Capability Assessments \"to reduce the burden of regulation.\nMy question is that at a time of increased regulation in health and social care, rightly so, why it is being proposed that private companies and the relationship with the DWP is not open to scrutiny. Particularly as decisions are about how my tax income is being spent. \nThere \nhas\n been numerous problems reported with Work Capability Assessments, with high numbers of appeals and the majority of those being successful. \nTo stop external reporting with reduce the ability to check on performance of said companies and decisions can be made based on the agenda of the DWP. If a narrow objective for decisions is adopted, say cost savings, how will quality and fairness be assured?\nAs an electorate and tax payer may concern is that the quality of assessments will become secondary if there is no external scrutiny\n&#xa0;\n28 August 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
