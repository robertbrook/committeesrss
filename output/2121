[normal]The Open Spaces Society 
[normal]is Britain’s oldest national conservation body, founded in 1865.  We campaign for public paths of all categories, on behalf of all types of lawful user, as well as for common land, town and village greens and open spaces, in town and country, throughout England and Wales.  We have over 2,000 members consisting of individuals, 
[normal]organisations
[normal] and local councils.  We are a registered charity.  I have been the general secretary of the society since 1984.

[normal]The society was represented on Natural England’s Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) on unrecorded public rights of way and worked for over a year with the other 
[normal]organisations
[normal] on the group (representing landowners and occupiers, local authorities and users) to achieve a consensus on a balanced package of regulatory reforms for public rights of way.  This was published in 
[normal]Stepping Forward
[normal] in March 2010 and submitted to ministers.  
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]reforms which require primary legislation now form part of the draft Deregulation Bill (clauses 12-18 and schedule 6), having been subject to public consultation by 
[normal]Defra
[normal].  They are supported by all those with an interest in the 
[normal]subject, which is a considerable achievement.  The society warmly welcomes these provisions in the Bill and considers there to be an urgent need for primary legislation to enable them to be introduced.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 4
[normal]              
[normal]It is essential that these clauses and the schedule are introduced as a package because the consensus between the wide 
[normal]range
[normal] of interests has been achieved on the complete package, and the consensus is vital to securing swift and pain-free passage of this part of the Bill.  
[normal]We ask the Joint Committee to resist any pressure to pick and choose from among the measures for public rights of way in the Bill.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]It has been a frustration for all those who work on public rights of way that the definitive map and statements are increasingly out of date, as evidence is discovered for the addition (and removal) of highways, but the surveying authorities, who have a duty to keep the maps and statements up to date, have not the capacity to do this.  Backlogs, in some cases of decades, are building up.  If the process for claiming and recording highways could be streamlined as proposed in the draft Bill, it would make a significant difference to progress, and it is in everyone’s interest to have an up-to-date and accurate record of public rights of way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 6
[normal]              
[normal]From the society’s point of view, as an 
[normal]organisation
[normal] championing public paths for their opportunities for public recreation and enjoyment, as well as their unique historical significance, we are anxious for all highways to be recorded, so that they are protected and signposted and can be enjoyed.  Walking, riding, cycling and carriage-driving are all good for the economy and for people’s physical and mental health and well-being.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 7
[normal]              
[normal]The introduction of these reforms to rights-of-way law are now urgent because, in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, the government introduced a cut-off date of 1 January
[normal] 
[normal]2026 (which, with some exceptions, will extinguish any pre-1949 public rights which have not been recorded on definitive maps by then).  We are over halfway through the period between the introduction of the cut off and its implementation and no progress has been made in speeding up the processes on the ground.  It is essential that the issue is fully addressed so that up-to-date definitive maps and statements will be achieved by 1 January 2026.  Otherwise countless public highways could be lost 
[normal]for ever
[normal] and the legal maxim ‘Once a highway, always a highway’ will cease to have meaning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 8
[normal]              
[normal]The clauses in the Bill affecting public rights of way are deregulatory and will reduce the burden on the Secretary of State, local authorities and landowners in many ways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 9
[normal]              
[normal]Examples are clause 12 (which will reduce the number of applications for deletion); clause 13 (which prevents duplication of work by local authorities and volunteers); clause 14 (which protects owners from losing private rights); clause 16 (which enables gates to be erected on byways, which will assist agricultural landowners); and schedule 6 (which streamlines the process for amending the 
[normal]definitive map and statement, to the benefit of the Secretary of State, local authorities, owners and occupiers, user groups and the public).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]There are some matters of detail which we look forward to discussing with other members of the SWG and officials to ensure that the clauses do reflect the SWG’s consensus.  An example is the omission, in England, of the words ‘or is reasonably alleged to subsist’ as set out in schedule 6 
[normal]para
[normal] 2(a).  This wording is important and the SWG intended it to remain in the legislation.  But we feel confident that this and any other technical matters will be resolved before long.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]              
[normal]We also request the Joint Committee not to [bold]recommend any [bold]widen[bold]ing of[bold] the scope of the Bill in relation to public rights of way.[bold]  The package in the Bill reflects the SWG consensus and if further issues are introduced, which have not been subject to discussion and agreement, this could put the whole consensus at risk.  As mentioned above, it is vital, for the smooth passage of the Bill and swift introduction of the reforms, that the consensus is retained.
