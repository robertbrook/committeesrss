[[[House of Commons Justice Committee – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Draft Deregulation Bill]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 19 August on behalf of the Joint Committee on the draft Deregulation Bill seeking the Justice Committee’s views on relevant provisions of the draft bill.&#xa0;The Justice Committee offers the following comments on clauses 35 to 39 of the draft bill:&#xa0;

[[[Clause 35]]]&#xa0;This clause removes the legal duty imposed on the Senior President of Tribunals to make an annual report to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the standards of decision-making achieved by the Department of Work and Pensions in the making of decisions against which an appeal lies to the First-tier Tribunal.&#xa0;The effect of this provision is straightforward. However, it comes against a background of disapprobatory reports published by the Senior President of Tribunals on the standards achieved by the Department of Work and pensions and the company that carries out fitness to work assessments, Atos. His Honour Judge Martin noted in evidence to the Commons Work and Pensions Committee that “the same problems and errors are repeated year after year, with no sign that anyone takes any notice of feedbacks from Tribunals ...” His concerns are borne out by the high number of successful appeals against DWP decisions to grant benefits based on Atos assessments, almost half of all cases brought to court. &#xa0;A Commons written answer of 18 October 2013 gave the Government’s reasons for the proposed repeal of the Senior President’s report duty:http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/text/131018w0001.htm#13101842000084&#xa0;The Joint Committee may wish to ask the Senior President of Tribunals for his opinion on the value of his annual report and whether he supports the abolition of the duty to make such a report. &#xa0;

[[[Clause 36 ]]]&#xa0;This clause amends the law with regard to witness statements and other matters of evidence in a criminal trial by repealing the statutory provisions and replacing them with a power by the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee to replace them with Rules. The previous statutory provisions are the&#xa0;'default' position until the&#xa0;Criminal Procedure Rule Committee&#xa0;provides otherwise. &#xa0;The Explanatory Notes envisage that the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee will use its new powers to streamline court procedures while ensuring "the rules provide appropriate safeguards for defendants..."&#xa0;This would also permit consolidation of&#xa0;matters of procedure in the criminal courts. On that basis,&#xa0;this measure is to be welcomed.&#xa0;Together with clauses 37 and 38, however, it is suggested that the Joint Committee may wish to ask the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee whether it welcomes these provisions. If the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee is likely to simply&#xa0;substitute these statutory provisions with identical Rules then it must be queried whether inclusion of these clauses in legislation represents a good use of Parliamentary time. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Clause 37 ]]]&#xa0;This clause amends section 12(7) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 to provide that the Criminal Procedure Rules may dispense with the requirement&#xa0;that the statement of facts, any notice served on the defendant, the guilty plea by the defendant and any written statements given in mitigation&#xa0;must be read aloud in court before that court may accept&#xa0;a written&#xa0;guilty plea without the defendant being present.&#xa0;This clause is intended to speed up the process of guilty pleas in the Magistrates' Court for comparatively minor offences such as minor road traffic offences.&#xa0;Clearly any measure that seeks to save court time is welcome. The only caveat would be that this measure reduces the public nature of justice in these cases. However, as the provision merely allows the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee to adopt this approach, presumably after the usual consultation and consideration, this measure can also be welcomed in principle. &#xa0;

[[[Clause 38 ]]]&#xa0;In all but one instance, this&#xa0;clause seeks to give the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee power to make Criminal Procedure Rules in areas where no statutory procedure applies.&#xa0;The exception is the removal of notice requirements for warrants for "excluded or special procedure material" in Schedule 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Unlike the clauses detailed above, the draft bill does not leave the current statutory procedure as the 'default'&#xa0;position, it repeals the provisions and&#xa0;gives the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee power to create a new&#xa0;procedure in future. &#xa0;The Explanatory Notes do not explain why the notice provisions in Schedule 1 of PACE are being repealed without leaving anything in their place. It is suggested the Government are asked what&#xa0;its rationale is for this approach. &#xa0;&#xa0;Clause 38 also requires, in two instances, under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, that the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee apply to a judge when stating procedure in the relevant proceedings. It is suggested the Government is asked why there is this difference of approach between these provisions and the others detailed in this draft bill.&#xa0;

[[[Clause 39 ]]]&#xa0;This clause makes certain changes to those offenders to which Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) apply. These are the arrangements that criminal justice and social care agencies are obliged to make under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to co-operate with each other in managing the risks posed by certain sexual, violent and other offenders. The clause is concerned with the duty as it relates to those offenders who receive, or meet the conditions to receive, a disqualification order, which prevents them from working with children. The court’s power to impose disqualification orders was repealed by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 but the MAPPA arrangements continue to apply automatically to those who received them in the past. The Government does not see this as necessary so the clause makes the necessary amendments to ensure that MAPPA arrangements do not apply solely for this reason. Further amendments are made to ensure that this change does not result in a failure to manage serious offenders. MAPPA arrangements are therefore extended to those offences for which a disqualification order could have been imposed which did not previously fall within the duty – parental abduction of a child, trafficking &#xa0;a child for exploitation, and various drugs offences against a child – provided they meet the required level of seriousness set out the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  &#xa0;This clause does not appear to be contentious as the removal of one means of public protection is largely replaced with another. It is possible that some offenders, particularly those that have committed offences of lesser seriousness that might have met the threshold for disqualification orders but might not do so for MAPPA arrangements, will not be subject to the same level of safeguarding as they were previously. The Joint Committee might wish to ask the Government the extent to which this might be the case.  &#xa0;&#xa0;I hope these comments are helpful to the Joint Committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
