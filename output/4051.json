"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the British Gas Service Ltd (BRC 47)&#xa0;\nThe following paper has been prepared by British Gas Services Ltd. in response to the questions raised by the Communities and local Government (CLG) Select Committee regarding electrical safety in the home and the operation of Competent Persons Schemes.\n&#xa0;Prior to the introduction of Part P there was no formal requirement for electrical work to be assessed or registered in any way.  The safety of the publ\nic in relation to electrical installation work was reliant upon the employment of competent contractors.  The only validation of the technical competence of those contractors was via voluntary registration with one of a number of trade organisations such a\ns the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) or the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installing Contractors (NICEIC).\n&#xa0;\nThe introduction of Part P in 2005 improved electrical safety standards by forcing contractors operating in the domestic secto\nr to follow the industry standards and regulations. \n&#xa0;\nHowever following the review of Part P in 2013 and subsequent concerns raised about the scheme, The CLG Select Committee has requested responses to a number of issues.  The following document details the\n view of British Gas Services ltd. with regards to these issues.\n&#xa0;\nBritish Gas carry\n \nout electrical contracting work throughout England (Scotland and Wales) across a number of specific markets.  We operate within the \nindustrial, commercial, \ndomestic and resi\ndential sector\ns\n via our Electrical Services contracting business, carrying out electrical installation and maintenance work for domestic customers, Central Heating Installation business undertaking gas heating installations and upgrades and through our Bri\ntish Gas Business contracting teams undertaking installation work, renewable technology installation work, \nmaintenance, repair, test and inspection services.\n&#xa0;\nWe support the introduction of electrical installations as a controlled service as defined within \nthe Building Regulations for England and any scheme aimed at improving electrical safety in domestic properties and raising awareness of the requirements for electrical safety in this sector.  As such we believe:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Appendix 1 – British Gas Responses to the Questions Raised by the CLG Select CommitteePrior to the introduction of Part P there was no formal requirement for electrical work to be assessed or registered in any way.  The safety of the public in relation to electrical installation work was r\neliant upon the employment of competent contractors.  The only validation of the technical competence of those contractors was via voluntary registration with one of a number of trade organisations such as the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) or th\ne National Inspection Council for Electrical Installing Contractors (NICEIC).\n&#xa0;\nThe introduction of Part P in 2005 improved electrical safety standards by forcing contractors operating in the domestic sector to follow the industry standards and regulations. \n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Committee is keen to establish: the extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;\nThe general awareness of the requirements for electrical work to be notified in England (Wales and Scotland operate a differing scheme) is poor.\n&#xa0;\n The proliferation of electrical accessories availability via DIY sheds like B&amp;Q, Screwfix, and Wickes adds to \nthe belief that electrical work \nis predominantly\n a DIY activity.\n&#xa0;\nThose members of the public that are aware of the requirements to use competent electrical installers and report certain electrical work employ contractors registered with an organisation suc\nh as the NICEIC or ECA as their brands are well established and respected.\n&#xa0;\nThe publicity on Part P \nand the requirements has \ntend\ned\n to be aimed at the trade not the general public.\n  This has educated the electrical contractors who want to operate \nlegitimate\nly and want to promote electrical safety but appears to have little impact on the general public’s awareness.\nPart P work is only a fraction of the electrical installation work carried out in homes across England, the main issue is that many home owners be\nlieve electrical installation work is a low risk activity.  Educating the general public on electrical safety and the risks associated with poor installation work \nand encouraging them to use competent registered electrical installers on all electrical work\n not just that deemed to be reportable under Part P should be a priority.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a \ncompany are brought up to the same level of skills;\n&#xa0;\nThe introduction of Part P into the building regulations in 2005 created a split in the electrical trades.\n&#xa0;\n For the first time it was recognised that the full skill sets delivered via a recognised trade a\npprenticeship of 4 -5 years were not necessary if the person was only training to operate in a small sector of the industry known as domestic installations.\n&#xa0;\n For many years electricians had been operating in this sector that migrated from similar trades, w\nere self taught or never completed their formal training.\n&#xa0;\n As electrical work was previously an uncontrolled service (not notifiable to building control) there was no requirement for any formal qualifications.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nPart P introduced a necessity for any instal\nler carrying out work that is “reportable” under the building regulation scheme to register with a Competent Person Scheme.  This had the effect that existing installers and previously “unqualified” installers had to take recognised qualifications, improvi\nng their awareness of the wiring regulations and as a result improving the electrical installation standards and safety.  \n&#xa0;\nHowever, in some cases\n new “\nlimited\n competency” qualifications were developed to allow those operating in this sector without formal qualifications to attain a recognised qualification quickly.\n&#xa0;\n These training courses ran from as little as 3 days, however their scope expanded from the provi\nsion of a recognised qualification for people already experienced to a new skill training scheme.\n&#xa0;\n The\n \nschemes became popular amongst people who never worked in the sector, they could attend a short duration course and then hold the necessary qualification\ns to become registered on a competent persons scheme and rewire domestic houses!\n  The quality of these training schemes needs to be carefully considered.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nThe competent person scheme providers rule\ns\n demand that the “Qualifying Supervisor” \n(QS) \nholds the t\nechnical qualifications and are assessed carrying out work such as testing.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe QS is then responsible for the work undertaken by the installers he is responsible for. \nA QS can supervise a n\number of unqualified installers\n, the\n individuals\n may never need t\no be assessed.\n&#xa0;\nThe two main issues with this scheme are:\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPoor levels of initial training to qualify as a Part P QS.\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNot everyone who carryout installation works on behalf of the company need hold the qualifications.\n&#xa0;\nA more robust mechanism fo\nr\n protection is the demand for minimum levels of competence in the form of a robust qualification along with individual registration with the \nCP\nS providers for \nall operatives similar to that adopted by the gas industry would improve safety and quality of do\nmestic installations.\n&#xa0;\nThere have been great strides to improve electrical competencies in the sector over the period that Part P has been in force with the \nE\nlectrotechnical \nA\nssessment \nS\ncheme (EAS) and\n the requirements of the M\nT\nC document published on the D\nCLG website, \n(\nin particular Appendix 4 of the MTC\n)\n which has been developed and strengthened over the last few years.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to \nensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations;\n&#xa0;\nThe Part P \ncompetent persons \nscheme requires that\n:\n&#xa0;\nThe an\nnual \nassessment of contractors is designed to ensure standar\nds are maintained and also helps build relationships between the contractors and CPS provider.  However, there is a case for risk based assessments to be considered.  That is where a contractor has demonstrated that they work to the standards expected cons\nistently and no issues have been identified during their annual assessments, the frequency of the assessments could be reduced.  Thus reducing the assessment burden for organisations operating in sectors with numerous annual assessment requirements.\n&#xa0;\nThe Pa\nrt P a\nssessments \ncarried out by ELECSA and the NICEIC (the CPS provider of our organisation) \nare conducted by assessors who are \nknowledgeable and highly competent.  This builds the confidence of the contractor in the CPS provider and should provide custome\nrs with assurances that the assessment process is robust.\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons;\nThe \ncurrent \nannual assessment of contractors is \nin line with similar competence schemes and electrical safety schemes\n in other parts of the UK.  E.g. Scotland \n&#xa0;\nHowever, \nas previously stated contractors such as ourselves would welcome a regime of assessments that are \nbased \non risk and past performance under the assessment regimes.\n  \nThus reducing the assessment burden for \norganisations operating in sectors with numerous annual assessment requirements.\n&#xa0;\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work; and\n&#xa0;\nCompetiti\non is healthy in any sector.  It provides a mechanism for self regulation and keeps operational costs down.\n&#xa0;\nThere have always been a number of CPS providers that any contractor could choose from.  The development of the two electrical contractor registers \nshould in effect provide the same competition.  \n&#xa0;\nIt should be noted that \nthe Electrical Safety Register recently launched by the ESC &amp; ECA, for the contractors, consumers, clients and specifier\n’\ns\n has provided a valuable platform for anyone requiring a competent installer to utilise\n,\n safe in the knowledge that the organisations registered with those bodies \nare\n competent and offer the safe guards the schemes provide.\n&#xa0;\nWe believe that \nthe initial publ\nicity to the general public was poor with \nmost householders unaware of the schemes\n.  The two registration schemes need to work together closely to avoid the \ndilut\nion of\n the safety messages and\n potentially confus\nion to\n the public.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe\n adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes.\nWe have \nlittle\n visibility of any supervision of the \nCPS\n providers via the DCLG.\n&#xa0;\nWe are aware that each scheme operator now has to be UKAS accredited.  Our understanding of UKAS and their as\nsessment processes provides assurance that this requirement ensures consistency and robust support processes to be in place by the CPS providers.\n&#xa0;\nThis further enhances the case for scheme providers like the Certsure Ltd. (NICEIC and ECA/ ELECSA) who have a\nchieved UKAS approval for their schemes.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
