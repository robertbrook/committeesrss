defaultWritten evidence from defaultAdvocatedefault Gordon Dawes on behalf of Kevin Delaneydefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultCrown Dependencies: Evidence of Lord McNally, 5 November 2013  default&#xa0;
defaultI am writing to you on behalf of Mr Kevin Delaney, of Sark, who is managing director of Sark Estate Management Limited and, separately, editor and publisher of the Sark Newsletter.
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Delaney has studied closely the evidence of Lord McNally to the Committee and has instructed me to comment as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Delaney agreed with a great deal of what Lord McNally had to say concerning the state of Sark government.  He agrees entirely that Sark is not governed well.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever there were several points that Mr
default Delaney does take issue with.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNally said that Sark had (only) had democracy since the 2008 reforms (see answer to Q37 in the transcript).
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Delaney says that there is still no fully functioning democracy on Sark for the following reasons:
default&#xa0;
default1
default              
defaultthere are no constituencies on Sark, all electors vote for all candidates, with the result that a majority interest group can dominate Chief Pleas completely, resulting in a single party state
default.  If an interest group can muster sufficient votes to elect the last candidate to get into Chief Pleas then it follows you can select every successful candidate
default;
default&#xa0;
default2
default              
defaultThis is what has happened in Sark with the majority interest group consisting of those criticised elsewhere in L
defaultord McNally's evidence as 
defaultlonging for the good old days of feudal rule, opposing reforms, 
defaultopposing 
defaultinvestment and even ideas;
default&#xa0;
default3
default              
defaultBecause of Sark's present constitution there is no opposition voice in Chief Pleas at all;
default&#xa0;
default4
default              
defaultIn reality Sark continues to have a feudal 
defaultconstitution
default because it continues to have a feudal lord at the head of its 
defaultconstitution
default and at the head of its property owning pyramid.  The Seigneur continues to have real political privileges and powers which nobody else has
default,
default by virtue only of inheriting land from his grandmother, which is entirely inappropriate according to the 21
defaultst
default century values which Lord McNally correctly said Sark must live by;
default&#xa0;
default5
default              
defaultThe Seigneur's privileges include the right to an unelected seat in Chief Pleas, the right to speak politically, extensive 
defaultpowers of appointment/
defaultdismissal form public office, a right of veto over certain legislation
default and 
defaulttrusteeship of Sark's assets.  The Bailiwick's professional police force cannot even land on Sark without his permission, which is, quite frankly, outrageous;
default&#xa0;
default6
default              
defaultSymbolic of his continuing power and influence is the fact that he sits, with no legal right to do so, on a large wooden throne on a dais overseeing every Chief Pleas meeting, with the President beside
default him on a smaller wooden throne.  From this position the Seigneur makes speeches which set the tone for meetings; indeed his very presence and well known hostility to my client and the interests he represents is sufficient to set the tone of every meeting;
default&#xa0;
default7
default              
defaultThe President is the former Seneschal, appointed by the Seigneur in 2000, but now elected by the 
default(one party) Chief Pleas members.  Lt. Col. Guille has displayed anything but neutrality in his role of speaker and has even been reprimanded by the Lt. Governor for his conduct;
default&#xa0;
default8
default              
defaultThe Seigneur continues to have considerable influence in addition to his actual powers.  He is the figurehead and rallying point for the people and viewpoints criticised by Lord McNally and, as noted above, he sits, unelected, in a dominant position in Chief Pleas making speeches from time to time which often set the tone for the entire meeting;
default&#xa0;
default9
default              
defaultSark is, in 
defaulttheory at least
default, governed by committees of Chief Pleas members, but those meetings are not open to the public nor are any minutes ever published.  The contrast with the way your own Committee works could not be starker;
default&#xa0;
default10
default              
defaultThe impression given is of government business being done behind closed doors and everything in Chief Pleas amounting to a 
defaultfait accompli
default, a problem identified by Belinda Crowe in her report
default, 
defaultGovernment of Sark, Administrative and Executive Support
default:
default&#xa0;
default"
defaultThe majority of detailed business is transacted not in Chief Pleas, but in its 16 committees.
default  
defaultCommittee meetings are not open to the public and the minutes are not published. Although final
default 
defaultpolicy decisions are made by Chief Pleas sitting in full session, and full minutes of those debates
default 
defaultare published, the lack of time for detailed debate, and the often lack of substance in the
default 
defaultexplanatory papers, creates an impression that policies are decided behind closed doors, that the
default 
defaultpublic have 
defaultlimited opportunity to input, and that many matters are voted through Chief Pleas ‘on
default 
defaultthe nod’.
default"
default&#xa0;
default11
default              
defaultOnly very brief reports supporting propositions are ever published prior to Chief Pleas meetings and then only a short time before those meetings (the last meeting's agenda was dated 4
defaultth
default September and the meeting held on 2
defaultnd
default October, the previous agenda was dated 5
defaultth
default June for a 3
defaultrd
default July meeting).  There is very seldom any active consultation on any proposition and very little time in which to make representations, let alone any prospect of having draft legislation amended in time for 
defaulta
default meeting; agendas commonly include draft legislation never seen before by the public and a
defaultre voted through at the meeting.  There is no equivalent to the various stages of a bill familiar to you and your colleagues of three readings, a committee stage a report stage and other pre-legislative scrutiny.  While this might be too much for a small assembly such as Sark, the present legislative process is wholly inadequate for true democracy to function;
default&#xa0;
default12
default              
defaultChief Pleas' rules of procedure are very brief and there is still no code of conduct for Conseillers, a basic register of interests is about to be adopted but the Seigneur and President have been exempted from having to make a return notwithstanding their status and influence in and over the assembly;
default&#xa0;
default13
default              
defaultThere is a perception that only those candidates acceptable to the establishment are ever elected.  Mr Delaney says that 
defaultConseillers
default are selected rather than elected
default.  This is again a function of the single and easily dominated constituency with no representation or protection of minority viewpoints
default;
default&#xa0;
default14
default              
defaultUltimately there are two conflicting systems of government on Sark, a still feudal establishment and the beginnings of a democratic system which cannot function properly because the feudal system remains largely intact, even to the extent of landholding remaining feudal.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Delaney also draws attention to the failure of Chief Pleas to implement the recommendations of Belinda Crowe's report 
defaultof May 2012 
default(beyond appointing a Senior Administrator) or the recommendations of Colin Kniveton's reports (a senior Isle of Man civil servant who was seconded to Sark temporarily)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNally commented critically on "some of the blogs that are alive in the island".  There is one principal such blog entitled "The blog of Ebenezer Le Page"
default.
default  I attach to this letter a copy of the posts relating to Lord McNally's evidence on a thread entitled "Listen up, Kevin".  The relevant sections have been highlighted for ease of reference.  Lord McNally is attacked as being

default".
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Delaney suspects that posters on the Blog include leading members of the Sark establishment.  One Conseiller openly 
defaultidentifies himself when posting and indeed another has taken recently to doing so also.  Blogs attacking Lord McNally have continued to the date of writing.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile Lord McNally was right to single out the blogs for criticism he made a serious error, in Mr Delan
defaultey's view, when commenting on the Sark Newsletter in the same breath and going so far as to suggest that it cease publication.  With all due respect to Lord McNally, the Sark Newsletter is a serious, weekly publication making serious political points and campaigning against precisely the same weaknesses and vested interests which Lord McNally identified in his own evidence.
default  It is the only opposition voice in Sark because there is none in Chief Pleas.  Mr Delaney makes no apology for its strident tone which reflects the treatment he has received at the 
defaulthands of the Sark establishment and the bitter refusal of the establishment to reform Sark.  Lord McNally himself admitted to having to twist arms even to have an election observer appointed and 
defaultnoted 
defaultthe delay it took even to 
defaulthave Sark 
defaultrespect an unappealed judgment of the English Court of Appeal
default on ECHR issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultNothing at all on Sark will change unless the feudal establishment is put under pressure.  If the Sark Newsletter ceased publication there would be no reforms.
default  Mr Delaney asserts his right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.  Such freedoms are especially important when under threat, as they are, in Sark.  Indeed a number of Conseillers and other members of the Sark establishment organised a march to his office with the intention of intimidating Mr Delaney into closing the Newsletter, something inconceivable in the United Kingdom.  It is precisely when unpopular views are being expressed that they most require protection.
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Delaney says that Sark will only be governed well and capable of 
defaultreceiving
default a clean bill of health (to adopt Lord McNally's words) when its constitution is reformed further to remove the still dominant feudal elements.  It cannot be consistent with good governance and true democracy to have a feudal lord with very real powers at the 
defaultheart of Sark's government and constitution
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Delaney asks that this letter be included in the evidence to your Committee.
default&#xa0;

defaultInteresting... Sark did very well to avoid politics for 450 years. The top line message is that Westminster generally does/did not have a clue about the workings of the CDs, and Ms Hannah (who seems like a thoroughly good egg) spends a lot of time educating politicians and fellow civil servants in the basics.
defaultAlbeit the basics are probably mostly that no one in Westminster (elected or feudally appointed) has any "authority" over the CDs, despite ideas to the contrary.
defaultAround 9.58 Tom admits he knew nothing of the various and complex constitutional relationships involved in the appointment when he was appointed for his 
defaultBuggin's
default Turn in 2010. 
defaultPlease everybody in Westminster keep this in mind when tempted to try and preach to Sark about democratic process and transparency.defaultTom sums it up: 
default"We don't want massive entanglements that we have then got to deal with..."
defaultRegarding Sark:- 
default"An island of 600 which in many ways is idyllic" "I don’t give Sark a clean bill of health" 
default"It has to provide a living for people... a future for young people... a working population...not enough empathy in the community ... see everyone as an enemy ... barriers to progress... find common ground"
defaultHe contrasts Sark Scribe 
default"bucolic"
default - Sark News Letter 
default"reports a fascist 1930s state"
default"future of Sark not in the past" "Take some of the poison on both sides out - see the blogs equally intolerant of the other point of view."
defaultDoes he mean 
defaultUS
default? Ahem your Lordship, there is no "intolerance" of the SEM 
default"point of view"
default, just the way they set about trying to impose it. Sark enjoys a good discussion - argument even - if conducted on a civil basis.
defaultIf Sark's community and stability comes under attack from aliens, then it is entitled to defend itself. (Did you ever see the TV show "V"..?)
defaultBut there 
defaultIS
default intolerance of the bullying methods of the SNL's threats of public and personal intimidation that are the key tactics of venal SNL propaganda. As further confirmed when that "point of view" joins us here for a discussion, when the crude taunts and obscenities appear.
defaultIf all we are doing is debating "points of view" then fine - but you should surely know (God help you and us if you still don't) - this is NOT about "points 
defaultif
default view" it is about an all-out assault on the democratically expressed wishes of the people by the Barclays' Bully Boys and intimidation by Big Money - with an agenda based on a lifetime of ruthlessly exploiting "distressed assets".
defaultAccept this reality, apologise for your limited comprehension of the reality, and we'll get along fine. But as long as you come across as out of your intellectual depth when attempting to analyse Sark 
default(gosh, am I really saying that?)
default there will remain a problem.

defaultNovember 7, 2013 at 1:19 PM
defaultAlthough the report comes over as reasonably well informed and balanced, I can just imagine how the SNL will selectively spin up comments like Sark not being given a "clean bill of health".
defaultAnd if Tom doesn't realise that, then he is an ever bigger impediment to resolving the "Sark solution" than we suspect.
defaultOverall, he confirms that the will of the people actually means nothing when set against the expectations and pressures of "rights" crusading the 21st century busybodies to conform to the same sort of minority government systems that have seen the UK, EU and US, all but collapse.
default&#xa0;
defaultA defaultnonnydefault mouse defaultNovember 7, 2013 at 1:42 PM
defaultIt does seem to further confirm the view that in the effort to avoid a showdown with the Barclays "at all costs", the 
defaultRt
default Hon Lord Tom McNally is erring on the side of political expedience to cover his own estimable arse and that of the MoJ, rather than fight Sark's corner as it should be fought.
defaultI enjoyed 
defaultCathryn
default Hannah's performance as Tom McNally's 
default"Reverend 
defaultNoot
default"
default and would like to have heard more from her, as she is doubtless our key contact with Westminster and follows the plot very closely.
defaultShe must know as well as anyone in Westminster that if the Barclays were to knock the SNL on the head, absolutely everything changes and a constructive relationship can begin to form. Even better if Delaney were to be given the challenge to open a new Barclay hotel in Afghanistan - where his brand of diplomacy would ensure him a brief tour of duty.

defaultVideo from 10:35 ...
defaultHe admits the election observer was a sop to the SNL's extreme interference because he wanted to "avoid having election where immediately afterwards there would be cries of foul". 
defaultAnd then Lord Tom can "see the attraction of a quieter, more leisurely, more certain way..." ..?
defaultWell then, if the people of Sark want it, and vote for it, exactly who are you to deny it?
defaultAnonymous defaultNovember 7, 2013 at 8:21 PM
defaultIt was significant that Tom summarised the situation as stasis v progress and it took an intervention from Sir Alan 
defaultBeith
default to point out that it is actually the people of Sark (as represented by Chief Pleas) v the Barclays.
defaultSparkydefault defaultNovember 7, 2013 at 9:04 PM
defaultThe SNL is very annoying, but it'd hard to be too upset with it when the UK government minister with responsibility for Crown Dependencies says (at 28.48) 
default"When I say the dependencies are governed well, I make an exception in the case of Sark. I don't give Sark a clean bill of health".
defaultAre the Barclays secretly in league with the government? Making lots of trouble to distract us so we meekly accept this power-hungry government?
defaultAnonymous defaultNovember 7, 2013 at 9:56 PM
defaultLord Tom made a very BIG error of misjudgement when he said that. It will haunt him for a long time. He has grotesquely overstepped the mark and exceeded his remit.
defaultHe talks dismissively about the retirement community - it is high time the old fraud joined one himself.
defaultAnonymous defaultNovember 7, 2013 at 11:46 PM
defaultI disagree. I think he got right. 
defaultFar from 'exceeding his remit', he fulfilled it exactly. 
defaultAnd he was also right about the 'landed gentry'. The basic problem with our government is that it's full of retired people who don't even remember what the word 'Economy' means.
defaultAnd I expect you are one of them.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolitician, retire thyself...defaultNovember 7, 2013 at 10:55 PM
defaultMcNally's constant pejorative reference to Sark's retirement community are ironic on several levels, not least because he could do us all a favour and retire himself. 
default"His" government has somehow got away with raising UK retirement ages, whilst destroying any value of savings returns. How did they pull this off and reduce expectations of the entire British population without an insurrection? In fact, the UK has accepted it all amazingly meekly, as if we all expected to have to pay for Labour's calamitous mismanagement of the economy one day.
defaultOK, so even though that was the consequence of the previous Labour administration's 13 years of cynical vote buying spree - while it also set about destroying the fabric of British society - nonetheless, it ill behoves Tom (an unelected feudal Lord) to take a pop at Sark's residents in quite such a glib and inflammatory manner.
defaultI suggest we all write to Sir Alan 
defaultBeith
default and tell him he needs to press for Lord McNally's replacement ASAP. If we have to have a UK government interface, then Lady 
defaultCathryn
default Hannah would probably do a better job.
defaultRabdefault defaultNovember 8, 2013 at 11:06 AM
default@8.23am Why are you keen to dismiss this line of thought with an emotive taunt like "deluded"? What is your perspective beyond insulting postings?
defaultThe UK is pivotal. A UK government dept lead by (elected by no one on Sark) Jack Straw caused the present situation; a UK government appointee (elected by no one anywhere) is opining and offering limited credibility to the SNL's vision of an invasion by the 1st Funicular Panzer Division of Delaney's 4th Reich.
defaultUnderstanding the UK government and how it got where it is, why it is obliged to configure itself as a political pantomime horse of many disparate parts, remains a very large part of managing Sark's challenge.
defaultToday's news that Nick Clegg (Lord Tom's party boss) now has a office staff paid by UK taxpayers of 20 - for a fundamental subversive role that is about as useful as teats on a bull - confirms we are dealing with people who do not think much like Sark's embattled long suffering 
defaulttriers
default.
defaultAnonymous defaultNovember 8, 2013 at 2:53 PM
defaultThe Right Honourable Lord Tom McNally is a career politician - the very epitome of a Westminster Journeyman - rewarded from public funds, and thus he willingly presents himself for the sort of examination that Sark's volunteers do not.
defaultPlease read him up, and then tell us what has ever occurred in his past to suggest that he has any relevance to the role he presently occupies.

defaultSNL259: Unacceptably unacceptable - 1defaultNovember 8, 2013 at 3:57 PM
defaultPart  1
defaultAs the crescendo builds towards the next election (has anyone put Ban 
defaultKi
default-Moon on standby teller-duty yet?) the SNL repeats the repeats of its call to change the constitution to one that the Barclays can own and operate without tedious interference by Sark's pesky voters.
defaultHe laughingly stirs his reader with such revolutionary concepts as 
default"a parliament of the people by the people for the people"
defaultWhat he 
defaultactually
default means is 
default"a compliant collection of yes-people who do what I tell them"
defaultYet again he fails to explain why a civil servant should have the casting vote in Sark's "Upper Chamber". I just wish Kath Jones would speak up NOW and tell him to count her out, please, because that is not in her remit.
defaultOr is it?
default After McNally's faltering performance at the Justice Committee on November 5th, we should count nothing out.
defaultMostly though, the notion that a failed "entrepreneur" and an over-presumptive failed manipulator of Sark's legal process, Kevin, knows better than 
defaultReg
default 
defaultGuille
default on matters of Sark and its long term issues of governance, is risible.
defaultAs we all expected, McNally's naive Justice Committee folly is spun like a top to mean what Kevin wants it to mean. If McNally was not regarded as an idiot before this, I trust there are few left who cannot see he is unfit for purpose?
defaultKD suggests 
default"Nowhere else in the world does anyone "long" for feudalism."
default Sark does not "long for feudalism", per se, it longs for a return to stability and civility based on 450 years of experience, and freedom from your type of harassment based on crudely wielded wealth that intimidates Crown ministers and forces them to admit they cow-tow to the threats you make. Any connection with "feudalism" seems to be incidental!
defaultSo, Your 
defaultLordhip
default, it is my sad duty to confirm the other views expressed herein, that it is time to make your excuses and go. The current SNL is clear evidence that you have directly interfered in ways that Sir Alan 
defaultBeith
default (who was at least elected by someone, somewhere) deplored.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultUnacceptably unacceptable - 2defaultNovember 8, 2013 at 3:58 PM
default2 ...
defaultKev
default goes on:
default"Lord McNally, you should know that without The Sark Newsletter there would be no opposition voice in Sark, no one to make the points, however forcefully, that you yourself take and make, there would be no pressure for change and nothing to hold to account the sick and unfit government of Sark you have identified."
defaultWell, His Lordship appears to know of 
defaultEbeneezer
default - albeit he has the curious idea that we are "intolerant". Eh? Explain yourself? The only intolerance expressed in here seems to come from barely literate SEM stooges. Please do not confuse SNL-style intolerance with 
defaultEb
default-style disagreement.
defaultWhatever, if Tom continues to read (and even post) here, he will find this is the 
defaultproperly
default free press, where all views are expressed - robustly - without redaction or editorial interference. Where anyone can then read and form their own views of the warring factions and decide who is actually representing the core ethos of Sark and its important traditions that determine the character of the entire island and its people.
defaultBut other than the above, 
defaultI of course agree with everything Kevin says. Sark plainly needs an economy, driven by people willing to take decisions, and thus it needs leadership.default So please get on with something, Chief Pleas - starting by telling a certain Lord to butt out..? 
defaultDelaney-Dawes has come a long way since the pantomimes of 
defaultdoctorgate
default and 
defaultchoppergate
default - but they have yet to learn that they needs to drop all the personal assaults, and concentrate purely on what they are going to do for the economy, stupid. Which is very risky, because all the evidence still seems to be that 
defaultSiH
default/SEM is a failed seasonal business on an island with an unpredictable climate, where it needs to own the government in order to change the rules - to see if undoing much of what makes and keeps Sark unique, will help rescue it. So please just go away, KD, and allow someone with manners, charm and empathy take on the task. We would LOVE to work constructively with your investments - and the good people you employ - to make Sark the success that it will one day become, once you are gone.

defaultThe pointless (and very poorly executed) Crowe report serial is a mystery - the only explanation can be that KD is still crawling up the MoJ fundament 
defaultso that Tom continues to hand out 
defaultspinnable
default quotes. 
defaultHey 
defaultEb
default, maybe is we serialised the Magna 
defaultCarta
default McNally would be less negative about our role in this vibrant debate..?
defaultHere we have an itinerant civil servant from the age of Blair - with a few days familiarity of Sark; a charmless Essex carpenter and self-styled messiah, and a reformed alcoholic PR man - all apparently in cahoots to undo the work of 448 years experience of operating a successful community.

default&#xa0;
defaultRemember defaultKilbrandondefault, Lord Tomdefault defaultNovember 10, 2013 at 2:06 PM
defaultI apologise in advance for the length of this post (in two parts), but may be time we “serialised” aspects of 
defaultKilbrandon
default and subsequent reports to help educate the present MoJ in the circumstances of the matters where Lord McNally has unfortunately intervened.
defaultThe 
defaultRt
default Hon Lord Tom McNally, who appears to have no legal training, seems to have made a substantial error of judgement and exceeded 
defaulthi
default brief. 
defaultSince McNally is "pure politicians" to his fingertips, it is necessary to explore the political antipathy widely and loudly expressed by Lord McNally’s party (
defaultLibDem
default) towards the Channel Isles over the years. Like all socialists they would prefer government to gather and spend the wealth that others create, and people like Vince Cable have made no secret of this fact. At no time bothering to acknowledge that they have NO democratic involvement in the government of the Channel Isles – but treating them much as if they are a subservient part of an empire controlled from Westminster, in which they find themselves with some power to meddle at last. Much to their own amazement... and our horror.
defaultLet's look at the background:
defaultJustice Committee report March 2010
default see Section 3 – Good Government :-
defaultKilbrandondefault Report, defaultparadefault 1361 default“There is a high degree of consensus amongst academics, legal advisors, 
defaultpoliticians and officials about the meaning of the term “good government” used in the 
defaultKilbrandon
default Report.49 They agree that good government would only be called into question in the most serious of circumstances, exemplified by the recent events in Turks and Caicos which did, indeed, lead to UK Government intervention. Such circumstances are likely to include a fundamental breakdown in public order or endemic corruption in the government, legislature or judiciary. 
defaultIf police officers conspiring to bring down a Cabinet Minister – and then remaining defiant despite being exposed to public ridicule in parliamentary committee questions - does not amount to a 
defaultbreak down
default of law and order, then what does? It was an act of brass-necked defiance straight from the pages of the SNL.
default” We think that the United Kingdom Government and Parliament ought to be very slow to seek to impose their will on the Islands merely on the grounds that they know better than the Islands what is good for them.”
defaultWith superb irony, the report continues…
defaultSome people have argued that certain events, such as those arising out of the historic child abuse inquiry in Jersey, are serious enough to warrant intervention in insular affairs by the UK Government
defaultThree words and an acronym: “Sir Jimmy defaultSaviledefault” and “BBC” defaultthe Crown Dependencies are democratic, self-governing communities with free media and open debate
defaultAnd now there is the aftermath of the 
defaultLeveson
default report that may lead to an unprecedented scope for muzzling of the British Press by political intervention. (
defaultOfcom
default has always hobbled broadcast media and is seeking to the same to internet).
defaultAnd then I noted that the MoJ 2010 report cites statistics for the CDs drawn from

default”[46] …although Sark now has a democratically elected government which is judged to comply with international human rights obligations by both the Justice Secretary and the Supreme Court60, a question mark has been placed over its continued ability to function properly. When we visited Sark, we were told of the considerable economic and political power exercised by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay. They are major employers on Sark and 
defaultown a considerable amount of land and businesses there. It follows that the livelihoods of many Sark’s people depend on them
default[47] This was amply demonstrated by the events which followed the first democratic election on Sark in December 2008. In the poll, all but two of the Barclays’ publicly preferred candidates for election to Chief Pleas were rejected, whereas nine of the successful candidates had, prior to the election, appeared on the brothers’ published list of candidates described as “dangerous to Sark’s future”. The following day, the Barclays closed down a number of businesses they owned and stopped their building projects on the Island. As many as 140 (estimates differ) of the 600 inhabitants were out of work until the Barclays reopened most of their businesses a few weeks later.
default[48] We were also told that the Barclays were engaged in a long-running battle of attrition with individuals, particularly Members of Chief Pleas, whereby the Barclays repeatedly instructed their lawyers to write to individuals demanding retractions or apologies in order to protect their interests and reputation. We were told that such legal action rarely comes to court because the Islanders involved often cannot afford to defend themselves and simply capitulate, however unwillingly. We have not tested these allegations in evidence and we do not intend to take sides or make judgement on these issues. 
default[49] As a matter of general principle, we note that, in a very small jurisdiction, there must always be the possibility that individuals wielding very significant economic, legal and political power may skew the operation of democratic government there. Just as the establishment of democratic government in Sark was a matter of good government, any threat to the ability of that system to operate fairly and robustly has the potential to raise good government issues which might require UK Government intervention. This is a matter on which the Ministry of Justice needs to keep a watching brief. 
defaultThere is a great deal more still to address in that report concerning the conflicts and contradictions that would be a better use of McNally’s time. No wonder he finds meddling in Sark’s complex situation to be a useful displacement activity. 
defaultIt remains plain that Westminster makes the rules up to suit itself, and then administers them – and then holds forth in judgement with a panel of parliamentarians who have had no time been subject to selection by any form of democratic process based in those Islands, whose fate they control. 
defaultGiven the way Sark has been fed through the mangle of the SNL’s hysterical accusations concerning the independence of judiciary and administration, McNally's 
defaultMoJ’s
default position of policy provider - judge - jury - executioner - 
defaultopiner
default - is precarious at best, but most likely, sheer hypocrisy. 
defaultGood Luck Ms Hannah, your clumsy boss has made your task - and ours - more difficult. 
defaultWhy not remind him that Sark's very active retirement community would be pleased to welcome a new member. He could even test our democratic process and stand for Chief Pleas!

defaultOnly on Sark!defaultDoes Lord McNally really believe that Sark is a democracy when one man has the power to prevent the Island from having an economy and a future by continually disrupting civic life with a generously funded campaign of misdirection and innuendo?
defaultOr can Lord McNally point to any functioning democracy anywhere in which citizens who dare criticise the main economic force are instantly vilified and subjected to harassment, intimidation, bullying, threats of economic violence, ecological vandalism and other 
defaulthalfwitted
default acts until they fall in line with the commercial line as dictated by an unelected Managing Director?
defaultHow on earth can there not be UK government intervention when those who ruin a British Crown Dependency behave like this, Lord McNally? The Island of Sark needs help. How much longer must we wait before we get it?

defaultThe Crown/ MOJ has no power to intervene in Sark unless there is a gross failure of governance which as the Crowe Report on Governance clearly states is not the case. 
defaultThe MOJ excluding the politicians like McNally, do their best to support in 
defaultthe areas that they can or are invited to.
default Defending petitions, judicial reviews and high/supreme court actions. The latter's judgement of course is always disregarded by KD in his vitriolic attacks on the fief holder. But then KD never confuses facts with the vitriolic

defaultSark would provide an ideal retreat for the more contemplative aspects of the Chinese psyche. Plus they respect their elders rather more than most, and probably would not continuously feel the need to refer them in dismissively pejorative and negative terms.
defaultAlbeit coming from a 70 year old feudal "Lord" who is "bed-blocking" parliament and keeping out younger talent, such glib dismissals are amusingly ironic
