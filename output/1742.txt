&#xa0;Written evidence from Michelle Levy (TIC 077)&#xa0;My name is Michelle Levy and I am writing with regard to the new committee set up to deal with the problem of public transport in rural communites, 'passengers transport in isolated communites'. My community/village is one of those.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I live in a village in north Cornwall called St. Newlyn East it's located 4 miles from Newquay yet it might as well be in outerspace the way our local government views it.&#xa0; There is a major road, the 3075 which divides our village which&#xa0; when coming from Newquay is on the&#xa0;left while two villages Cubert and Crantock which is on the right side of this main road enjoy a better bus service then we do.&#xa0; There buses run every half hour and they also enjoy an evening service up to mid-night and also a Sunday service while our village has only an hourly service finishing at 1645 from Newquay and from Truro 1810.&#xa0; We do not have even a Sunday bus service and our village is the same size if not bigger then the two above mentioned villages.&#xa0; There is also a similar bus service which runs from Mitcheal a village only 2 miles from ours.&#xa0; They in fact have two different bus companies serving them and they too enjoy an evening and Sunday service.&#xa0; And they are much smaller then oursleves.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is even a bus service in Zela a little hamlet with less then a quarter of the popluation then Newlyn&#xa0;East.&#xa0;&#xa0; They in fact have a bus service every half hour.&#xa0;I think it disgusting that we as concil tax payers should have to pay concil tax to subsidise these villages that enjoy a much better service then we do.&#xa0;They say our route is not viabley commercial, well neither is&#xa0;the other villages.&#xa0; The only time Cubert and Crantock are busy&#xa0;is in the summer months of&#xa0;June, July and August.&#xa0; The rest of the year they get the same amount of people getting on them as we do yet there service never alters.&#xa0;Many times the early buses do not turn up-they are supposed to start the service going to&#xa0;Truro&#xa0;from our village at 0710.&#xa0; Yet on several occasions the 0710, 0810 and the 0910 never turned up and there&#xa0;were people waiting to get to work, college, doctors and dentist appointment and even jury duty.&#xa0; Many young people have left our village because&#xa0;when they get&#xa0;a job they have to leave it or else they are sacked because they&#xa0;can't get to work on time.&#xa0;What the use of having a bus service which cannot be relied on.&#xa0; A timetable&#xa0;is a legal contract between the passenger and the bus company.&#xa0; They can't just say they don't have a bus to put on because then they become in breach of contract.&#xa0;The fares to get to Truro are £4.50 for an adult and around £2.90 for a child.&#xa0; If a young mothert had to go shopping in the city she would have to pay £7.40 just to pick up the essentials and she is not even sure that a bus will turn up to take her!!&#xa0;I am a pensioner and&#xa0;I have to wait on&#xa0;1010 bus, but many times this bus doesn't turn up or if it does turn&#xa0;up it's full.&#xa0;&#xa0; They give priorty to the people in Newquay.&#xa0; The bus company wouldn't even think to save maybe five spaces for us.&#xa0; I once asked an offical&#xa0;who works for Western Greyhound the bus company that servies our village, why don't they do this so atleast some of us would have a change to get on the bus&#xa0;and there answer was that the people at Newquay would then have to wait another 45 minutes for a bus well what about us, we would have to wait for an hour!&#xa0;&#xa0; But he didn't seem to care.&#xa0; Why should he, he lives in Newquay.&#xa0;&#xa0;I was waiting for the 1010 to show up&#xa0;and when it did it was full.&#xa0; &#xa0;There were 9 people plus myself waiting to get on the bus.&#xa0; It was a freezing morning in March&#xa0; most of the people waiting were between 70-85 years of age and one man had to make a hospital appointemt to be examined for an empending heart operation.&#xa0; This man was inferm&#xa0;and had trouble standing up for too long even with a can you can see he was shaking from the strain of standing up and waiting for this bus.&#xa0; You could tell he was in pain but he was old and sick and too tired to fight the bus company so he turned and walked away stooped, dejected. &#xa0; Probably going home to&#xa0;call the hospital and tell them he can't&#xa0;make his appointment again because he had to cancel the week&#xa0;before for the same reason.&#xa0;This is not an islocated insident it happens on a regular basis.&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;PEOPLE DEPEND ON THE BUSES TO GET TO WORK, COLLEGE, ATTEND DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT AND EVEN JURY DUTY.&#xa0; THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE A LIFE AND THE BUS COMPANY IS DESTROYING IT FOR MANY.&#xa0;&#xa0; OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE JOBS AND ARE FORCED TO LEAVE TO VILLAGE.&#xa0; WHEN BUSES DON'T TURN UP PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO TAKE TAXIES AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET REIMBURED BY THE BUS COMPANIES.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
