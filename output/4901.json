"              \n              \nDAR 08\n          Non-attributable note from a development professional on business caes'Business cases are too intricate and require too many different people to be involved in their completion.  The origin of the more complex business case is in the increased emphasis on results introduced by the coalition government.  \nWhile the results emphasis is positive\n,\n the w\nay it is being processed is not, and is in fact helping prevent the achievement of results.\nIt is the combination of the \nunwieldy business case and the requirement for Secretary of State approval for virtually every spending decision that causes the most difficulty. Officials are very nervous about documents that are seen by the Minister. They will seek to ensure that these documents are as near perfection as possible.  Many more officials in the decision-making chain get involved in reviewing the documents.  Drafts are sent back to be redone. \nApp\nendices are pour\ned over and revised.  Language is tightened.\nIn one case, which took over 9 months from completion of original business case to approval, officials were commenting on each other’s comments and holding up review of the next drafts because they were on holiday. \nThis happens all too often. Of course those commenting often don’t understand the details of the proposal \nbecause they are remote from it, thus causing confusion which \nthen \nneeds to be cleared up.\nThen in some circumstances the Secretary of State asks a question because she doesn’t understand some aspect, and a whole new flurry of activity starts.\nThere is in fact a second round of Secretary of State approvals, relating to contracts.  Every contr\nact or contract amendment \nabove £1m has to go to Secretary of State for approval.   So one spending programme may go through three or four or \nmore \nSecretary of State approvals – at business case, at contract approval and at approval of one or more amendments. \nAgain this involves substantial delays, as associated paperwork is prepared and argued over by officials. Procurement staff spend months disputing costs and quarrelling over minutiae. If contract amendments are involved, the delays can be very damaging.  Funding runs out and project teams have to be stood down. \nThis hurts DFID’s reputation as a reliable and credible organisation. Counterparts have been promised assistance and are astounded when it stops.  \nTheir own credibility is\n sometimes also undermined. \nMomen\ntum is lost. Restarting activities is inevitably more costly.\n&#xa0;\nA key aspect of the \noverall \nproblem are the disincentives provided to DFID staff \nby the heavy \nand time-consuming procedures.  It’s always more difficult to find the dog that didn’t bark, but there will be many valuable initiatives that have not been started because DFID staff either could not summon the enthusiasm or have the time to fill in all the necessary paperwork\n, or realised that the whole process would take so long as to make it futile.\n In many circumstances an intervention needs to be done quickly if it is to be at all effective.\n Intricate project description and approval requirements\n mean that action cannot be taken quick\nly, thus it is\n often not attempted at all.\n DFID’s \nreputation for \nspeed and flexibility is being lost.\nIt has been said by some DFID staff that there are so many procedures these days that no-one knows what they are. This creates a natural hesitancy to proceed on behalf of some staff.  In some \ncircumstances staff don't go ahead with an activity because they imagine that a procedure prevents it when in fact this is not so. All this leads to climate of conservatism\n and cautiousness, where the\n least risk\ny\n course seems the most attractive.\n \nThe solution is to (a) \ngreatly streamline project preparation activities\n and (b) remove the requirement \nfor Secretary of State approval, except in the case of very large or very politically sensitive spending \nprogrammes.\n \nDFID staff should be trusted to take decisions.\n&#xa0;\n"
