"UKR 39Roger Wade is CEO of Boxpark Shoreditch, the World’s 1\nst\n Pop Up Mall. Boxpark has successfully rebuilt a High Street in Hackney, London, and\n has\n a unique mix of\n Events,\n Indep\nendent brands and \nPop Up Retailers. \nThe Government sho\nuld be encouraging pop up units across Britain\n and offering business rates relief for qualifying small business tenants\n. This is potentially a sustainable solution to revitalising our empty high streets.\n Pop ups are the future breeding\n ground for next gene\nration of Independent R\netailers.\nWe recommend a qualifying small business tenant can claim up to 3 months rate\ns\n relief once per calendar year. The qualifying business could be administered by\n an\n I\nndepende\nnt Pop U\np organisation like We A\nre Pop Up\n, Appear \nHere, Pop Up Britain\n or \nsimilar body.\n \nThe current business rates relief scheme allows landlords to qualify for up to\n 3 months rates relief if they \nlet empty units BUT the small business tenants are sti\nll responsible for paying rates if the rateable value \nis above £6000. \nThis sys\ntem is totally one sided\n because it does not encourage small businesses to rent empty shops.\n \nThe suggested scheme encourages both the landlord and tenant to fill empty units. \nThe \nlong-term\n objective i\ns to encourage small\n business\nes\n to trial pop up stores.\n \nAfter a \n3-month\n period the tenant will be then liable for \ncommercial \nrent\nal terms\n and business rates.\nThe benefits are the following; the smal\nl business tenant can test out \nbusiness\n concepts at relatively low set up costs. The land\nlord can fill empty units and qualify for up to 3 months business rates relief and hopefully develop a \nlong-term\n tenant. The government can f\nill empty stores and hopefully \nafter 3 months generate \nlong-term\n business rates. \nPlease find a link below to an In\ndepend\nent \n&#xa0;\nPetition \n supporting our suggested scheme.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/boxpark-pop-up-business-rates-relief-proposal\n2. Digital Marketplace: Create a \nDigital Marketplace \nfor small independent retailers, allowing customers\n to view all products available on \nthe\n high street\n/town centre\n, and to \nbuy or share products \nin store\n, online or mobile.\n3. Digital High Street: Provide free public \nWi-Fi\n on our High Street and Town Centres\n, allowi\nng customers to use their mobiles to browse \nand locate local Independent \nstores and develop \nan\n email \ndatabase of local visitors, c\nreating a connected community of retailers and customers.\nThe aim of this Box\npark proposal is to develop three complementary, and sustainable \ninititives\n which if successful could be applied to High Streets\n and Town Centres \nacross Britain. \nThe business rates relief will encourage small independents to fill empty stores and reduce th\ne\n high cost of starting a retail business\n. \nOnce the retailers have started we need to help them develop their business \nand compete in this Digital age, by \ndevelop\ning\n a digital \nmarketplace\n of connected local independent retailers\n. \nFinally we need to connect\n with the customer\n, and develop free Wi-Fi on the H\nigh \nStreet, allowing customers to view\n \nlocal \nproducts available, and buy or share products instore, online or mobile.\nBoxpark are prepared to run a\n pilot scheme on a not for profit basis, and work with\n the\n \nShoreditch Digital \nC\no\nmmunity, Hackney Council, \nGLA\n \nor Government\n to develop these\n \ninitiatives further.\n&#xa0;\nROGER WADECEO, BOXPARK LTDWWW.BOXPARK.CO.UK\n&#xa0;\nRoger \nWade is\n the Founder and ex owner of British Street Fashion brand, Boxfresh.
