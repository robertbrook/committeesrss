"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nBiblioFox\n Research (HSR 033)\n&#xa0;\n1. \nBiblioFox\n Research is a research consultancy established in 2000. We specialise in document-based research and archival research and have recently been \ninvestigating the implications of the HS2 business case for existing intercity services on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines.\n&#xa0;\n2. \nIn our opinion \nthere is a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the HS2 strategic case.  This concerns pla\nn\ns\n to divert \nnorth-south \nintercity travellers to HS2 \nservices\n and remove \na high number of \n‘classic’ \n(\ni.e\n \ntraditional\n)\n intercity services from \nthe \nexisting \nnorth-south \nlines\n, \nthus \nfreeing those lines \nfor more commuter, regional and freight services.  We \nexp\nlain \nthis contradiction below.\n&#xa0;\n3. On the one hand, the Government says its aim is that “all towns and cities which currently have a direct service to London will retain broadly comparable or better services once HS2 is completed”\n (Strategic C\nase, 4.2.6).\n \nOn the other, it proposes that long distance services are diverted onto HS2, freeing capacity on the existing network for new services (\nStrateg\nic C\nase, Executive Summary, \npara\n 57). \n Figure 10 (\nStrategic Case \np.24) shows how, with HS2 taking \nresponsibility \nfor \nmost long-distance services, the number of commuter services into Euston can be increased greatly. \n \nThe same figure shows\n, \nthough, \nthat this comes through a \nmassive reduction in classic intercity \nservices\n.\n&#xa0;\n4. While it might be assumed that many passen\ngers travelling between cities \nsuch as Manchester, Birmingham and London \nwill be happy to use HS2 services instead of the classic intercity services that \nHS2\n will replace, \nHS2 cannot – by its nature – \nexactly \nreplicate the current north-south intercity \ntimetables on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Line\ns\n.  It will call at far fewer stations than current intercity services. If classi\nc intercity services are reduce\nd in number, the \ntowns and cities \nnot served by HS2 trains, such as Stoke-on-Trent\n, Wilmslow and Stockport on the WCML, Leicester on the MML\n,\n and Wakefield and Doncaster on the ECML, will \nalmost certainly \nface \nreduction\ns\n in \ndirect services to London.\n&#xa0;\n5. Despite the Government’s claim that all towns and cities currently with direct serv\nices to London should receive broadly comparable or better services, and that decisions on future services will be taken nearer the time, its own business case for HS2 \nis predicated on \nsignificant \nsavings \nbeing made through \nreductions in \nintercity services\n on existing lines. \nThese \n‘\nclassic line \nsavings’ \nare a fundamental part of the business case, yet do not appear to be mentioned in the \nStrategic Case document.  They may be found instead in \nThe Economic Case for HS2 \n(October 2013) at\n \nhttp://assets.hs2.org.uk/sites/default/files/inserts/S%26A%201_Economic%20case_0.pdf\n (Table 9). This reveals that \nsavings of £8.2 billion are being \nused to \noffset \npart of \nthe pr\nedicted cost of operating HS2, thus reducing the ‘headline’ \noperating cost\n.  The \nactual cost of operating the full HS2 network over the 60 year appraisal period is calculated to be £30,408 million.  Offset against this are savings from reductions in spendi\nng on the existing \nlins\n of £8,265 million (savings on staff, electricity, diesel, lease costs, maintenance etc). This gives a headline figure \nfor the cost of operating HS2 \nof £22,143.  It is this latter figure that is used in the \nHS2 business case benefit-\ncost ratio (\nBCR\n)\n.  If all these classic savings were not to materialise, the BCR would \nof course \nbe \nsignificantly \nlower.\n&#xa0;\n6. The reductions in classic line intercity services that \nmake up \nth\nose \n£8.2 billion \nof savings \nmay be found in \nHS2 Ltd’s report \nPFM \nV.4.3 Assumptions report\n \nhttp://assets.hs2.org.uk/sites/default/files/inserts/S%26A%2020_PFM%20assumptions%20report.pdf\n(section 6.4).  Comparing\n the proposed classic line \nintercity \nservice patterns with today’s intercity services revea\nls that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7. In conclusion, the Government’s claim that no towns and cities will face worse services to London appears t\no be in conflict with its incorporation of £8.2 billion of classic line savings into the business case for HS2.  Without the\nse\n savings, the HS2 BCR will fall\n significantly\n, but with them, it will be \nextremely \ndifficult, we believe, to maintain \nthe level\ns\n of service \nto \nusers of \ncurrent intercity services\n to London\n that the Government claims is their aim\n.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
