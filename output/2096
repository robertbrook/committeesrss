defaultAsylum Support Appeals Project (ASAP) – Written evidencedefaultASAP is a legal advice charity specialising in asylum support law. It was set up in 2003 with the aim of reducing the destitution of asylum seekers by protecting their legal rights to food and shelter. ASAP runs a 
defaultpro bono
default representation scheme, called the Duty Scheme, at the First-tier Tribunal (Asylum Support) (the Tribunal). The Duty Scheme operates daily and appellants are assisted by ASAP staff and around 30 volunteer solicitors and barristers. In 2012 we represented in 455 cases, just over half the number of appellants with oral hearings.  ASAP also provides training on asylum support law to voluntary sector agencies and runs a telephone advice line. We seek to influence asylum support policy through research, lobbying and strategic litigation.
