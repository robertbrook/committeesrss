[normal]Those prohibitions, set out in the Competition Act 1998 (CA98)
[normal]3 
[normal]and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)
[normal]4 
[normal]apply to the conduct of all '
[normal]undertakings
[normal]'. 
[normal]In making this assessment, it is the nature of the particular activity being conducted that is key, not the legal form, or public or private sector status, of the body that carries it out. Thus, a body – including a public body – may be an undertaking (and therefore subject to competition law) in respect of some of its activities, but not others.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]It is also important to note that this 'functional' approach means that a public body may act as an undertaking – and therefore be subject to competition law – in respect of some of its activities, but not in respect of others
