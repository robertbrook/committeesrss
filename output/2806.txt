&#xa0;Written evidence from the Highways Agency (WRT 013)&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Highways Agency is responsible for the strategic road network in England, covering more than 4,300 miles of motorways and trunk roads.  The Agency delivers a robust winter service that has been developed over a number of years, with significant improvements introduced following previous reviews and lessons learned.  The Agency is well prepared for winter weather.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Resilience of the Strategic Road Network]]]&#xa0;2.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensuring resilience of the strategic road network is a challenge during times of severe weather, especially as weather conditions can be unpredictable and change quickly.  High traffic volumes and congestion, particularly at peak times, can make keeping the network open during severe weather difficult.  However, this is what the Agency aims to achieve and it has done so consistently over recent years with only very isolated problems at times of exceptionally extreme weather.&#xa0;2.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Following a spell of particularly cold and snowy weather in mid-late January 2013 the RAC Foundation commissioned a review into how highway authorities coped with the conditions.  The report, entitled ‘Ploughing On: A review of highway resilience in Winter 2013’, also considered the response to the further heavy snow in March, which was the coldest for 51 years.  The report commented that “…the Highways Agency responded well to the recent periods of snow and ice”.  It also concluded that, due to the implementation of the recommendations from various reviews, there is much stronger underlying resilience than was the case in 2009-10.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ and Changes Made]]]&#xa0;2.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the most significant changes made since the winter of 2009-10 has been the establishment of a strategic salt stockpile, which has substantially increased the resilience of salt stocks.  This has been delivered by the Highways Agency in conjunction with the Department, following the recommendations of the Independent Review of England’s Transport System in Winter (2010).  Over 500,000 tonnes of salt were imported into England in the winter of 2010-11 which helped to provide resilience at a time of widespread salt shortage.  Since then, the Agency has continued to maintain strategic stockpiles amounting to 425,000 tonnes, of which 120,000 tonnes (representing 6.7 capability days) are allocated for the strategic road network and around 305,000 tonnes held for local authorities. The strategic stockpile will only be used as a last resort in the event that domestic salt supplies are unable to meet demand, and as such continues to play a key role in ensuring a high level of resilience in national salt stocks.&#xa0;2.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Highways Agency has implemented many other improvements since the winter of 2009-10, based on a robust lessons learned process and implementation of the recommendations from winter resilience reviews including the Transport Select Committee report ‘Keeping the UK Moving: The Impact on Transport of the Winter Weather in December 2010’.  The improvements made have also taken knowledge and learning gained from our active role on the winter service technical committee of the World Road Association together with our partnership agreement with the Netherlands and Belgium. In addition we share experiences and lessons nationally with transport operators of other modes including National Rail, Transport for London and airports.  Improvements include:&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; New Winter Fleet&#xa0;Completion (in June 2010) of the roll-out of the Agency’s new fleet of 437 specialised winter service vehicles. These spread pre-wetted salt which acts more quickly and stays on the road longer, delivering a more effective and sustainable treatment. The vehicles are all equipped with data logging systems which, in addition to GPS location information, record vehicle speed, salt spread rates, ploughing condition and other vehicle operating conditions.&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Salt Stock Management&#xa0;Improvements to operational salt stock management, resilience and monitoring has taken place, allowing early identification of salt stock issues.  The Agency’s stock monitoring system is also used by the Department and local highway authorities to give a better full national picture.&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Severe Weather Plans&#xa0;The Agency’s severe weather plans, which our service providers are required to complete each year for each area, have undergone substantial revision. Improvements include the identification of vulnerable locations on the network, which are particularly susceptible to disruption from severe weather. Key transport hubs such as Heathrow and Manchester airports are considered in the preparation of the plans. Mitigation plans are in place to deal with problems at these locations and may include measures such as pre-positioning of salt spreaders with ploughs, traffic officer and heavy recovery vehicles, multi-agency response arrangements (police and local authorities) and contingency plans. An example is the multi-agency response plan in place for the A38 Haldon Hill and A328 Telegraph Hill in Devon, just south of Exeter, which was successfully implemented several times during the 2012-13 winter season.&#xa0;Further improvements made to the severe weather plans include the provision of guidance for treating the network in extreme cold conditions and additional measures to ensure the resilience of Agency depots.&#xa0;d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Highways Agency Weather Information Service&#xa0;For the 2012-13 winter season the Agency introduced its new weather information service, which takes data from more than 240 weather stations on the strategic road network, together with forecast information, and makes that information available to its service providers and others to enable them to make informed decisions on how to respond to severe weather. In addition, the Agency has a Met Office forecaster embedded in the National Traffic Operations Centre during the winter period which enables us to send out targeted severe weather warnings and alerts to all interested stakeholders so that appropriate actions can be taken.  We provide the Met Office (and other partners)&#xa0;with&#xa0;all observation data and camera imagery&#xa0;received from our weather stations under a defined data exchange agreement.&#xa0;e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Amber Alert Process&#xa0;The Agency introduced an ‘amber alert’ process for snow in 2011 that provides freight operators and others with advance targeted notice of when there is a significant risk of disruption to the network from snow. This is supported by variable message signs on the network to provide advance warning to road users of when severe weather is expected.  This is supplemented by messages on the Agency’s website and social media.&#xa0;f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Communications &amp; Marketing Campaign&#xa0;Since winter 2009/10, the Highways Agency has undertaken a comprehensive partnership marketing campaign and has worked closely with over 100 key partners&#xa0;- including the AA, RAC, Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), Road Haulage Association (RHA) and the Freight Transport Association (FTA), local authorities and airports to deliver winter messages through partners’ own communications channels, such as websites, newsletters, posters and social media channels.  Each year the Agency continues to implement a comprehensive winter communication campaign, working with key partners including the Met Office and Cabinet Office as part of the wider ‘

[[[Get ready for ]]]

[[[Winter]]]’ campaign. &#xa0;g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Use of Social Media&#xa0;The Agency has also developed its use of social media including its dedicated winter twitter channel (@winterhighways) and has introduced a Facebook page at Facebook.com/winterhighways. These media help the Agency to put across key messages, including information on road conditions and weather alerts, to a wider audience than before.&#xa0;h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Crisis Management Manual&#xa0;The Highways Agency Crisis Management Manual (CMM) is an internal document launched in November 2011 and last updated in July 2013. It sets out policy and guidance for how the Agency and its service providers manage severe disruptive events that affect the strategic road network. Key changes relate to management and reporting in advance of, and during, widespread events, the availability of crisis management expertise and business continuity.&#xa0;2.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although numerous improvements have been made to the way the Highways Agency plans for and responds to severe winter weather, we accept the need to avoid complacency. The Agency has a well established lessons learned programme specifically for winter service, which feeds into the issue of the latest Severe Weather Plan for each area. In this way the Agency continuously reviews its performance, learning lessons from each winter period, and making improvements.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Preparedness for Winter 2013/1]]]

[[[4]]]&#xa0;2.3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Highways Agency is well prepared for the coming winter.  Operational salt stocks will stand at around 270,000 tonnes (representing 15 capability days) by the end of October, in line with the past two years, and more than at the start of the 2010-11 season.  In addition we continue to hold 120,000 tonnes of strategic salt. &#xa0;2.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Agency is currently finalising its preparations for its winter driving campaign ‘Make time for winter’, which will commence on 28 October. The campaign will encourage road users to prepare for their journeys, to plan by checking traffic and weather before they set out and then to adjust their travel plans and their driving style according to the conditions.&#xa0; We are working with key partners and stakeholders to maximise the reach of the campaign and to increase the impact of messages. Partner agencies such as DVLA and VOSA/DSA are supporting this with their own communications channels.  We are working with motoring organisations, freight transport organisations, the Confederation of Passenger Transport, local authorities and a number of large private sector organisations to help promote the key messages of "Be prepared: is your vehicle ready for winter?" and "Be informed: have you checked the latest traffic and weather?"&#xa0;2.3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Following the experience of running the campaign in previous winters the Agency will be increasing the flexibility of the campaign so we can respond quickly to the different challenges of varying weather patterns. Our significant use of online communications and social media is particularly suited to this type of agile and responsive campaign.  Our media spokespeople also play an important role during peak periods of severe weather by providing interviews to the media, both broadcast and press.  We will also facilitate media visits to our control centres and depots where it is appropriate to do so and does not compromise operational delivery.&#xa0;2.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Highways Agency campaign sits within the wider cross-government ‘Get Ready for Winter’ campaign. This is hosted by the Met Office and co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office to include key Government departments/agencies, the health and voluntary sectors to provide advice and support on a wide range of weather related issues.&#xa0; Links between the partners will further increase the reach of our particular messages related to travel during severe weather.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Coordinating Responses]]]&#xa0;2.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Agency recognises the importance of coordinating its planning and operational response with other authorities, such as the police and local highway authorities.  Severe weather plans require service providers to consult with adjacent local authorities to ensure, among other things, that planned treatment routes are coordinated and that there is sharing of information on treatment decision making.  Local authorities take part in annual severe weather desk exercises and briefings are provided.&#xa0;2.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is an established procedure for the provision of mutual aid during the winter season.  For example, last winter the Agency provided a snow plough and driver to Cumbria County Council to assist with snow clearance following heavy snowfalls at the end of March.  In some locations salt barns are shared with local authorities which provides a benefit to both parties. Furthermore, the Agency works with police and local highway authorities as part of Local Resilience Forums, which play a key coordination role at times of significant disruption to the network from any cause, including severe weather.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; One capability day is based on 6 treatments of 20g per sq metre on all routes which is considered to be the maximum scale of treatment under the most extreme weather conditions.
