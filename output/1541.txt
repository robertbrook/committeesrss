[[[Bbf Biochar Cic (CCS08)]]]&#xa0;Biochar is the charcoal-like solid product of heating biomass in very low-oxygen conditions. Biochar usually contains a lot of carbon which is tightly fixed in molecules that are resistant to microbial breakdown, meaning that the carbon persists in soil for hundreds to thousands of years  - long enough to be a useful way of reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Biochar is also a soil improver – it adds nutrients, modulates the pH, helps to store moisture in dry soils, increases the microbial activity, changes the soil structure, and so on. Biochar can make a major contribution to the UK’s decarbonisation ambitions – especially in relation to the land-use, agricultural and bioenergy sectors – while enhancing the long-term health of soils. The potential role of biochar in reducing carbon is between

[[[ment per year]]] (benefitting between 4 and 28% of the UK’s agricultural land over a 20 year period). However, biochar is a relatively new idea and much work remains to be done on making the underpinning technologies reliable and economically viable and on demonstrating the value of biochar in agricultural and other settings.  The UK Government can assist by establishing a carbon offsetting value for biochar allowing trading into the EU ETS  (as is already allowed for CO2 capture and geological storage) and/or allowing biochar to contribute to meeting company or organizational carbon emission reduction targets.&#xa0;&#xa0;The British Biochar Foundation (BBF) CIC. was founded in 2013 to represent the wide range of individuals, groups, companies and other organisations in the UK which have an interest in biochar. The BBF has 197 individual members (as of August 2013) and the members come from research and development, private sector, consultancy, public sector, nature and conservation bodies, community groups and charities. In June 2013, 110 BBF members participated in the BBF’s inaugural event in Oxford.  In August 2013, a new Board has been established and will meet for the first time in September. The aim of the BBF is to represent the emerging biochar sector in the UK in all its diversity. Our submission reflects the opinions of the BBF Board.  &#xa0;Biochar is a solid charcoal-like material, obtained from thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment that is used for the long-term storage of carbon in the environment and for soil improvement. Because the carbon in biochar is derived from CO2 through photosynthesis, there is the potential for biochar to be a carbon-negative energy generation technology, through beneficial use of the energy produced during its manufacture. A study undertaken for DEFRA and DECC in 2009 (Shackley and Sohi, 2010) concluded that biochar could contribute between 3.5 million tonnes (Mt) CO2 (equivalent) abatement per year to 22 MtCO2eq abatement per year depending on scenario, this representing 0.3 – 3% of 1990 UK greenhouse gas emissions or 1.5 – 10% of the emission reductions required by 2020 (Table 1). (In this note, we will convert all carbon and non-CO2 greenhouse gases into units of CO2 equivalence or CO2eq using conventional conversion factors). The wide range is explained by uncertainty regarding the quantity of available biomass feedstocks, with the very high scenario implying that a reasonable percentage of suitable, sustainable biomass feedstocks are directed towards biochar production. Carbon abatement from agriculture and forestry as whole for the UK is c. 50 MtCO2eq. A study for the Committee on Climate Change calculated emissions reductions from UK agriculture and soils of between 1.5 and 10  MtCO2eq per year (assuming a maximum abatement cost of ≤£100/tCO2eq) (MacLeod et al., 2010). The potentially large role of biochar in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture comes from using a large amount of organic waste (much of which is not currently used effectively for other purposes) and avoiding its decomposition to methane. &#xa0;&#xa0;Agricultural land application of biochar under two scenarios of biochar use: 10/1 and 30/1 (in million hectares)Feedstock availabilityCO2eq abated in million tonnes Biochar production in million tonnes  10 t ha-1 first year, then 1 t ha-1 (20 y horizon)  30 t ha-1 first year, then 1 t ha-1 (20 y horizon)  % of existing agricultural land (11.9 million ha) Lower resource  3.610.70.43.5 - 6 %Higher Resource15.93.52.41.412 – 20% High resource21.94.73.31.916 – 28%&#xa0;Table 1: Preliminary and provisional estimate of annual biochar production and carbon abatement in the UK using three scenarios for virgin and non-virgin biomass feedstock and the resulting land-use implications.  (source: Shackley et al. 2011).&#xa0;Table 1 also indicates the area of land which might be implicated in biochar deployment under each scenario. The key message is that available or suitable land is much less likely to be a constraint than availability of suitable feedstocks. A methodology has been developed, based upon adapting existing LCA tools, for calculating the CO2eq benefits of biochar across its life-cycle and published in the Biochar Quality Mandate (2013). The UK government has no policy on encouraging biochar, though some government agencies such as the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and WRAP have expressed support for re-using wastes more productively  through biochar production. &#xa0;&#xa0;Whether the UK will benefit from biochar depends upon: a) the biochar sector taking off globally, b) the UK supporting an active involvement in the sector.  It will come as no surprise to the Committee, that we are firmly of the view that (a) will happen and that (b) is highly desirable. The UK has expertise in soil science, soil amendments, agricultural research (arable, livestock, horticulture) and pyrolysis engineering and technology which, together, constitute the key resources and capabilities required to enable successful biochar innovation. &#xa0;Biochar is not only about carbon storage, it is also a way of improving soil fertility and crop productivity. Despite a high variability of UK field trial results, there are examples of statistically significant yield gains in barley and grasslands (Jones et al., 2012; Hammond et al., 2013). Further R&amp;D is underway to understand the optimum crop-soil-weather-management regimes required for biochar benefits in the UK. At the global scale, a recent meta-analysis of 371 independent studies reported that the addition of biochar to soils resulted, on average, in increased above ground productivity and crop yield (Biederman &amp; Harpole, 2013). Recent research in China and Australia has been testing blends of biochar and synthetic chemical fertilizer and this has been showing some impressive crop yield increases, suggesting that the way forwards is to use smaller amounts of biochar more productively.  There is reasonable evidence that biochar allows the more efficient utilisation of added nutrients, especially nitrogen. The same crop yield may be obtained with a lower synthetic fertiliser input as a consequence, reducing: costs, associated GHG emissions from fertiliser manufacture and potential nitrate run-off pollution: all-in-all competitive low carbon farming.&#xa0;At present charcoal production is deployed around the world at small scale, and there are several manufacturers of medium scale devices.  However the larger scale plant, for continuous production of biochar, syngas and/or bio-liquids,  is not at a high technology readiness level due to lack of demand hence investment. Until such time as there are reliably operating pyrolysis plants at the right cost, biochar will not be deployed  on any large scale. There are, nonetheless, pioneering companies which are developing clean, efficient and controllable biochar production at small to large scales (e.g. Pyrreg and Black is Green). To develop such technical systems requires sufficient investment by the private sector, including firms with the necessary technical and engineering competencies. This investment will occur when one or more of the following happen: &#xa0; Once reliable larger scale systems have been developed, the costs of producing biochar in the UK are likely to range from £-100/t to £400/t.  The negative figure would be where organic waste streams are used, with a gate fee  for wastes input to the production plant (Shackley et al., 2011). The average production cost across a wide range of feedstocks (including organic wastes) is £118 per tonne biochar. &#xa0;The marginal abatement cost for carbon (MACC) ranges from £200 per tCO2 to £-150 per tCO2 (ibid.), with an average value of £57 per tCO2 (ibid.). If only clean non-waste feedstocks are considered both production cost and MACC are may be 1/3 higher. The MACC value is competitive with energy technologies such as CCS (geological variant) and offshore renewables, though the levelised cost of electricity generation is higher than conventional biomass (depending on how efficiently liquids and gases are utilized and on the efficiency of heat recovery in conventional biomass utilisation).  &#xa0;The agronomic value of biochar with current applications is unlikely to be as high as the average biochar production cost (£118 per tonne). As a rule of thumb, one tonne of biochar abates one tonne of CO2eq.  DEFRA has set the shadow cost of carbon at between £25 and £60 per tonne CO2eq and, if we take a nominal value of £40 per tonne CO2eq reduction, this would require a minimum agronomic value of £78 per tonne biochar to cover production costs.  This is feasible in certain niche applications; biochar production costs will in any case be a lot lower than £118 per tonne in many instances. For instance, if a biochar is used with a negative production cost, it would, in principle, be possible to return a profit from both carbon abatement and agronomic dimensions. &#xa0;There is no carbon credit available for biochar. The EU ETS does not include biochar and pyrolysis is unlikely to quality for entry into the EU ETS. The non-traded sector does not permit carbon off-setting options, so biochar cannot be included. Without carbon financing, successful  large scale development deployment of biochar is much less likely. &#xa0;Regulation is a further possible barrier to biochar development and deployment in the UK.  This is because of the high level of complexity surrounding regulation of soil amendments and use of wastes.  These issues have been thoroughly addressed in the Biochar Quality Mandate (BQM), a document prepared by a consortium of regulators, scientists and with input from the industry and technical experts, which is currently undergoing revisions. Both SEPA (2012) and the Environment Agency (2013) have issued Regulatory Position Statements (RPS) (on the manufacture and use of biochar from specified wastes (mostly untreated wood wastes) (WST-PS-031). &#xa0;Safety issues arise from the potential risks introduced by toxicants in the biochar (heavy metals, organic molecules), from pyrolysis operations that are dirty and produce particles and fugitive emissions of gases such as carbon monoxide, methane and nitrous oxide (greenhouse gases) and from the unsustainable sourcing of biomass. Other minor health and safety issues concern application of a dusty material to soil requiring good practice such as wetting and wearing face masks, etc.  All these issues have been addressed in guidance and assessment documents including those of the International Biochar Initiative (IBI), the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and the BQM for the UK context in particular. The bottom-line is that if biochar is sourced from carefully managed feedstocks, is produced from modern controlled pyrolysis equipment and is properly tested prior to soil addition, safety concerns can be adequately addressed. &#xa0;Several countries have provided incentives for biochar RD&amp;D, in particular China and the USA. Schemes in China have been promoting removal of straw from fields for use as a biochar feedstock rather than straw burning in field which causes air pollution.  Pyrolysis can be included in existing renewable bioenergy incentive schemes through electricity generation from syngas (in the UK via ROCs and FiTs), though more mature technologies such as direct biomass combustion are lower risk.  Biochar is an energy dense by-product, reducing the generation of bioenergy from a given mass of biomass compared to combustion, even though the overall carbon abatement of pyrolysis-biochar is greater than that from direct combustion. Current &#xa0; In Japan, biochar has been officially recognised and permitted as a soil amendment since 1984. In April 2013,   Switzerland became the first European country to officially permit biochar production and use in soil, adopting the requirements of the European Biochar Certificate. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]The key value of biochar is in carbon sequestration, where carbon is removed from the atmosphere for 100’s to 1000’s of years. The atmosphere already holds 400ppm yet the safe level is believed to lie somewhere between 350 and 450ppm with no let-up in CO2 emissions to atmosphere. Therefore regardless of actions to decarbonise the UK’s energy system it is necessary to also remove CO2 from the atmosphere to reduce present concentrations to a safe level. Biochar provides a relatively safe and cheap method of doing this, which can be deployed at various scales and at speed should it be so desired.  The UK potential for biochar is estimated at 

[[[3.5 to 22]]] million tonnes CO2 abatement per year (benefitting between 4 and 28% of the UK’s agricultural land over a 20 year period).

(2010),  An Assessment of the Benefits and Issues Associated with the Application of Biochar to Soil,  Defra + Decc,  London. &#xa0;August 2013&#xa0; Depending upon feedstock and technology-scale, avoided emissions were 1.0–1.4&#xa0;t&#xa0;CO2eq&#xa0;t&#x2011;1&#xa0;oven dry (o.d.) feedstock in slow pyrolysis. This compares with an avoided emission of 0.55 t CO2eq t&#x2011;1 o.d. for straw combustion at 33% efficiency. Hence, for straw, there is an additional 80% carbon abatement from pyrolysis-biochar (on an LCA basis) compared to combustion. The Carbon Abatement Efficiency (CAE) of pyrolysis-biochar compared to combustion improves as the full life-cycle impacts are incorporated, this being due to the indirect effects of biochar in the soil. The largest contribution to pyrolysis-biochar carbon abatement (40–50%) is from stabilised feedstock carbon. The next largest contribution is from the indirect impacts of biochar in the soil (lower crop fertiliser requirement, lower soil N2O emissions, increased SOC, etc): these hypothesised impacts are based only upon a few studies and stand in need of far better evidence. The indirect impacts account for 25–40% of CA, the proportion changing with the size of other CA categories. The final major CA category is fossil-fuel offsets from renewable electricity generation, 10–25% of total CA.  Expressed in terms of carbon emissions per unit of delivered energy, pyrolysis-biochar abates (i.e. avoids the emission of) between 1.5–2.0&#xa0;kg&#xa0;CO2eq&#xa0;kWh-1. This compares with an average emission of 0.5&#xa0;kg&#xa0;CO2&#xa0;kWh-1 arising from the national electricity grid in 2008. The Environment Agency estimates that the carbon emission factor for electricity generation from many biomass feedstocks is between 0.05–0.30&#xa0;kg&#xa0;CO2eq&#xa0;kWh-1 (Environment Agency, 2009). Hence, pyrolysis-biochar may be a more efficient way of abating carbon than alternative uses of biomass feedstock. Likewise, it  results in the abatement of approximately 7–30&#xa0;t&#xa0;CO2eq&#xa0;ha-1&#xa0;yr-1 for dedicated feedstocks. These numbers fall within, but also exceed, the range of the first generation biofuel system with the highest CAE – namely bioethanol from sugarcane (10–16&#xa0;t&#xa0;CO2eq&#xa0;ha-1&#xa0;yr-1) and are much larger than most bioenergy crops and biofuel feedstocks (e.g. biodiesel from rapeseed, soy or sunflower gives a saving of 0.5–4.0&#xa0;t&#xa0;CO2eq&#xa0;ha-1&#xa0;yr-1) (Cherubini et al., 2009); UK bioelectricity systems, meanwhile, give a saving of between 1–7&#xa0;t&#xa0;CO2eq&#xa0;ha-1 yr-1 (Thornley, 2009).  &#xa0;&#xa0;
