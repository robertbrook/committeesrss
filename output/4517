[normal]AFS0028[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Ron Glatter[bold]Emeritus Professor of Educational Administration and Management[bold],[bold]The Open University[bold];[bold]Visiting Professor, [bold]Institute[bold] of [bold]Education[bold], [bold]University[bold] of [bold]London[bold]&#xa0;[bold]“What is being created is the most personally centralised education system in Western Europe since 
[normal]Germany
[normal] in the 1930s – each school contracted directly to the Secretary of State…”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.  The 
[normal]main 
[normal]focus of this
[normal] submission is on the third and fourth points identified by the Committee for consideration by respondents, concerning the space between the Secretary of State and individual schools and the issues raised by academy chains with regard to governance arrange
[normal]ments.  I
[normal] begin 
[normal]by referring briefly 
[normal]to the wider context.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.  
[normal]The issue of ownership of publicly-funded schools is hardly ever debated.  To whom do – and should – schools funded by the public purse belong?   In past 
[normal]periods 
[normal]this may not have been a major concern.  For example politicians in the post-war period attempted to develop 
[normal]education 
[normal]policy largely by consensus, as illustrated 
[normal]by 
[normal]the three great reports from the Central Advisory Council (
[normal]England
[normal]) between 1959 
[normal](Crowther
[normal]) 
[normal]and 1967
[normal] (Plowden).  2013 marks
[normal] the 50
[normal]th
[normal] anniversary of the second of these – the Newsom report on the education of 13 to 16 year olds of average and below average ability
[normal] – and like the others it provided a model of how to achieve 
[normal]widespread understand
[normal]ing of a set of educational challenges and substantial agreement on ways forward.
[normal]  Actual policy tended to be negotiated between the central education department, the associations representing the local education author
[normal]ities and the teachers’ unions.  It w
[normal]as 
[normal]a corporatist approach which 
[normal]is out of fashion today
[normal].  Even if it tended towards excessive ambiguity and diffuseness 
[normal]and perhaps exaggerated the degree of consensus 
[normal]it 
[normal]had the merit of taking into account some key 
[normal]stakeholder 
[normal]interests and experience ou
[normal]tside central government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Autonomy – over what and for whom?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.  
[normal]The current scene is very different.  Since the Education Reform Act of 1988 
[normal]schools have become ever more closely 
[normal]directed and 
[normal]monitored from Whitehall on the core aspects of education whi
[normal]le they have been granted increasing autonomy over operational matters such as 
[normal]premises, staffing and admissions.  The rhetoric of autonomy has been a 
[normal]strong 
[normal]and consistent feature, expressed in terminology such as that of the 
[normal]‘
[normal]independent 
[normal]state school
[normal]’.  
[normal]This draws on the symbolic power of the fee-charging independent school sector which is a highly distinctive and influential feature of English education.   Although educating only about 7% of the pupil population it is resourced lavishly by any internatio
[normal]nal standards
[normal], whether of state or private schools
[normal].  Its class sizes are half those of 
[normal]our 
[normal]state-funded schools, 
[normal]it has about twice the number of teachers for 
[normal]its 
[normal]pupil population and 
[normal]it 
[normal]charges fees up to three times the per-pupil spend in state schools.  Yet OECD research shows that, once the differences in socio-economic intake are taken into account, state-funded schools 
[normal]in the 
[normal]U.K.
[normal] 
[normal]perform much better than independent schools
[normal].  Never
[normal]t
[normal]heless independent school alumni are heavily 
[normal]and quite disproportionately 
[normal]represented in the top professions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.  
[normal]The status and image of independent schooling exert a powerful influence on the public imagination and this has encouraged politicians to s
[normal]eek to mimic the governance structure of 
[normal]the 
[normal]English 
[normal]private school
[normal] in state-funded schooling
[normal],
[normal] most notably in relation to academies
[normal] which now make up more than half the secondary schools in 
[normal]England
[normal].  Yet the international evidence 
[normal]on increasing autonomy i
[normal]s mixed
[normal].  Autonomy over the curriculum is positively related to a system’s performance but there is no clear relationship in regard to autonomy over staffing and
[normal] 
[normal]budgetary decisions
[normal], which is where the emphasis has been 
[normal]placed 
[normal]in 
[normal]England
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]It seems too 
[normal]t
[normal]hat institutional leaders are the big gainers rather than teaching and support staff
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]Whether putting so much power – and responsibility – in the hands of headteachers is a wise strategy will become evident in due course.
[normal]  Autonomy is not as simple a co
[normal]ncept as is often implied and key questions about it are: autonomy over what and for whom?  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.  
[normal]Moreover the private schools arguably provide an entirely inappropriate governance model
[normal], since they are 
[normal]primarily responsible to their owners or trustees wh
[normal]ereas publicly provided schools have a much wider set of responsibilities including to taxpayers and indeed the whole citizenry, as well as to their local community in the broadest sense.  A pluralist governance model is 
[normal]surely 
[normal]needed that reflects these m
[normal]ultiple obligations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The dem[bold]ocratic deficit[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.  
[normal]Yet the system as a whole has been moving sharply away from such a pluralist perspective.
[normal]  The powers of local government in education have been greatly reduced
[normal] in 
[normal]spite of evidence that a strong mediating layer is vital for successful performance
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]This has given 
[normal]the centre ever greater control to 
[normal]impose 
[normal]its 
[normal]often 
[normal]controversial and sometimes 
[normal]idiosyncratic 
[normal]preferences about
[normal] school structure, curriculum and asse
[normal]ssment
[normal], generally with minimal trialling, on 
[normal]our
[normal] large and complex 
[normal]system
[normal].  
[normal]There are distinctive 
[normal]national 
[normal]constitutional issues involved, such as the weak 
[normal]separation of the executive from the legislature, the absence of proportional voting and the lack of
[normal] constitutional protection for local government
[normal], so that the checks and balances generally found in other comparable 
[normal]jurisdictions 
[normal]are
[normal] absent
[normal].  
[normal]For example the 
[normal]Academies Act 
[normal]passed
[normal] through Parliament at high speed in 2010 with very limited debate using spe
[normal]cial powers intended for emergenc
[normal]y situations
[normal] such a
[normal]s those related to terrorism.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.  
[normal]Also a
[normal]cademies
[normal] and other new types of school
[normal] 
[normal]such as ‘free’ and studio schools 
[normal]operate on the basis of funding agreements, 
[normal]in effect 
[normal]contracts, made directly with the Secretary of State rather than any local arrangements 
[normal]under public law
[normal], a mechanism originally introduced by the previous Labour government.and extensively used by the present administration.  
[normal]This ‘governance by contract’
[normal] raises 
[normal]major 
[normal]issues of public accountability, not least th
[normal]at the contract is between the Secretary of S
[normal]tate and the sponsor and neither the child nor the parent is a party to it
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]There is a significant and growing democratic deficit
[normal] 
[normal]indicating 
[normal]a crisis 
[normal]of legitimacy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.  
[normal]None of this is to suggest that central government should have no role in shaping and monitoring the system.  At present however ownership is determined too heavily by its control over resources and as a consequence the distribution of 
[normal]power has become seriously unbalanced.  More than a decade ago the distinguished philosopher Onora O’Neill argued in he
[normal]r acclaimed BBC Reith Lectures that 
[normal]prof
[normal]essionals and public servants should
[normal] be given more scope “to serve the public rather than their p
[normal]aymasters”
[normal].  In education there is just as much need today to achieve a better balance between upward, lateral and downward accountability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.  
[normal]The issue becomes even more acute in relation to the academy chains which are currently proliferating.  Althou
[normal]gh they vary in style and organisation, their head offices and centres of power are generally distant from the social, economic and geographical communities in which the schools are located, 
[normal]so that 
[normal]substantial control 
[normal]is 
[normal]exercised remotely.  This model is
[normal] very different from that of the ‘independent state school’
[normal] and 
[normal]it 
[normal]offers little scope for local democratic or strategic co-ordination or community governance.  It can fairly be said that schools in chains are not independent, they just have different mast
[normal]ers.
[normal]  In fact the barrister 
[normal]David Wolfe
[normal] who specialises in education law has pointed 
[normal]out that a maintained school entering into a sponsored academy chain loses its distinct legal identity – it becomes simply the educational activity which the sponsor provides at that particular location under its funding agreement.  In fact Wolfe comments 
[normal]that the academy chains “have even greater control over the academies they run than did local education authorities” 
[normal]before delegated
[normal] 
[normal]budgets and so on were introduced a quarter of a
[normal] 
[normal]century ago
[normal].
[normal]  It i
[normal]s a vivid 
[normal]illustration 
[normal]of how misleading the rhetorica
[normal]l use of terms like autonomy can be.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.  
[normal]Policy has also since the late 1980s strongly reflected a belief in the power of competition to improve schooling.  However a major OECD review in 2010 of more than 250 studies found very little e
[normal]vidence to supp
[normal]ort this view
[normal].  According to this wide-ranging study
[normal],
[normal] i
[normal]ntroducing market mechanisms in education d
[normal]oes
[normal] not tend to generate innovation, it could increase social segregation and the evidence showed no link to improved teaching and learning
[normal].  There was no in
[normal]dication that private providers did better than traditional ones.
[normal]  Research
[normal] from different contexts 
[normal]showed that co-operation
[normal] between schools
[normal] is a 
[normal]highly 
[normal]fragile and vulnerable process in a competitive
[normal], market-driven
[normal] climate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The need for a new framework[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]11.  
[normal]C
[normal]ontrary to much rhetoric, there is no convincing evidence that any particular type of school in terms of governance structure produces superior performance
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]against the narrow criteria determined by policy-makers
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]when all relevant factors are taken 
[normal]into account and like is rigorously compared with like.
[normal]  Beyond this
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]governance of publicly-funded schooling 
[normal]should be far 
[normal]more than a technical matter of which provider can get the best test and exam results
[normal]: moral, social and cultural issues 
[normal]lie 
[normal]at 
[normal]the 
[normal]heart 
[normal]of schooling
[normal].  If
[normal], for example,
[normal] the 
[normal]academy chain 
[normal]model became 
[normal]more 
[normal]widespread and some 
[normal]chains 
[normal]achieved control of 
[normal]large numbers of schools, 
[normal]as some aspire to do, 
[normal]the issue of who exercises legitimate power in the system would become prominent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.  
[normal]In this 
[normal]general 
[normal]context 
[normal]there is an urgent need 
[normal]to define models and approaches that can deliver an alternative to the current polarisation: an excessive 
[normal]focus 
[normal]on autonomy and competition
[normal] 
[normal]on the one hand and alienating and unsustainable centralisation
[normal] on the other.  A new 
[normal]framework 
[normal]is 
[normal]required 
[normal]in 
[normal]which trust and collaboration
[normal] 
[normal]are emphasised 
[normal]and which spreads ownership to loca
[normal]l communities 
[normal]and stakeholders 
[normal]within a pluralist multi-level system.
[normal]  The support and performance management of all schools should be provided locally and the concept
[normal]s 
[normal]of ‘local school system’ 
[normal]and ‘local family of schools’ should have real meaning.  It is not right for the only significant democratic input to schooling to 
[normal]be at central level.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.  The Committee will 
[normal]no doubt 
[normal]receive numerous 
[normal]detailed 
[normal]formulations and I hope will assess them at least in part 
[normal]against 
[normal]the above criteria.  
[normal]I want to make one specific proposal.  The arrival of academies has brought with it st
[normal]ark differences in the ways in which publicly-funded schools are governed.   This is unfair
[normal], divisive
[normal] and 
[normal]indefensible.  
[normal]All publicly-funded schools should be 
[normal]placed within a common administrative
[normal] and legal framework based on the principles of public not c
[normal]ontract law.
[normal]  It follows that variations in levels of autonomy between different categories of school should be kept to an absolute minimum and a strong and convincing rationale should be provided for any such differences, which is not the case currently.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.  This proposal puts into strong focus the regime of outsourcing embodied in the 
[normal]mechanism of 
[normal]funding agreements applied to academies.  
[normal]This method
[normal] (
[normal]which is highly idiosyncratic 
[normal]for this type of purpose internationally)
[normal] was not designed to be operate
[normal]d 
[normal]on the kind of scale at
[normal] which it is now being employed.  
[normal] In view of recent incidents it 
[normal]is becoming even
[normal] clearer that this process cannot be managed at 
[normal]such a 
[normal]scale by central government without major risk
[normal]s but it is also unlikely that local authorities
[normal] or other middle tier bodies, such as the regional ‘headteacher boards’ 
[normal]led 
[normal]by ‘chancellors’ that the government is reported to
[normal] be planning, could effectively, 
[normal]consistently 
[normal]and
[normal] economically 
[normal]do so either.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]It would be irresponsible to continue along this pa
[normal]th.
[normal]  
[normal]The aim should be to phase this system out as existing agreements come to the end of their life.  In the meantime an approach based on over-riding the agreements by regulation and/or by primary legislation “in order to bring proper coherence and resto
[normal]re a schools ‘system’” as proposed by 
[normal]David Wolfe
[normal] should be adopted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.  
[normal] 
[normal]Various models might be considered suitable for providing the common framework.  An obvious one is that of the maintained school trust.  This preserves that degree of 
[normal]‘
[normal]autonomy
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]hich has achieved such totemic significance in English policy discourse as well as allowing for the involvement of external bodies in governance which is claimed to have a beneficial impact.  It also facilitates strong collaborative arrangements and enable
[normal]s wide stakeholder involvement as successfully demonstrated, for example, by the Co-operative group of schools which now number over 600.  It might also allow faith schools to be 
[normal]effectively integrated.  
[normal]Stronger 
[normal]regulation or reform of admissions
[normal] might be
[normal] required
[normal], since trust schools are their own admissions authorities.  
[normal]This is simply one possibility
[normal], 
[normal]and legal as well as educational and administrative expertise would need to be brought to bear on fashioning an appropriate framework.  What is 
[normal]required 
[normal]a
[normal]bove all is 
[normal]an inclusive and integrated 
[normal]set of arrangements which avoid
[normal]s
[normal] favouritism and 
[normal]unjustified hierarchies.  To my knowledge
[normal], the most successful educational systems, combining high quality with equity, have such arrangements at their heart
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]EXECUTIVE SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The status and image of independent schooling exert a powerful influence on the public imagination and this has encouraged politicians to seek to mimic the governance structure of the English private school in state-funded schooling, 
[normal]most notably in relation to academies.
[normal]  Autonomy is not as simple a concept as is often implied and key questions about it are: autonomy over what and for whom?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The centre has secured ever greater control to impose its preferences about school structure, 
[normal]curriculum and assessment on our large and complex system.  
[normal]There is a significant and growing democratic deficit indicating a crisis of legitimacy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘Governance by contract’ 
[normal]in relation to academies 
[normal]raises 
[normal]serious 
[normal]issues of public accountability
[normal] and ca
[normal]nnot be operated at the very large scale intended without major risks
[normal].
[normal]  The aim should be to phase this system out as existing agreements come to the end of their life.  In the meantime an approach based on over-riding the funding agreements should be adop
[normal]ted.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ‘academy chain’ model is very different from that of the ‘independent state school’ and it offers little scope for local democratic or strategic co-ordination or community governance.  It can fairly be said that schools in chains are not indepe
[normal]ndent, they just have different masters.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Contrary to much rhetoric, t
[normal]here is no convincing evidence that any particular type of school in terms of governance structure produces superior performance 
[normal]against the 
[normal]conventional
[normal]ly-accepted
[normal] criteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A new fram
[normal]ework is required in which trust and collaboration are emphasised and which spreads ownership to local communities and stakeholders within a pluralist multi-level system.  It is not right for the only significant democratic input to schooling to be at cent
[normal]ral level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All publicly-funded schools should be placed within a common administrative and legal framework based on the principles of public not contract law.
[normal]  Variations in levels of autonomy should be kept to an absolute minimum and fully justified as exceptions.
[normal]  Various models including that of the maintained school trust should be considered.  An inclusive and integrated set of arrangements which avoids fa
[normal]vouritism and unjustified hierarchies is required.
