default&#xa0;
default1.  The 
defaultmain 
defaultfocus of this
default submission is on the third and fourth points identified by the Committee for consideration by respondents, concerning the space between the Secretary of State and individual schools and the issues raised by academy chains with regard to governance arrange
defaultments.  I
default begin 
defaultby referring briefly 
defaultto the wider context.
default&#xa0;
default2.  
defaultThe issue of ownership of publicly-funded schools is hardly ever debated.  To whom do – and should – schools funded by the public purse belong?   In past 
defaultperiods 
defaultthis may not have been a major concern.  For example politicians in the post-war period attempted to develop 
defaulteducation 
defaultpolicy largely by consensus, as illustrated 
defaultby 
defaultthe three great reports from the Central Advisory Council (
defaultEngland
default) between 1959 
default(Crowther
default) 
defaultand 1967
default (Plowden).  2013 marks
default the 50
defaultth
default anniversary of the second of these – the Newsom report on the education of 13 to 16 year olds of average and below average ability
default – and like the others it provided a model of how to achieve 
defaultwidespread understand
defaulting of a set of educational challenges and substantial agreement on ways forward.
default  Actual policy tended to be negotiated between the central education department, the associations representing the local education author
defaultities and the teachers’ unions.  It w
defaultas 
defaulta corporatist approach which 
defaultis out of fashion today
default.  Even if it tended towards excessive ambiguity and diffuseness 
defaultand perhaps exaggerated the degree of consensus 
defaultit 
defaulthad the merit of taking into account some key 
defaultstakeholder 
defaultinterests and experience ou
defaulttside central government.
default&#xa0;
defaultAutonomy – over what and for whom?default&#xa0;
default3.  
defaultThe current scene is very different.  Since the Education Reform Act of 1988 
defaultschools have become ever more closely 
defaultdirected and 
defaultmonitored from Whitehall on the core aspects of education whi
defaultle they have been granted increasing autonomy over operational matters such as 
defaultpremises, staffing and admissions.  The rhetoric of autonomy has been a 
defaultstrong 
defaultand consistent feature, expressed in terminology such as that of the 
default‘
defaultindependent 
defaultstate school
default’.  
defaultThis draws on the symbolic power of the fee-charging independent school sector which is a highly distinctive and influential feature of English education.   Although educating only about 7% of the pupil population it is resourced lavishly by any internatio
defaultnal standards
default, whether of state or private schools
default.  Its class sizes are half those of 
defaultour 
defaultstate-funded schools, 
defaultit has about twice the number of teachers for 
defaultits 
defaultpupil population and 
defaultit 
defaultcharges fees up to three times the per-pupil spend in state schools.  Yet OECD research shows that, once the differences in socio-economic intake are taken into account, state-funded schools 
defaultin the 
defaultU.K.
default 
defaultperform much better than independent schools
default.  Never
defaultt
defaultheless independent school alumni are heavily 
defaultand quite disproportionately 
defaultrepresented in the top professions
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.  
defaultThe status and image of independent schooling exert a powerful influence on the public imagination and this has encouraged politicians to s
defaulteek to mimic the governance structure of 
defaultthe 
defaultEnglish 
defaultprivate school
default in state-funded schooling
default,
default most notably in relation to academies
default which now make up more than half the secondary schools in 
defaultEngland
default.  Yet the international evidence 
defaulton increasing autonomy i
defaults mixed
default.  Autonomy over the curriculum is positively related to a system’s performance but there is no clear relationship in regard to autonomy over staffing and
default 
defaultbudgetary decisions
default, which is where the emphasis has been 
defaultplaced 
defaultin 
defaultEngland
default.  
default 
defaultIt seems too 
defaultt
defaulthat institutional leaders are the big gainers rather than teaching and support staff
default.  
default 
defaultWhether putting so much power – and responsibility – in the hands of headteachers is a wise strategy will become evident in due course.
default  Autonomy is not as simple a co
defaultncept as is often implied and key questions about it are: autonomy over what and for whom?  
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.  
defaultMoreover the private schools arguably provide an entirely inappropriate governance model
default, since they are 
defaultprimarily responsible to their owners or trustees wh
defaultereas publicly provided schools have a much wider set of responsibilities including to taxpayers and indeed the whole citizenry, as well as to their local community in the broadest sense.  A pluralist governance model is 
defaultsurely 
defaultneeded that reflects these m
defaultultiple obligations.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe demdefaultocratic deficitdefault&#xa0;
default6.  
defaultYet the system as a whole has been moving sharply away from such a pluralist perspective.
default  The powers of local government in education have been greatly reduced
default in 
defaultspite of evidence that a strong mediating layer is vital for successful performance
default.  
default 
defaultThis has given 
defaultthe centre ever greater control to 
defaultimpose 
defaultits 
defaultoften 
defaultcontroversial and sometimes 
defaultidiosyncratic 
defaultpreferences about
default school structure, curriculum and asse
defaultssment
default, generally with minimal trialling, on 
defaultour
default large and complex 
defaultsystem
default.  
defaultThere are distinctive 
defaultnational 
defaultconstitutional issues involved, such as the weak 
defaultseparation of the executive from the legislature, the absence of proportional voting and the lack of
default constitutional protection for local government
default, so that the checks and balances generally found in other comparable 
defaultjurisdictions 
defaultare
default absent
default.  
defaultFor example the 
defaultAcademies Act 
defaultpassed
default through Parliament at high speed in 2010 with very limited debate using spe
defaultcial powers intended for emergenc
defaulty situations
default such a
defaults those related to terrorism.  
default&#xa0;
default7.  
defaultAlso a
defaultcademies
default and other new types of school
default 
defaultsuch as ‘free’ and studio schools 
defaultoperate on the basis of funding agreements, 
defaultin effect 
defaultcontracts, made directly with the Secretary of State rather than any local arrangements 
defaultunder public law
default, a mechanism originally introduced by the previous Labour government.and extensively used by the present administration.  
defaultThis ‘governance by contract’
default raises 
defaultmajor 
defaultissues of public accountability, not least th
defaultat the contract is between the Secretary of S
defaulttate and the sponsor and neither the child nor the parent is a party to it
default. 
default 
defaultThere is a significant and growing democratic deficit
default 
defaultindicating 
defaulta crisis 
defaultof legitimacy
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.  
defaultNone of this is to suggest that central government should have no role in shaping and monitoring the system.  At present however ownership is determined too heavily by its control over resources and as a consequence the distribution of 
defaultpower has become seriously unbalanced.  More than a decade ago the distinguished philosopher Onora O’Neill argued in he
defaultr acclaimed BBC Reith Lectures that 
defaultprof
defaultessionals and public servants should
default be given more scope “to serve the public rather than their p
defaultaymasters”
default.  In education there is just as much need today to achieve a better balance between upward, lateral and downward accountability.
default&#xa0;
default9.  
defaultThe issue becomes even more acute in relation to the academy chains which are currently proliferating.  Althou
defaultgh they vary in style and organisation, their head offices and centres of power are generally distant from the social, economic and geographical communities in which the schools are located, 
defaultso that 
defaultsubstantial control 
defaultis 
defaultexercised remotely.  This model is
default very different from that of the ‘independent state school’
default and 
defaultit 
defaultoffers little scope for local democratic or strategic co-ordination or community governance.  It can fairly be said that schools in chains are not independent, they just have different mast
defaulters.
default  In fact the barrister 
defaultDavid Wolfe
default who specialises in education law has pointed 
defaultout that a maintained school entering into a sponsored academy chain loses its distinct legal identity – it becomes simply the educational activity which the sponsor provides at that particular location under its funding agreement.  In fact Wolfe comments 
defaultthat the academy chains “have even greater control over the academies they run than did local education authorities” 
defaultbefore delegated
default 
defaultbudgets and so on were introduced a quarter of a
default 
defaultcentury ago
default.
default  It i
defaults a vivid 
defaultillustration 
defaultof how misleading the rhetorica
defaultl use of terms like autonomy can be.
default  
default&#xa0;
default10.  
defaultPolicy has also since the late 1980s strongly reflected a belief in the power of competition to improve schooling.  However a major OECD review in 2010 of more than 250 studies found very little e
defaultvidence to supp
defaultort this view
default.  According to this wide-ranging study
default,
default i
defaultntroducing market mechanisms in education d
defaultoes
default not tend to generate innovation, it could increase social segregation and the evidence showed no link to improved teaching and learning
default.  There was no in
defaultdication that private providers did better than traditional ones.
default  Research
default from different contexts 
defaultshowed that co-operation
default between schools
default is a 
defaulthighly 
defaultfragile and vulnerable process in a competitive
default, market-driven
default climate.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe need for a new frameworkdefault&#xa0;
default11.  
defaultC
defaultontrary to much rhetoric, there is no convincing evidence that any particular type of school in terms of governance structure produces superior performance
default,
default 
defaultagainst the narrow criteria determined by policy-makers
default,
default 
defaultwhen all relevant factors are taken 
defaultinto account and like is rigorously compared with like.
default  Beyond this
default,
default 
defaultthe
default 
defaultgovernance of publicly-funded schooling 
defaultshould be far 
defaultmore than a technical matter of which provider can get the best test and exam results
default: moral, social and cultural issues 
defaultlie 
defaultat 
defaultthe 
defaultheart 
defaultof schooling
default.  If
default, for example,
default the 
defaultacademy chain 
defaultmodel became 
defaultmore 
defaultwidespread and some 
defaultchains 
defaultachieved control of 
defaultlarge numbers of schools, 
defaultas some aspire to do, 
defaultthe issue of who exercises legitimate power in the system would become prominent.
default&#xa0;
default12.  
defaultIn this 
defaultgeneral 
defaultcontext 
defaultthere is an urgent need 
defaultto define models and approaches that can deliver an alternative to the current polarisation: an excessive 
defaultfocus 
defaulton autonomy and competition
default 
defaulton the one hand and alienating and unsustainable centralisation
default on the other.  A new 
defaultframework 
defaultis 
defaultrequired 
defaultin 
defaultwhich trust and collaboration
default 
defaultare emphasised 
defaultand which spreads ownership to loca
defaultl communities 
defaultand stakeholders 
defaultwithin a pluralist multi-level system.
default  The support and performance management of all schools should be provided locally and the concept
defaults 
defaultof ‘local school system’ 
defaultand ‘local family of schools’ should have real meaning.  It is not right for the only significant democratic input to schooling to 
defaultbe at central level.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default13.  The Committee will 
defaultno doubt 
defaultreceive numerous 
defaultdetailed 
defaultformulations and I hope will assess them at least in part 
defaultagainst 
defaultthe above criteria.  
defaultI want to make one specific proposal.  The arrival of academies has brought with it st
defaultark differences in the ways in which publicly-funded schools are governed.   This is unfair
default, divisive
default and 
defaultindefensible.  
defaultAll publicly-funded schools should be 
defaultplaced within a common administrative
default and legal framework based on the principles of public not c
defaultontract law.
default  It follows that variations in levels of autonomy between different categories of school should be kept to an absolute minimum and a strong and convincing rationale should be provided for any such differences, which is not the case currently.
default&#xa0;
default14.  This proposal puts into strong focus the regime of outsourcing embodied in the 
defaultmechanism of 
defaultfunding agreements applied to academies.  
defaultThis method
default (
defaultwhich is highly idiosyncratic 
defaultfor this type of purpose internationally)
default was not designed to be operate
defaultd 
defaulton the kind of scale at
default which it is now being employed.  
default In view of recent incidents it 
defaultis becoming even
default clearer that this process cannot be managed at 
defaultsuch a 
defaultscale by central government without major risk
defaults but it is also unlikely that local authorities
default or other middle tier bodies, such as the regional ‘headteacher boards’ 
defaultled 
defaultby ‘chancellors’ that the government is reported to
default be planning, could effectively, 
defaultconsistently 
defaultand
default economically 
defaultdo so either.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultIt would be irresponsible to continue along this pa
defaultth.
default  
defaultThe aim should be to phase this system out as existing agreements come to the end of their life.  In the meantime an approach based on over-riding the agreements by regulation and/or by primary legislation “in order to bring proper coherence and resto
defaultre a schools ‘system’” as proposed by 
defaultDavid Wolfe
default should be adopted.
default&#xa0;
default15.  
default 
defaultVarious models might be considered suitable for providing the common framework.  An obvious one is that of the maintained school trust.  This preserves that degree of 
default‘
defaultautonomy
default’
default 
defaultw
defaulthich has achieved such totemic significance in English policy discourse as well as allowing for the involvement of external bodies in governance which is claimed to have a beneficial impact.  It also facilitates strong collaborative arrangements and enable
defaults wide stakeholder involvement as successfully demonstrated, for example, by the Co-operative group of schools which now number over 600.  It might also allow faith schools to be 
defaulteffectively integrated.  
defaultStronger 
defaultregulation or reform of admissions
default might be
default required
default, since trust schools are their own admissions authorities.  
defaultThis is simply one possibility
default, 
defaultand legal as well as educational and administrative expertise would need to be brought to bear on fashioning an appropriate framework.  What is 
defaultrequired 
defaulta
defaultbove all is 
defaultan inclusive and integrated 
defaultset of arrangements which avoid
defaults
default favouritism and 
defaultunjustified hierarchies.  To my knowledge
default, the most successful educational systems, combining high quality with equity, have such arrangements at their heart
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultEXECUTIVE SUMMARYdefault&#xa0;defaultThe status and image of independent schooling exert a powerful influence on the public imagination and this has encouraged politicians to seek to mimic the governance structure of the English private school in state-funded schooling, 
defaultmost notably in relation to academies.
default  Autonomy is not as simple a concept as is often implied and key questions about it are: autonomy over what and for whom?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe centre has secured ever greater control to impose its preferences about school structure, 
defaultcurriculum and assessment on our large and complex system.  
defaultThere is a significant and growing democratic deficit indicating a crisis of legitimacy.

default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ‘academy chain’ model is very different from that of the ‘independent state school’ and it offers little scope for local democratic or strategic co-ordination or community governance.  It can fairly be said that schools in chains are not indepe

defaultA new fram
defaultework is required in which trust and collaboration are emphasised and which spreads ownership to local communities and stakeholders within a pluralist multi-level system.  It is not right for the only significant democratic input to schooling to be at cent
defaultral level.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll publicly-funded schools should be placed within a common administrative and legal framework based on the principles of public not contract law.
