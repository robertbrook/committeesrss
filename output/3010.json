"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nSouth East Local Transport Board\n (SRN 024)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe South East Local Transport Board (SELTB) \nwelcomes\n this opportunity to provide input to the Select Committee’s Inquiry into the Strategic Road Network\n \n(SRN)\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe SELTB is working closely with the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP), local authorities and businesses in the preparation of SELEP\n’s Strategic Economic Plan. The LEP-wide growth priorities emerging from this work \nclearly require\n a \nhigh quality SRN to provide real and direct economic benefits. \n&#xa0;\nThe SELTB shares the concerns of its Local Transport Authorities in relation to Highways Agency procedures in relation to the delivery of schemes and attracting private sector funding. In its separate submission to the Committee, Kent County Council has \npr\novided\n \nexamples of how private sector funding may be secured and where \nLocal Transport Authorities\n could provide schemes on the SRN more efficiently and cost effectively\n than the Highways Agency\n. The SELTB is of the opinion that \nsimilar examples could be p\nrovided across the \nUK\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn the context of the set questions the SELTB offers the following responses.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHighways Agency sche\nmes generally have been motor vehicle-centric with little regard to other users apart from the need to safely accommodate them. Any policies that will result in greater emphasis given on encouraging sustainable transport would be welcome. However, at a ver\ny recent stakeholders meeting with the Highways Agency and their consultants relating to the proposed improvements at the M25/A13 Junction 30\n,\n consideration for non-motorised modes \non the A13 \nappear to have been minimal in developing the scheme.  Whilst \nnew policies to “maximise green gains”, “decarbonising roads” and providing a “netwo\nrk for walkers and cycles” are\n welcomed\n,\n \nthe SELTB has reservations about the extent to which these will be delivered.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe answer to the previous question also relates to this question. In addition the SELTB welcomes the current engagement on the Route Based Strategies and anticipates that this may be a means to provide useful \ninput to enable the link between roads policy and planning for other transport modes.\n It is good to see the traditional stand of seeking to over-protect the trunk road network moderated by the need to stimulate \neconomic development. This is to be encourage\nd and applauded.\n However, further work is required, for example policies such as Circular 02/2013 need relaxing to encourage the delivery of schemes that would stimulate development, economic growth and job creation; thus allowing the SRN to play its full \npart in supporting regeneration and economic prosperity. \nThe standard practice of automatically issuing holding notifications on schemes gives uncertainty to developers who immediately conclude there \nare \nproblems \nin delivering their schemes\n. In relation to\n the threshold for intervention being related to when there may be “severe” impacts, without any definition of what “severe” means, adds further uncertainty at this time when the viability of schemes is a concern. Currently there are concerns about the unr\neasonably high level of contributions initially sought \nby the Highways Agency \nfor S106/S278 agreements. An example of this is a new warehouse development at Tilbury for which the Highways Agency initially sought a contribution of £1m. Following discussions with Thurrock Council this was reduced to a more reasonable amount of £100k. \nThe initial figure sought clearly could have \nunnecessarily made the scheme unviable and stoppe\nd this job-creating development had Thurrock Council not intervened.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe SELTB recognises that we live in a changing economic world resulting in uncertainties in forecasting traffic growth. \nThe SELTB would advise\n the Government to remain transparent in its\n processes and the assumptio\nns it has made in its modelling\n,\n and undertake regular reality checks on its forecasts. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government has made \nsteps forward in embracing technology such as the introduction of Managed Motorways and the provision of traffic information to drivers. The SELTB supports the Government’s proposals to \nfurther \ndevelop such technology to reduce cong\nestion, improve safety and \nto \nincrease\n journey\n-\ntime\n reliability\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n        The introduction of funding certainty over a longer period would attract new investors\n t\nogether with more flexibility on the development and delivery of schemes. The SELTB’s Local Transport Authorities can provide examples \nof \nwhere they could be de\nlivering Highways Agency schemes \nmore e\nfficiently and cost-effectively and how private sector funding may be secured. Kent County Council’s separate submission to the Committee provides examples of these.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n        \nThe SELTB recommends that \nthe Government listens to the stakeholders’ concerns and \naction is taken to allow local delivery of major road schemes, provide greater flexibility in policies governing Highways Agency procedures, and take a more proactive approach to attract\ning\n private s\nector funding to deliver schemes and improve the SRN.\n&#xa0;\nThurrock Council’s Director of Planning and\n \nTransportation, David Bull, would \nbe pleased to \nrepresent the SELTB and \nprovide oral evidence at a Select Committee hearing on this matter. \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
