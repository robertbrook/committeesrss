defaultHow exceptional funding is working so far
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultThe process of applying for exceptional funding
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“You also argue that your client has mental health problems and you state that
default your client was “
defaultreferred for treatment to X Hospital where she subsequently received counselling
default” (paragraph 19 of grounds). However, there is no supporting evidence provided which outlines your client’s diagnosis and treatment.” 
defaultSourcing evidence
default may i
defaultnvolve obtaining a letter from a doctor
default or social worker
default. Many doctors charge fees for writing such reports.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe systemic flaws of the exceptional funding scheme
defaultApplications for exceptional funding are 
defaultmade
default at risk
default&#xa0;
default“An applicant for such funding already faces a high hurdle if it is to be secured. He or she must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director of casework that it would be a breach of their human rights not to provide funding for representation. That wi
defaultll, of necessity, involve a detailed explanation of the substance of the legal case to show why the applicant needs representation, plus evidence of any characteristics that contribute to the need for representation, and legal argument around the test bein
defaultg applied. It is not plausible for a client who meets the test and needs the exceptional funding criteria to demonstrate, without assistance, that they meet the test. It is a classic Catch-22 situation, and not the first in the Bill. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf we are not to fa
defaultll foul of our convention obligations, it is essential that legal aid funding is available to assist prospective clients to make an application under the test, and the amendment provides for such assistance to be made available. I hope that the Minister wi
defaultll accept it”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring the course of the debate, the Minister responded by stating (8 September 2011, Hansard report, page 403): 
default&#xa0;
default“Amendment 227 would ensure that civil legal services were provided for the purposes of making an exceptional funding applic
defaultation. I assure the Committee that the Government will implement appropriate procedures to ensure that those who require exceptional funding will, in practice, be able to access the scheme. To that end, we will of course engage with all interested parties,
default including key stakeholders, to discuss relevant procedural issues such as contracting and remuneration and the important practical questions surrounding applications to which her amendment alludes. On that basis, I hope that hon. Members will withdraw the
defaultir amendments”.
default              
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no procedure for urgent cases
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“If you wish the application
default to be treated as urgent you should complete page 13 of the CIV ECF1 to provide us with details as to the urgency of the case, for example an imminent date for a hearing or the imminent expiry of a limitation date or reasons why delay would cause risk of h
defaultarm or prejudice to the client’s case. We will consider the information that you have provided and if we agree, then we will deal with your case ahead of non-urgent applications. We aim to determine all cases within 20 working days from the date of receipt
default of the fully completed application. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever we cannot guarantee that the application will be determined before a hearing day or before specified urgent work is needed. We can provide information if you call our ECF telephone enquiry line about the likel
defaulty timeframe for completion of a pending application.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are no exemptions for children or people who lack capacity

default ‘Enforceable EU right’ is defined in section 2(1) of the European Communities Act  1972, which states: “(1) All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to 
defaulttime created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United 
defaultKingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly; and the expression “enforceable EU right” and similar expressions shall be read as referring to one to which this subsection applies.”
default Section 10 also ma
defaultkes provision for exceptional funding to be granted in certain inquests. The provisions relating to inquests are not considered further here. 
default Statistics will be published by the LAA on a quarterly basis. The next publication will therefore be on or arou
