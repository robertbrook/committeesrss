default              
defaultI am an independent statutory office holder appointed under the Senior Courts Act 1981.  My office derives from the long established duty of the State to protect the interests of those who lack capacity to protect themselves either because of minority or because of lack of mental capacity.  My duties and responsibilities derive from statute, rules of court, direction of the Lord Chancellor, common law, or established practice.  One of my primary functions is to act as last resort litigation friend.

default              
defaultThere are two classes of persons who are unable to conduct their own proceedings when involved in proceedings in the civil and family courts or in the Court of Protection - those who lack the mental capacity to do so (a protected party and, in the Court of Protection, ‘P’) and children (subject to defined exceptions under the rules).  Of course when a person lacks litigation capacity it is because they lack the capacity to conduct the litigation either with the assistance of a solicitor or in person whether with the assistance of a McKenzie Friend or otherwise.

default              
defaultRules of court both define who is a protected party and make special provision first for the protection of those parties but also for the protection of the other party or parties and of the court’s own process by requiring the appointment of a litigation friend.

defaultI have focussed here on the position of those with impaired mental capacity.

default              
defaultAs last resort litigation friend, my predecessors and I have never sought to, and indeed could not as a matter of law, recover our internal or administrative costs of being last resort litigation friend.  I may, and generally do, however, make my consent to act as litigation friend conditional on securing, from external sources, my costs of obtaining or providing legal services, except in cases involving medical treatment, where my involvement has long been regarded as a matter of necessity.  Those external sources include the Legal Aid Agency where the incapacitated person is eligible for legal aid, or that person’s own funds.  If the incapacitated party also lacks capacity to manage their own financial affairs, I will obtain authority in advance from the Court of Protection or from any financial deputy or attorney under a Lasting Power of Attorney or Enduring Power of Attorney to recover the costs from the protected party or P.

default              
defaultIf, because of removal of classes of case from scope or the changes to financial eligibility or operation of the residence test, funding for legal representation is unavailable for a party or intended party for whom rules of court require appointment of a litigation friend, and, practically, alternative funding is not available, there is a clear risk that person will be denied effective access to justice.
default              
default8.
default              
defaultThe reforms to legal aid introduced on 1 April 2013, in particular the abolition of the capital passport where a person receives certain State benefits, already cause such practical difficulty in funding of legal services.  For example legal aid will be refused if assessed disposable capital exceeds £8,000.  There are already cases where the incapacitated person is ineligible for legal aid because their sole asset is their home and the equity exceeds the capital disregard, but the reality is that the equity is practically unavailable and their income is unable to fund legal services.  It is unclear how the Government expects such a person to utilise their capital to fund litigation or otherwise to take steps to secure alternate funding for legal representation.  I would also point out that there may be no person with lawful authority to manage that incapacitated person’s financial affairs, that such persons are often at risk of, or have in fact suffered, financial abuse, and because of their impaired mental capacity will be particularly vulnerable in the context of alternate funding arrangements.
default9.
default              
defaultThe residence test imposes a further barrier.  The Government does not accept that the residence test proposal will disproportionately affect those who lead chaotic lives because it states that solicitors are well practiced in adducing the necessary information from the most vulnerable clients (
defaultTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps, 
defaultAnnex F: Equality Statement).  A person with impaired mental capacity is clearly a vulnerable client but the reality is that person may not be able to assist in providing the solicitor with the required information and documents or even with sufficient information to enable the solicitor to investigate further (if willing to do so) whether the residence test is met.
default10.
default              
defaultI note that in 
defaultTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps 
default(paragraph 2.14) the Government has said that there are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain matters of law would not be required to meet the residence test including where the individual is ‘particularly vulnerable’ or ‘where the case relates to the protection of children’.  In Annex B (paragraph 94) the Government notes that the respondents to the consultation raised particular concern about the impact on vulnerable groups of people and certain types of cases including those with mental health and mental capacity issues and records (paragraph 101) and that concern was raised regarding the position of individuals who would not meet the residence test and who lack capacity (under rules of court) to represent themselves.  I note that the Government has concluded that in certain further limited circumstances (
defaultTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps 
defaultAnnex B, paragraph 25) applicants for civil legal aid would not be required to meet the residence test but that concession is limited and the Government has not explained generally how the concern about the position of persons who lack capacity is met.
default11.
default              
defaultThe impact assessment annexed to 
defaultTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps 
defaulthas made a number of assumptions (paragraph 9) in the estimate of costs and benefits including assuming that individuals who no longer receive legal aid will adopt a range of approaches to resolve issues; they may choose to represent themselves in court, seek to resolve issues by themselves, pay for services which support self-resolution, or decide not to tackle the issue at all.   An incapacitated party is not able to represent themselves in court, is highly unlikely to be able to take steps to resolve the issues, or to undertake self-resolution. It is also unlikely that they will make a positive decision not to tackle the issue at all because of their impaired mental capacity and may not in fact either understand that there is an issue which requires resolution, or a legal right which should be enforced.  It may also not be open to the incapacity party to avoid proceedings as they may have to respond to proceedings brought by others and the decision is not therefore in their hands.

defaultI would point out that no alternative dispute resolution method was identified in the Ministry of Justice’s 
defaultTransforming legal aid: delivering a more credible and efficient system
default (CP14/2013) or its predecessor consultation
default Proposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales 
default(CP12/10) which would provide a fair process for a person lacking mental capacity, either to conduct litigation or to conduct their own property and affairs, for resolving the issues (having regard to the functional elements of capacitated decision making identified in section 3(1) Mental Capacity Act 2005) and arriving at a legally effective decision.  The Government’s response to the responses to consultation 
defaultTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps
default does not assist.
default13.
default              
defaultNor do I consider that the fact that any person excluded from civil legal aid as a result of the residence test is 
defaultentitled to apply for
default (but not to receive) exceptional funding under the power set out in section 10 of LASPO to be a safeguard sufficient to meet the concern about the position of those with impaired mental capacity.  The decision to grant exceptional funding is discretionary (regardless of whether the application would otherwise meet the means and merits test).  The Lord Chancellor’s Exceptional Funding Guidance makes clear that section 10(3)(b) LASPO does not provide a general power to fund cases that fall outside scope of legal aid and says in terms that the power is to be used for rare cases.   Although solicitors can assist a person to make an application for exceptional funding, legal aid for making the application is only be available retrospectively if the application is granted.

default              
defaultThe reality is that the most vulnerable will be left in a position where they do not have effective access to justice.
