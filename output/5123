defaulthe difficulty is in the big cities is probably the mix of how we travel is wrong. We need to encourage people to cycle and therefore we need to make the roads safe, and to do that you have to plan, not just one year, it's year on year, it's decade on 
defaultdecade, and other cities manage to do it, and we could do it too. It's very difficult to change the road layout for cyclists in a matter of months; it does take a long time planning, and it can be done, and it's done effectively across Europe.
defaultSo that's t
defaulthe first practical step you would take, just to try to encourage people to get out of their cars and onto bicycles?
defaultIt only needs people on the margin: the people who are more likely to do it, to encourage them. Of course there are people who won't do it 
defaultwhatever, but if enough people do it, it does make a change. We're talking about things on the margin.

defaultEchoing Andrew Davis’ point about 
defaultit only needing 
defaultpeople 
defaulton the margin
default to begin with
default, 
defaultCycling: the way ahead for towns and cities
default 
defaultspeaks of “encouraging 
defaultthe mass of non-cyclists who are most likely to take up cycling again". 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCycling: the way ahead
default 
defaultis the only publication out of Europe to answer the question: How to start? This is what it 
defaultsays about the function of facilities
default,
default in the chapter entitled 
default‘
defaultSafety: a responsibility
default’
default:
default&#xa0;
default“According to his or her physical aptitudes, balance, agility, rapidity 
defaultof reflexes and clarity of perception, the adult cyclist will instinctively choose his or her routes […]. Cyclists must therefore be enabled to circulate everywhere, on both secondary roads and major routes.
default&#xa0;
default“Children are a different category. Less capabl
defaulte than adults of choosing their itinerary according to their skills, they need guidance and various facilities all along their route. Routes leading to schools merit particular attention, therefore (and parents and schoolchildren are, moreover, very good a
defaultt advising on possible improvements).
default&#xa0;
default“In the town of Courtrai (Belgium), the town council is paying special attention to these routes and has not hesitated to take special measures during peak traffic times regarding school routes (some streets are close
defaultd to traffic in one direction, policemen are on duty at hazardous crossroads where there are no special facilities provided). As a result, 60% of the journeys made by schoolchildren are by bicycle.”
default&#xa0;
defaultYou can probably tell from the syntax that this work is 
defaultwritten by non-native English-speakers. 
defaultF
defaultor example, 
defaulti
defaultn big, bold lettering, on page 2 of the chapter about how to start,
default 
defaultit says: “The level of minimum functioning is a prudent course to follow.” Probably we would talk about the prudence of introducing the network to a minimum level of functioning, but already I am allowing myself to be side-tracked. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe point about safe r
defaultoutes to school is that they can be dealt with separately, as part of 
defaultlocal
default cycling plans. In London, for example, there are over 2,200 schools. If you sought to provide links to all of these schools at a strategic level, this 
defaultwould end up being an incredi
defaultbly 
defaultambitious
default undertaking. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCycling: the way ahead
default doesn’t mention the disabled at all, and talks about the elderly only in passing, but I want now to introduce to you some evidence from 
defaultPor
defaulttland, Oregon.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Cycling Coordinator there, a chap called Roge
defaultr Geller, has written a famous paper entitled 
defaultFour types of cyclist
default. The four types are:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe strong and fearless make up about 1% of the population, and will cycle regardless of 
defaultthe conditions. 
default(
defaultOr rather, they are more concerned about potholes than heavy traffic.
default)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe enthused and confident make up about 8-10% of the population, and they include people like myself.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe interested but concerned make up about 60% of the population. In high cycling countries, th
defaulte authorities have found that it has paid off
default to 
defaultensure t
defaulthat this group is properly 
defaultprovide
defaultd
default for. Thus we see the development of protected cycleways and the like. Cities like Cambridge, certainly, and York, probably, are now in a position where they can seriously consider the provision of quality infrastructure 
defaultat a strategic level, but cities like London and Manchester don’t even 
defaulthave the basics in place just
default yet
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exemplar schemes which are proposed for London and Manchester are all to the good, of course, but only up to a point. 
defaultTo begin with, Lynn Sloman 
defaulthas suggested, the focus of our attention should switch from a few grandiose schemes to thousands of small initiatives. "Even if their impact is not massive,"
default&#xa0;
defaultCycling: the way ahead
default&#xa0;
defaultexplains, "it will be real."
default&#xa0;
defaultOkay, so the basic strategy is as follows: 
defaultplan, study and then “introduce” a cycle network
default. O
defaultnce it is up and running, develop it further “on the basis of priorit
defaulty interventions and a timetable
default”
default.
default This strategy is still running its course in the Netherlands
default (the Dutch program these things to work i
defaultn twe
defaultnty-year cycles, I believe
default)
default. It is absolutely the tried and tested method, and it is incredibly frustrating that people here consistently find ways to misunderstand it.
default&#xa0;
default“Oh, we’ve tried all that!” 
defaultsome of them
default say, confusing a 
defaultcycle network which fun
defaultctions at a 
defaultminimum level as “more of the same”. But actually it’s a means to an end, a stepping-stone. The eastern philosophers talk about going from zero to one as being the hardest step, and in this case, ‘one’
default is a comprehensive, city-wide
default cycle networ
defaultk
default. Once the network has been ma
defaultde to work, once it is functioning
default,
default once it is up and running, 
defaultgoing from one to two, from two to three, from three to four, and so on,
default would be
default relatively quite easy. By the time you 
defaultneed to 
defaultgo from six to seven, you find th
defaultat 
defaultyou can skip along
default. But without a solid foundation, 
defaultit’s very difficult to build upwards
default in any sort of meaningful way
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe case is, there isn’t a single town or city in this country which has a functioning cycle network, so how can people say this 
defaultapproach has been tried before?
default&#xa0;
defaultJust a few words about a network introduced to the point where
default it functions. I
defaultt is of paramount importance that cyclists are visible to motor traffic.
default 
defaultThis 
defaultdoes not mean hi-viz; rather it 
defaultmeans th
defaultat cyclists 
defaulthave to be posi
defaulttioned in the correct place relative to 
defaulteveryone else
default. 
defaultFor example, r
defaultesearch from Denmark suggests that the 'bike box' should be at least five metres deep (so that lorry drivers have a direct view of any cyclists who may be waiting ahead of them).
default&#xa0;
defaultStressing that I am talking here about short-term solutions, another measure—which is linked to a different aspect of good cycle provision—is to make alternative cycle routes more numerous, more comfortable, easier to follow, and more convenient (by removi
defaultng annoyances for cyclists, for example).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis said, as reported in the 
defaultCycle Network and Route Planning Guide
default: “
defaultAlternative routes merely supplement the main road routes, and rarely eliminate the need fo
defaultr cycle provision on the latter”; and also: “
defaultIndirect cycle routes may lead cyclists to choose more d
defaultirect routes with greater risk”.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, there is no debate between myself and other cycle advocates about where we would like to end up. No, the debate is about where to begin. I have asked them ma
defaultybe a thousand million, billion squillion times why they are not campaigning for the installation of high quality infrastructure to be undertaken within the framework provided by a functioning cycle netw
defaultork. I never do get an answer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe often hear in this country about how dangerous cycling is, but rather than focus on the removal of a negative, why don’t we try to build on a positive? For 
defaultthe Enthused and Confident 
defaultcyclists, the problem is not so much safety
default, as
default access. 
defaultT
defaulthe bicycle is
default the fastest, most convenient form of transport in the built-up area. If we opened up our one-way streets and parks to cycling, people would respond very positively.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would like to close with a quote from Steffen Rasmussen from the City of Copenhagen. He
default came to give evidence to the GLA eighteen months ago, and the very first thing he said
default—
defaultthe very first thing
default—
defaultwas as follows: “The key word is an holistic approach and then a separation of functions.”
default&#xa0;
defaultKey Points
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultNetwork first
defaultLong-term plan – sustained i
defaultnvestment
defaultBuild on the positives 
defaultTreat routes to school separately
defaultConsider, at a strategic level, is it practical to design facilities for cyclists of basic competence
default 
defaultat this stage
default?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso, I have abridged three important chapters from 
defaultCycling: the way 
defaultahead
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultSafety: a responsibility
default&#xa0;
default(chapter 4),
default&#xa0;
defaultDaring to redistribute space and means
default&#xa0;
default(chapter 5), and
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat
default needs to be known
default&#xa0;
default(chapter 6).
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, forgive the preamble, but I have also transcribed much of the Transport Select Committee’s 
defaultInvestigation into cycle safety
default.
