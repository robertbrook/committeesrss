[[[Hands Off Our Schools]]]

[[[’]]]&#xa0;INTRODUCTION&#xa0;1. ‘Hands Off Our Schools’ is a campaign group comprising local parents, teachers, governors and councilors, which monitors local schools and campaigns against academisation and free schools in the Nottingham and Nottinghamshire area. It is not affiliated to any political party.  The group is clear in its aims: we oppose academy conversions and free schools because we see this development as a loss of community control of our local schools, combined with an incoherent and chaotic approach to the provision of school places. Our view is that within such a system, democratic control will diminish whilst educational inequalities are likely to increase.&#xa0;SUMMARY&#xa0;2. In our experience, detailed in this submission, we are already seeing our concerns being realised.  However, of equal concern, is that the processes by which academies and free schools are emerging are far from clear.  There are key questions about the community use of public money and yet we have consistently experienced attempts to stifle or avoid public debate on these key issues by those pursuing particular agendas. This is sometimes achieved by refusing to engage in meaningful consultation, but in other instances it is achieved through acts of bullying and intimidation, of employees and ourselves.&#xa0;3. Our concerns therefore centre on several issues and can be summarized as follows: &#xa0;i.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; loss of democratic oversight of schools (including school place planning); ii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; lack of democratic procedures in the process of academisation and the setting up of free schools; iii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; growing 'conflicts of interest' emerging in the academy/free school 'world' (and associated opacity in relation to these); iv.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the increasingly inefficient use of resources for items that are not directly related to education. &#xa0;SUBMISSION&#xa0;4. This submission gives case study examples from our area of all these issues [within the submission we have anonymised all schools – the full list of schools mentioned, with brief descriptors, is provided at the end of this submission].&#xa0;&#xa0;5. We have been struck by the way those who are 'for' academy status are unprepared to engage in debate with those of us who oppose. In our experience, those 'pushing' for academy status are often the head and chair of governors of a school. Typically, they will arrange for the governing body to be addressed by another proponent of academies who gives all the arguments 'for' whilst no-one is invited to put the case 'against' (where we have been invited we have been well-received.) Sometimes the academy proponent is portrayed as a ‘neutral’ who is giving ‘the facts’ in an unbiased way. 'Consultation' with parents usually follows the same pattern and staff are often simply informed. The impression is given that the change is going to happen, it is non-controversial and that everyone agrees it's self evidently a 'good thing'. We are aware of many instances where staff feel afraid to express opinions that might oppose a potential academisation.&#xa0;6. In our area, F Primary was going through the process of academisation, to become part of the G Trust. The staff of another local primary, B, who were also facing academisation as part of the G Trust and who were anxious about it, arranged a meeting for all staff from local schools to discuss it. No-one from F attended and we have been informed by a reliable source that letters about the meeting that were individually addressed to School F teachers were, on the orders of the head teacher, intercepted and destroyed.&#xa0;7. At A Primary school, the upcoming academisation was publicly announced on the website of the 'parent' school (G, of which, more later) whilst the so-called 'consultation' period was still ongoing.&#xa0;8. The G Trust is a developing organisation in our area, centred on the G secondary school. It is gathering to it a number of local primary schools, those that might be considered in its local 'family', though not all. In those schools, the arguments 'for' include the benefit of close working with G. This is an argument being put at B Junior School but whilst that debate has continued (the staff are active in opposition) it is clear the school has continued to work closely with G, so academisation would appear to be unnecessary. C Primary Academy was an early ‘converter academy’ as part of the G Trust and the head has been active in promoting academy status to others. He acted as a kind of 'super head'/adviser to E Primary. &#xa0;9. The Chair of Governors at A Primary is a former Vice Principal at G, who now runs a consultancy which has done work for G. The senior office manager at C is Chair of Governors at G. The wife of the B Chair of Governors is a former deputy at the same school, later a local headteacher herself and then independent adviser to Nottinghamshire CC. She now runs her own education consultancy and has done some training at G. Recently she was co-opted onto the governors at H and became Chair of the Finance Committee straight away, at the instigation of the headteacher. No suggestion is made that anyone has broken any laws but it concerns us that an ‘inner circle’ of networked individuals is emerging in which a relatively small number of people who clearly know each other well are making significant and critical decisions about the future of schools in our area.  There is no meaningful community involvement in these decisions and there is no democratic process whereby the local community has a meaningful voice in the decisions being made.  &#xa0;10. A final decision has not yet been made over academisation at B in part, we think, because of the active opposition of many staff there, supported and encouraged by us. However, another explanation is that the governors are waiting for the local authority to foot the bill for a much needed new roof, before then taking the school out of local authority control.  If this is the case, it illustrates how key decisions about local management of our community schools are being driven by concerns that have nothing to do with educational arguments, or debates about community control – but everything to do with principles of accountancy. We do not believe this is in the interests of the effective stewardship of public finances, let alone the best interests of our children.   Something similar appears to be happening at H, a large primary school, where expansion is likely to happen with funding from the LA. However, meetings of governors have taken place with the head autocratically driving the agenda. This is illustrated by the headteacher of C being invited to a governors’ meeting to present the ‘academy’ case (no-one was invited to put the case ‘against’) : governors were told they could only ask questions if these had been submitted in advance. We believe this is extraordinary.  How can governors have an intelligent and open debate about a critical issue if they are not able to respond to points raised in the presentation at the meeting? It exemplifies very clearly how important debates are often one-sided, stage managed and closed down.  In this same school (H) we have been reliably informed that the staff governors are not elected but appointed by the headteacher, in rotation, for 'staff development' purposes! &#xa0;11. In recent months, much of our efforts have been put into opposing two proposed free schools (L and M) in our area. The DfE approved one of these, the M Free School: both of the schools were mooted by J K Trust which is, effectively, J Comprehensive and the K School, a failing school which the 'outstanding' J has been supporting (NB an OFSTED judgment made in December 2011). There is no shortage of secondary places in the Sherwood area of Nottingham where the M Free School will, apparently, be located.  We believe that the introduction of a free school into the area will badly destabilise existing provision and will be both inefficient and a threat to quality.&#xa0;12. We have therefore continued to oppose the M Free School, aiming to influence the parents of potential recruits, through letters and statements to the local press and by handing out leaflets at primary schools and at open meetings publicising the Free School. The J K Trust has not engaged with us via the media but reacted very strongly to our leaflets, issuing a threatening letter, taking issue with our statements - and the questions raised - in the leaflet. We are satisfied that none of their complaints are justified: for example, we made much of the fact that currently there was (and still is) no publicly announced site for the new school and that as it is a new school parents couldn't talk to existing parents and pupils or view an OFSTED report or check examination outcomes. These are self-evident facts, yet J K Trust seemed to think that because they could raise counter arguments, what we had said was a 'malicious falsehood'. Although we were confident in what we had said, J K 's letter threatened legal action and as a small voluntary group with little in the way of funds, we couldn't afford legal advice or representation and therefore we have had to stop issuing the leaflet. None of the consequential actions threatened by J K have been pursued but we do feel as if we have been bullied into silence. We think this might in part be because we were instrumental in an article in the local press that revealed the sums earned by the Chief Executive of J K  (the former headteacher of J) and other local 'executive principals' including at G. As the Nottingham Post said, these are well in excess of the published pay scales for headteachers in maintained schools and we believe they offer another example of how resources are being misdirected in the new school system.&#xa0;13. The development of academies has involved expenditure that we think would have been better spent directly on education. Several schools or ‘trusts’ have executive principals or CEOs in addition to headteachers, several of whom are paid extremely well (as reported in the Nottingham Post - http://www.nottinghampost.com/Heads-Notts-academies-earn-PM/story-19840343-detail/story.html); a wide range of posts are proliferating at academies as evidenced by the Jobs Section of the Nottingham Post.  These posts may perform important roles, however we question, for example, the educational value of a ‘Publicity Officer’ (recently advertised by J K Trust) that appears to have more to do with marketing than teaching children in classrooms. Moreover we question whether the move away from local authority provision has resulted in the reduction of bureaucracy that was always claimed by advocates of academisation. Indeed, as multi-academy trusts in our area grow, many have established business premises located away from schools.  This again suggests that the argument that academisation would direct resources away from town halls and into schools is proving misguided.  Rather we are seeing new bureaucracies being created, in one case located in a premium location in the business district of Nottingham. &#xa0;14. We wonder also how much money the New Schools Network (a publicly funded quango run by people close to Michael Gove) has put into supporting the J K free schools (L, M and N). The original two had websites from early on, which featured children apparently wearing the L Free School uniform; the same child models and people pretending to be teachers appeared on the ‘sister’ M Free School web site (the L FS site has been taken down after the DfE failed to support it and, in its place, at the same address, a website for the N Free School has appeared. How much public money has been wasted there?). In passing, we also question whether the adults and young people who appeared – and still appear - in the website pictures were paid models or members of staff/students at J or K? If the latter, were proper permissions and procedures followed? Whatever the case, public money has been – and is being – spent to promote these schools, one of which at least will not come to pass.&#xa0;CONCLUSION14. In short, therefore, those who promote academies and free schools in our area do not engage in debate or proper consultation with those who might be considered legitimate stake-holders, preferring to further their cause by more underhand means including, where they feel it necessary, threat and intimidation. They also appear to be engaged in an undemocratic behind-the-scenes 'network' of dubious conflicted interests, with clear financial benefits for some at the top. Finally, posing as both more effective and efficient than local authority schools, academies and free schools actually appear to waste public money - on additional management/admin posts or promotion - that could be better spent on the education of children. As yet, we have seen little evidence locally that academies are more effective than their local authority predecessors and counterparts. &#xa0;15. In conclusion, we very much welcome the Select Committee review, and the opportunity to present our arguments.  As we indicate, we are a relatively small group, and we are all volunteers.  We have no resources of an appreciable nature.  We are clear that we are opposed to academies and free schools, for the reasons indicated.  However, our concerns are not just that our criticisms of academies and free schools appear to be well-founded, but that genuine community debate on these issues is often being stifled.  As a group of local people, we are well connected to parents, governors and those who work in schools.  We therefore hear what is happening in schools, and how decisions are being made. We know what is going on.  However, as a small group of local campaigners, with very few resources, we are left with anecdotal rather than systematic evidence.  We also understand that those who seek to stifle debate in the ways we have described have no interest in opening themselves up to serious research into their processes of governance.&#xa0;16. Our view is that there is an urgent need to commission serious, detailed and independent research into many of the issues identified in this submission.  There is much that is rotten in the governance of schools currently if our stories are replicated on a much wider scale across the country.  Much more difficult and penetrating questions need to be posed, and appropriate research undertaken, if we are to develop a more authentic understanding of what is really happening in our schools.  We hope that the Select Committee Review is the start of this process, and that much more work will be undertaken as a result.&#xa0;
