[[[Craven Naturalists and Scientific Association – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I write to you both as President of the Craven Naturalists and Scientific Association, and as a regular hill walker in the Yorkshire Dales.&#xa0;I, and my association, are most concerned about the potential implications of the draft Deregulation Bill on Byways and green lanes in the Yorkshire Dales.  These lanes were not designed or constructed to take wheeled vehicles, and whilst we fully accept the needs of farmers and other landowners to gain access to their property, the considerable damage that can be, and is, done by leisure vehicles (both 4x4 type vehicles and motorbikes) is considerable.  Such damaged lanes do not recover either their appearance or their natural flora for years, if at all. In addition, they become unpleasant, and occasionally well-nigh impassable for walkers.&#xa0;We therefore ask that all unsealed byways should be accepted as not suitable for road traffic, and as such they should be re-classified as Restricted Byways, allowing landowners proper access, but preventing recreational vehicles and the concomitant excessive damage.&#xa0;In addition, we ask for a right of appeal to an independent body against any decision by the appropriate local authority when it declines to impose a Traffic Restriction Order.&#xa0;We strongly support the submissions made by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance, and other bodies such as the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance, the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group and the Green Lanes Protection Group.&#xa0;V G Edy&#xa0;&#xa0;1 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
