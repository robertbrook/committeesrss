Written evidence from the British Association and College of Occupational Therapists (LTC 46)default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault and Summarydefault&#xa0;defaultThe College of Occupational Therapists
default, the professional body representing over 29,000 occupational therapists and OT staff, 
defaultis pleased to 
defaultrespond
default to the Health Select Committee Inquiry into 
defaultthe Management of L
defaultong 
defaultTerm C
defaultonditions.
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe College of Occupational 
defaultT
defaultherapists believe
defaults
default that OTs c
defaultan
default pla
defaulty a greater role in supporting 
defaultpeople to be treated outside of hospital. 
defaultOTs are already he
defaultavily involved in 
defaultenabling community care and COT b
defaultelieve
defaults
default that investment in OTs is cost effective, saving the NHS money in both the short and 
defaultlong
default term. 
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe government should 
defaultutilise 
defaultoccupational therapists’ skills
default, which are already available, and further develop their roles, in order for more people to be treated outside hospital.
default 
defaultThey should also 
defaulttake greater account of 
defaultoccupational therapists’ 
defaultability to use both a medical and a social model of health and disability when working with clients. 
defaultFinally, the government should plan for the long term, so that 
defaultthe impact of interventions can be evaluated comprehensively.
default 
default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe pattern of service provision for people with long term conditions
default appears to be 
defaultpiecemeal, with some examples of good practice and other reports o
defaultf lack of investment and coordination of services.
default 
defaultOne of our members reports, for example, that specialist services provided by acute services are not followed up in the community,
default even when such 
defaultintervention would only need to be brief.
default 
defaultCOT would like to see a consistent approach to service design and delivery, taking into account the examples of good practice which are available.
default 
defaultFor example:-
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOccupational therapists
default are involved in 
defaultEarly Supported Discharge (ESD) services f
defaultor people who have had a stroke. 
default‘A National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellenc
defaulte assessment of 
defaultits (Camden Reach Early Discharge Service
default) approach showed that savings of £83,000 per 100,000 population can be achieved through reduction of an average of 10 stroke bed days and by reducing ongoing dependence on social care packages by an average of 19 hours per week.’
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOccupational therapists working for social services also enable patients to return to, or remain in
default,
default the community 
defaultby providing
default home adaptations, making moving and handling recommendations and 
defaultdelivering
default 
defaultreablement
default services
default.
default 
defaultS
defaultuch activities also result in cost-savings.
default For example
default, o
defaultne exa
defaultmple of a 
defaultreablement
default service including
default occupational therapy 
defaultshowed
default that outcomes 
defaultimproved for citizens over a four week period, increased the skills of rehab support workers and saved an estimated £780 per citiz
defaulten over the 
defaultreablement
default period
default. 
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultO
defaultccupational therapists 
defaultare employed 
defaultin A&amp;E departments to prevent unnecessary admissions
default by
default conduct
defaulting rapid assessments, arranging 
defaultdischarge home with the necessary care arrangements and equipment in place, or 
defaulttransferring patients to more appropriate services by using
default links with intermediate care and social services. This result
defaults
default in significant cost savings
default. 
default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCOT would like to see greater AHP involvement in commissioning decisions, alongside GPs, nurses and doctors based in secondary care.
default 
defaultUseful sources of assistance in the commissioning of community based care are the Allied Health Professions (AHP) AHP Toolkits
default, developed by the AHP Leads working with NHS London.
default 
default‘
defaultThey define exactly how each AHP, including occupational therapists, contribute to each step of the pathway, and base this on clear evidence.’ (COT 2013 p7).
default. 
defaultThe toolkits have been produced for six major care pathways, including stroke, 
defaultmusculo
default-skeletal conditions, cancer and diabetes. 
default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOccupational therapists tend to take a functional approach when working with individuals, taking into account how they may be affected physically, cognitively and psychologically by their condition or conditions.
default 
defaultThis helps the person to be seen ‘as a whole’; ‘Techniques used may be rehabilitative (enabling a person to regain reduced abilities) educational (for example, managing fatigue that may be associated with the condition) or adaptive (for
default 
defaultexample, finding new, easier ways of carrying out tasks, often using equipment or assistive technology).’
default.
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany services are commissioned based on outcomes which relate to single conditions, and this negatively affects the ability of NHS and social care providers to treat people who have several long term conditions.
default 
defaultCommissioning problems could be addressed by using functional as well as condition specific outcome measures.
default 
defaultThe NHS Outcomes Framework does include ‘functional ability’ as one of the overarching indicators for long term conditions, but this is then measured by usi
defaultng employment as an indicator. Al
defaultthough employment is important, f
defaultunctional ability incorporates many factors such as mobility, se
defaultlf care, domestic activities
default. COT would like to see a greater variety of functional and occupational performance measures included within the framework. 
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne way in which o
defaultccupational therapists work with people who may have several long term conditions is through their approach to vocational rehabilitation.
default 
defaultIn relation to this, The AHP Advisory Fitness for Work Report has been launched recently.
default 
defaultThis tool has b
defaulteen developed to enable AHPs
default to advise on the functional impact of a patient’s condition on his/
defaulther ability to work and to recommend workplace adjustments. 
defaultThe focus on functional ability helps to tailor intervention to the person’s needs, rather than towards specific condition(s)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOccupational therapists are well placed to contribute to obesity prevention and management.
default 
defaultFor example in primary care, they have a role in prevention of obesity in ‘high risk’ groups, such as people with disabilities.
default 
defaultIn tertiary care the occupational therapy role within bariatric teams includes addressing problems with daily activities, improving mobility within home and community, increasing physical stamina, teaching relaxation and communication skills and use of techniques such as motivational interviewing to change activity patterns and eating habits
default. Occupational therapists also have a major role in the prescription of bariatric equipment as necessary, making the judgement between ensuring safety and optimising activity levels. 
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCOT would like to see
default occupational therapists role in health pr
defaultomotion and prevention work, such as obesity management 
defaultrecognised, for
default example, by including it in service 
defaultand person specifications
default. 
default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOccupational therapists have a significant contribution to make to
default the 
defaultprovision of integrated care, working across health, social care, housing, employment, cha
defaultrity and independent sectors
default.
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne example of effective integrated care is the 
defaultNeuro
default Case Management Service in Sheffield.
default 
defaultThe service integrates care across health, social and voluntary sector, whilst providing personalised care.
default 
defaultThe team consists of three occupational therapists and one nurse, working as case managers, with the four health professionals being responsible for a case load of over 800 people.
default 
defaultThe service ha
defaults been commissioned to provide:
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe implications of an ageing population include that more people will be living with several long term conditions including dementia
default, 
defaultmusculo
default-skeletal conditions and general frailty.
default 
defaultMore people will also be living with mental health issues.
default 
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany recommendations have already been made on how to improve capacity and quality of care
default 
defaultfor people with dementia
default.
default 
defaultThe role which occupational therapists can pl
defaultay includes:
default7.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the population ages, it is important that older people’s mental well-being is supported and maintained.
default 
defaultOTs
default can improve mental well-being by promoting physical activity when working with older people, as evidenced by N
defaultICE Public Health Guidance
default 16
default.
default 
defaultOTs also
default have a key 
defaultrole in 
defaultreablement
default, admissi
defaulton avoidance 
defaultand falls prevention
default. 
default7.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the longer term, it will be 
defaultimportant to improve health equality
default, both as an end in itself and to reduce the overall increases in demands on services brought about by an ageing population.
default 
defaultThis will require the social determi
defaultnants of health to be addressed by
default 
defaulto
defaultccupational therapists
default and
default other health professionals
default.
default 
default7.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCOT would like the government to recognise and promote the important role which occupational therapists can and do play in addressing the mental and physical health needs of older people, as well as their role in addressing the social determinants of health.
default 
defaultThe latter aspect of their role will help to manage future demands on services for older people.
default 
default&#xa0;default8.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultO
defaultccupational therapists have always recognised
default the fundamental link between physical and mental health
default, and work to address both aspects, within the constraints of the services in which they work.
default 
defaultCOT
default would like to see this role recognised and suppo
defaultrted in commissioning decisions
default. 
defaultExamples of conditions for which occupational therapists address the psychological and cognitive aspects of long term physical conditions include rheumatologic conditions
default, limb amputation
default stroke
defaultacquired brain injury
defaultand progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis
default and Parkinson’s disease
default.
default8.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Mental Health
default Network publication, 
defaultInvesting 
defaultin emotional and psychological wellbeing for patients with long term conditions
default provides many examples of the importance of addressing 
defaultthe mental health needs of people with long term physical health conditions
default.
default 
defaultMany of
default the services mentioned
default are characterised by the ability to treat both the physical and psychological aspects of the condition and a multi-disciplinary approach to intervention, with teams including allied health professions such as occupational therapists, as well as physicians and clinical nurse specialists.
default8.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn example of a service which treats mental health issues arising from living with long term condition(s) is the Norfolk and Suffolk Wellbeing Service.
default 
defaultPsychological Therapists and Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners use a CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) based approach to treat anxiety and depression.
default 
defaultIntervention includes delivering an 8 week workshop specifically for those with anxiety and/or depression who are living with any diagnosed long term physical health condition
default.
default 
default&#xa0;default9.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe College would like to see ser
defaultvices organised around a broad spectrum of conditions,
default over longer time frames
default, and using holistic approaches
default,
default in order for personalised care to be improved.
default These principles are illustrated in the example below:-
default9.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOccupational therapists enabled K, a woman with learning disabilities and morbid obesity, to regain her independence.
default 
defaultK was a 45 year old woman, living with her husband.
default 
defaultShe had a number of health and functional problems which had gone undetected, including morbid obesity (her weight was 33 stone), diabetes, respiratory failure and poor mobility.
default 
defaultShe remained in bed for 24 hours per day. OTs helped K by improving communication skills, goal setting, improving diet and exercise, and enabling mainstream health and social services to work more effectively with her.
default 
defaultThe outcome was that K lost 12 stone and is now able to manage her diabetes herself
default.
defaultAdditional commentsdefault10.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to provide more effective management for people with long term conditions, it may be useful to consider the definition of ‘health’ rather than ‘long term condition’.
default 
defaultThe Ottawa Charter states that
default,
default ‘
defaultHealth promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. To reach a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, an individual or group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations, to satisfy needs, and to change or cope with the environment.’
default 
defaultOccupational therapists are well placed to promote health amongst people with long term conditions
default as
default their approach focuses on all three elements of health.
