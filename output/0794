Written evidence from the British Association and College of Occupational Therapists (LTC 46)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold] and Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The College of Occupational Therapists
[normal], the professional body representing over 29,000 occupational therapists and OT staff, 
[normal]is pleased to 
[normal]respond
[normal] to the Health Select Committee Inquiry into 
[normal]the Management of L
[normal]ong 
[normal]Term C
[normal]onditions.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The College of Occupational 
[normal]T
[normal]herapists believe
[normal]s
[normal] that OTs c
[normal]an
[normal] pla
[normal]y a greater role in supporting 
[normal]people to be treated outside of hospital. 
[normal]OTs are already he
[normal]avily involved in 
[normal]enabling community care and COT b
[normal]elieve
[normal]s
[normal] that investment in OTs is cost effective, saving the NHS money in both the short and 
[normal]long
[normal] term. 
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he government should 
[normal]utilise 
[normal]occupational therapists’ skills
[normal], which are already available, and further develop their roles, in order for more people to be treated outside hospital.
[normal] 
[normal]They should also 
[normal]take greater account of 
[normal]occupational therapists’ 
[normal]ability to use both a medical and a social model of health and disability when working with clients. 
[normal]Finally, the government should plan for the long term, so that 
[normal]the impact of interventions can be evaluated comprehensively.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The pattern of service provision for people with long term conditions
[normal] appears to be 
[normal]piecemeal, with some examples of good practice and other reports o
[normal]f lack of investment and coordination of services.
[normal] 
[normal]One of our members reports, for example, that specialist services provided by acute services are not followed up in the community,
[normal] even when such 
[normal]intervention would only need to be brief.
[normal] 
[normal]COT would like to see a consistent approach to service design and delivery, taking into account the examples of good practice which are available.
[normal] 
[normal]For example:-
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Occupational therapists
[normal] are involved in 
[normal]Early Supported Discharge (ESD) services f
[normal]or people who have had a stroke. 
[normal]‘A National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellenc
[normal]e assessment of 
[normal]its (Camden Reach Early Discharge Service
[normal]) approach showed that savings of £83,000 per 100,000 population can be achieved through reduction of an average of 10 stroke bed days and by reducing ongoing dependence on social care packages by an average of 19 hours per week.’
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Occupational therapists working for social services also enable patients to return to, or remain in
[normal],
[normal] the community 
[normal]by providing
[normal] home adaptations, making moving and handling recommendations and 
[normal]delivering
[normal] 
[normal]reablement
[normal] services
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]uch activities also result in cost-savings.
[normal] For example
[normal], o
[normal]ne exa
[normal]mple of a 
[normal]reablement
[normal] service including
[normal] occupational therapy 
[normal]showed
[normal] that outcomes 
[normal]improved for citizens over a four week period, increased the skills of rehab support workers and saved an estimated £780 per citiz
[normal]en over the 
[normal]reablement
[normal] period
[normal]. 
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]O
[normal]ccupational therapists 
[normal]are employed 
[normal]in A&amp;E departments to prevent unnecessary admissions
[normal] by
[normal] conduct
[normal]ing rapid assessments, arranging 
[normal]discharge home with the necessary care arrangements and equipment in place, or 
[normal]transferring patients to more appropriate services by using
[normal] links with intermediate care and social services. This result
[normal]s
[normal] in significant cost savings
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]COT would like to see greater AHP involvement in commissioning decisions, alongside GPs, nurses and doctors based in secondary care.
[normal] 
[normal]Useful sources of assistance in the commissioning of community based care are the Allied Health Professions (AHP) AHP Toolkits
[normal], developed by the AHP Leads working with NHS London.
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]They define exactly how each AHP, including occupational therapists, contribute to each step of the pathway, and base this on clear evidence.’ (COT 2013 p7).
[normal]. 
[normal]The toolkits have been produced for six major care pathways, including stroke, 
[normal]musculo
[normal]-skeletal conditions, cancer and diabetes. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Occupational therapists tend to take a functional approach when working with individuals, taking into account how they may be affected physically, cognitively and psychologically by their condition or conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]This helps the person to be seen ‘as a whole’; ‘Techniques used may be rehabilitative (enabling a person to regain reduced abilities) educational (for example, managing fatigue that may be associated with the condition) or adaptive (for
[normal] 
[normal]example, finding new, easier ways of carrying out tasks, often using equipment or assistive technology).’
[normal].
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many services are commissioned based on outcomes which relate to single conditions, and this negatively affects the ability of NHS and social care providers to treat people who have several long term conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]Commissioning problems could be addressed by using functional as well as condition specific outcome measures.
[normal] 
[normal]The NHS Outcomes Framework does include ‘functional ability’ as one of the overarching indicators for long term conditions, but this is then measured by usi
[normal]ng employment as an indicator. Al
[normal]though employment is important, f
[normal]unctional ability incorporates many factors such as mobility, se
[normal]lf care, domestic activities
[normal]. COT would like to see a greater variety of functional and occupational performance measures included within the framework. 
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One way in which o
[normal]ccupational therapists work with people who may have several long term conditions is through their approach to vocational rehabilitation.
[normal] 
[normal]In relation to this, The AHP Advisory Fitness for Work Report has been launched recently.
[normal] 
[normal]This tool has b
[normal]een developed to enable AHPs
[normal] to advise on the functional impact of a patient’s condition on his/
[normal]her ability to work and to recommend workplace adjustments. 
[normal]The focus on functional ability helps to tailor intervention to the person’s needs, rather than towards specific condition(s)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Occupational therapists are well placed to contribute to obesity prevention and management.
[normal] 
[normal]For example in primary care, they have a role in prevention of obesity in ‘high risk’ groups, such as people with disabilities.
[normal] 
[normal]In tertiary care the occupational therapy role within bariatric teams includes addressing problems with daily activities, improving mobility within home and community, increasing physical stamina, teaching relaxation and communication skills and use of techniques such as motivational interviewing to change activity patterns and eating habits
[normal]. Occupational therapists also have a major role in the prescription of bariatric equipment as necessary, making the judgement between ensuring safety and optimising activity levels. 
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]COT would like to see
[normal] occupational therapists role in health pr
[normal]omotion and prevention work, such as obesity management 
[normal]recognised, for
[normal] example, by including it in service 
[normal]and person specifications
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Occupational therapists have a significant contribution to make to
[normal] the 
[normal]provision of integrated care, working across health, social care, housing, employment, cha
[normal]rity and independent sectors
[normal].
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One example of effective integrated care is the 
[normal]Neuro
[normal] Case Management Service in Sheffield.
[normal] 
[normal]The service integrates care across health, social and voluntary sector, whilst providing personalised care.
[normal] 
[normal]The team consists of three occupational therapists and one nurse, working as case managers, with the four health professionals being responsible for a case load of over 800 people.
[normal] 
[normal]The service ha
[normal]s been commissioned to provide:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The implications of an ageing population include that more people will be living with several long term conditions including dementia
[normal], 
[normal]musculo
[normal]-skeletal conditions and general frailty.
[normal] 
[normal]More people will also be living with mental health issues.
[normal] 
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many recommendations have already been made on how to improve capacity and quality of care
[normal] 
[normal]for people with dementia
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The role which occupational therapists can pl
[normal]ay includes:
[normal]7.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the population ages, it is important that older people’s mental well-being is supported and maintained.
[normal] 
[normal]OTs
[normal] can improve mental well-being by promoting physical activity when working with older people, as evidenced by N
[normal]ICE Public Health Guidance
[normal] 16
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]OTs also
[normal] have a key 
[normal]role in 
[normal]reablement
[normal], admissi
[normal]on avoidance 
[normal]and falls prevention
[normal]. 
[normal]7.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the longer term, it will be 
[normal]important to improve health equality
[normal], both as an end in itself and to reduce the overall increases in demands on services brought about by an ageing population.
[normal] 
[normal]This will require the social determi
[normal]nants of health to be addressed by
[normal] 
[normal]o
[normal]ccupational therapists
[normal] and
[normal] other health professionals
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]7.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]COT would like the government to recognise and promote the important role which occupational therapists can and do play in addressing the mental and physical health needs of older people, as well as their role in addressing the social determinants of health.
[normal] 
[normal]The latter aspect of their role will help to manage future demands on services for older people.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]O
[normal]ccupational therapists have always recognised
[normal] the fundamental link between physical and mental health
[normal], and work to address both aspects, within the constraints of the services in which they work.
[normal] 
[normal]COT
[normal] would like to see this role recognised and suppo
[normal]rted in commissioning decisions
[normal]. 
[normal]Examples of conditions for which occupational therapists address the psychological and cognitive aspects of long term physical conditions include rheumatologic conditions
[normal], limb amputation
[normal] stroke
[normal]acquired brain injury
[normal]and progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis
[normal] and Parkinson’s disease
[normal].
[normal]8.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Mental Health
[normal] Network publication, 
[normal]Investing 
[normal]in emotional and psychological wellbeing for patients with long term conditions
[normal] provides many examples of the importance of addressing 
[normal]the mental health needs of people with long term physical health conditions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Many of
[normal] the services mentioned
[normal] are characterised by the ability to treat both the physical and psychological aspects of the condition and a multi-disciplinary approach to intervention, with teams including allied health professions such as occupational therapists, as well as physicians and clinical nurse specialists.
[normal]8.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An example of a service which treats mental health issues arising from living with long term condition(s) is the Norfolk and Suffolk Wellbeing Service.
[normal] 
[normal]Psychological Therapists and Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners use a CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) based approach to treat anxiety and depression.
[normal] 
[normal]Intervention includes delivering an 8 week workshop specifically for those with anxiety and/or depression who are living with any diagnosed long term physical health condition
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The College would like to see ser
[normal]vices organised around a broad spectrum of conditions,
[normal] over longer time frames
[normal], and using holistic approaches
[normal],
[normal] in order for personalised care to be improved.
[normal] These principles are illustrated in the example below:-
[normal]9.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Occupational therapists enabled K, a woman with learning disabilities and morbid obesity, to regain her independence.
[normal] 
[normal]K was a 45 year old woman, living with her husband.
[normal] 
[normal]She had a number of health and functional problems which had gone undetected, including morbid obesity (her weight was 33 stone), diabetes, respiratory failure and poor mobility.
[normal] 
[normal]She remained in bed for 24 hours per day. OTs helped K by improving communication skills, goal setting, improving diet and exercise, and enabling mainstream health and social services to work more effectively with her.
[normal] 
[normal]The outcome was that K lost 12 stone and is now able to manage her diabetes herself
[normal].
[normal]Additional comments[bold]10.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to provide more effective management for people with long term conditions, it may be useful to consider the definition of ‘health’ rather than ‘long term condition’.
[normal] 
[normal]The Ottawa Charter states that
[normal],
[normal] ‘
[normal]Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. To reach a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, an individual or group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations, to satisfy needs, and to change or cope with the environment.’
[normal] 
[normal]Occupational therapists are well placed to promote health amongst people with long term conditions
[normal] as
[normal] their approach focuses on all three elements of health.
