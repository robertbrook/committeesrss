RCH0006[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by the Office of the Children’s Rights Director[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence to the Education Select Committee Inquiry into the Government’s proposals with regard to residential children’s homes [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Submitted by Roger Morgan, Children’s Rights Director for England[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am submitting this document as a summary of children’s views, in my capacity as Children’s Rights Director, with a statutory duty to ascertain the views of children within my remit, which includes children in children’s homes.  My aim is to provide an independently summarised account of the views of children themselves, without adding additional material or my own views or comments.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The children’s views on the current Government proposals come from a children’s consultation survey just completed, which will be the subject of a full report to be published in October of this year.  Key points listed at the end of this submission are from previously published children’s views reports.  I am not speaking on behalf of any organisation, and do not speak on behalf of Ofsted, the body which currently hosts my Office.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The recent consultation survey sought children’s views on each of 12 proposals from the 
[normal]DfE
[normal] consultation documents issued on 23 April 2013.  The wording of the questions was checked with 
[normal]DfE
[normal].  Invitations for children to participate in a secure web survey were sent to all children’s homes in England.  594 children responded to the survey.  Their median age was 15.  60% were boys and 40% girls.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other than being asked whether they voted FOR, AGAINST or DON’T KNOW on each government proposal, the children were not given any suggested answers to questions asking them for their reasons for the way they voted.  Reasons given in this submission are therefore categorised from their own free text answers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Findings from the consultation survey [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The majority of children responding to the consultation survey supported all but two of the government proposals we listed from the relevant consultation documents.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Well over half of the children responding voted FOR each of the following ten government proposals (listed in descending order of support given, with the percentage of children voting who voted in favour of each proposal):
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Every Review of every child’s care plan must (as well as lots of other things) check wheth
[normal]er the child is being kept safe (82% in favour).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The law already says that the person running a children’s home must look after the children properly. In future it should also say they are responsible for keeping the children safe, and that the plan for each child in the home must say how that child is to be kept safe
[normal] (77% in favour)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In future, the person running a children’s home must check if the area is safe for the children to live in. They should deal with any risks there are - and should by law check this out every year with the police and children’s social care services
[normal] (72% in favour)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Before a council places a child away from their home area, it must talk to the council for the new area first about whether the home is in a safe or risky area for the child to move into
[normal] (71% in favour)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The law already says that every children’s home must have a policy that says what will happen if someone runs away. As well as this, in future the policy should say what the home will do, with the police and other people, to PREVENT children from running away
[normal] (70% in favour)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whenever someone who has run away returns to the home, the police should talk with them about where they have been, anything that has happened while they were away, and whether they are safe and well
[normal] (67% in favour)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The person running a children’s home should ask social care services for a Review of a child’s care plan if the child keeps running away from the home
[normal] (66% in favour)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Before a council places a child away from their home area, it must talk to the council for the new area first, and send them the child’s care plan, to help decide whether it will be the right placement for the child
[normal] (65% in favour)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The people running each children’s home should choose a really independent person to visit the home every month to check that it is being run properly (and the independent person should usually not tell the staff when they are coming to visit)
[normal] (61% in favour)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whenever someone has run away, they should have the chance to talk to somebody who is independent of the home before they come back to the home – about why they ran away, whether they feel safe at the home, whether they need any extra help at the home, and about anything that happened to them while they were away
[normal] (61% in favour)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The following proposal was supported, but by fewer than half the children voting:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To stop young people being made to leave care before they are ready, if someone’s plan says they will be leaving care at 16 or 17 (instead of 18), then their whole care plan would have to be agreed by the Director of Children’s Services (44% in favour).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The one proposal opposed by the children voting was:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Director of Children’s Services should be the only person who can decide to place a child a long way from their home area (45% against, 25% in favour, 30% undecided, 565 children voted).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The top five reasons given by children for opposing this proposal were:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The decision should be made by more than one person (from 24% of those against the proposal)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Director of Children’s Services doesn’t know the child (from 19% of those against the proposal)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The child should be more involved (from 16% of those against the proposal)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Parents or family should be more involved (from 15% of those against the proposal)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The decision should be made by the child’s social worker (from 14% of those against the proposal)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The most frequent reason for children’s opposition to the proposal, that the decision should be made by more than one person, was based on two main grounds.  Firstly, that in principle such an important decision for a child should not be in the hands of one person, but should be made by a panel or a group of people sharing their views about what is best for the child.  As two children put it, the 
[normal]decisionmaker
[normal] ‘shouldn’t be one person’, ‘should be a group decision’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Secondly, many children wished the decision to involve people who most directly knew the child and what was best for the child, such as their social worker, current carers, and (where appropriate) parents.  To quote one child, ‘it should be decided by a group of adults that have worked with the child, so that they can come up with the best thing for the child’.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The next most frequent reason for children opposing this proposal was related to this.  It was that the Director of Children’s Services is someone who does not know the child, and children were generally clear that such a key decision should be made for the child by people who know the child well enough to make the right decision for that individual child.  As one child put this, ‘the Director only knows what he has read on paper and hasn’t actually met the young person’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The children’s [bold]responses[bold] [bold]do not support the [bold]final [bold]decisionmaker[bold] [bold]on placement a long way awa[bold]y from the home area being [bold]the Director of Children’s Services[bold] – and they [bold]present the alternative of such decisions being made by a panel of people with direct knowledge of the child and their needs[bold].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It appears important to children that the role of the Director in relation to [bold]distant placement should not be that of [bold]a[bold] final [bold]or sole [bold]decisionmaker[bold], and the decision itself should be taken by a group who personally know the child and their needs[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Distance versus travel time in defining a whether a placement is a long way away[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Out of 586 children responding to the question, 57% told us that they were placed away from their home area.  The question asked them whether they defined their placement as away from their home area, therefore for some children a placement in a different town in a large local authority may be defined by the child as out of their home area even though it may be in the same local authority area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We asked children to [bold]define whether distance or travel time was the major factor in d[bold]efining [bold]whether[bold] a placement feel[bold]s[bold] a long way away from their [bold]home area[bold].  Out of 567 children responding, half (50%) said that the main factor was the time it took to get there, with only 25% saying that it was the distance there in miles.  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The median definition of what [bold]children [bold]felt to be a long time to travel [bold]between their home area and a placement [bold]was two hours.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Reasons for placement away from home area[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We asked children to tell us the reasons for their placement away from their home area.  308 children responded to this question.  Of these, 64 (53%) said they didn’t know the reason for their placement away from their home area.  229 children gave reasons.  The most frequent reasons given were:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Needed to be placed away from the area for the child’s own safety (from 18% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The more distant placement was chosen to meet the child’s needs (from 14% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Because the child had previously absconded home from closer placements (from 12% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The child needed to be kept away from contact with their parents or family (from 10% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There was no closer placement available (from 10% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The child needed to be placed away to keep them from getting into trouble in their own area (from 9% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Because of the child’s behaviour in a previous placement (from 4% of those who gave reasons).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In summary, 
[normal]over half the children did not know why they had been placed away from their home area, but those who did told us that they had been placed away from the area in order to meet their needs[bold].  These included a distant placement being needed for their own safety and protection, meeting their needs better than other placements, being chosen because of a history of absconding back home from closer placements, and the need to keep them away from their families or to keep them away from trouble they were involved in 
[normal]in
[normal] their home area.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Only one in ten children told us they had been placed away from their home area because of a lack of local placements[bold].
[normal] 
[normal] In some of those cases, the child qualified their response by saying that the distant placement was still the nearest that was available (
[normal]eg
[normal] ‘they couldn’t find anywhere closer’, ‘it was the closest home they could get me in’).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Effects of placement away from home on safety[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We asked children who were placed away from their home area whether they thought this had made a difference to their safety.  322 answered this question, out of the 332 who told us they were placed away from their home area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overall, the children’s view was that being placed out of area was [bold]much [bold]more likely to make you safer than less safe[bold].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Almost half the children, 
[normal]49%, told us that being placed away from their home area had made them safer, while only 6% told us that it had made them less safe.  45% of those placed away from their home area thought this had made no difference[bold] at all to their safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From those who thought they were now safer because they had been placed out of their home area, the main reasons given by the 156 who responded to this question were:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Good care and support at the placement (from 29% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The child is away from what was getting them into trouble in their home area (from 26% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The child is well away from risks from their family (from 13% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The child is away from threats to their safety in their home area (from 11% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The child is no longer absconding back to the family home they were removed from (from 11% of those who gave reasons)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Direct quotations illustrating some of these responses are; ‘I don’t  have the people to lead me into doing silly things – the staff have helped me to learn how to keep myself safe’, ‘I’m no longer encouraged to hang with the wrong people and get myself into trouble’, ‘not being with troublemakers and not becoming involved in trouble’, ‘it’s safer because I’m not near my mum’, ‘I can no longer put myself at risk or in dangerous situations’, ‘I couldn’t run off to my mum and dad’s’.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One child summed up the mixed feelings of being safer away from risks at home, but also feeling isolated from home; ‘in some ways it makes me feel safer because I know that my family can’t come and find me – but then in another way I wish I was still near them’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These findings are corroborated by an in depth focus group discussion we had previously held on the subject of out of authority placements.  That group advised that the key factors in deciding to place a child at a distance were to keep them away from trouble in their home area, and a history of absconding home when placed close to home.  That focus group also reported very variable levels of contact with social workers and Independent Reviewing Officers once placed at a distance – varying from continued close contact and good relationships to loss of contact and of working relationships.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sixteen children in our survey gave reasons for being placed at home making them feel less safe than they had been in their home area.  
[normal]Seven of these said that they felt less safe with unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place[bold], and four said they missed their old friends and family nearer home.  Two said their new area was no less ‘rough’ than their home area, two told us they were still absconding back home which they knew was not a safe thing for them to do, and one said that they were now away from the protection members of their family had given them against other people in their home area.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“in the case of a proposed placement which is also at a distance, must not be put into effect until the Director of Children’s Services personally is satisfied that the decision has been properly reached under these Regulations, is in the best interests of the safety and welfare of the child, and will meet the child’s needs.”
