"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Local Government Association (LGA)&#xa0;\n1.1\n \nThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government. We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n \nWe are a \npolitically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government. We aim to influence and set the political agenda on issues that matter to councils so that they ar\ne able to deliver local solutions to national problems.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n \nUniversal Credit presents an opportunity to provide a more seamless support offer to claimants that will enable them to become more motivated, resilient and self-reliant.  For this to be realised cou\nncils must have a lead role in commissioning local support services, and local partnerships must be at the heart of delivery.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n \nCouncils are best placed to provide local support services\n. H\nowever help with meeting housing costs through advice and pastoral s\nupport will only take people so far. The Government is aiming to make projected savings of £11.8\n \nb\nillio\nn in 2015/16\n. It is important to make sure that these savings are realised.  There is a need for there to be real changes to funding for affordable, appr\nopriately sized housing and local commissioning and delivery of support for skills, work readiness and employment. Without such changes, there is a significant danger\n of \nrent arrears occurring. \n&#xa0;2.1\n \nEarlier this year the \nLGA\n commissioned the Cent\nre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI) to produce a piece of mapping and modelling research on the local impact of the welfare reforms.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n \nThe purpose of this research was to enable \nthe LGA\n to have a better understanding, from t\nhe local government \nperspective,\n of the cumulat\nive impact of all of the reforms.\n \nI\nmportantly\n this included\n the scope for households to mitigate reductions in household income through a housing or employment route with appropriate support from local partners.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n \nBy far the most \nsignificant and substantial outgoing for low income households is the cost of housing\n.\n \nA significant\n risk to public service provision as a consequence of the welfare reforms comes from the potential for increased rent arrears.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n \nOur research shows that ther\ne is a significant gap between the amount of money being taken away from households through the cuts to \nwelfare spending and the extent to which those households can mitigate their losses in the short to medium te\nrm by reducing their outgoings or\n increasin\ng their income by \nfor example\n downsizing, entering employment or accessing other financial support.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n \nThere are three main rational responses for claimants to reductions in household income / increased housing costs:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n \nThis submission will explore both the\n \nopportunities\n for\n,\n and feasibility of\n,\n each of these options, and how councils and their partners can support \ntheir residents\n. It will also highlight the potential risks to households and service providers when these options are constrained and consider \nhow these risks might be addressed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n \nOur recent re\nsearch\n estimates that the income of households claiming benefit will be on average lower by \n£1,615 a year\n – or £31 a week – in 2015/16 as a result of welfare reforms. This exclu\ndes the impact of Universal Credit. \nIt\n is equivalent to around £1 in every £7 of household income for these households.\n&#xa0;3.2\n \nA particular focus of the analysis that CESI carried out on behalf of the LGA was an understanding of the local impacts of reforms that\n are most likely to affect households’ ability to remain in or to afford housing – particularly in households where no one works.  The report focused on the local impacts of reforms affecting Housing Benefit, and specifically the impacts of:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n3.3\n \nThe report estimates that 1.18 million of these households (70 per cent of the total) will be household\ns where no one works. Households are generally more likely to be impacted in the north than the south of the country.\n&#xa0;3.4\n \nImpacts \nper household\n are significantly greater in southern England – reflecting the high costs of housing in these areas. The large\nst im\npacts by far are in London.\n \nI\nn every single London authority, the average i\nmpact is above £1,300 per year, \nwhil\nst\n in just fourteen local authorities outside London the average impact is £1,300 or higher (all in the south east of England).\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n \nLong term reduct\nions in the generosity of benefits paid to working households through changes to the tax credits system, reductions t\no disability benefits and the 1 per cent\n uprating may have an impact on their ability to cope if rents continue to rise and wages continue \nto stagnate.  \nOur report estimates that around three fifths (59 per cent) of all projected welfare reform savings fall on households where somebody works.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n \nThe research \nmodelled a range of plausible responses to the \nreforms, based on housing and employment data and recent research on behavioural responses to the reforms to date. In their relatively generous central scenario CESI estimated that 155,000 claimants, of the 1.18 million out of work, may mitiga\nte their loss\nes by finding work;\n and 115,000 by moving home.  So in total, they estimated that 270,000 claimants – 23 per cent of the total impacted – may be successful in taking steps to mitigate the impacts of reform. This leaves a significant number of households an\nd individuals needing additional interim and long-term support with managing their money.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n \nThe establishment of the local authority-led Universal Credit face-to-face pilots in autumn 2012 recognised the LGA’s shared understanding with DWP that many of those who are affected by the welfare reforms will continue to look to councils and the volunta\nry sector as their principal source of advice and support. \nThe pilots are helping to identify the challenges that councils and partners will face and, most importantly, developing practical solutions that other councils can learn from.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n \nT\nhis kind of suppor\nt can only be commissioned and delivered effectively through local partners who have an understanding of the local area, existing relationships with individuals and families and, in the vast majority of areas, an established track record in working togethe\nr to meet complex or multiple needs.\n&#xa0;\nLewisham – Universal Credit face-to-face support&#xa0;\nLewisham developed an approach for working with vulnerable residents that integrated preparation for the benefit cap with preparation for U\nniversal \nC\nredit\n.\n&#xa0;\n A pilot te\nam was set up comprising officers from the council’s housing benefit and housing needs teams and Jobcentre Plus to design and then deliver the service. \n&#xa0;\nPhase 1A letter is sent to the customer explaining the key welfare changes and providing them with an\n estimate of the financial loss of the benefit cap.\n&#xa0;\nThe customer is contacted for a triage assessment over the phone, which \nfocuses on skills and experience across the financial, digital, housing and employment spheres. The script built into Lewisham’s CR\nM system assigns scores to the answers given by the customer, which determines if they are considered ‘vulnerable’ triggering the need for a further support appointment. \n&#xa0;\nA face-to-face appointment is conducted, focusing on the financial impact of the ben\nefit cap and returning to work after the cap.\n&#xa0;\nAn individualised support plan is created with warm referrals to key agencies who will be responsible for providing on-going support tailored to the individual needs identified. \n&#xa0;\nPhase 2 Lewisham are working\n with the Behavioural Insights Team from the Cabinet Office to develop a case management approach which will see the team offering some customers more on\n&#xad;\ngoing support.\n&#xa0;\nThe project governance established to oversee the pilot meets monthly and has represen\ntation from all key local authority departments, VCS leads, JobCentre Plus and Housing associations. Working groups have been established representing the same areas but at an operational level.\n&#xa0;\nWhen making referrals for clients as part of their support p\nlan the key partners the council has worked with are:\n&#xa0;\nfinancial: Credit Union for budgeting accounts, CAB for debt/money management\n&#xa0;\nemployment: JCP (universal jobs match/ flexible support fund) and Lewisham’s Family Budget programme which is part of thei\nr Troubled Families initiative\n&#xa0;\nhousing: referrals to Lewisham’s Housing Options Service\n&#xa0;\ndigital: customers are directed to where they can access the internet (local libraries and so on) and sites where they can access IT training. \n&#xa0;\nIt is the council’s v\niew that integrating housing and employment into local models is critical for the success of its approaches. Face-to-face triage makes it easier to identify those who are likely to need on-going support. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCommunity Budgets Essex, Greater Manchester, Wes\nt Cheshire and the London Tri-borough (Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster) piloted a new approach to local public service transformation during 2012. In each of the four areas a range of partners, including NHS Trusts, the police,\n Jobcentre Plus, councils, the voluntary and private sectors and educational establishments worked together. The pilots demonstrated the benefits of aligning resources, reducing duplication and sharing information \nthrough working together to break down pub\nlic, voluntary and independent sector boundaries and joining-up related, but disconnected delivery silos. \n&#xa0;\nThis model of collaborative leadership around the needs of a place is potentially very well-suited to helping customers affected by the welfare refo\nrms and commissioning local support services for Universal Credit.  The LGA is working closely with DWP and colleagues across local and national Government to ensure that the learning from Community Budgets is fed into the development and roll-out of Unive\nrsal Credit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n \nResearch on responses to the reforms to date shows relatively little evidence of claimants moving to more affordable accommodation. This is largely because cheaper accommodation simply isn’t available in the places that people want \nto live and, crucially, work.\n Poor or insecure housing can also prevent people from being reliable and motivated to work\n and councils are ideally placed to ensure that housing and employment support is joined-up around the needs of people and families.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n \nTh\ne only way to ensure the \nG\novernment’s benefit reforms work is to address the \nsignificant \nundersupply\n of affordable housing and to support a more flexible supply of smaller properties to meet demand. This means that councils need to be free to invest in new\n homes that meet this need.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n \nHousing need has never been met by the private sector alone. Local Authorities and Housing Associations have an important role to play to increase the availability of housing of the right size and at the right price to meet \ndemand. However, as of June 2013 Housin\ng Associations had completed 25 per cent\n fewer pr\noperties than in the previous twelve\n months\n.\n Councils’ ability to build is limited by centrally set borrowing caps meaning build rates are depressed below their potent\nial levels.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n \nRemoving the H\nousing \nR\nevenue \nA\nccount\n borrowing cap could result in up to a further 60,000 homes over and above current plans. Overall \nthe LGA \nestimate that unlocking this potential to invest in housing would lead to a wider economic impact o\nf £20 billion\n.\n \n \nThe centrally set cap is distributed unevenly and bears little relation to overall housing need. This means some authorities have little or no borrowing headroom to invest in the smaller properties they need to meet demand.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n \nThe LGA will c\nontinue to press Government for to lift the borrowing cap and to trade borrowing headroom to allow greater investment in new affordable housing.\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n \nCouncils are taking a range of approaches to use their existing stock more effectively and to incentivise peop\nle to move. All of those councils who are offering financial incentives to tenants to move into smaller \nhomes have calculated that is will save them more in reduced rent arrears than it costs to pay the incentives.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nShropshire Council – supporting tenants through effective partnershipShropshire is one of the Housing Benefit Direct Payment Demonstration Projects.  The council has put a particular focus on working in partnership with the voluntary sector and has developed a financial inclusion board that in\ncludes housing associations, CAB, the Jobcentre Plus and other local support organisations to enable financial inclusion for tenants. Some of the services provided are signposting support, financial training and support for tenants, assistance with budgeti\nng to help them pay their rent, provision of banking facilities via credit unions and advice on basic bank accounts. Provision of case work and advocacy support is also available if required following a segmentation of residents in terms of capability. \nTh\ne partners are evaluating tenants’ capability at a pre-tenancy stage as a way to sustain tenancies. Supporting tenants and identifying individuals requiring safeguarding of rent payments will be key to protecting landlords’ income streams. In Shropshire a \ntrigger of 12 weeks is being tested before direct payment switches back to the landlord when the tenant hasn’t paid rent. Timely monitoring of rent arrears and intervention as well as signposting tenants to support as necessary are another key aspect of th\neir work\n.\n5.7\n \nDiscretionary Housing Payment&#xa0;\n5.7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£155 million has been made available to local authorities in Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) in 2013/14, to provide discretionary support to Housing Benefit claimants impacted by welfare reforms.  Our researc\nh suggested that even once plausible responses by tenants are taken into account DHPs would cover just £1 in every £7 of the impact of housing reforms on tenants.\n&#xa0;\n5.7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe allocation formula does not reflect \nthe totality of housing impacts. This\n leads to some \nareas facing larger impacts than others.  As a result there is wide variation in how f\nar DHPs will meet the ‘residual’\n losses in local areas, after mitigations are taken into account.\n&#xa0;\n5.7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is the LGA’s view that \nDHP\n should not be seen as the solution to lon\ng-term and intractable consequences of the reforms. The Government has presented the additional funding as transitional – in which case the problems it is being used to address should be possible to resolve over time, for example enabling people affected b\ny the size criteria to downsize into a smaller property. The LGA is conducting research into the use of DHP by local authorities and will use this as a basis for further discussions with the sector and DWP.\n&#xa0;\n5.8\n \nArrears, evictions and homelessness&#xa0;\n5.8.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs set out \nabove our recent report estimated that 270,000 claimants – 23 per cent of the total impacted – may be successful in taking steps to mitigate the impacts of reform. This suggests a considerable likelihood that a significant proportion of those affected may \nfall into arrears for the first time or exacerbate existing debt problems.\n&#xa0;\n5.8.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is borne out in recent research by the National Housing Federation\n. In total\n 38 housing associations responded to their survey (of 51 contacted) who between them had 43,989 te\nnants overall affected by the Social Sector Size Criteria. 11,064 (25\n per cent\n) of these tenants went into arrears for the first time between 1 April and 30 June\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.8.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence from the Direct Payment Demonstration Projects also shows arrears increasing under \nmonthly payments to household despite intensive support from councils and housing partners.\n&#xa0;\n5.8.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore work needs to be done to understand what level of arrears councils and housing providers can and should tolerate during the transition to Universal Credit, in\ncreased arrears will inevitably have an impact on the financial capacity of local authorities to invest in new and existing homes. \n&#xa0;\n5.8.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCouncils are committed to preventing evictions and homelessness wherever possible, not least because of the financial and h\numan costs of housing people in Temporary Accommodation. The LGA is working closely with councils, housing providers and the DWP to monitor the impact of the reforms on homelessness and to develop the right evidence base for new burdens funding.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n \nThe most desirable and sustainable way to support those affected by the reforms is, of course, to help them \ninto work.\n \nCouncils are\n \ndriving local growth, and \nprovide and/or commission services to\n help residents with more complex barriers to employment benefit from it.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n \nFar too many councils\n’\n are still reporting that J\nob \nC\nentre \nP\nlus (JCP)\n colleagues are unable to share information on clients and are \nprevented from engaging\n with the complex needs of those most impacted by the welfare reforms. There is an opportunity in Universal Credit to make effective partnership working between councils and JCP the norm rather than the exception.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n \nThe pressure on JCP advisers to move peop\nle into employment as soon as possible disincentivises providing additional support to vulnerable claimants. The truth is, in developing an employment offer, the majority of JCP advisers, cannot confidently bring together a range of services in an area tha\nt an individual may need as part of their journey towards work, even if they are incentivised to do so.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government needs to give councils and their partners in business more influence over work readiness and employment schemes.\n \nCouncils’ wider economi\nc development role and local insight means that they can work with employers to forecast\n skills \nthat will be \nneeded\n in the future\n so \nthat \neducation, further education and \ntraining \nprovision \nproduce\ns\n more people with skills that are closely matched to what \nemployers in the area need. \n \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n \nCouncils are also well placed to co-commission support given their relationship with local public agencies, in depth understanding and proximity to the client base and the services they are most likely to use, and links into \nthe voluntary and community sector\n which can help to build confidence and skills profiles.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n \nThe outcome and financial benefits of local work and skills support models have been demonstrated in the Whole Place Community Budget Pilots. From these, Ernst and \nYoung have projected annual savings of up to £1.7 billion, the majority of which would be found in DWP budgets.\n&#xa0;\n6.6\n \nThe next letting of Work Programme contracts in 2016 is an ideal opportunity to line up the geography of delivery with the economic development\n actions of councils and their partners through Local Economic Partnerships. Councils should be the commissioners.\n&#xa0;\nOxford - Universal Credit face-to-face pilot&#xa0;\nOxford identified some common barriers to people entering work, including: lack of child care;\n health issues preventing work; fear of the instability of entering work; lack of skills; debt.\n&#xa0;\nThey then tested their understanding of local need with a selection of customers affected by either the social sector size criteria or the housing benefit cap.\n Customer feedback confirmed that these common barriers were experienced by our customers and that most had multiple barriers. They also found that people generally were very keen to engage with the council in overcoming barriers to work. \n&#xa0;\nThe council is \nworking with three organisations to support customers – Skills Training UK, JCP and CAB and is moving away from the traditional signposting model to one where the client is directly introduced to the organisation they are referred to. Counci\nl staff keep \nin\n contact with the customer after they have received support to identify and responds to any further needs.\n&#xa0;\nBy July 2013 Oxford had engaged 180 customers and was working on an on-going basis with 26 of those, of which four had moved into work. A further 16\n cases had been referred to partner organisations - 14 as priority cases; 30 had received discretionary housing payments and all had received housing and/or work related advice. \n&#xa0;\nThe councils is also working with Thriving Families (Oxfordshire’s Troubled \nFamilies programme) who are providing some intensive support to customers affected by the social sector size criteria and the housing benefit \ncap. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1\n \nEven at the ‘high’ scenario in our research, which assumes both high levels of inclination and\n motivation in claimants and an optimistic analysis of local employment markets, the scope for households to mitigate reductions in income by moving house or getting a job is relatively limited. And at more plausible estimates, at least four out of every f\nive households are likely to need further assistance – with cumulative financial impacts in excess of £1 billion per year.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n \nCouncils and local partners are clearly best placed to provide advice and guidance at the local level that will enable people to mak\ne the best possible decisions for themselves and their families, and to provide targeted support to those who need it to become more stable, motivated or financially literate.  But there is a limit to the amount local partners can achieve while they are co\nnstrained by fundamental structural shortcomings in both housing and employment markets and a lack of real influence over jobs and development in their localities.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n \nThe LGA would like the Government to engage fully with local government on the key challeng\nes in their local areas; provide freedom to borrow and spend where there is a clear logic for doing so, and recognise within the design of Universal Credit that the complex barriers faced by some low income families to improving their circumstances are bes\nt understood and addressed by local partners at the local level.\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe full report is available at:  \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/finance/-/journal_content/56/10180/4098967/ARTICLE\nFurther information accessible via: \nhttp\ns://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/232108/House_Building_release_-_June_Qtr_2013.pdf\n \nFurther information accessible at: \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/housing/-/journal_content/56/10180/3796944/ARTICLE\nFurther information accessible at: \nhttp:/\n/www.cih.org/resources/PDF/Policy%20free%20download%20pdfs/Welfare%20reform%20practical%20approaches.pdf\n&#xa0;\n"
