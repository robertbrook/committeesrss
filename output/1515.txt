[[[Written evidence submitted by Oil &amp; Gas UK (HOT06)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]Oil &amp; Gas UK is the principal trade association for the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry in the United Kingdom, with more than 370 member companies, comprising oil and gas operators and investors and a broad spectrum of the supply chain: contractors, suppliers, law firms and consultants.  We have pleasure in submitting our evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry into heat.&#xa0;In the public debate about energy during recent years, there has been a lot of emphasis on electricity, but little about heat (or transport).  In overall terms, only about 35% of the primary energy consumed in the UK is used as electricity; the remaining 65% has two main forms of consumption, namely heat, where gas is the principal source, and transport, where oil is dominant.&#xa0;While industrial heat demand is reasonably constant, domestic demand is highly seasonal, being almost entirely temperature dependent.  The variation between summer and winter demand is large and, because gas provides 80% of domestic properties (and a large proportion of smaller commercial premises) with heat, the demand for gas varies widely as the seasons change.  However, gas is well suited to this; it is much more flexible than electricity which has to be balanced instantaneously, whereas gas does not – it is normally balanced over a 24 hour period.              

[[[Terms of Reference]]]There are others who are better placed than Oil &amp; Gas UK to answer the Committee’s 12 questions and so we are taking the opportunity to make some broader points relevant to this inquiry, but also answering the specific question about the relative merits of using gas in space heating.&#xa0;

[[[fic Question Regarding the Use of Gas in Space Heating]]]Q.6:              “What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared with central electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?”&#xa0;There are a number of advantages of using gas directly to provide space heating:i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Gas is a primary source of energy and so, in converting gas to heat, there are none of the losses associated with converting it to a secondary source of energy, such as happens when a primary source is converted into electricity before the resulting electricity is turned into heat.  The best (i.e. super-critical) coal fired power stations achieve about 45% thermal efficiency and the best gas fired ones about 58%, so there are significant losses involved in generating electricity.  The best coal fired power station in this country, Drax, is not super-critical and only achieves 38% thermal efficiency.ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The existing national gas transmission system (NTS) probably has the necessary overall capacity for most future requirements, but will no doubt require some investment to take account of changing patterns of supply and demand.  The NTS has also proved to be very flexible in its operation during testing conditions in the past five winters.  By contrast, the electricity grid is going to need substantial investment because its capacity will have to be enlarged in a more electrified future.  This will be expensive.iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Furthermore, as mentioned above, gas does not need to be balanced instantaneously (which electricity does) and gas can be stored at scale (which electricity cannot).  Indeed, the NTS itself acts as a short term store of gas by virtue of “linepack”, i.e. the ability to compress the gas in the system during the night, when demand is lower, and use such extra gas during the day, as required.  This is impossible with electricity.  As a means of delivering energy to users, gas is much more flexible than electricity.iv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The conversion of gas directly into heat is highly efficient (c. 90%) where modern appliances are used.  This is better than modern combined heat and power plants generally achieve (c. 80%).v)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Gas heating gives households and smaller commercial premises complete control over heating their buildings.  District or similar heating systems, however good, do not generally provide the same degree of local control.vi)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Gas heating is better than a heat pump with thermally inefficient buildings, such as are common in the UK.  The incoming heat is at a lower temperature with a heat pump than is delivered by a gas boiler.  Heat pumps operate best at constant load, with well insulated buildings, and are not well suited to poorly insulated ones.vii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The retrofitting of heat pumps to existing properties means that they will mostly be of the air source type.  Although ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air source, they are more costly and, obviously, require land adjacent to a building which is not generally available in towns and cities, where the majority of people live.viii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In cold weather, air source heat pumps operate at reduced efficiency and require “topping up” by electricity in order to maintain their heating effect which, therefore, places an additional load on electricity supplies at times of highest demand.  National Grid foresees electricity demand for heating rising rapidly from 2035 in its Future Energy Scenarios, especially if its “Gone Green” scenario applies, but less so in the case of “Slow Progression”.ix)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Gas fired power stations are going to be required in considerable numbers over the next 15-20 years in order toBut, it would make no sense to convert gas into electricity at a power station and then to convert the electricity generated into heat within buildings, in order to satisfy demand during colder weather.  This is inherently less efficient than converting gas directly into heat within buildings.&#xa0;Therefore, given the nature of the building stock of this country, the high penetration of gas in supplying space heating and the current programme of conversion to high efficiency boilers, it seems inevitable that gas will continue to have a major role in heating until at least 2030.&#xa0;We trust that this submission is helpful to the Committee’s inquiry.  If there are any queries relating to our submission, please do not hesitate to contact us.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;  See http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Gas/OperationalInfo/TBE/
