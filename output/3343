default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultThis response is focused specifically on the role of local authorities in delivering adult social care, and in particular the 57%
default of people who self fund all or s

defaultFor the past three years, 
defaultPartnership has
default campaigned for self
default-
defaultfunders 
defaultfor care 
defaultto receive regulated financial advice so that they can make informed decisions about how best to pay for their care needs. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1

defaultSelf
default-
defaultfunders in the current adult social care system are those who have assets (including property) of more than £23,250.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultA substantial number of people in the care system fund all of their care (43%). A further 14% make top up payments (
defaultpayment o
defaultf additional costs via a third party
default)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultIn some areas of the country, the majority of people pay for all their care costs - 55% in the South East have to pay all their care costs, 53% in the South West and 50% in the East
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultUnfortunately there 
defaultis a lack of
default awareness and
default access to appropriate regulated financial advice and no obvious place for many self
default-
defaultfunders to get information and advice on long term care. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo put this in perspective, of the 53,000 self funders who entered residential care in
default 2009, only 7,000 received appropriately qualified financial advice
default. The Local 
defaultGovernment Information Unit (LGiU) ha
defaults
default estimated that 24% of self funders deplete their assets and fall back on state funding costing councils an estimated £425 million each ye
defaultar in England alone.  
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultThis cost ultimately 
defaultfalls to individual local authorities, who themselves are facing significant cuts to their overall budgets. However, 
defaultsignificant costs might be saved
default if self
default-
defaultfunders are actively encouraged to get regulated financial advice. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultSome local authorities are already putting in place models of referral for self
default-
defaultfunders to regulated financial advice. 
default&#xa0;

defaultPartnershi
defaultp and i
defaultts
default not-for-profit subsidiary company, 
defaultPayingForCare, 
defaultare
default currently engaged with 64 local authorities to help them limit the risk of self
default-
defaultfunders falling back on state funding by providing an ‘air gap’ service for the local authority, which takes the self
default-
defaultf
defaultunding citizen through the care process and explains all the available options, including referral to a regulated financial adviser where necessary. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultIn addition to this, 
defaultwww.payingforcare.org
default, a clear and accessible information and advice website provides information for those in need of guidance.  This website also enables 
defaultconsumers
default to find a regulated financial 
defaultadviser
default who can advise on their care funding needs
default in their area
default, if they so wish
default.

default-
defaultfunders to financial information,
default not only is the citizen enabled to make better informed decisions
default about how
default to fund their care needs, 
defaultbut it also 
defaulthelp
defaults
default local authorities prevent self
default-
defaultfunders from depleting their
default capital prematurely an
defaultd falling back on state funding. In addition to this, c
defaultitizens will 
defaultalso 
defaultbe better placed to know the potential next steps in the care pathway when they are admitted to hospital and will therefore help lessen the burden of bed blocki
defaultng in hospitals. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultPartnership believes that the Care Bill should b
defaulte welcomed as it aims to bring together “threads from over a dozen different Acts into a single, modern framework for care and support”
default. The 
defaultBill also makes provisions for self
default-
defaultfunders to be given information and advice on how to access independent financial advice. While this is a step in t
defaulthe right direction, as recommended by the Joint Committee on the Draft Care and Support Bill
default, 
defaultlocal autho
defaultrity services should recommend financial advisers only if they are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority). 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultAs outlined in point 3.5
default, the LGiU has estimated that the cost of self funders depleting their cap
defaultital and falling back on state funding costs local authorities £425 million each year in England alone. It would be worth local authorities 
defaultseeking to find ways to 
defaultreduc
defaulte
default this amount, particularly given the cuts in local authority funding and the potential
default cost to local authorities of implementing the Care Bill. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultAlthough t
defaulthe Spending Round announcement 
default(
defaultJune 2013
default)
default made provisions for £335 million to be made available to local authorities in 2015-16 so that they can prepare for reforms to the system of
default social 
defaultcare funding, there are some doubts to whether this is enough. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultThe proposals outlined in the Care Bill are set to be implemented between 2015 and 2016, and will 
defaultresult in 
defaultlocal authorities tak
defaulting
default on a number of significant duties. Such propos
defaulted new roles include the 
defaultrunning of a 
defaultD
defaulteferred 
defaultP
defaultayment 
defaultS
defaultcheme, wh
defaultich will be an interest bearing
default loan. Local authorities will 
defaultalso 
defaulthave to manage and calculate each individual’s care account meter which will run until they reach the cap. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultAlongside th
defaultis, there will be an increase in the number of both eligibility and financial assessments that will need to be carried out. It has also been estimated that 500,000
default more people will make contact with their local authority in order to 
defaultstart
default their care accou
defaultnt meter. 
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultThis will inevitably mean that local authorities will have to put in place new IT systems, re-train staff a
defaultnd increase workforce capacity. All of which will mean an increase in spending. We therefore believe that local autho
defaultrities should ad
defaultopt
default and would benefit from
default 
defaultefficient and low cost 
defaultways of
default 
defaultmaking significant
default 
defaultsavings, including those
default outlined in this response.
