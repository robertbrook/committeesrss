[[[Case A -  ]]]

[[[Family Y ]]]

[[[v Home Office ]]]A family with two young children were detained for two periods at Yarl’s Wood IRC in April 2009 for 11 days and September 2009 for 15 days. The adults are foreign nationals who met in the UK. They were seeking leave to remain on the basis of Article 8 and/or the Immigration Rules and would not, therefore, qualify under any exception to the residence test.  &#xa0;On two separate occasions the parents’ immigration applications were refused unbeknown to them and certified, thereby precluding any in country right of appeal. On both occasions, without notice and in breach of policy, dawn raids were conducted on the family home. They were told to pack their belongings for removal and taken with their children in a caged prison-like van to for detention in Yarl’s Wood Immigration Reception Centre. The children vomited in the van. The second enforcement action took place despite compliance with release conditions.&#xa0;Removal was halted by a judicial review, which was ultimately settled by consent with the grant of an in country right of appeal. The family was finally released following an opposed application for bail.&#xa0;A claim was brought for false imprisonment as well as breaches of human rights including Articles 3, 5 and 8 ECHR. It settled with significant sums for all Claimants for both detentions. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case B - ]]]

[[[Immigration detention of seriously ill woman for 17 months]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]KB is a 51 year old woman, apprehended at a UK airport and sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment for drug importation. In prison she suffered a stroke leading to paralysis of the right side as a result of which she has permanently limited mobility, eventually able to walk slowly with a stick and paralysis of the right arm. She also suffers a range of other serious medical conditions and is dependent upon a strict medical regime for her survival.&#xa0;At the conclusion of her criminal sentence the UK Border Agency detained KB for deportation despite medical evidence from her treating hospital doctor that she was unfit to fly. UKBA spent over a year obtaining its own medical evidence on fitness to travel which eventually confirmed the earlier stated position.&#xa0;KB spent almost one and a half years in immigration detention at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Reception Centre. She alleges a false imprisonment and a breach of article 5 ECHR given the lack of any imminent removal and the fact that she did not present a risk of re-offending or absconding due to her medical condition.&#xa0;KB would fall foul of the residence test, having no leave to be in the UK at any time.

[[[Case C - ]]]

[[[Detention due to difficulties in obtaining travel documentation]]]Mr D is not lawfully resident in the UK and does not object to returning to his country of origin. However, there have been significant difficulties in obtaining travel documentation from the relevant High Commission, rendering his return impossible to date. He is effectively stuck. There is a dispute between the parties as to the level of Mr D’s co -operation with the re-documentation process. &#xa0;His arrest took place when he went to report to the Home Office pursuant to the conditions of his temporary admission, with which he had been complying for a significant period. He was then detained under immigration powers pending his deportation for a total of 

[[[2.5 years]]]. He was released following an application for bail which was opposed. &#xa0;Use of Force&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case D - ]]]

[[[Female prisoner suffering sexual harassment by male prison staff]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]JS was a Thai woman who was detained at HMP Holloway for two and a half years pending extradition to the US after being stopped in transit at a UK airport. She would fall foul of the residence test, having no leave to be in the UK at any time. &#xa0;JS suffered on-going sexual harassment over many months by two male members of staff. The men exposed themselves to her and demanded oral sex, ordered her to undress in her cell and grabbed at her genitals when she came out of the showers. She was also subject to repeated obscene verbal sexual harassment during this period on frequent occasions.&#xa0;When JS finally reported the events internal prison investigations found no case to answer in respect of one officer. The second member of staff faced an internal disciplinary hearing over a year later. The allegations of JS were found unproven and JS was not informed of the outcome of the hearing for five months.&#xa0;JS issued proceedings for breaches of the Human Rights Act (articles 3 and 8 ECHR), breaches of the investigative duty on the part of the prison in the way in which her complaints were handled. She also claimed sex discrimination under article 14 ECHR and under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 as well as race discrimination due to her treatment being the result of stereotyping of her as a Thai woman being a prostitute/ promiscuous. &#xa0;A settlement of the civil claim was reached at £30,000 which included a series of steps to be taken by the prison as a result of the lessons learnt, requiring the prison authorities to re-examine the way in which very serious misconduct had been handled.&#xa0;

[[[Case E - ]]]

[[[Foreign national mother in prison]]]&#xa0;BB was a foreign national who gave birth to a baby with disabilities while on remand.  She spoke no English. After her sentence she was informed that the baby would be removed as they did not know if she would be allowed to remain with her baby when she was eventually returned to Spain.  After taking legal advice it was possible to establish that the Spanish authorities would accept her home to serve her sentence and would allow her to remain with her baby.  The decision was reversed.  Aside from the human costs of an unnecessary separation of mother and child, the cost to the public purse would have been enormous. BB would have fallen foul of the residence test because, although an EU citizen, she was not present in the UK as a result of exercising EU rights and had no other right of residence.&#xa0;

[[[Case F - ]]]

[[[Unlawful arrest and police caution]]]KA is a 29 year old man from Bangladesh with no previous convictions, cautions or arrests. KA had been living in the UK on a spouse visa for less than 12 months. His relationship broke down leaving him without leave in the UK and he would therefore have fallen foul of the residence test.&#xa0;KA suffered an assault and attended a police station to report this. Instead of his allegation being dealt with KA was arrested on the basis that his assailant had attended the station a few hours previously and made an allegation of assault against him. &#xa0;KA consistently denied committing an assault. Officers told him that if he admitted it he could go home but if he did not he would have to stay in custody for two to three months. KA signed a document which he later discovered had been a consent to a police caution.&#xa0;KA successfully challenged the lawfulness of the caution by way of judicial review proceedings. As a result of his complaint the officers were disciplined and issued with written warnings for unprofessional behaviour. &#xa0;The police communicated incorrect information about the caution to the UK Border Agency, seriously jeopardising KA’s application for indefinite leave to remain. Upon KA’s challenge the information was rectified.&#xa0;The claim settled for £20,000 plus an apology. KA was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain. &#xa0;

[[[Case G - ]]]

[[[Death in custody ]]]WW was a 32-year old man from the Republic of Ireland. He had a history of drug, alcohol and mental health problems, including self harming. WW was arrested in London and remanded in custody pending extradition to the Republic of Ireland.&#xa0;On arrival at HMP Brixton, WW was displaying signs of alcohol / drug withdrawal and referred by a doctor for a mental health assessment which never took place. During five weeks’ detention WW was never seen by a member of the mental health outreach team, despite two referrals being made, nor by the substance misuse team. When he reported that he would rather be extradited dead than alive he was made subject to self harm procedures which were withdrawn within 24 hours and he was found hanging the following morning.&#xa0;An inquest jury found that WW hanged himself whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed and that his death was contributed to by neglect.&#xa0;WW’s family were citizens of the Republic of Ireland and therefore not lawfully resident in the UK. A claim was brought under the Human Rights Act for breach of article 2 ECHR, the right to life, which was settled for £15,000.&#xa0;

[[[Victims of trafficking ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Case H - ]]]

[[[Unrecognised]]]

[[[ trafficking victim]]]AS

[[[ ]]]is a 19 year-old Nigerian national and a victim of trafficking, forced labour and physical abuse at the hands of her aunt, her aunt’s husband and her maternal grandmother. AS’s aunt brought her to the UK in 2007 where she subjected her to sustained physical abuse. In 2009 AS reported the abuse to her teachers and local Social Services who sent a social worker to speak to AS but took no further steps to investigate the abuse. In 2012 AS reported the abuse to the police who closed the investigation a week later. AS claims violation of her rights pursuant to Articles 3 and 4 ECHR, on the basis that the police and social services have failed to protect her from inhuman and degrading treatment and from being held in servitude.&#xa0;In September 2012 the Home Office decided that there were reasonable grounds to believe that AS was a victim of trafficking. She then began a claim for asylum. She has a strong connection with the UK by virtue of being a victim of abuse in the UK over a five-year period. Nevertheless AS would appear to fall foul of the residence test because the reasonable grounds decision was not made until after the commencement of her civil claim and her claim for asylum was brought after that decision. Had the civil claim been postponed until after the decision the limitation period under the Human Rights Act would have expired.&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;27 September 2013 These detentions occurred prior to the coalition government’s change in policy in 2010 (which reduced but did not end the detention of children under immigration powers). A wealth of material regarding the harm caused to children by these practices is available in the public domain. It includes reports such as ‘State Sponsored Cruelty’ by Medical Justice in 2010 which records, inter alia, children experiencing the use of force themselves, children witnessing the self-harm and suicide attempts of others, witnessing their parents’ mental health deteriorate and suffering deterioration in their own physical and mental health. See also Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Royal College of General Practitioners, Royal College of Psychiatrists and Faculty of Public Health: Inter collegiate Briefing Paper: “Significant Harm – the effects of administrative detention on the health of children, young people and their families” delivered in December 2009, and the study ‘The mental and physical health difficulties of children held within a British immigration detention center:  A pilot study’, Lorek et al, Child Abuse and Neglect 33 (2009) 573- 585 In the event, the Claimants themselves at the time of the claim may have fallen within the residence test exceptions (although this is not entirely clear). Mr Justice Collins granted the injunction in favour of the claimants with the following comments: ‘I hope that the defendant will recognise that prima facie use of force against children and pregnant women is generally speaking unacceptable unless clear and appropriate limitations on its use ... are set out.’ &#xa0; Legal aid granted under Section 32 Part 1 Schedule 1 LASPO
