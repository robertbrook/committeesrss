"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (LCI0019)The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers \n(CIBSE) \nis the professional body that exists to:\n‘support\n the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information’ \nCIBSE members are the engineers who design, install, operate, maintain and refurbish the energy using systems installed \nin buildings, including homes, and are specifically trained in the \ndesign and installation of low carbon building fabric and the associated \nsystems for the provision of heating and hot water, lighting, ventilation and cooling and small power distribution i\nn homes.\nAs an Institution CIBSE publishes Guidance and Codes which provide best practice advice and are internationally recognised as authoritative. The CIBSE Knowledge Portal, makes our Guidance available online to all CIBSE members and is the leading sy\nstematic engineering resource for the building services sector. Over the last \ntwo years\n it has been accessed over 200,000 times, and is used regularly by our members to access the latest guidance material for the profession. Currently we have users in over\n 170 countries, demonstrating the world leading position of UK engineering expertise in this field.\nCIBSE is pleased to respond to \nthe \nC\nommittee’s\n consultation on \nLow Carbon Innovation.\nSummary of CIBSE Response1. There is too much focus in the Government’s approach to Low carbon Innovation on individual measures or incentives and insufficient focus on systems integration and on feedback and analysis of the performance of incentivised low carbon measures. 2. The current strategy does not reflect that used elsewhere in Government  of first reducing energy use through efficiency, then reducing energy use through low carbon systems, and only then delivering energy through low carbon or renewable generation. 3. There is insufficient attention to existing buildings and the specific consumer or user aspects of promoting low carbon interventions in existing buildings, and undue emphasis on retrofitting bolt on low carbon technology. 4. There is insufficient support for the innovations required for  the delivery of existing policies such as the energy performance of buildings regulations and building regulations. Q1. Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?1. \nThe \nassociated \nNAO \nReport \nhas quoted the IIASA \nGlobal Energy Assessment’s conclusion\n that innovation plays a key role in the delivery of a low carbon global economy. Many of the innovations that will be de\nployed over the next decades to meet the UK’s target will have been developed by industries abroad\n eager to capture global markets\n. European manufacturers are taking leading roles in technology like organic LED’s, High Voltage DC transmission and smart gri\nd control. The Department inherited \npossibly\n the most incoherent programme of \npublic sector \nresearch amongst its \ninternational \npeers, and its approach \nto \nconsolidation and co-ordination is widely welcomed. \nW\nhether\n,\n \nwhen \nviewed in hindsight\n,\n this consolidation \nwill be seen to have delivered\n the \nUK’s \ntargets at the lowest cost\n,\n is a harder question. \n2. \nEnergy\n engineering\n, \nwhether \ncollecting biomass \nor \ndistributing \nelectrical \npower is a set of interconnected systems. Systems incorrectly analyz\ned deliver less than the sum of their parts.  This is as true in cutting edge \nlow energy \nbuilding design as it is in many other fields. Indeed this Institution has \nrecently \nprioritised looking at city level \nenergy \nsystems as key to delivering the full prom\nise of technology\n to meet low carbon targets\n. This \nimportant \nurban\n-level\n \ntheme \nwas also \nechoed in the IIASA report. We find the Governments innovation plans very patchy \nin resolving the inevitable systemic issues\n in target delivery\n. \nTo achieve outcomes tha\nt are efficient and effective, i\nnnovation in deployment is at least\n,\n if not more critical\n,\n than innovation in components.\n3. Innovation in deployment requires a greater degree of integration between policies than is currently achieved. For example, there a\nre several incentive schemes for the delivery of low carbon building technologies, the feed in tariff for photovoltaics and the renewable heat incentive for biomass heating, solar thermal and heat pump systems. When first launched \nnone \nof these required an\ny minimum level of energy efficiency to be present in buildings in receipt of the incentive payments, even though the installation of basic insulation and draft proofing would have delivered a far better return on investment than the investment in renewabl\ne systems. This clearly fails the test of delivering low carbon innovation at lowest cost. \n4. \nIn contrast \nthe Department for Communities and Local Government, they have adopted a hierarchical approach to delivering “zero carbon” buildings, \n[[to include it\n would be a bit of a diversion]]\nThis sets out the policy approach of seeking improvements in building fabric first, then seeking to reduce the emissions from the installed energy using systems, called carbon compliance, and only then looking to install ren\newables (or using “allowable solutions” instead). Whilst “allowable solutions” demonstrate innovation in low carbon accountancy, they are unlikely to drive innovation in low carbon technology.\n5. A further frequently overlooked aspect of low carbon \ninnovation relates to its successful integration into buildings\n as complex systems\n. Buildings are responsible for almost half of UK carbon emissions, and many of those which emit the highest levels of carbon per unit floor area are the most complex. In the\nory, Building Regulations require that these buildings have the\nir\n complex energy systems properly installed, tested, and commissioned, or put into practical operation. In practice, it is widely understood in the industry that the various minimum legal requ\nirements to commission building services systems are honoured in the breach. \n6. There is also evidence to suggest that the measures required by the energy performance of buildings regulations, which implement the eponymous Directive, are widely \noverlooked\n, leaving building owners individually, and DCLG, DECC and other policymakers unaware of current levels of energy performance of much of the building stock. It \nis\n \ntherefore very \nhard \nto argue that low carbon building innovation is being delivered on the sc\nale it should be, let alone at lowest cost.\n A strong driver for innovation would be if new buildings procured by Government were required to deliver a Display Energy Certificate rating of A in \nthe relevant\n c\nategory\n. \nDEC’s focus on real out turns not simply\n design calculations made pre-tender.\nQ2.Does the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?7. \nThis I\nnstitution has long been concerned at the inverted pyramid of public sector funding for energy research.  Research that improves the efficiency and efficacy of energy use may be messy but that is not a reason to deprioritise it against far blue skies resea\nrch agendas like fusion, which often have little industrial relevance to the UK. \nThis issue goes far beyond a low carbon agenda. If international consensus was to fail and the UK carbon target was to fade, the economy still has the pressing problem of rema\nining \nglobally \ncompetitive should its marginal fuel remain LNG, \ncurrently \nthe most expensive \nfossil \nfuel of all. \n8. Given the current levels of concern about the falling capacity margin in the wholesale electricity market, any policy which can deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions and energy demand has the potential to reduce the risk of power supply dis\nruption. Energy efficiency, or enabling people not to use as much energy without impairing their comfort, enjoyment or productive use of buildings is the lowest cost route to reducing UK electricity and gas demand. It may not require huge levels of technic\nal research, but some of the research into consumer behaviour and reaction to energy efficiency propositions shows that more needs to be done to deliver consumer acceptable low carbon building refurbishment\n.\nQ3. What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?9. \nIn the built environment sector, \nwhich is \nitself a significant part of the \nUK \ncarbon footprint\n,\n market pull rather than\n technology push has been the defining paradigm of successful innovation. Unfortunately a\n procurement\n incentive plan with sufficient stability to create confidence has seldom been \nthe outcome. \n&#xa0;\n10. \nFor example \nlevel 6 of the\n Code for Sustainable Homes had\n been both a test bed for new technology and a market pull for better overall performance of housing\n. As Code levels became economically achie\nv\nable \nby the industry at large \nthey could\n be later encapsulated in Building Regulations. We now understand that in\n England \nat least (\nand \npossibly also \nWales\n)\n the \nproposed\n Housing Standards \nReview \nwill \nlead to a winding down of the Code and public sector housing procurement will \nno longer link to it\n. \n \nA\nn important incentive \nfor innovation \nhas \ntherefore \nbeen removed in \na critical area. Some of the leading specialist\n firms\n who have provided much of the innovation \nin this sector \nnow face a difficult time\n, with little obvious prospect of their investments in levels 5 and 6 being profitable\n. \nIf there were short comings with \nthe Code, given its innovation importance, they sh\no\nuld have been addressed rather than the Code abandoned.\n11. \nCloser to home, LCICG should look to \nthe need for some stability in funding arrangements, and for \nsmoother transitions between incentive schemes.\n \nThe current hiatus over the Energy Company Obligation has led to an almost total moratorium on new projects being approved, with very serious implications for the specialists who provide installations under ECO. These installers have to be certificated un\nder the Green Deal installer rules, a process which will have cost them. Now, without the regulated workstream they expected from the ECO, they have to compete on the open unregulated market with those variously described as “cowboy” or “rogue” traders, wh\nere they cannot hope to recoup the costs of investing in Green Deal approval and certification. \nTheir learning curves gains from repeated quality installations will be dispersed. \nThe changes to the ECO arrangements threaten to penalise those installers mos\nt likely to be working to \nand advancing \ngood practice standards, and to reward those who stayed out of the ECO and Green Deal system. That is perverse. \n&#xa0;\n12. \nHowever, it is also a threat to future low carbon innovation schemes, as those who may consider be\ncoming early \ninvestors\n will need to form a view on whether the scheme, and the political support for it, will be sufficien\ntly robust to justify the risk of early participat\nion\n. \n&#xa0;\n13. \nCurrent transitions \nin the feed in tariff and renewable heat incentive al\nso \nappea\nr to pay little heed to the col\nl\na\nteral damage caused by abrupt change and funding hiatus. Specialist firms, and those most likely to provide innovative solutions, suffer most. In the present SME banking climate the effect can be terminal\n, and only \nodd job cowboy contractors survive\n.\n&#xa0;\n14. \nThe Committee has asked for views on metrics. \nExperience suggests that metrics can cause more harm than good unless they closely reflect the objectives. \nThe problems associated wioth a patents metric provides a good\n example. \nF\ninding a faster, cheaper way to install a solar collector is never likely to obtain a patent, but would revolutionize the market\n since insulation costs now dominate\n. We note that the LCICG naturally chose patents as one possibility, without nece\nssarily recognizing that this could distort priorities. \n&#xa0;\n15. In the market to retrofit low carbon solutions to existing buildings, the most significant innovations are likely to be process related, and not product related. Working out how to create a pack\nage of cost effective measures to improve the worst housing in a cost effective manner will require innovation, but not patents. Perhaps metrics need to be applied to successful outcomes in the form of measurable low carbon results in buildings. The emphas\nis needs to be on measured practical low carbon outcomes on site, and not on predicted theoretical results in a building simulation or design. \nQ4. Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?16. \nWe do not believe that is currently true for the built environment. While enthusiasts often promote the idea of learning \nrat\nes to justify \ninvestment in expensiv\ne renewables technology, it is hard to see how the argument can apply when there is so little investment in collecting \ndata from which to \nlearn.  Integrating heat pumps into heating systems is a case in point. Manufacturers’ test data suggested impressive \nperformance\n from the latest models\n. \nBut i\nt required an initiative by the Energy Savings Trust to actually test the field performance of some 80 installations. Needless to say because of a lack of knowledge about critical systems\n integration\n issues the actu\nal performance was disappointing. \nYet CERT had installed some 8,000 heat pump installations without any feedback or learning.  \nNAO recently commented on the general lack of feedback information during their review of the Levy Control Framework.\n17. \nIt is e\nven impossible to access \nstatutory \nDisplay Energy Certificate \n(\nD\nEC) d\nata \nin quantity \nonline without incurring \nsignificant \nfees, despite the availability of benchmarking data being critical for the confident roll out of new technology.\n Although energy perfo\nrmance data is essential to the improvement of our building stock, DCLG is tied into a contract for the management of the national database of energy certificate data under which access to the data is only available at considerable expense. In the case of \nDEC data, which is required to be displayed in public buildings, and is therefore publicly available data, to obtain that data in aggregate form from Landmark is prohibitively expensive. \nQ5. What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?18. \nThe Institution can only offer an observation. Modern R&amp;D is a fast moving area. For example smart grids built today might be obsolete in 5 years time such is the pace of IT technology. What is often a greater disincentive\n than fun\nding length\n, especially when trying to incorporate new technology into a real project\n,\n is the front end delay in obtaining final approval\n from a support scheme\n.  Whether delays are unavoidable it is hard to say from \nthe \noutside\n, but our own research fund \ncan \nmake allocative decisions within weeks.\nQ6. How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?19. \nThe Institution suggests th\nat the Committee might wish to \ne\nn\nquir\ne whether the underspend relates \nin part \nto Departmental staffing levels.  In other areas of Government recent staff reductions have had a disproportionate reduction in in-house technical skills able to process projects with confidence.\n20. The Department \nmight consider that any initiative to increase spending should focus on improving system integration and outcomes, and on measuring actual practical performance of some of the early installations under the various existing schemes.\nQ7. How is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?21. \nCIBSE’s membership is worldwide.  We work closely with our US sister organisation \nASHRAE \nand we are an active member in the Europe wide equivalen\nt REHVA.  Most of the public sector research is indeed in the public domain, and many of the companies involved in innovation are themselves global in reach. Possibly the starkest comparison is in the style of \ninnovation\n procurement. The US Department of E\nnergy funds large programmes through experienced prime contractors, much as the 1970’s \nUK \nDepartment of Energy used the UKEA to run the programmes of the Energy Efficiency Office. \nUS \nGovernment is also a strong provider of market pull for innovation, espec\nially the Department of Defense. \nThis May\n,\n for example\n,\n DOD connected its Fort Bliss embedded generation system into the Texa\ns power grid, showcasing Lockhee\nd smart grid controllers. \n In Europe larg\ne metrop\no\nl\nitan authorities are frequently involved in the \nprocurement of innovative solutions such as advanced waste combustion and heat distribution. The po\nw\ner of informed and challenging procurement along the technology strategy trajectory is noticeable by its absence in the UK\n programmes\n.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n See the report on the EPSRC funded CALEBRE project on energy efficient renovation of homes.\n \n"
