[normal]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Current research gives us limited understanding of 
[normal]how 
[normal]the structure and content of 
[normal]media 
[normal]coverage impinges on public understanding of climate change.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ork done 
[normal]o
[normal]n television
[normal] coverage – the public’s most trusted and most used source of information – has 
[normal]been undertaken
[normal] by 
[normal]this submission’s 
[normal]author
[normal]. I
[normal]t illuminates a set of worrying patterns that are under-explored by principal funders of research.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Unique research undertaken by the author suggests televisual coverage 
[normal]of climate change has diminished. But such coverage as there is 
[normal]has a measurable influence on the emphasis that citizens place on the topic as a significant issue facing Britain. This 
[normal]‘salience’ 
[normal]is an important precursor to further public engagement, but needs to be viewed in the light of climate sceptic
[normal] coverage
[normal] (a topic also under-explored in research)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]This
[normal] submission suggests that the main research funders need encourage
[normal]ment
[normal] to support 
[normal]work that 
[normal]integrat
[normal]es
[normal] of research on public attitude formation
[normal] (heavily funded)
[normal], with long-term assessments o
[normal]f press and television coverage of climate change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Broadcasters in both the non-commercial and commercial sectors need to be challenged on the emphasis place
[normal]d
[normal] on documenting climate change. In addition, senior government 
[normal]politicians 
[normal]ought to be challenged on the extent to which they are prepared to invest political capital in raising the profile of climate change. Finally, 
[normal]press 
[normal]editors should be challenged on the
[normal]ir
[normal] rationale 
[normal]for 
[normal]continued emphasis on climate sceptic
[normal]ism
[normal].

[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]This evidence is 
[normal]based on 
[normal]the author’s extensive contribution to 
[normal]political communication 
[normal]research. Th
[normal]is straddles 
[normal]climate-related public relations, the coverage of climate change in all significant media (press, television and the internet),
[normal]1
[normal] and the media’s impact on public attitu
[normal]d
[normal]es.

[normal] The author of this

[normal]also currently Convenor of the Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association’s ‘Climate Change, Environment and Sustainability network, an umbrella organisation for scholars research
[normal]ing

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The evidence is also given against 
[normal]a 
[normal]background of ongoing 
[normal]exploratory 
[normal]research on climate change coverage
[normal]’s impact
[normal] on public attitudes, 
[normal]and 
[normal]the incidence of climate sceptic coverage in the

[normal]Background
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he press is currently taking a diminishing interest in climate (
[normal]see 
[normal]Figure 3.1).
[normal] This is worryingly consistent with the rise, plateau and decline pattern outlined in ‘issue attention cycle’ thesis, with we may well be at a phase characterised by declining interest and a ‘post-problem’ mentality.
[normal]4
[normal] Here, spikes around the Copenhagen conference and recently, are not necessarily reassuring, as they may represent the ‘spasmodic recurrence’ of attention allowed for in this perspective. In addition, this overarching pattern cannot be looked at in isolation from the much, much larger quantity of coverage that bears on non-climate, ‘bread-and-butter’ issues, like crime, health and economics.

[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]underlying structure 
[normal]of this coverage 
[normal]has some features that are 
[normal]well established
[normal]. First, the broadsheet 
[normal](and notably 
[normal]the Guardian and Independent
[normal])
[normal] make a
[normal] very
[normal] notable contribution. Second, 
[normal]broadsheet 
[normal]coverage has a sophisticated take on climate change, with sceptical messages
[normal], according to some assessments,
[normal] much less apparent than they were.
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]Third, 
[normal]the high circulation mid-market and tabloid press takes a lesser interest
[normal], but 
[normal]th
[normal]e tabloid
[normal] 
[normal]in particular are 
[normal]not trusted, nor 
[normal]are they 
[normal]cited 
[normal]by citizens 
[normal]as their principal 
[normal]information 
[normal]source
[normal]. 
[normal]Nevertheless, the 
[normal]wider 
[normal]literature 
[normal]on ‘media effects’ 
[normal]suggests that 
[normal]broadsheet
[normal]s
[normal] and 
[normal]the mid-market ‘
[normal]black top
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]titles 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] the 
[normal]potential
[normal] to influence public appreciat
[normal]ion of 
[normal]climate change.
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]Other 
[normal]work 
[normal]on public perceptions of the climate commentary 
[normal]suggests the 
[normal]citizens 
[normal]cite the media as a source of climate information, talk to family and friends about 
[normal]such 
[normal]coverage, but nevertheless continue to dispute 
[normal]global warming’s 
[normal]anthropogenic basis, and are still confused about the science.
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]What is much 
[normal]less
[normal] well-understood, is how 
[normal]television 
[normal]which 
[normal]is
[normal] trusted use
[normal]d
[normal] as a 
[normal]reliable information
[normal], refract
[normal]s
[normal] climate issues. The author’s research suggest that even at significant ‘moments’ for climate change (such as Copenhagen, 2009), television 
[normal]news
[normal] coverage 
[normal]is 
[normal]quite modest, a 
[normal]historical 
[normal]pattern 
[normal]noted by others
[normal].
[normal]7
[normal] 
[normal]It 
[normal]also suggest
[normal]ed
[normal] that climate sceptic messages 
[normal]are 
[normal]more prominent than 
[normal]is commonly acknowledged, or 
[normal]healthy. 
[normal]However
[normal], there is very little research that deals 
[normal]directly
[normal] with the impact of 
[normal]such 
[normal]coverage.
[normal]6
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Some c
[normal]urrent research has sought to 
[normal]update what the public think about climate change, and how this relate
[normal]s
[normal] to media representations
[normal], sponsored by UKERC and by a combination of NERC, DECC and Defra
[normal].
[normal]8
[normal] However, solid as 
[normal]this work is
[normal], 
[normal]it suffers 
[normal]in 
[normal]some 
[normal]important respect
[normal]s. 
[normal]The focus is primarily on attitudes and attitude development. But 
[normal]it 
[normal]is not 
[normal]closely 
[normal]articulat
[normal]ed
[normal] to 
[normal]an assessment of the 
[normal]long-term 
[normal]patterning of 
[normal]coverage
[normal] across 
[normal]all
[normal] media
[normal] (especially
[normal], though not exclusively,
[normal] with regard to 
[normal]TV coverage
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]or 
[normal]the prevalence of climate sceptic messages
[normal] across 
[normal]the 
[normal]media
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]Finally, 
[normal]with a reliance on focus group
[normal] techniques
[normal] 
[normal]it 
[normal]does not 
[normal]explore the 
[normal]full range of ways in which ‘media impact’ is 
[normal]generally 
[normal]conceived and evidenced.

[normal]              
[normal]What little work that has been done on TV documentary coverage of climate c
[normal]hange, has been conducted by this
[normal] 
[normal]submission’s 
[normal]author.
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]genre is 
[normal]important
[normal]. I
[normal]t 
[normal]is 
[normal]a source citizens trust, and documentaries 
[normal]can 
[normal]give sustained attention to the issue 
[normal]lacking in 
[normal]new
[normal]s
[normal] bulletins. 
[normal]An ongoing 
[normal]and exhaustive 
[normal]survey of
[normal] climate documentary 
[normal] 
[normal]programming 
[normal]shows the same 
[normal]general
[normal] structure as press
[normal] coverage – a 
[normal]rise, plateau
[normal], then
[normal] decline (see Figure 
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]below, 
[normal]and Appendix
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]It is noteworthy that, like press coverage, the greatest emphasis came at a time when the Prime Minister, Chancellor and 
[normal]DECC 
[normal]Minister all strove 
[normal]persistently 
[normal]to 
[normal]make 
[normal]climate 
[normal]change 
[normal]a high profile issue at the heart of government (
[normal]with 
[normal]Opposition leader
[normal]s
[normal] compelled to position 
[normal]themselves 
[normal]accordingly). The current situation has seen both a drop in press and television coverage, 
[normal]at a time when 
[normal]climate change 
[normal]is 
[normal]given a much lower profile by 
[normal]significant figures in 
[normal]the government.

[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]structure 
[normal]of documentary coverage 
[normal]is 
[normal]concerning
[normal] for a number of reasons. 
[normal]First, the vast bulk of these documentaries are
[normal] on BBC,
[normal] 
[normal]not
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]commercial
[normal] channels
[normal]. This 
[normal]is 
[normal]understandable, if commercial broadcasters consider this form of programming 
[normal]un
[normal]likely to draw 
[normal]large 
[normal]audience, and hence 
[normal]generate 
[normal]limited 
[normal]advertising revenue. 
[normal]But this 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]consign
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]their duty to keep the public informed about one of the most commanding issues of our generation, 
[normal]to a 
[normal]second-order 
[normal]priority
[normal]. 
[normal]Second
[normal], of the last three documentaries, only one 
[normal]was 
[normal]on 
[normal]BBC1
[normal]. Before th
[normal]is
[normal], 
[normal]there was only 
[normal]one in late 2009 and 
[normal]another in 
[normal]mid-2010
[normal]. T
[normal]he rest 
[normal]predate March 2007.
[normal]This 
[normal]too 
[normal]is significant. 
[normal]BBC1 is 
[normal]the 
[normal]place where viewers 
[normal]are most likely to 
[normal]encounter documentar
[normal]ies
[normal]. They
[normal] watch
[normal] 
[normal]around 
[normal]9.8 hours per year on 
[normal]BBC1
[normal],
[normal]8
[normal] 
[normal]s
[normal]o a drop of
[normal]f
[normal] here is potentially significant
[normal] for audience exposure to the issue
[normal]. ITV1 is next in line
[normal], with the
[normal] public watching 
[normal]3.8
[normal] hours per year
[normal] on this channel
[normal] – a considerable way behind
[normal]. 
[normal]But a
[normal]lthough the last two 
[normal]documentaries we
[normal]re on ITV1, there were 
[normal]no
[normal] others
[normal] in our inventory
[normal]. 
[normal]Again, 
[normal]audience 
[normal]exposure to climate change (or, rather, 
[normal]its absence
[normal]) is an issue here. 
[normal]Finally, 
[normal]the vast bulk of documentaries were on 
[normal]niche
[normal] channels
[normal] 
[normal]characterised by low audience
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal](BBC2, BBC3, BBC4, and
[normal] to a much lesser extent, on
[normal] their commercial counterparts)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]This picture is significant in itself, but more so in 
[normal]view 
[normal]of recent exploratory research undertaken 
[normal]by th
[normal]is submission’s 
[normal]author
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]on the 
[normal]media’s 
[normal]so-called ‘agenda-setting’ role
[normal] – 
[normal]where 
[normal]they 
[normal]possess the power to direct 
[normal]citizen 
[normal]attention to particular issues, 
[normal]via
[normal] the quantity of coverage. Th
[normal]eir
[normal] output 
[normal]influence
[normal]s
[normal] the extent to which citizens consider 
[normal]an 
[normal]issue 
[normal]a significant 
[normal]one 
[normal]facing the country
[normal] (
[normal]its 
[normal]‘
[normal]salience
[normal]’
[normal])
[normal]. The analysis
[normal] 
[normal]explored 
[normal]the period between 2000 and late 2007
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]before 
[normal]‘the economy’ began to dominate
[normal] political,
[normal] media and public agendas. 
[normal]Unlike Figure 3.1, i
[normal]t 
[normal]only 
[normal]tracked 
[normal]press 
[normal]stories where climate figured in 
[normal]headlines
[normal]. In addition, 
[normal]it 
[normal]differentiated between 
[normal]stories 
[normal]from 
[normal]the broadsheets, the mid-market ‘black tops’
[normal] (Mail/Express),
[normal] and the ‘red top’ tabloids
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]enter
[normal]ed
[normal] them 
[normal]separately
[normal] in the model
[normal]. 
[normal]A 
[normal]number of political events 
[normal](such as 9/11 and Gulf War 2) 
[normal]also 
[normal]figured 
[normal]in the
[normal] assessment
[normal], to determine if they had an
[normal]y
[normal] 
[normal]role 
[normal]in distracting 
[normal]citizens 
[normal]from environmental issues. Finally, and uniquely, our analysis factor
[normal]ed
[normal] in the 
[normal]Figure 3
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal]’s 
[normal]documentaries. But
[normal], in
[normal] 
[normal]addit
[normal]i
[normal]on
[normal],
[normal] a 
[normal]separate
[normal] variable was entered for 
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]‘
[normal]Great Global Warming Swindle’
[normal] documentary
[normal], because
[normal] – unlike 
[normal]all 
[normal]others 
[normal]– 
[normal]its 
[normal]highly controversial 
[normal]message was unequivocally 
[normal]at odds with the scientific consensus
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]The results suggest that only broadsheet coverage had an impact on 
[normal]‘
[normal]salience
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] There was no such impact for 
[normal]either 
[normal]the ‘black tops’ or ‘red tops’, nor did the political event variables achieve statistical significance
[normal]. But importantly there was an interaction effect between broadsheet coverage and documentary coverage
[normal]: 
[normal]in effect, the two mediums 
[normal]conjoin
[normal] to produce a greater influence on salience, than the broadsheet press would on its own. 
[normal]A
[normal]ddition
[normal]ally
[normal], the ‘Great Global Warming Swindle’ had a
[normal]n independent,
[normal] measurable and statistically significant impact 
[normal]in 
[normal]lowering
[normal] salience
[normal]. This
[normal] 
[normal]particular 
[normal]finding 
[normal]is un
[normal]surprising 
[normal]in 
[normal]some 
[normal]respect
[normal]s
[normal]. ‘Swindle
[normal]’s highly controversial nature helped generate an audience of near
[normal]ly
[normal] two million, in all likelihood far beyond that of many (if not all) the other documentaries
[normal]. In addition, it generated supportive commentary in the Telegraph and 
[normal]the 
[normal]black top press
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] But
[normal],
[normal] if 
[normal]un
[normal]surprising, 
[normal]the finding 
[normal]is 
[normal]still 
[normal]worrying, given its 
[normal]potent 
[normal]counter-consensus message.
[normal] The results underscore the problematic nature of Channel 4’s defence of its broadcast, on the grounds that it 
[normal]balanced
[normal] a portfolio of environmental output which also contained material 
[normal]consistent 
[normal]with the scientific consensus.
[normal]9
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]              
[normal]Given the findings, it is no surprise that with climate change now diminished in press coverage (Figure 3.1), and documentary coverage dwindling (Figure 4.1), the salience of the environment is at a record and worrying low, and on a sharp downward track.
[normal] 10
[normal] 
[normal]But another feature of ongoing research 
[normal]on the British press 
[normal]is pertinent here. It 
[normal]has t
[normal]r
[normal]acked climate sceptic messages in our national newspapers, and 
[normal]suggests unchallenged 
[normal]contrarian 
[normal]commentary is still persistent in 
[normal]a 
[normal]broadsheet 
[normal]press that helps drive the salience of climate (notably in the Telegraph), and in 
[normal]a 
[normal]black top press that so conspicuously supported the ‘Great Global Warming Swindle’ documentary.

[normal]Conclusions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]From 
[normal]th
[normal]e 
[normal]perspective
[normal] of the evidence presented here
[normal], the picture is concern
[normal]ing
[normal]. It invites us to consider 
[normal]a number of 
[normal]interrelated 
[normal]issues. 
[normal]To what extent do we need a research agenda that takes into consideration the structure of climate change coverage in the widest possible range of media? Do we need to find a way to integrate existing research on climate attitudes and attitude development, with a fuller appreciation of these structures. And to what extent do the principal funders of such research need to 
[normal]be encouraged to 
[normal]acknowledge 
[normal]such 
[normal]issues?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, there are questions for the broadcasters
[normal] and for the press
[normal]. Given the remit 
[normal]of the former 
[normal]to educate and inform the public, h
[normal]ow 
[normal]far 
[normal]are they prepared to 
[normal]go to 
[normal]document 
[normal]climate 
[normal]change 
[normal]in the future?
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ill 
[normal]th
[normal]eir
[normal] output reflect the urgency the scientific com
[normal]munity express about the issue
[normal], and will this be tempered significantly by concerns about audience figures and advertising revenue
[normal]? 
[normal]And t
[normal]o what extent will 
[normal]counter-consensus messages like that embodied in the ‘Great Global Warming Swindle’
[normal] be given a place in broadcasting output?
[normal] For 
[normal]newspaper 
[normal]editors, some of the same themes emerge. Although, the press acknowledge no obligation to inform or educate the public, they should perhaps consider more fully than they do at present, the potential impact their coverage has, and the extent to which it serves the public good.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Finally, what role do senior government politicians have in heightening the media profile of climate change? 
[normal]The media often take their cue on what is important from these figures. 
[normal]Here
[normal],
[normal] the issue of political leadership 
[normal]comes 
[normal]to the forefront.
