[normal]Introduction[bold]Special Olympics
[normal] 
[normal]bring
[normal]s
[normal] together more than 4.2 million athletes with intellectual disabilities across 175 countries. Established in 1978, we provide year round training and competition opportunities for children and adults with intellectual disabilities in 33 different sports ev
[normal]ery single day. We don't just support athletes but their families too.
[normal] 
[normal]We 
[normal]recognise
[normal] the correlation between poverty and disabil
[normal]ity and the further impact that 
[normal]impoverishment has on those already marginalised by disability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Participating in sports 
[normal]helps 
[normal]peo
[normal]ple with intellectual disabilities
[normal] become more confident, active citizens and learn important physical and emotional life skill
[normal]s. But the Special Oly
[normal]mpics movement
[normal] is about more than just sport – we run
[normal] education, early intervention training and health 
[normal]screening programmes to create more inclusive communities and improve 
[normal]the 
[normal]general health and wellbeing of our athletes.
[normal]Special Olympics is helping foster a more inclusive society by highlighting ability over disability, allowing people with intellectual 
[normal]disability to realise their potential whilst also breaking down inaccurate and negative perceptions about intellectual disability amongst the wider community.
[normal] 
[normal]We welcome this opportunity to submit evidence to the International Development Committee and wo
[normal]uld be delighted to provide 
[normal]further, oral
[normal] evidence to the inquiry.

[normal] 
[normal]Given the broad focus of this inquiry, 
[normal]we
[normal] have addr
[normal]essed the following issues 
[normal]of specific interest 
[normal]where 
[normal]Special Olympics have real
[normal] experience of delivering 
[normal]effective 
[normal]programmes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The adequacy of DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development, and whether it needs a disability strategy[bold]It is 
[normal]the 
[normal]Special 
[normal]Olympics
[normal]’
[normal] firm belief that DFID should develop a clear disability strategy – and one that explicitly seeks to address the challenges faced by 
[normal]people 
[normal]with intellectual disabilities across the world.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Individuals with intellectual disabilities represent on
[normal]e of the most marginalized and underserved groups in the world today.  Representing approximately 3% of the world’s population, individuals with intellectual disabilities are subjected to some of the most 
[normal]the worst
[normal] abuses and rights deprivation the world h
[normal]as ever 
[normal]seen.  These individuals suffer the lowest child survival and education rates, and some of the highest abuse and health disparity rates in the world.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite global reporting on this epidemic from the World Health Organization’s 
[normal]World Report on 
[normal]Disability
[normal], UNICEF’s 
[normal]2013 State of the World’s Children 
[normal]Report
[normal], and the recent UN High Level Meeting on Disability and Development, development assistance and aid falls woefully short in providing direct support and investment in improving their social pro
[normal]tection, education, access to health, employment
[normal] –
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]most importantly, their right to life.
[normal] 
[normal]Nowhere in the world has this epidemic come with
[normal] more dire consequences for the 
[normal]population than in Africa.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DFID ha
[normal]s
[normal] traditionally led the world on disability-inclusive development. Recent initiatives
[normal] – include the 
[normal]announcement
[normal] that all new DFID-funded schools will be accessible to disabled children, 
[normal]the Department’s
[normal] call
[normal]s 
[normal]for be
[normal]tter global data on disability 
[normal]and an 
[normal]increased emphasis on disabled people in future development targets
[normal] –
[normal] have
[normal] 
[normal]all been welcome. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, DFID’s 
[normal]current policy commitments on disability and development do not g
[normal]o far enough in addressing the strong
[normal] link 
[normal]between disability and poverty
[normal]. Remov
[normal]ing barriers to the participation of disabled 
[normal]people in society 
[normal]should be a cornerstone of DFID
[normal]’
[normal]s pol
[normal]icies
[normal] and development work.  
[normal]1.3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I[bold]ntegration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmes (for example in health, education, sanitation, livelihoods, [bold]and empowerment) and its humanitarian work.[bold]The 
[normal]Special Olympics
[normal]’
[normal] goal is to end the cycle of poverty and exclusion faced by people with intellectual disabilities.
[normal] 
[normal] People with intellectual disabilities are 
[normal]regularly 
[normal]excluded from government
[normal]-
[normal]run disability programmes 
[normal]which more often focus
[normal] on physical disabilities. 
[normal]We believe that DFID should fully integrate disability issues – particularly those associated with intellectual disabilities – into all its sector programmes. 
[normal]Evidence of 
[normal]the effec
[normal]t of poverty on people with intellectual disabilities across 
[normal]the 
[normal]different 
[normal]DFID sector
[normal] programmes 
[normal]includes:
[normal]Education:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Healthcare[bold]Employment[bold]Community and political participation[bold]Our work
[normal] in the areas of inclusive sports, global health, early childhood development, family support and youth activation 
[normal]could support DFID’s development work throughout Africa 
[normal]and
[normal] serve as ‘bes
[normal]t practice’ that DFID can offer to additional assistance program
[normal]me
[normal]s.  
[normal]1.4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]effectiveness of DFID’s approach to rehabilitation and service provision for disabled people.[bold]DFID has been a leading development stakeholder in driving critical support for people 
[normal]with disabilities across many parts of the world.  As part of a renewed disa
[normal]bility and development approach – and one that focuses on 
[normal]rehabi
[normal]litation and service provision – 
[normal]DFID
[normal] 
[normal]stands to make one of the largest and most sustained impact of any foreign aid
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For people with intellectual disabilities, the 
[normal]‘s
[normal]ervice
[normal] provision’ 
[normal]aspect of DFID’s programme 
[normal] is of the highest importance.  
[normal]As already highlighted, people with intellectual disabilities (especially children)
[normal] face some of the lowes
[normal]t access rates of any marginalis
[normal]ed population subset in the world.  Education, health care, socia
[normal]l protection, advocacy services and
[normal] recreation still remain very much out of reach to this population.  In addition, most sectors, including education and heal
[normal]th across developing nations, are in desperate need of disability health care training, special 
[normal]teachers
[normal], inclusive ed
[normal]ucation training, youth sensitis
[normal]ation campaigns, and much more to create a viable setting for true inclusive development that will benefit
[normal] the groups most in need.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In an effort to increase the effectiveness of service provision for people with intellectual disabilities, 
[normal]we believe 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]should
[normal] integrate the population into mainstreamed initiatives, while also helping to create and resource
[normal] important training opportunities for doctors, teachers, and government officials so that people with intellectual disabilities are 
[normal]fully integrated into society
[normal].
[normal]1.5[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The strength of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disabil[bold]ity.[bold]Special Olympics have a wealth of evidence demonstrating the impact that development programmes can have on people with intellectual disabilities. 
[normal]A
[normal] particularly successful programme has focused on health screening. 
[normal]200 million
[normal] people with intellectual disabilities are denied access to quality health services
[normal] and we have been working through the 
[normal]Healthy 
[normal]Athletes 
[normal]programme to offer participants free 
[normal]health screenings, education, and
[normal] referrals for follow-up care
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Special Olympi
[normal]cs believe that every person with an intellectual disability and their family should be provided with the information and support to understand what they need to do in order to optimize their health. In order for this to be achieved information, resources,
[normal] systems and policies must exist at an individual, community and national level to support individuals and their families to realise healthy and productive lives. 
[normal]In Africa, over 27,000 free health screenings have been provided by Special Olympics between
[normal] 2007-2013. This has allowed basic access to health care for 
[normal]over 18,500 Special Olympics athletes 
[normal]in 33 countries
[normal].
[normal]The results of these screenings illustrate
[normal]s
[normal] the value of this care and highlight the striking disparity of access to healthcare for people w
[normal]ith 
[normal]i
[normal]ntellectual disability living in the developing world compared to their global counterparts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] For example, in Africa 
[normal]72.5% of athletes screened by Special Olympics to date had never had an eye exam
[normal] before, compared to 23.5% of Special Olympics athlete
[normal]s globally.
[normal]Through a system of community partnership
[normal],
[normal] Special Olympics aims to develop a network of local community health providers 
[normal][
[normal]in each country we work in
[normal]]
[normal] that are engaged with the Special Olympics’ health work and committed to providing ongoing health resources and services to people with intellectual disability and their families. Through this network
[normal],
[normal] we aim to ensure that all athletes remain engaged wit
[normal]h the health system throughout their lives. 
[normal]Over the next three years Special Olympic
[normal]s will be piloting the Healthy C
[normal]ommunities programme in the following countries: Peru, Mexico, South Africa, Malawi, Romania, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, and within t
[normal]he U.S. in Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas, New York, New Jersey, and Florida.
[normal]The Healthy Communities programme aims to
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Raise awareness around the issue of health disparities facing people with intellectual disability worldwide; 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Foster increased international
[normal] development cooperation focused on delivering care to this marginalized population, and;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ultimately create communities where Special Olympics athletes and others with intellectual disability have the same access to health and wellness resources – and can 
[normal]attain the same level of good health – as all community members.
