defaultIntroductiondefaultSpecial Olympics
default 
defaultbring
defaults
default together more than 4.2 million athletes with intellectual disabilities across 175 countries. Established in 1978, we provide year round training and competition opportunities for children and adults with intellectual disabilities in 33 different sports ev
defaultery single day. We don't just support athletes but their families too.
default 
defaultWe 
defaultrecognise
default the correlation between poverty and disabil
defaultity and the further impact that 
defaultimpoverishment has on those already marginalised by disability.
default&#xa0;
defaultParticipating in sports

defaultple with intellectual disabilities
default become more confident, active citizens and learn important physical and emotional life skill
defaults. But the Special Oly
defaultmpics movement
default is about more than just sport – we run
default education, early intervention training and health 
defaultscreening programmes to create more inclusive communities and improve 
defaultthe 
defaultgeneral health and wellbeing of our athletes.
defaultSpecial Olympics is helping foster a more inclusive society by highlighting ability over disability, allowing people with intellectual 
defaultdisability to realise their potential whilst also breaking down inaccurate and negative perceptions about intellectual disability amongst the wider community.
default 
defaultWe welcome this opportunity to submit evidence to the International Development Committee and wo
defaultuld be delighted to provide 
defaultfurther, oral

default 
defaultGiven the broad focus of this inquiry, 
defaultwe
default have addr
defaultessed the following issues 
defaultof specific interest 
defaultwhere 
defaultSpecial Olympics have real
default experience of delivering 
defaulteffective 
defaultprogrammes:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.2default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe adequacy of DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development, and whether it needs a disability strategydefaultIt is 
defaultthe 
defaultSpecial 
defaultOlympics
default’
default firm belief that DFID should develop a clear disability strategy – and one that explicitly seeks to address the challenges faced by 
defaultpeople 
defaultwith intellectual disabilities across the world.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIndividuals with intellectual disabilities represent on
defaulte of the most marginalized and underserved groups in the world today.  Representing approximately 3% of the world’s population, individuals with intellectual disabilities are subjected to some of the most 
defaultthe worst
default abuses and rights deprivation the world h
defaultas ever 
defaultseen.  These individuals suffer the lowest child survival and education rates, and some of the highest abuse and health disparity rates in the world.  
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite global reporting on this epidemic from the World Health Organization’s 
defaultWorld Report on 
defaultDisability
default, UNICEF’s 
default2013 State of the World’s Children 
defaultReport
default, and the recent UN High Level Meeting on Disability and Development, development assistance and aid falls woefully short in providing direct support and investment in improving their social pro
defaulttection, education, access to health, employment
default –
default and
default 
defaultmost importantly, their right to life.
default 
defaultNowhere in the world has this epidemic come with
default more dire consequences for the 
defaultpopulation than in Africa.  
default&#xa0;
defaultDFID ha
defaults
default traditionally led the world on disability-inclusive development. Recent initiatives
default – include the 
defaultannouncement
default that all new DFID-funded schools will be accessible to disabled children, 
defaultthe Department’s
default call
defaults 
defaultfor be
defaulttter global data on disability 
defaultand an 
defaultincreased emphasis on disabled people in future development targets
default –
default have
default 
defaultall been welcome. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, DFID’s 
defaultcurrent policy commitments on disability and development do not g
defaulto far enough in addressing the strong
default link 
defaultbetween disability and poverty
default. Remov
defaulting barriers to the participation of disabled 
defaultpeople in society 
defaultshould be a cornerstone of DFID
default’
defaults pol
defaulticies
default and development work.  
default1.3default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdefaultntegration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmes (for example in health, education, sanitation, livelihoods, defaultand empowerment) and its humanitarian work.defaultThe 
defaultSpecial Olympics
default’
default goal is to end the cycle of poverty and exclusion faced by people with intellectual disabilities.
default 
default People with intellectual disabilities are 
defaultregularly 
defaultexcluded from government
default-
defaultrun disability programmes 
defaultwhich more often focus
default on physical disabilities. 
defaultWe believe that DFID should fully integrate disability issues – particularly those associated with intellectual disabilities – into all its sector programmes. 
defaultEvidence of 
defaultthe effec
defaultt of poverty on people with intellectual disabilities across 
defaultthe 
defaultdifferent 
defaultDFID sector
default programmes 
defaultincludes:
defaultEducation:default&#xa0;defaultHealthcaredefaultEmploymentdefaultCommunity and political participationdefaultOur work
default in the areas of inclusive sports, global health, early childhood development, family support and youth activation 
defaultcould support DFID’s development work throughout Africa 
defaultand
default serve as ‘bes
defaultt practice’ that DFID can offer to additional assistance program
defaultme
defaults.  
default1.4default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe defaulteffectiveness of DFID’s approach to rehabilitation and service provision for disabled people.defaultDFID has been a leading development stakeholder in driving critical support for people 
defaultwith disabilities across many parts of the world.  As part of a renewed disa
defaultbility and development approach – and one that focuses on 
defaultrehabi
defaultlitation and service provision – 
defaultDFID
default 
defaultstands to make one of the largest and most sustained impact of any foreign aid
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFor people with intellectual disabilities, the 
default‘s
defaultervice
default provision’ 
defaultaspect of DFID’s programme 
default is of the highest importance.  
defaultAs already highlighted, people with intellectual disabilities (especially children)
default face some of the lowes
defaultt access rates of any marginalis
defaulted population subset in the world.  Education, health care, socia
defaultl protection, advocacy services and
default recreation still remain very much out of reach to this population.  In addition, most sectors, including education and heal
defaultth across developing nations, are in desperate need of disability health care training, special 
defaultteachers
default, inclusive ed
defaultucation training, youth sensitis
defaultation campaigns, and much more to create a viable setting for true inclusive development that will benefit
default the groups most in need.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn an effort to increase the effectiveness of service provision for people with intellectual disabilities, 
defaultwe believe 
defaultDFID 
defaultshould
default integrate the population into mainstreamed initiatives, while also helping to create and resource
default important training opportunities for doctors, teachers, and government officials so that people with intellectual disabilities are 
defaultfully integrated into society
default.
default1.5default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe strength of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disabildefaultity.defaultSpecial Olympics have a wealth of evidence demonstrating the impact that development programmes can have on people with intellectual disabilities. 
defaultA
default particularly successful programme has focused on health screening. 
default200 million
default people with intellectual disabilities are denied access to quality health services
default and we have been working through the 
defaultHealthy 
defaultAthletes 
defaultprogramme to offer participants free 
defaulthealth screenings, education, and
default referrals for follow-up care
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultSpecial Olympi
defaultcs believe that every person with an intellectual disability and their family should be provided with the information and support to understand what they need to do in order to optimize their health. In order for this to be achieved information, resources,
default systems and policies must exist at an individual, community and national level to support individuals and their families to realise healthy and productive lives. 
defaultIn Africa, over 27,000 free health screenings have been provided by Special Olympics between
default 2007-2013. This has allowed basic access to health care for 
defaultover 18,500 Special Olympics athletes 
defaultin 33 countries
default.
defaultThe results of these screenings illustrate
defaults
default the value of this care and highlight the striking disparity of access to healthcare for people w
defaultith 
defaulti
defaultntellectual disability living in the developing world compared to their global counterparts.
default&#xa0;
default For example, in Africa 
default72.5% of athletes screened by Special Olympics to date had never had an eye exam
default before, compared to 23.5% of Special Olympics athlete
defaults globally.
defaultThrough a system of community partnership
default,
default Special Olympics aims to develop a network of local community health providers 
default[
defaultin each country we work in
default]
default that are engaged with the Special Olympics’ health work and committed to providing ongoing health resources and services to people with intellectual disability and their families. Through this network
default,
default we aim to ensure that all athletes remain engaged wit
defaulth the health system throughout their lives. 
defaultOver the next three years Special Olympic
defaults will be piloting the Healthy C
defaultommunities programme in the following countries: Peru, Mexico, South Africa, Malawi, Romania, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, and within t
defaulthe U.S. in Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas, New York, New Jersey, and Florida.
defaultThe Healthy Communities programme aims to
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRaise awareness around the issue of health disparities facing people with intellectual disability worldwide; 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFoster increased international
default development cooperation focused on delivering care to this marginalized population, and;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUltimately create communities where Special Olympics athletes and others with intellectual disability have the same access to health and wellness resources – and can 
defaultattain the same level of good health – as all community members.
