defaultThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is the national governing body for cricket in England and Wales. 
defaultOur vision is to inspire the nation to choose cricket. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur responsibility is to promote and develop the game at all levels and in recent years we h
defaultave invested a great deal of expertise and resource into modernising our structures to ensure that we can effectively support and develop cricket at all levels of the game, including women’s and girls’ cricket.
default&#xa0;
defaultSixteen years ago the ECB took over responsi
defaultbility from the Women’s Cricket Association as the National Governing Body for women and girls cricket 
defaultIn this time we have made tremendous progress in growing and promoting the women’s and girls’ game at all levels. 
default 
defaultWomen’s and girls’ cricket is more or
defaultganised, better funded and has wider exposure than ever before with more people participating not only as players but in many different roles – including coaching, umpiring and volunteering.
defaultOne of the most significant achievements is that women’s cricket 
defaultis now fully integrated within the ECB, from international level to development programmes
default.  T
defaulthe women’s game sits inside the same structures with the same reporting lines.  It is completely embedded in the or
defaultganisational
default structure and has become an integr
defaultal part of the cricket family within the ECB’s Cricket Partnerships and 
defaultEngland Cricket Departments
default. 
defaultAt present there are two women on ECB’s main Board
default: 
defaultformer Chief Constable Jane Stichbury who is an Independent Director providing strategic support to ou
defaultr anti-corruption unit and Baroness Rachel Heyhoe-Flint
default OBE DL
default, a former high profile England International and Women’s Cricket representative who has championed the women’s game for many years.
defaultAs with the 
defaultmen’s 
defaultgame, the vast majority of our investment i
defaults focused into developing grassroots opportunities, developing player pathways and top-class support structures for elite players. 
default 
defaultThis approach ensures we have a “product” from the elite end to the very grassroots which is compelling, competitive and sus
defaulttainable.
defaultOn the international stage, ECB investment and on-going commitment has seen the England Women’s team secure continued success including lifting the ICC World Cup in Sydney in 2009, retaining their number 
defaultone
default 
defaultworld ranking from 2009 to 2013 and this summer beating Australia to regain the Ashes – and win the inaugural multi-format Women’s Ashes Series (which comprised one Test match, 
defaultthree
default 
defaultNatWest 
defaultODIs and 
defaultthree
default 
defaultNatWest 
defaultT20s). 
defaultAt the grassroots level
default, 
defaultthe last 
defaultten years has seen a 507% increase in the number of cricket clubs with a Women’s and/or a 
defaultg
defaultirl’s section (from 93 to 565). 
default 
defaultWe have had huge success in attracting young girls to the sport and we have exciting plans to retain a greater percentage of them th
defaultrough their teenage years and into adulthood and ultimately, for those with the ability, into a clearly defined and maturing talent pathway.
defaultNot only has ECB made women’s cricket part of its core business so too have the 39 County Cricket Boards (CCBs). 
default 
defaultT
defaulthe CCBs are the game’s local delivery network and with support and investment from both ECB and Sport England in recent years the women’s game is now central to their strategic plans
defaultThere remains a significant challenge to secure wider media coverage and commercial value for 
defaultw
defaultomen’s 
defaultc
defaultricket. 
default 
defaultThe ECB will continue to pioneer new formats and invest directly to achieve these aims, building on the success we have had already in promotion
defaultal activity including “double headers” where 
defaultinternational w
defaultomen’s Twenty20 fixtures are played immediately before the men’s match, 
defaultinvesting 
defaultin broadcasts of non-televised matches on YouTube and creating a new 
defaultpoints based multi-
defaultformat 
defaults
defaulteries 
defaultto widen and
default sustain interest 
defaultthroughout the summer
default.
defaultIn this submission we highlight some of the successes to date, some of the challenges we face and set out how we are committed to ensuring that women’s cricket continues to thrive and provide women and girls with 
defaultoutstanding opportunities.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultChildren should be introduced to physical activity opportunities (physical literacy) at an early age as part of their personal and emotional developme
defaultnt and then in time to competitive sport. It is vital that this development process is driven within the school system. 
default 
defaultWe believe that young girls should be given the same opportunities to play and try sport without any stigma that the sport is only ‘for
default boys’.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur priority is to ensure delivery of as many opportunities as possible for girls to develop a lasting interest in cricket and continue to play the sport for years to come.  
defaultTo deliver this the ECB has invested millions of pounds over the last fe
defaultw years into partnerships with other cricket bodies and the private sector to build programmes that help 
defaultgrow 
defaultcricket in schools, especially state schools
default,
default and make full use of the facilities they offer. 
defaultEach partnership programme offers a fantastic oppor
defaulttunity for girls to participate in cricket from a young age either through offering
default both mixed sessions and/or specific courses for girls. 
default2.1
default              
defaultAsda Kwik Cricket
defaultThe ECB’s flagship grassroots schools initiative is Kwik 
defaultCricket
default,
default in its 8
defaultth
default year of sponsorship
default with Asda
default.
default 
default It provides children at primary school a fun, inclusive, fast-paced introduction to the game of cricket
default 
defaultand offers both mixed sessions along with a programme designed specifically for girls
default. 
defaultThe current competition boasts 
defaultparticipation figures of 140,000 with over 50% of all primary schools entering the competition.
default 
default 
defaultThe girls
default’
default only programme had over 30,000 girls 
defaultplay 
defaultin 2013, a 38% increase from 2012.
defaultThe main aim of the competition is to inspire children to play cricket 
defaultthrough the means of a national competition framework delivered by our 39
default CCBs
default. 
default 
defaultThe 
defaultprogramme provides
default teachers 
defaultwith a range of resources
default

defaultChance to Shine
defaultThe Chance to 
defaultShine
default programme is run by the Cricket Foundation 
defaultcharity and is currently in its 8
defaultth
default year of delivery and is part funded by the ECB.
default 
default It has delivered cricket lessons to over 
defaulttwo
default 
defaultmillion children in 
default7,000
default schools across the UK.
default 
default The aim of the programme is to reintroduce cricket into state schools and use cricket as a tool for the wider developmental issues like behaviour, attainment, team work and life skills 
defaultand
default 
defaultvalues.
defaultChance to
default Shine supports the wider development of girls and cricket by working in partnership with the ECB to place girl’s cricket development at the forefront of every project. 
default 
defaultThere are approximately 160,000 girls playing cricket in school annually through the C
defaulthance to 
defaultShine
default programme
default 
defaultand it will reach the one millionth girl to have gone through the programme during this school term
default. The programme will continue to expand its reach into both Primary and Secondary Schools (with a new focus on 14-16 year olds based
default on Sport England funding) offering more girls the chance to receive high quality coaching and the ECB will be looking to increase the numbers entering the club network on the back of this. 
defaultThe project has partnerships with 1,004 local cricket clubs, and 
defaultqualified cricket coaches provide coaching and competition to local primary and secondary schools.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultOf those children going on to join a local club, 31% of these were girls. 
defaultSeven members of the current England’s Women Cricket Team, including the captain 
defaultCharlotte Edwards
default MBE
default, are employed by the Cricket Foundation as Chance to Shine Coaching Ambassadors and have made an enormous impact as positive role models in schools and clubs.
default&#xa0;
default The Ambassador programme has been running since 2008 and so far 11 England
default Women have worked inside both schools and community programmes. 15,000 school girls were coached by the seven England Women ambassadors last year.

defaultECB have benefitted from a 
defaultten
default 
defaultyear relationship with the Lady Taverners, a funding arm to the Lord
default’
defaults Taverners,
default to promote the participation of teenage girls playing cricket in education and at cricket clubs
default. defaultSince its inception the outcomes of the girls
default’
default only programme has: 
defaultIn 2013, the indoor competition had entries of 1500 teams (a 32% increase on 2012) from the U13 and U15 age groups; whilst the club competition had circa 400 entries from a variety of soft and hard ball formats ranging from U11 to U15. 
default 
defaultThe co
defaultmpetition has engaged with over 110
default,
default000 girls since its introduction in 2003.The competition is administered centrally by ECB but supported locally by 39 CC
defaultBs
default and provides girls with the opportunity to play regular cricket at a local level and progress thr
defaultough to County, Regional and National Finals.

defaultThe National 
defaultschools 
defaultcompetition culminates in a Final held in the indoor school at Lord

defaultFuture School 
defaultSport 
defaultFunding
defaultECB welcomes the additional funding from DfE and support from DCMS into school sport and the commitment that this will be ring-fenced and reviewed by Ofsted. It is vital that the school sports programme, including the national curriculum, underpin school s
defaultport provision. 
default 
defaultThe scale of the school system is far too big for any NGB to cover the entire infrastructure and training that is required. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf we are to tackle the decline in some areas of sport and physical activity and deliver the wider social benefit
defaults sports brings there has to be more focus on this activity at school, particularly for young girls who play less sport than boys. 
default 
defaultWe are aware that 24% of girls aged 2-15 don’t do enough physical exercise yet 74% would do more if the offers to them were 
defaultmore suitable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhatever the positives or the negatives of the previous system, it did provide NGB’s with support and strategic assistance to help us to effectively assist school sport so that our engagement offers greater economies of scale and return on
default investment.
default&#xa0;
defaultOrganisations that can provide specialist coaching and training such as NGBs require support and advice on how to access schools which do not currently run any cricket programmes or training. 
default 
defaultThe Youth Sport Trust has a tremendous network bu
defaultt there are thousands of schools still not being given the chance to draw upon our resources. 
default 
defaultThere needs to be a one stop shop at a county level, such as County Sport Partnerships, to have the necessary resources and expertise to help identify demand and
default where needed help co-ordinate delivery.
default&#xa0;defaultECB’s strategic plan for the development of grassroots cricket is mapped out in our Whole Sport Plan, a partnership arrangement with Sp
defaultort England. The development of 
defaultwomen’s 
defaultcricket is integral to this plan and a key priority for the ECB. Whole Sport Plans have transformed the way Cricket approaches its delivery both nationally and at local level. Stability in the sector is crucial to al
defaultlow sports to deliver the agreed 
defaultp
defaultlans with Sport England to 
defaultachieve 
defaultthe current long-term targets.
default default&#xa0;
defaultOur key focus is on:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWomen’s Club Cricket has seen considerable growth over the last ten years. P

defaultaffiliated clubs had

default and by 
default2012 
defaultthis had increased to 
default565:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOur ambition is to ensure the game maintains this level of growth and as such we are in the process of putting together a new strategy which will see the women’s cricket 
defaultembedded
default across our C
defaultCB 
defaultnetwork to sustain and grow our network of clubs and increase the level of participation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEach of our 39 County Cricket Boards now 
defaulthas a
default 
defaultperformance pathway in place that provide
defaults
default opportunities for girls and women to compete in county cricket.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012 t
defaulthe ECB also introduced a new women’s club competition structure in which the pinnacle of club cricket was expanded to increase the number of top level clubs, and other leagues link to the linear structure. Counties are now investing in running and developi
defaultng their own junior and senior leagues to meet demand. Leagues are run throughout the week or at weekends
default.  
default3.1
default              
defaultCoaches
default 
defaultThe number of female coaches has grown from 556 in 2003 to 2,756 in 2013.
defaultEight CCBs are involved in project 500,
default a County Sport Partnership / UK Sport project which is working with 5 NGB’s to develop programmes and opportunities for female coaches in their sports. The ECB will develop this programme nationally and roll it across our CCB network.

default              
defaultOfficials
default 
defaultAs part of our integrated approach the ECB is committed to offering opportunities
default to women
default across a
defaultll sections of the game including offering and providing training to 
defaultthose 
defaultwho want to become umpires and scorers
default within a membership arm called the ECB ACO (Association of Cricket Officials). 
defaultSeveral counties have begun to provide female only courses in support of the growth of female umpires. 
default 
defaultFurther steps have been taken to source female official role models from the success of the England Women’s teams. 
default 
default 
defaultActive promotion of female official
defaults is one of the main priorities for the ECB ACO and recent work has been undertaken to identify and remove the key barriers to females following the officials’ pathway through to all levels of the game. 
defaultFemale umpires are becoming more prominent
default – within 
defaultthe last few years female umpires have been appointed to umpire both Minor Counties and County Second Eleven cricket and further examples exist in Premier 
defaultLeagues
default. 
defaultLate in 2012 ECB ACO launched a national initiative to develop and engage more females in u
defaultmpiring.  Having established a robust pathway for all umpires to follow, it is now open to all umpires of the appropriate ability, irrespective of gender and race, to attain appointments at all levels of the game. 
default 
defaultThis includes developing Umpires at the v
defaultery highest level of the game and ECB is about to launch an inclusive scheme to provide top level female umpires with opportunities to demonstrate their umpiring ability and to progress towards involvement in the professional game.
defaultThere are currently fema
defaultle scorers involved at all levels of the game (including international level)
default, and the intention is to mirror this in the umpiring arena
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCase Study – defaultfemale umpires in the defaultNorthumberland Cricket League defaultIn 2011 
defaultOfficials Gillian Woodley and Sarah Lee have
default become the first two women to take charge of a match in one of the North’s top leagues
default.
default Gillian is a fully qualified umpire having attained her Level Two 
defaultqualification 
defaultlast year. Sarah previously scored for Blyth Second XI and this is her second season um
defaultpiring, after passing her Level One from the English Cricket Board’s Association of Cricket Officials.
defaultGillian, from Gosforth, Newcastle, said: “I admit I once hated the sport but I was becoming a cricket widow because my husband loves it. I had to grow to
default like it just to see him at weekends. 
default 
default 
defaultI started as a scorer and got hooked so I decided to get my qualifications at the same time as Peter. It’s a fascinating sport and I love it now. I think I’ve gained respect from the men players.
default 
default It was difficult at first when I did my first matches four years ago because I think some men found it hard to accept decisions from a woman. 
default 
defaultBut I think now I’ve shown I can do it and it’s something I very much enjoy.
default 
default It would be lovely to see more wom
defaulten doing it. There’s a great team spirit among the umpires, but it’s always nice to see a few women walking out there.”
defaultSarah, from Blyth, Northumberland, is studying A-levels at Newcastle College but spends her weekends 
defaultat cricket matches
default across the county.
default  
defaultShe first attended a cricket match aged just three months with her dad, a keen player.
default(Case study used from the local paper – the Chronicle live) 
default3.3
default              
defaultCapital Investment into Facilities
defaultThrough the last Sport England funding period the ECB have targeted women’s and girls’ participation through capital investment – identifying where access to facilities are barriers and require investment to increase participation. Over the 4 year period t
defaulthe ECB invested £5.4m to specifically support women and girls cricket. This totalled 57 awards across approximately 26 projects with the majority of these going to our recreational clubs. Supporting this capital investment, first class counties and clubs e
defaultnsured revenue funding was aligned to support growth in women’s cricket. 
defaultInitial statistics have seen increases in participation across the awards with a 72% increase amongst 5 – 15 year olds and 40% increase in participation of 16 – 24 year olds. 
defaultIn add
defaultition to this targeted funding, other revenue and capital investment is made available to support club programmes and the wider network to support women and girls cricket and clubs within England and Wales.
default3.4
default              
defaultProtection of Local Authority and School pitc
defaulthes
defaultIn order for Women and Girls’ participation to continue to grow they must have access to decent local facilities and pitches. 
default 
defaultOver 40% of cricket is played on local authority pitches and Central Government must make sure that local leisure provision i
defaults a key 
defaultcriterion 
defaultby which local authorities are held to account for their spending by the Department for Communities and Local Government. 
default 
defaultAs sport is not a statutory service it too often a soft option for cuts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultECB welcomed the enhanced protections ou
defaulttlined in the Government’s National Planning Policy framework but remains very concerned at the on-going threat to the infrastructure of pitches and facilities available to sports within the local authority framework which is under extreme budgetary pressu
defaultres. 
default 
defaultPlaying fields are also under threat from developers on certain sites such as Civil Service grounds.
default&#xa0;
defaultGreater effort needs to go into provision of pitches and facilities. 
default 
defaultWhether these are maintained by local authorities, volunteer groups or cricket
default clubs on-going support needs to be given to addressing the poor state of pitches and increasing quality standards.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecently all of the major pitch sports have jointly with Sport England, revised the planning model for local authority playing pitch strate
defaultgies.
default 
default Through this model all pitch sports have committed to collaborating and working with Local Authorities on the strategic provision of sport. 
default 
defaultSupply, demand, disposal and quality are all measured through this process.
default4.default              defaultInternational and Elite programme development and facilities  defaultFor many years there were envious glances from all UK NGBs to the facilities and research centres and programmes in other countries. Cricket was no
default&#xa0;
defaultdifferent. 
default 
defaultCricket Australia's centre of exc
defaultellence was always seen as the benchmark in this regard. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, in 2003 the National Cricket Performance
default&#xa0;
defaultCentre at
default 
defaultLoughborough
default&#xa0;
defaultUniversity was
default&#xa0;
defaultopened
default&#xa0;
defaultby Her Majesty 
defaultThe
default Queen,
default&#xa0;
defaultand has
default&#xa0;
defaultnow established itself as the leading cricket centre in the world. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe centre employs
default&#xa0;
default25 full time staff
default&#xa0;
defaultand delivers world class programmes in terms of cricket and areas such as science and medicine and provides the game in England and Wales with leading edge research.
default 
default The coaching courses created and the science and m
defaultedicine innovations
default&#xa0;
defaultpermeate throughout the game and the centre itself is used by a wide range of teams from grassroots school levels to the England elite squads.
default&#xa0;
default 
default 
defaultIndeed the Elite Coach development Programme is recognised as the foremost cricket coach ed
defaultucation programme in the world.  It has also provided an elite coaching benchmark which other UK sports have sought to follow by seeking advice directly from the ECB.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll England Women’s Cricket Pathway programmes (players and staff) benefit from this wor
defaultld-leading resource: from the England Women’s Development Programme U15 through to the full England Women’s Programme.  All winter training camps ate staged at the National Cricket Performance Centre with matches also staged at Loughborough during the seas
defaulton.
default&#xa0;
defaultEach County Cricket Board delivers an 
defaultEmerging Players Programme (EPP) to support players who 
defaultC
defaultounties believe have talent and potential at ages 13 – 16 in preparation for potential future academy programmes and elite England programmes. There are 
defaultcurrently over 150 girls in EPP programmes across the country, and
default 
defaultsome counties now run specific EPP programmes for their talented females. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst Class County Academies are completely supportive with more 
defaultA
defaultcademies now offering places to females who are
default identified as talented through ECB’s England Women’s Development Programme (EWDP) –many of the current England team and 
defaultEngland Women’s A

default has secured unprecedented success on the international stage in recent years culminating in being ranked the world number one 
defaultODI 
defaultteam from 2009 to 2013 and regaining the Ashes 
defaultwith a resounding victory against Australia, the new world champions, in August 2013.
defaultThis success comes as a result of the full integration of elite women’s cricket into the England Cricket Department at ECB. This integration has yielded more of the suppo
defaultrt services needed to 
defaultperform at a world class level – specialist coaching, medical screening, bespoke strength and conditioning programmes and access to the very best facilities.
defaultThe England 
defaultWomen’s 
defaultsquad players are now semi-professional and benefit from
default membership of the PCA – the Professional Cricketers’ Association. 
defaultThe England Women’s team play their internationals at some of the finest grounds in the country.
default&#xa0;
default The 2013 Ashes matches were played in all corners of the country including Lord’s Cricket 
defaultGround, Ageas Bowl (Southampton), ICG Emirates Durham, Chelmsford, and Hove.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst the majority of women’s internationals are staged at First Class County grounds, ECB also takes international women’s cricket to out-grounds and to festivals such as Tru
defaultro CC (Cornish Festival of Cricket 2012) and Louth CC, Lincolnshire (SO Festival 2013).

defaultECB has set itself the target of developing the world’s best players to win the ICC World Twenty20 in 2014, 2016 and 2018 and the ICC Women’s World Cup in England in 2017.  One of our key ambitions is to for the England Women’s 
defaultAcademy to develop an effective supply of players capable of performing for England from 2014 and at world’s best level from 2018.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe England Women’s Development Programme U19 is designed to develop an effective supply of players to the England Women’s 
defaultAcademy from 2014 capable of performing for England from 2017 and at world’s best level from 2021. Both the England Women’s Development Programmes at U19 and U15 level and the inaugural England Women’s U19 overseas tour (South Africa) is to become an annua
defaultl event.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnderpinning this development the ECB in partnership with Sport England invest into the further development of a robust Talent ID system to detect the country’s highest potential players from within Counties.  There is a mentoring Programme imple

defaultOne of the most challenging areas in trying to develop and grow wo

defaultcommercial success.
defaultThere is still a long way to go and the reality is that women’s cricket is still subsidised from revenues generated by the men’s international game a
defaultnd requires cross promotional support and subsidy in the commercial field and targeted public sector investment. ECB’s commercial strategy is to centralise all England team sponsorships – meaning all England teams (Men, Women, Lions, development sides,

default) share the same Team Sponsor. 
default 
defaultFrom 2014
default,
default 
defaultWaitrose 
defaultwill be the 
defaultmain 
defaultTeam Sponsor 
defaultwith kit provided by adidas.  From a perception point of view it is important for the women’s team to have an association with 
defaultthese
default 
defaultpremium
default, well-known brands as it
default helps reiterate and promote the professionalism of the game.
defaultHowever, whilst our current view is that the teams should share the Team Sponsor, the ECB will longer-term continue to explore additional standalone commercial deals for the women’s team – and h
defaultas employed a new business manager devoted specifically to targeting these opportunities. 
defaultThis summer, the ECB secured its first “stand
default-
defaultalone” sponsorship for the Women’s team - Kia Motors came on board for the Women’s Ashes Series providing the team with
default cars for the duration of the Series.
default 
default Whilst the deal did not have any significant financial benefit for the team nor organisation, it shows that there is an appetite from brands to be associated with successful women’s sports teams –albeit on a much smal
defaultler scale.
default 
default For comparison, Jaguar – the men’s team car supplier – provides cars in addition to £300k in sponsorship monies.
defaultEngland Women tend to play a mixture of One Day Internationals (ODIs; 50 overs) and Twenty20 matches (it is only in the Women’s Ash
defaultes Series where they 
defaultalso 
defaultcompete in one four-day Test match). In previous years, these formats have been sponsored by NatWest – as they also sponsored the men’s ODIs and T20s. 
default 
defaultFrom 2014, NatWest will become the title sponsor of all T20 cricket (men’s, wo
defaultmen’s and grassroots). The ECB is currently sourcing a new sponsor for the ODI format, who we envisage will become the game-wide sponsor of the one-day format, including Women’s ODIs.
defaultWe are also optimistic that the ICC Women’s Committee will create a bi-l
defaultateral programme amongst the top 8 teams over the next 3 years to 
defaultenable us to market international women's cricket with a longer lead time and therefore give the ECB Commercial team more to work with and much stronger assets to sell.

default 
defaultFor comparison in 
defaultthe cricket world, Cricket Australia

default a similar strategy by ‘bolting-on’ women’s sponsorships onto the men’s team packages. CA 
defaulthave
default not been able to secure any stand-alone sponsorships for the women’s team. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe one major difference between ECB and C
defaultA is their choice of branding and communications strategy for the Women’s team - the Australia Women’s team is branded as the ‘Southern Stars’ and have their own social media channels. 
default 
defaultFor reference, Southern Stars twitter feed has 8,700 followers compare
defaultd to the CA’s overall following of 223,200. 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultWhilst the ECB is exploring separating its digital media channels for each team or competition, our current view is that sending women’s messages to our entire database (circa 1.5m across all channels) does mor
defaulte to boost the profile of women’s cricket/ the England team, than sending to a smaller, targeted audience as CA choose to do.  Both approaches have their merits and we keep this area under close review in order maximise our reach.
defaultThe profile of women’s cr
defaulticket will only grow through sustained, mass media interest leading to increased spectator following and commercial income.
default 
defaultSecuring mass
default media coverage 
defaultremains a challenge
default, but t
defaulthe ECB notes and welcome
defaults
default the further progress made by broadcasters and the media since the London Olympics. Sky’s viewing figures of the recent Women’s Ashes were the 
defaultbest ever for international women’s cricket in this country and Sky described 2013 as “a breakthrough summer for 
defaultwomen’s cricket”.
defaultThe ECB itself 
defaultcontinues to heavily invest in marketing activity to help profile the Women’s team and fixtures
default as highlighted in case study 5.
defaultThe ECB provides rights-free imagery to media for every match (through Getty), and after every 
defaultday’s play and training session - a player is put up for media interviews. If media cannot attend these sessions, ECB records interviews and sends to them via our Audioboo site.
default 
default In addition, video highlights of every women’s international – regardless of 
defaultwhether it’s televised or not – are posted on the ECB’s digital platforms.
defaultIn addition to this ‘business as usual’ activity, ECB arranged 4 ‘life-style’ photo-shoots to present the team in a different light – one as part of a promotional shoot for suit mak
defaulter TM Lewin, one taken at Wormsley Cricket Ground (before the Women’s Ashes Test), one at Brighton sea-front (before the NatWest ODI at Hove), and another beneath the Angel of the North – with the Women’s Ashes Series trophy in shot.
defaultDuring ECB promotional
default activity for the grassroots game – a women’s player is always offered up to media alongside a men’s player. For example, in April 2013 Charlotte Edwards joined Alastair Cook at Harrow Town CC to promote NatWest CricketForce – a nationwide initiative where
default 2,000 clubs hold an event to prepare their ground for the season ahead.

defaultMedia partnerships
defaultThe ECB’s two major broadcast partners – Sky Sports and BBC Radio – are committed supporters of the women’s game, and their increased coverage reflects the increasing interest in women’s cricket. 
defaultSky Sports began broadcasting women’s cricket seventeen yea
defaultrs ago (June 1996 v New Zealand), and aired 
defaultfour
default of the 
defaultseven
default Women’s Ashes Series matches live this summer.  Sky have aired
default the majority
default 
defaultof England women’s home T20 matches live during the past 5 years, including the team winning the ICC Women’s World Cup
default and World Twenty20 in 2009. Sky routinely undertake player interviews and broadcast promotional events on Sky Sports News and Cricket AM, as well as background pieces featuring key players during the intervals of men’s internationals. 
defaultBBC Radio covered t
defaulthe first ever England Women’s T20 match at Hove in 2004, and have reported on every 
defaultWomen’s
default World Cup.
default 
default 
defaultEarlier this year, for the first time they broadcast all of England’s games in a World Cup – as well as sending a network TV crew and a reporter for BBC
default 
defaultOnline
default to India the 
defaulthost country
default.
default  BBC Radio also covered the Women’s Ashes in 2005 and 2009, and this summer carried ball-by-ball commentary on all 
defaultseven
default Women’s Ashes Series matches.
defaultOn a smaller scale, The Times is the ECB’s Official Newspaper partner, and the ECB promoted the Women’s Ashes Series with a ticket promotion in-paper and online a few months prior to the matches – giving away 100 tickets for 
defaultthree
default games, helping to raise a
defaultwareness of the Ashes Series. 
defaultNational newspapers continue to support the women’s game, but like other sports no doubt share our frustration, space given is minimal. Coverage for Women’s cricket peaks during Ashes matches and World Cups. 
defaultThe Women’s Ashe
defaults Series format was announced on 13 May, and since then 11 matches have been played (
defaultfour
default against 
defaultPakistan,
default and 
defaultseven
default against Australia). These matches generated 86 items of national print coverage – reaching a total audience of 44.1 million.
defaultThe 
defaultECB looks
default toward Government to place greater focus on public service broadcasters to cover women and girls sport within their schedules, including magazine and coaching programmes, as part of their broadcast licence arrangements
default. Additional pressure on Sports Edito
defaultrs would also be welcomed.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe ECB approach, as documented in 
defaultthis submission, is to create a fully accessible sport at every level of the game to ensure that we continue to grow the sport and make the right interventions to remove as many of the barriers to playing as possible.
defaultThere are many well documented reasons
default for a drop out in sport - physical, environmental and social factors all can play their part to greater or lesser extent and the ECB is keen to understand 
defaultmore and to make sure our programmes adapt and meet the needs and requirements of those women and gi
defaultrls wanting to participate in the sport. In reality it is the same barriers that prevent women playing as men. 
defaultOne of the key interventions a National Governing Body (NGB), such as the ECB, can make is to promote physical literacy at an early age, as part
default of a young person’s personal and emotional development and then in time provide the right opportunities to play competitively. It can provide teachers with the necessary training and coaching support to help young people begin to develop a habit for life.
default In our view it is vital that this development process is driven within the school system, to allow sports such as cricket to create a development journey from childhood to adulthood with different opportunities to play to meet the demand.
defaultAs outlined, the
default ECB through its partnerships has well established programmes at primary school level such 
defaultAsda 
defaultKwik Cricket which has a huge reach offering both mixed and programmes focused specifically on girls. 
defaultSince receiving a major National Lottery investment from S
defaultport England in April 2013
default, t
defaulthe Cricket Foundation is also embarking on a change in the way they work and a shift in priority to secondary schools.
default 
default 
defaultThrough Chance to 
defaultShine
default, they have 
defaultbegun creating strong links between community sports clubs and schools w
defaultith the help of County Cricket Board. Local cricket clubs are enabled to work closely with coaches, young people and teachers to set up a satellite cricket club on school sites; making it easier for young people to make the transition to clubs in the commu
defaultnity. 
defaultIt
default has already recently reached the milestone of its 500th school-based or ‘satellite’ cricket club.  
defaultPupils are at the heart of the decision-making and influence how their school club is run. 
default 
defaultActivity at the clubs range from extra-curricular coaching and forums to discussions on club activity, organising social events and ambassador visits.
default 
default 
defaultThe aim of the scheme is two-fold: first, to help reduce the number of children leaving the game when th
defaultey move from primary to secondary school and, second, to contribute to a lower drop-off rate in sport among teenagers, especially in the 14 to 16 year age group. 
default 
defaultOver the next three years Chance to 
defaultShine
default will look to work with 1250 secondary schools to es
defaulttablish Satellite Clubs to improve the transition from school to community cricket.
defaultTo gain a greater understanding 
defaultof participation 
defaultacross all ages, the ECB 
defaulthas recently commissioned a significant research project called Eureka! 
defaultthat
default seeks to give specifi
defaultc insight from current, lapsed and non-players. 
default 
defaultThis will be used nationally and locally to better inform planning and programme design for women and girls. Early indications suggest that young people will continue to play more 
defaultcricket 
defaultwith better signpos
defaultting of opportunities at local clubs and teams with proactive contact in schools to establish these links. 
default 
defaultThis places more focus on expanding our school club links going forward.
defaultThere is significant potential to grow even further the game for women over
default the age of 14 and will be looking to provide a different range of options based on this insight and in both cricket clubs and a range of different environments. 
default&#xa0;
defaultECB has also recently established a dedicated programme to work with further and higher educ
defaultation institutions to ensure that the drop off rate after leaving school is reduced and is working in partnership to deliver new programmes such as Last Man Stands.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultSince taking over the Women’s game, the ECB
default,
default along with its key partners
default,
default has transform
defaulted
default women’s and girls
default’
default cricket at every level of the game. 
default 
defaultWomen’s cricket is now fully integrated within 
defaultour
default structures from international level to our development programmes, and has become an integral part of the cricket family within the 
defaultECB’s Cricket Partnerships and
default England Cricket Department
default.
defaultThe international team has access to the best facilities and we promote their outstanding success through every means possible.
default 
default 
defaultThere has been a huge level of investment into the development of th
defaulte women’s game that has helped rebuild cricket in schools, grow a thriving community club network and to ensure we continue to develop the pathway to elite success. 
defaultWe cannot be complacent as there are many challenges facing us as we continue to grow and 
defaultdevelop the game and we are continually exploring new ways 
defaultgetting
default more people 
defaultto

defaultcricket and mak

default,

defaultOn a wider level the Government has its part to pla
