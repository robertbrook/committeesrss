"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n1.1 The links\n between disability, poverty, and exclusion are irrefutable. \nPeople\n with disabilities form a significant proportion of those most affected by \nemergencies\n.  As such, disability inclusion \nmust be addressed as a core\n issue.  Inclusive programming \nhas been shown to be achievable through\n active participation by \npeople\n with disabilit\nies\n in all aspects of development and \nthrough \nthe provision of specific inputs that empower and provide opportunities for \npeople\n with disabilities.  \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nSince 1982, Handicap International has sought to \nmainstream disability, with the support of specialist services, rather than build hermetically separate approaches. Nevertheless, actions specifically targeting people with disabilities \nremain essential to reach inclusion objectives.\n  A\ns one of the only NGOs with a dual focus on humanitarian and development actions and inclusion of people with disabilities in such settings, Handicap International seeks to highlight the importance of inclusion in all aspects of humanitarian work \n(particularly\n access to relief services and specific programming)\n and \nin longer\n \nterm development work such as education, supporting the reduction of armed violence, and improving equitable access to health services, including rehabilitation. \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nA cross-cutting theme through all these areas is value for money (\nVfM\n). The contribution of \nVfM\n analysis and monitoring in development and humanitarian practice is appreciable. However, there is a risk \nthat\n negative effects on disability and inclusive programming can arise if the \nVfM\n approach relies too heavily on economic considerations \n(\nleading to narrow, reductive view\ns\n of programme efficacy) at the price of attention on equity, impartiality\n,\n and \nother\n \nqualitative measures.\n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nHandicap International recognises and commends the positive steps \nDFID has t\naken to improve disability inclusion in its policies and work. \n \nHowever, our experience demonstrates that further steps \nare necessary before this\n become systematic. For example, while DFID’s Rwanda education approach (where one pillar focuse\ns\n on inclusive education) is an excellent example of DFID’s commitment to disability inclusion, the opposite is true in countries like DRC where the DFID country team admitted \noverlooking\n disability when developing its health strategy.\n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nIn ratifying the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)\n, the \nUK committed to \nensuring that UK aid is inclusive of and accessible to people with disabilities, but\n there is still much to be done before programming e\nqually benefits all people\n.  The development of policy and programming \ninvolving people\n with disability is vital to a participatory and proactive model of inclusion.  \nAs such \nHandicap International calls on DFID to implement a strategic approach to disability inclusion\n through:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA Disability Theory of Change\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n central and country level \nDisa\nbility Results Fr\namework \nof accountability\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTools for inclusive funding mech\nanisms  \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImproved d\nata disaggregation \n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPartic\nipation of \npeople\n with disabilities at all stages of programming.\n&#xa0;\n2. Humanitarian Response \n \n \n&#xa0;\n2.1 With \napproximately \n80% of the world’s disabled population living in developing countries\n, \nHandicap International calls for \nan inclusive approach to emergency response and development initiatives in line with international obligations.  \nThe exclusion of people with disabilities from humanitarian assistance is a fundamental breach of the principle of impartiality and a violation of human rights.  \nIn emergencies, people with disabilities face additional barriers and vulnerabilities linked with their condition and the disruption of their environm\nent which pu\nt\n them at increased\n risk. \nThe \nCRPD\n outlines that States Parties, including the UK as a 2009 signatory, are obliged to \ntake all appropriate \nadditional measures to secure the safety of persons with disabilities\n (Article 11)\n \n.  \n&#xa0;\n2\n.2 People with disabilities and older people are disproportionately affected by disasters, yet \nless than\n \n1% of international humanitarian aid is dedicated to people with disabilities.  \nA\n 2011 study of submissions to the Consolidated Appeals Process found that only 1.6% of projects included targeted activities for people with disability and\n only\n 0.7% were funded\n. \nData from the current Syrian crisis highlights that approximately 18% of refugees in Jordan and Lebanon live with at least one impairment, be it physical, visual, auditory, or intellectual\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nDisaggregated data on people with disability, injury, and chronic illness are insufficiently gathered and shared to inform response.  DFID has identified \nHandicap International, with \nHelpAge\n, as the\n \ninclusion focal point\n among Rapid Response Facility partners for the Philippines response.  This is a welcome step, but to effect real change this focus by DFID on inclusion must be systematically applied in all crisis contexts and with all implementing partners to avoid substantive information gaps and programming exclusion.\n&#xa0;\n2.4 I\nn emergenc\nies\n, \npeople with disabilities (and other vulnerable groups) are rarely consulted about their needs\n and \nface significant difficulties accessing humanitarian goods and services.  When they do, \ngoods and services are often inappropriate.  \n \n&#xa0;\n2.5 \nA recent global study shows that only\n 20% of \npeople\n with disability could evacuate immediately \nand \nwithout difficulty \nduring\n a sudden disaster, the remainder only with a degree of difficulty\n;\n 6% would \nbe\n \nun\nable to do so at all.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, with\n sufficient time, preparation,\n and warning, those able to evacuate without difficulty rises from 20 to 38%\n, underscoring the importance of \ndeveloping and implementing inclusive early warning systems that can reach all people through adapted messages and communication tools.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n6\n \nOlder women and women and girls with disabilities experience heightened risk of sexual, physical, and domestic violence, especially during emergencies and conflict.  As DFID takes forward its\n’\n Call to Action, all approaches to \ncombat\nting\n violence against women and girls must include these groups \nand specific protection programming \nbe established \nto address this issue.\n  \n \n&#xa0;\n2.7 DFID has taken\n multiple\n steps to improve its\n inclusive approach, including s\npecific\nally\n mention\ning\n older and disabled people as vulnerable groups in their humanitarian policy\n. \nHowever, the single mention of disability in this policy highlights the need to build \nD\nFID’s commitment to targeting the most vulnerable.  \nAppreciating that disasters affect different people differently, \nunderstanding the dynamic nature of risk is key to planning and implementing inclusive and effective humanitarian response and development programming.  DFID’s challenge \nto \nmake inclusion systematic\n \ncan be facilitated by\n:\n developing specific\n inclusion\n indicators for measuring project success\n;\n requiring partners to include\n action points that target people with specific needs in their operations\n;\n and disaggregating data by age and disability.\n&#xa0;\n2.8 \nRecommendations \nto\n DFID’s humanitarian team to improve \ndisability \ninclusion into a consoli\ndated and structured approach are:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRequire that all\n \nDFID \nproposals include specific consideration for the inclusion of people with disabilities \nand ensure that funded \nemergency \nresponses meet the basic and specific \nneeds of \npeople\n with disabilities, older people\n,\n and \npeople\n with injuries.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRequire\n DFID implementing partners to d\nisaggregate data by disability.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure that all assessment, monitoring, and response activities are inclusive.  \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure responses are informed by evidence which includes input from \npeople\n with disabilities.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclude \npeople\n with disabilities (and other vulnerable groups) proactively in the development of disaster resilient communities through emergency and disaster risk reduction programming. \nConsult\n and involve people with disabilities in the development of all DFID supported disaster risk reduction programming.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPromote \na \nVfM\n approach that focuses on equity and inclusion \nand encourage \nstakeholders to develop innovative, contextually adapted, and multi-scaled operations that cover the needs of \nall\n disaster affected \npeople\n.\n&#xa0;\n3. Armed Violence Reduction \n  \n3.1 \nArmed violence threatens people’s safety and security, undermines poverty reduction, development, social cohesion, human rights efforts, and \nresults in over 16 million injuries requiring medical attention each year\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 Globally, \ntwo million people live with firearm injuries sustained in non-conflict settings over the past decade. Research indicates that \n80% of victims consulted developed a severe disability as a result of their injury and need long term medical and social care\n.\n Their injuries generate considerable direct and indirect costs, including those incurred through treatment, recovery, and lost productivity.  \nMany injuries negative\nly\n impact\n \nhouseholds, disrupting social\n relations\n and creating \nsevere gender inequalities\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nAn estimated \n740,000\n people die every year from armed violence\n. \nArmed violence is one of the top ten causes of death in over 40 countries and the fourth leading cause of death\n for people aged\n 15-\n44 globally.\n For every person who dies, thousands more are injured.  \nOnly by integrating armed violence reduction into development \nactivit\nies in a multi-sector process involving multiple \nand diverse actors can stakeholders address the combined local, national, \nand \nregional\n \nfactors which drive armed violence\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n Women and girls with disabilities are twice as likely to experience gender based violence \nas\n non-disabled peers\n.  In settings where arms are readily available, \nrisks to women and children increase  with weapons used to \nboth threaten and implement violence\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n5\n \nIn 2011, over 4,000 people were killed or injured by landmines \nand\n \nexplosive remnants of war\n.\n \nVictim assistance is an essential component of all mine action programming.  Meeting\n survivors’ needs demands a holistic approach that addresses social, economic, livelihoods, and health and rehabilitation services, access to which\n improves the quality of life of victims and their inclusion in \nsociety.  \nWhilst DFID’s newly-published Mine Action Strategy has taken a complete view on the ‘five pillars’ of Mine Action, it has direct\ned\n responsibility for responding to victim assistance outside the immediate remit of its own Mine Action\n response, making\n it incumbent on DFID country programmes\n \nto ensure that provision is made for victim assistance support.\n Handicap \nInternational’s own experience of mine action programming across all five pillars demonstrates that a mine action programme \nis only\n successful when victim assistance is fully integrated.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n6\n \nHandicap International \nrecommends \nthat DFID\n:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncrease \nevidence on the impact of armed violence by gathering disaggregated data on the \nmagnitude, scope, and characteristics of armed violence to inform policy and practice\n. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuild capacity to implement National Injury Surveillance Systems. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntegrate victim assistance into broader human rights, disability, and development frameworks beyond health and rehabilitation interventions.  \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExamine how victim assistance can be effectively supported beyond mine clearance\n \ncompletion. DFID’s support to mine action will fall short of \nachieving \nits \nVfM\n potential if clearance and mine risk education does not connect to victim assistance efforts.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRatify the UK Arms Trade Treaty\n.  \n Support States\n to consider the risk of arms diversion and assess \nhow\n export of conventional arms, ammunition, or components \ncould \nundermine peace and security or be used in facilitating serious violations of international human rights.  \n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\neduce and prevent the risks, impact, and incidence of armed violence by \npromoting comprehensive responses to the issues of Community Safety and Security and Small Arms and Light Weapons Control and \nimproving services that provide immediate and longer-term health, psychological\n, social, and economic support to include direct and indirect victims \nof armed violence.\n4. Rehabilitation and access t\no \nHealth across humanitarian and long-term programming\n&#xa0;\n4.\n1\n People with disabilities are more likely to have health needs, but are less likely to access health services and have these needs met.  They are twice as likely to \nfind health care providers’ skills and facilities inadequate, thrice as likely to be denied health care, and four times more likely to be \ntreated badly in the healthcare system\n.  \nAchievements in health\n mean that \npeople are living longer\n, but \nlack of equitable access to a full continuity of care\n means that people of all ages experience \npreventable disabilities. \nHealth services must better address accessibility, affordability, inclusiveness, appropriateness, and quality for \npeople\n with disabilities.  \n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nInclusivity in health initiatives and programmes aiming to reach the most marginalised and vulnerable populations cannot be achieved without meeting the needs of people with disabilities.&#xa0;\n4.\n3\n More \ndisaggregated \ninformation is needed about the health and health access of \npeople\n with disabilities (and injuries and chronic illnesses) to ensure solutions to implement \nuniversal access to health and rehabilitation for people with disabilities \nare\n cost-effective.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n4\n \nIn many low-income and middle-income countries, \nonly \n5%–15% of people who require assistive devices/technologies receive them.\n \nHealth services\n such as \nrehabilitation therapies\n are perceived as a luxury and are \nwoefully limited.  \nEnsuring full continuity of care, including \naccess to\n appropriate rehabilitation services, for \npeople\n with disabilities and \npeople\n experiencing new impairments due to illness or injury is critical.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n5\n Costs of health services exacerbate the poverty level for people with a disability.  Health services and systems should increase involvement of\n people\n with disabilities in the development, implementat\nion, and evaluation of services to ensure their accessibility and viability for populations at risk.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n6\n \nRehabilitation services must be an integral part of health services, especially in humanitarian response and development.  DFID \nis supporting\n H\nandicap \nI\nnternational\n to develop the rehabilitation \nco\nmponent of the UK International Emergency Trauma Register enabling deployment of medical professions in \ndisasters\n such as the Philippines typhoon.  DFID’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation professionals in trauma response, and as an integral part of the health service package, is lauded both for universal access and to improve holistic humanitarian response in major disasters.\n \nRehabilitation services are key to avoid\ning\n permanent impairments for \npeople\n with injuries.\n In long\ner\n-term global health and development initiatives, however, the focus on reduction in mortality (aligned to current MDGs) has meant that rehabilitation services have been largely overlooked. \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n \nSurvival needs to be redefined to go beyond the process of preventing death to preventing impairment and promoting meaningful \nlives.  Advances in global \nhealth, highlighted in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease reported and published in the Lancet, have cr\neated new challenges of chronic diseases, longer life expectancy, and increasing rates of disability.  Health partners have a duty to respond to and address these emerging trends multi-dimensionally through prevention, rehabilitation, and treatment\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.8\n \nRecommendations \nfor inclusive health provision \ninclude: \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrioritise universal access to health \nservices, including for people with disabilities.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRequire DFID funded global health interventions\n to \ninclude targets which better address morbidities and disability within the health sector\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFund health research that examines rehabilitation services and barriers faced by people with disabilities, injury, and chronic illness when accessing health services, \nand\n strategies which overcome such barriers. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupport DFID health and disability partners to achieve \nuniversal health coverage \nin humanitarian and development programming\n, \nthus ensuring the right to health as \nper\n the CRPD.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure that all DFID funded health programs consider the need for integration of immediate and \nlong-\nterm rehabilitation\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdvocate for \nand lead \nglobal development agencies and donors to include programming to ensure the needs \nof\n \npeople\n with disabilities within health are met.\n \n&#xa0;\n5. Education\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\n5.1 \nThe MDG of achieving universal primary education by 2015 is \nnot on track\n, according to UNESCO\n: 57 million primary aged children are still out of school. \nOf these, \none third are children with disabilities\n, and an\n estimated \n90% of children living with a disability in low and middle income countries do not attend school.\n  Of those who are in school, an esti\nmated 250 million children are \nfailing to learn\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nInclusive education is both a right in itself and the means for realising the civil, political, and economic rights of all children (as stipulated in the CRPD)\n.\n \n It \nis the central means for achieving the goals of \nEducation for All\n, \nfulfilling the \nsecond and third 2015 M\nDG\ns\n and is mentioned explicitly in goal 3 of the proposed sustainable development goals post-2015\n. By\n promoting a child-centred approach to teaching and supporting the rights of \nall \nlearners to access and benefit from \nformal \nand \nnon-formal \neducation, \nEducation for All \npromote\ns education that is inclusive, child\n-\nfriendly\n,\n and gender sensitive\n.  \n   \n&#xa0;\n5.\n3\n \nPrioritising inclusive education should not be thought of in terms of an additional cost burden. \nT\nhe cost of failing to invest in the education of children with disabilities has been estimated to be much greater than the estimated cost of implementing inclusive education\n. By one estimate, US$135–192 billion is lost from the GDP of low-income countries per annum as a result of disabled people’s exclusion from employment\n. The World Bank concluded that educating children with disabilities reduces welfare costs and increases potential productivity and wealth creation\n,\n in turn helping to alleviate poverty\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n4\n \nDFID’s September announcement by Parliamentary Undersecretary of State Lynne Featherstone that \nall school construction DFID supports is designed to allow disability access \nis a welcome step.  However, this must be followed by a comprehensive inclusive education approach\n.  Reproducing \nDFID’s Rwanda country programme focus on inclusive education would be an excellent first step. Handicap International is committed to partnering with \nDFID to define clear targets and accountability measures to ensure the effective implementation of future commitments to inclusive education, such as ensuring DFID-supported teacher-training \nincorporates inclusive teaching methods \nrespecting the diversity of learners\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n5\n With the 2014 Global Campaign for Education theme being \nDisability and Inclusion\n, this is an ideal time for DFID to increase its efforts\n on Inclusive Education. \nRecommendations include:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloping a strategic approach to equity and inclusion of children with disabilities and a coherent policy towards inclusive education (including accessible school design, child friendly environments\n,\n and inclusive teaching methods) across all countries where DFID operates.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMaking the inclusion of disabled people a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding in all education programmes an urgent priority\n.  A\n strategy alone will be insufficient without effective implementation and accountability. \n \n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInves\nting\n in research (especially participatory research involv\ning\n children \nand teachers with disabilities)\n in inclusive education \nfocussed\n \nprogrammes\n and encourag\ning\n the support of civil society to promote equitable and inclusive education.  Provide funds and materials to support such initiatives.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsur\ning\n that all \nprogrammes\n focus on scaling up national plans rather than\n implement\n fragmented small scale projects.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdvocat\ning\n internationally for inclusive \neducation with other donors and governments \nand ensure effective coordination amongst all stakeholders\n.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nmplement\ning\n effective and transparent monitoring and evaluation \nacross all \ninclusive education \nprogrammes\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n6. Recommendatio\nns for DFID\n6.1 \nHandicap International seeks to build a vision of inclusive development based on:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nActive participation of disabled \npeople in all aspects of development and emergency response/recovery, including basic needs, health, rehabilitation, protection, education, mine action, socioeconomic empowerment and reduction of \narmed violence.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nargeted measures that support the development of and meet \nthe \nspecific needs of \npeople\n with disabilities.\nTo facilitate this, Handicap International \nhas gathered examples of good practice for disability inclusive development on their \nMaking it Work\n project’s website\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 \nBased on Handicap International’s \nexperience, \nto ensure that the\n UK achieves compliance to the \nCRPD\n to promote the rights and full participation of \npeople\n with disability and ensure fully inclusive development and humanitarian practice\n,\n \nHandicap International calls on DFID to implement a strategic approach to disability inclusion through:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloping a Disability Theory of Change through active co\nllaboration with civil society. \nHandicap International commits to supporting \nthis process which would enable DFID to demonstrate its advanced thinking on the critical issue of disability inclusion.\n \nAs \nthe key process from which all other DFID commitments stem\n, a robust Theory of Change will create a natural flow to the following commitments: \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA \nDisability \nResults F\nramework \nimplemented at\n central and country level against which \nDFID and partners are\n accountable. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTools for inclusive funding mechanisms and data disaggregation, supporting all steps throughout the development, roll out\n,\n and training of the tools\n.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData disaggregation in all DFID’s humanitarian and civil society programmes.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMechanisms that ensure the effective participation of \npeople\n with disabilities at all stages of programming.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 \nFurther, Handicap International asks DFID to:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInfluence the UN agencies\n it funds via the multi-lateral system to ensure they include disability, age, and injury concerns in their work.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStrengthen existing internal \ndisability \ninclusion advisory work across humanitarian and civil society DFID teams and identify senior focal points.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
