"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Seabed User And Developer Group&#xa0;\nThe\n Seabed User &amp; Developer Group comprises some of the key marine industries. The SUDG understands that the sea around our shores is a sensitive environment that needs to be valued and protected, but it is also a working environment that makes a substantial contribution to all our lives. From energy to aggregates and from ports to cables and leisure boating, the industries of the sea make an essential contribution to our land-based society and represent 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product supporting c.900,000 jobs. \n&#xa0;\nWe are an informal grouping whose participants have a common interest and commitment to sustainable development within the UKâ€™s marine environment. We believe that sustainable win-win solutions are possible from what are sometimes seen as competing needs. We are committed to working with Government, the MMO and other stakeholders to develop cost-effective regulation and marine management that benefits both business and the environment. Our website \nwww.sudg.org.uk\n sets out more information about the group and our priorities which are summarised as:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIndividual sectors may present specific \nsectoral\n evidence to the Committee, so this response is centred round more generic issues which we feel are important to ensuring that the whole process of designating and managing MCZs will benefit both conservation and industry, will lead to more effective ways of working and applying regulations and lead to better management of MCZs pre and post designation.\nSUDG members played significant roles during the development of the \npMCZs\n and participated in all four regional projects providing data, information and support to the teams doing the work. SUDG has consistently supported the move to create MCZs and continues to do so. The views of SUDG were made clear in the joint statement that we prepared with the conservation bodies (WCL, MCS, RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts) and presented to Richard Benyon in February 2013. This set out clearly that an essential aspect of good MCZs is a proportionate approach to regulation with clear and practical guidance to meet clear and agreed conservation objectives and management measures. \nThis is a critically important time for marine development and the opportunities to support sustainable development and meet Government policies on economic growth, climate change and environmental protection are enormous. SUDG continues to hold the view that well managed MCZs will not prevent economic growth, but if this is to be the case, and to \ndevelop the broad statements above, a number of important aspects must be clearly recognised and the management of MCZs must show that these points are properly embraced in determining both designation and subsequent management:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIndustry has considerable experience of addressing environmental issues resulting from development and of reaching positive outcomes through constructive discussions that look for win-win solutions. We have always supported the work of Defra and the regulators in \ndeveloping and implementing marine legislation and will continue that support. Industry therefore has a lot to offer, both in terms of the evidence and data required to help define MCZs and in helping to develop effective approaches to marine management, but it is important that that this offer to develop constructive support and assist the process is used more than has been the case to date. \n9 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
