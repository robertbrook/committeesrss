[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Public benefit delivered]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our charitable purpose defines our business. All of our services, treatments and facilities, and the funding that enables them, is dedicated to augmenting the nation’s health and wellbeing. 2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Improving public health outcomes is critical and Nuffield Health is uniquely positioned as a Third Sector organisation to achieve long-term, scalable, and leading-edge innovations across the UK healthcare sector. No other healthcare group can combine the freedom to act solely in the interests of the public, with the ability to deliver across a range of services, and the flexibility to take a panoramic view. Our carefully built and managed financial strength permits us to utilise the benefits and independence endowed by our not-for-profit status to consider and meet the genuine needs of the UK health consumer.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Accessibility to our services matters deeply. Our Trustees review this regularly and report annually. 13% of our revenue comes from products and services that are less than £1 per day, and approximately 20% of our revenues are provided from services that are free at the point of delivery – predominately from NHS contracts. We also offer free healthcare education to the public and hold over 650 events annually.&#xa0;

[[[Empowering our ability to help ]]]4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield Health never stops trying to better our provision of care and to develop the vision that delivers it.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We identified people’s health and wellbeing needs and then applied evidence-based propositions to create ‘joined-up’ healthcare:6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2005: Sona Positive Health acquired. Combined with Nuffield Hospital’s physiotherapy and health assessment services to create the UK’s first employee wellbeing business – Nuffield Proactive Health.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2007: Cannons Health &amp; Fitness acquired. Combined with Nuffield’s clinical expertise to offer personal wellbeing services to the individual.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2008: Nuffield Hospitals, Nuffield Proactive Health and Cannons united as Nuffield Health, providing ‘joined-up’ healthcare: integrated fitness, prevention and cure across different services and facilities.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2010: Bladerunner corporate fitness acquired. Expands Nuffield Health’s employee wellbeing offer across the UK.10.&#xa0;&#xa0; 2012: Greens Health &amp; Fitness acquired. Extends Nuffield Health’s personal wellbeing offer across the UK.11.&#xa0;&#xa0; We continue to expand our investment programme, membership levels, access and revenues.12.&#xa0;&#xa0; £246m has been reinvested into infrastructure, staff, services, support and facilities over the last five years. In a challenging debt market, we secured £270m in loans to support the on-going implementation of our innovative strategy.13.&#xa0;&#xa0; Group turnover grew from £552m in 2010, to £645m in 2012, with cash generation (EBITDA) increased by 21%.14.&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2012 alone: Group turnover increased 12% and £69m was invested in improving and expanding our services.15.&#xa0;&#xa0; 2012: Almost 500,000 hospital patients; 191,000 consumer fitness and wellbeing centre members; 104,000 employee wellbeing members in 1,600 companies.16.&#xa0;&#xa0; 25 million customer journeys annually.17.&#xa0;&#xa0; Revenues from Wellbeing services grew from £147m in 2009, to £194m in 2012, and now represent 30% of the charity’s revenues.18.&#xa0;&#xa0; The Nuffield Health Bond, launched May 2013, is a five-year fixed-term product, offering a fixed annual return of 6% (gross) in cash, for investments of £1,000 - £250,000. Our initial aim, to raise £15m, was reached early due to a phenomenal response that resulted in the Bond being over-subscribed - a gratifying endorsement of the Nuffield Health proposition in a depressed bond market. Ultimately the Bond raised £18m to help us make a real difference to the future of healthcare. 19.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield Health has the best balance sheet in the private health sector (compared to gym or private hospital operators). We are the least leveraged businesses in the industry and our debt represents less than 25% of our overall value. Alexander Harrison, Director Strategic Debt Finance, Barclays Commercial Bank, 2008: “Nuffield Health has a very strong balance sheet with a low ratio of debt relative to the sector, further reinforcing their market position.”20.&#xa0;&#xa0; 13% of revenue comes from products and services that cost less than £1 a day.&#xa0;

[[[Hospitals and medical ]]]

[[[centres]]]21.&#xa0;&#xa0; Response through innovation is key to our culture. We identify the needs of our patients and consumers, analyse healthcare trends, and then act on them. We are defined by dynamism. 22.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our strong, consistent leadership, married to meticulous medical and nursing procedures, and the outstanding quality of our staff, helps us to achieve industry-leading standards.23.&#xa0;&#xa0; As a charity we also have a valuable role to play within the hospital sector as a guardian of reasonable pricing. Effectively, we act as a safeguard on for–profit hospital groups, whose need to satisfy shareholders can cause an escalation in costs to the health consumer.24.&#xa0;&#xa0; UK’s largest network of well-invested, not-for-profit independent hospitals and operating theatres. 25.&#xa0;&#xa0; Two thirds of Britain within an hour’s drive of our facilities.26.&#xa0;&#xa0; 31 hospitals, 1,333 beds and 118 operating theatres.27.&#xa0;&#xa0; 50,000+ orthopaedic procedures.28.&#xa0;&#xa0; 31,000+ general surgical procedures.29.&#xa0;&#xa0; 16,000+ ophthalmic procedures.30.&#xa0;&#xa0; 36,000+ MRI scans.31.&#xa0;&#xa0; NHSLA 3 accreditation: unique in independent sector.32.&#xa0;&#xa0; 1,500+ different kinds of treatment.33.&#xa0;&#xa0; Almost 500,000 patients every year.34.&#xa0;&#xa0; Almost 100,000 NHS patients free, at the point of delivery.35.&#xa0;&#xa0; Community engagement and partnership health programmes run throughout our hospitals, and fitness and wellbeing centres.36.&#xa0;&#xa0; The only private hospital group to publish full clinical governance data, with demonstrable outcomes. Patient satisfaction levels over 99% and we have an impressive record of infection-free hospital facilities. 37.&#xa0;&#xa0; 2009: ‘Recovery Plus’ launched to help surgery patients transition to an integrated physiotherapy and fitness-related rehabilitation programme in our wellbeing centres, thus improving post-operative outcomes by ‘joining-up’ health and wellbeing.38.&#xa0;&#xa0; £35m invested to create a national network of facilities, via the Hospitals’ division, offering industry-leading instrument sterilisation and decontamination services. All six facilities have gained accreditation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to the standards required to be compliant with the European Medical Devices Directive (EC93/42) and to achieve ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 9001:2000 compliance. Each has ‘defect rates’ at about half of the accepted national average.39.&#xa0;&#xa0; First provider to offer free removal and replacement of PIP implants, and establish industry-leading best practice to ensure the safety and best interests of patients.40.&#xa0;&#xa0; Unique programme of matron-led care to empower matrons as leaders and decision-makers.41.&#xa0;&#xa0; 2009: First independent sector hospital provider to roll out Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) across all hospitals. 42.&#xa0;&#xa0; The only independent sector organisation to compile and publish an Integrated Governance Report (IGR), which stretches from ‘board to ward’. 43.&#xa0;&#xa0; Supported development of the Exeter Hip, 1970s. Pioneered hip resurfacing in Birmingham, 1990s. 2006: first ever autologous elbow tissue transplant performed at the Gerrards Cross Nuffield Hospital.44.&#xa0;&#xa0; Zero cases of MRSA bacteraemia since May 2011.

[[[Fitness and wellbei]]]

[[[ng]]]45.&#xa0;&#xa0; We are proud to have been a catalyst in the wellbeing revolution that emphasises prevention as much as cure. We have acted on this insight and now inform, inspire and enable people to choose lifestyles that are better for their health and wellbeing. This is particularly vital in the workplace where so many days are spent. Our workplace employee fitness and wellbeing centres allow people to step directly from work into health.46.&#xa0;&#xa0; Preventative healthcare is central to the viability of the UK’s future. It contributes to containing sector costs, improves productivity and helps people to take control of their health. Our commitment to this concept is realised through our investment in fitness and wellbeing centres, nutritional therapists, health mentors and physiotherapists, as well as in leading-edge digital innovations such as our HealthScore™ app. 47.&#xa0;&#xa0; Over the past decade we have acquired four major corporate and fitness chains. We transformed and united them under Nuffield Health to create a unique network of preventative care for the country. This is our vision made tangible to the people we are here to help.&#xa0;

[[[Employee fitness and wellbeing]]]48.&#xa0;&#xa0; UK market-leader for provision of wellbeing services to employees. 49.&#xa0;&#xa0; We provide award-winning wellbeing services to 1,600+ businesses, benefitting 104,000 employee members.50.&#xa0;&#xa0; Physiotherapy offered to our corporate partners in 600+ locations. 51.&#xa0;&#xa0; We power the productivity of UK businesses through their people, supporting half the FTSE100 and 40% of the FTSE250 in health and wellbeing.52.&#xa0;&#xa0; We establish new standards of health assessment. In addition to traditional areas, we screen for muscular-skeletal problems derived from poor posture in the work environment and anti-oxidant levels that help prevent health risks such as cancer. 53.&#xa0;&#xa0; We innovate in evolving ways of caring that best serve our customers, taking the unprecedented step of creating two entirely new kinds of practitioner - the wellbeing physiologist, and the wellbeing advisor - uniquely trained and developed by Nuffield Health. All Nuffield physiologists are part of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH).54.&#xa0;&#xa0; Europe’s largest health-screen provider: 150,000+.55.&#xa0;&#xa0; 100 Meet Our Experts’ events.56.&#xa0;&#xa0; First charity to develop and implement a centralised health screening system, the ViSystem, enabling automated aggregate reporting of health data to be monitored and acted on appropriately, with the integrated services and governance to support it.&#xa0;

[[[Personal fitness and wellbeing]]]57.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our proposition is unique. Everyone who joins our fitness and wellbeing centres receives a clinically-governed Health MOT covering 12 risk areas. This translates into an easily understandable health score, indicating personal levels of health, enabling beneficiaries to address any issues thus taking control of their health future: the essence of preventative healthcare. Helping people to help themselves is central to meeting the myriad challenges, such as the obesity epidemic, that the UK’s healthcare sector currently faces. We strive to lead that agenda.58.&#xa0;&#xa0; The only consumer fitness and wellbeing service in the UK: 65 sites.59.&#xa0;&#xa0; The only national chain of independent physiotherapists in the UK: 130 centres and 2,000 physiotherapists.60.&#xa0;&#xa0; We invented the Health MOT as an integrated aspect of fitness and wellbeing programmes.61.&#xa0;&#xa0; 100,000+ Health MOTs, delivered 2012. 62.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our research reveals that more than 75% of our members, who have a Health MOT, achieve a measurable improvement in their health. 54% reduced their cholesterol; 57% improved their blood pressure; 35% lost more than 3% of their body weight.63.&#xa0;&#xa0; Vi4 health assessments recorded a 17% decrease in obesity, blood pressure and cholesterol. 64.&#xa0;&#xa0; Research from our assessments revealed:9%+ of clients had recorded abnormal cardiovascular investigations, including significantly narrowed arteries, irregular heart patterns or other abnormalities.6%+ of female clients had abnormal mammograms requiring further investigation (10% of these cases were classified as urgent).3%+ had abnormal prostate-specific antigen tests and over 5% had abnormal cervical smears.65.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield HealthScore™, built on approximately 70 million man-years of available clinical data, is our exclusive, unique online tool and smart phone app. It helps people live healthier and more active lifestyles through bespoke, personal health and wellness information. 17,000+ users.66.&#xa0;&#xa0; 650 Meet Our Experts sessions provided.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[A decade of raising the bar]]]67.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield Health is recognised as living its commitment to excellence. Since 2003 we have won more major awards than any other comparable competitor, spanning every area relating to healthcare. During the same period we have gained numerous professional accreditations as benchmarks of the highest levels of care.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Remuneration]]]68.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield Health has a Remuneration Committee, comprising trustees of the charity, which takes independent advice from external advisors. It ensures that senior executives and other employees receive the necessary development and leadership opportunities, and are appropriately motivated and rewarded for their individual and collective contributions to the organisation’s overall performance. 69.&#xa0;&#xa0; With respect to executive remuneration, the Committee has delegated authority from Nuffield Health’s Board of Governors to determine the remuneration package for all senior executives including the Chief Executive.70.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield Health remuneration package: total compensation, including pension contributions, bonuses and other benefits, is positioned at 75% of the market median (median rate, discounted by 25%) for the reference market. [E.G. if there are 11 companies in the comparative market group for a role, and the total compensation level for each company is ranked from lowest to highest, the median level is that of the company positioned in the middle at 6th place. We benchmark at this point and then apply a further 25% discount to determine the level of remuneration].71.&#xa0;&#xa0; Current reference market is a selection of companies based on comparable organisational size and complexity. 72.&#xa0;&#xa0; Committee informed of total compensation levels in private and public healthcare organisations, and leading charities of a comparable size, to gauge relative positioning of executive packages. 73.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our trustees conduct an independent annual review of executive remuneration and view the salaries of our executives as being at the appropriate level to attract and retain the talent required to sustain the success of the charity. 74.&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe that a charity should be transparent so all of our pay levels are published in our Annual Report and Accounts.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Leadership]]]75.&#xa0;&#xa0; The leadership culture established by David Mobbs, since becoming Group Chief Executive of Nuffield Hospitals in 2003, has sustained the transformation of our charitable mission in all aspects of our operations. Nuffield Health is the result: a dynamic, innovative, responsive charity, delivering ‘joined-up’ healthcare across society to offer choice and excellence. 76.&#xa0;&#xa0; On his watch, we have developed the financial strength to enable Nuffield Health to use its not-for-profit status to consider and deliver the long-term needs of the UK health consumer. Our ability to innovate in response to the needs of today and the requirements of tomorrow, across numerous fronts, has helped the UK’s healthcare industry to evolve.77.&#xa0;&#xa0; David Mobbs’ catalytic role in our success has been recognised by his peers and health commentators. In 2010 he was awarded the highest accolade for outstanding individual contribution to the industry at the annual Health Investor awards. He has been personally ranked within the top ten in the ‘Health Investor Power 50’ since its inception.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Conclusion ]]]78.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield Health’s charitable mission is to maximise our positive impact on healthcare and wellbeing in the twenty first century. To service this vision necessitates a leadership team that is committed to the premise of being a unique charity, operating within this sector, and which has the experience, strategic awareness and competence to implement and deliver every aspect of ‘joined-up’ healthcare. 79.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nuffield Health’s ability to make a meaningful difference to countless people, from all walks of life, has been greatly enhanced and expanded over the past decade. Our mission continues.
