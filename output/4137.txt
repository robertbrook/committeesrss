[[[Summary]]]The UK’s food security can be improved by (a) increasing productivity and its resilience locally, (b) increasing the resilience of the international food supply chain, accounting for 40-50% of our food use, (c) reducing waste of food already grown/imported, (d) helping people manage diets and dietary choices better, and reducing over-consumption.  Arguably, greater impacts on local food security will arise from (b-d) than from increasing productivity locally.  Ensuring both sustainability and resilience are key issues, even if they “cost” in yield terms.  Taking a food systems view is crucial in planning for a world made more variable by climate and where food and other resources are increasingly competed for.Introductory comments

[[[Concluding remarks]]]Economic growth and ensuring a reliable and sustainable food supply are both important aims.  Encouraging healthy dietary choices and reducing waste – and thereby decreasing demand – has the potential to drive a “win-win-win” (health, environment, food security) solution.  This potentially allows producers to be paid more for producing less, but in a more environmentally sustainable way.  The UK has a strong potential to lead a “race to the top” to show that food systems for “sustainable nutrition” are both possible and profitable.  Thus, food security, for the UK (and globally) is not about producing more and more cheaply and accepting unsustainability: it is about encouraging respect for food, reducing waste, and managing production to protect the environment to allow our children and grandchildren to have the same securities we have now.December 2013&#xa0; See www.foodsecurity.ac.uk CS Holling (1973) Resilience &amp; Stability of Ecological Systems Ann Rev Ecol Syst 4: 1-23 UK NEA; E.
