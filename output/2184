defaultBroadsdefault Authority and the Broads Local Access Forum – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultI am writing to give you the views of the Broads Authority and the Broads Local Access Forum on the clauses in the draft Deregulation Bill which relate to public rights of way.
default&#xa0;
default I understand that National Parks England and the Rights of Way Review Committee will be submitting a response to the call for evidence but the Broads Authority and the Broads Local Access Forum have decided to submit separate additional comments.
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst, I would like to emphasise that both the Broads Authority and the Broads Local Access Forum support the package of measures contained in the Bill which relate to public rights of way.
default&#xa0;
default In our view the clauses in the Bill will simplify the procedures for recording and making changes to rights of way – procedures which have long been viewed as being overly cumbersome by rights of way professionals.
default&#xa0;
default Further the package of measures will, in the main, deliver the recommendations of the Stakeholder Working Group which is to be welcomed.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, we would like to submit suggestions regarding the proposed changes in the Bill which relate to the authorisation of gates or stiles under Section 147 of the Highways Act 1980.
default&#xa0;
default While welcoming the proposal to extend the powers under this section of the Act to Byways and Restricted Byways, we would also suggest that consideration be given to removing the need for an agricultural reason for the authorisation - for example the control of livestock.
default&#xa0;
default In our view there are circumstances in which it would be in the public interest for authorities to be able authorise gates where there is no agricultural or livestock control reason for doing so.
default&#xa0;
default In particular, in the Broads, we have encountered a number of situations where the ability to authorise gates for reasons of public safety would be of value. In one situation we have recently encountered, we are unable to authorise a gate to prevent unauthorised vehicular access to the site of a scheduled ancient monument which lies at the end of a restricted byway.
default&#xa0;
default In addition we feel that there are grounds for authorising fencing on routes in order to be able to separate users for safety reasons in situations where there is adequate width to allow all public rights to be exercised without let or hindrance.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe should therefore be grateful if you would record the our support for the Bill in general and our views with relation to Section 147 of the Highways Act in particular.
default&#xa0;
default Perhaps the best way to deal with this matter would be to remove the need for an agricultural reason for the authorisation of structures under Section 147 but the Broads Authority would also support the addition of a public health and safety reason for doing so.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you would like me to comment further. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRegards
