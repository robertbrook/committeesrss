[[[Protocol 36 process]]]While giving evidence to the Justice Committee on 16 October 2013, I committed to providing you with some additional information relating to Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions (the Probation FD). For ease of reference, this measure is number 88 on the list of measures within the scope of the 2014 decision that we placed in the House library and further information on it can be found in Command Paper 8671.As I explained while giving evidence, one of the key issues the Government had in mind when considering which measures to rejoin was that those measures will permanently come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) once we rejoin them. As you know, many of the pre-Lisbon measures were political compromises in order to secure unanimity and as a result can be broadly drafted. If the UK Parliament enacted similarly broad legislation UK courts would have to interpret that legislation were it ambiguous or unclear. Of course in the case of 

[[[EU ]]]legislation, it would ultimately be the ECJ which would decide how a measure should be interpreted. The key issue is what happens if the interpretation of that legislation by the ECJ results in unwelcome outcomes for the UK which the Government wants to address. If it was a UK law and a UK court then the UK Parliament could respond. However, with an EU law and an ECJ judgment the - UK cannot act unilaterally to amend the law.With this in mind, the Government assessed each measure and considered whether on balance the UK should seek to rejoin it. In the case of the Probation FD, it has only been implemented by a limited number of Member States and we are not aware of it ever having been used to date. As such, at this stage it is very difficult to make an assessment as to how the measure might or might not work.When I made this point while giving evidence I touched upon the measure's vagueness in relation to deportation and committed to provide you with further detail on that point in particular. Article 5 of the measure relates to the criteria for forwarding on a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision. In our view it is entirely unclear in relation to its application to persons who have been returned to another Member State as a consequence of being deported and who did not consent to be returned but who are now lawfully and ordinarily residing there. My view is that the better reading of this FD is that this does not apply to deportees, as the provision implies that return should be a choice, but it is absolutely not clear whether other Member States, the Commission and ultimately the ECJ would agree.Whether or not it applies to deportees and in what circumstances could of course have potentially substantial consequences in terms of the Probation FD's usefulness, and impact on the UK. If it doesn't apply to deportees then its usefulness (as a public protection measure allowing states to supervise incoming deportees who may present a risk) is obviously significantly curtailed. If it does apply to deportees then, although this may affect a relatively small group of offenders, we are unclear as to what happens in the event an individual is deported, the probation decision or alternative sanction is transferred, and there is a subsequent breach. In particular, Member States may make a declaration that they will not deal with breach locally, under certain circumstances, but will transfer jurisdiction back to the issuing Member State (and we already know from declarations made by some Member States that some States will do this). As a result, if the person has already been deported, and the receiving Member. State then wishes to return jurisdiction on breach, I am not clear what the status of that deportation would be. Alternatively, the transferred order may be unenforceable, thereby entirely undermining the purpose of the FD. These are very important questions and until we have clearer answers it is not a measure that I consider the UK should seek to rejoin.October 2013&#xa0;
