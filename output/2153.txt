[[[Arctic Methane Emergency Group – Written evidence]]]

[[[              ]]]&#xa0;As Chairman of AMEG, the Arctic Methane Emergency Group, I would very much appreciate the opportunity, on the behalf of AMEG, to submit written evidence to the Joint Committee pertaining to Clause 20, second question, under the group of questions titled 

[[[“A duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth.”]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The second question under Clause 20 reads: Where might there be adverse consequences?  I would like to identify in my evidence such “adverse consequences” under Clause 27 of the Draft Bill, namely the “

[[[Reduction of duties relating to energy and climate change”]]]&#xa0;Sir Nicholas Stern has described climate change as “the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen”.  What is the point of economic growth if the planet is trashed?  The stability of our climate is a critical factor for the food supply which must underpin growth in the economy. Regulation is a crucial tool in the battle against climate change.&#xa0;I believe AMEG is in a position to provide special and telling evidence of the extreme adverse consequences that would follow a meltdown of the Arctic ice cap and release of vast quantities of methane.   Any relaxation of the requirement to combat Arctic warming by every possible means, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, must be resisted.&#xa0;AMEG provided both written and oral evidence for the Environmental Audit Committee’s enquiry into Protecting the Arctic and has also presented submissions to the All Party Group on Climate Change.&#xa0;

[[[Nature of the evidence AMEG would like to submit.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The basic contention that AMEG will be providing evidence to support is that any contemplated reduction of duties relating to energy and climate change should be given the most serious consideration as the Government would be seen as being irresponsible in the highest regard with any weakening of their determination to adhere to their current policy on climate change.&#xa0;We would base our evidence in considerable measure on the forthcoming IPPC report (AR5) with its latest findings on the state of the world’s climate, but we will add as a crucial element in this evidence, a factor that the IPPC has underestimated in its importance. This factor is the rapidly disappearing Arctic sea ice  and snow cover on the surrounding land: it portends catastrophic consequences for the world order, including a dramatic failure of the world’s economy for a variety of reasons, not least being the collapse of business confidence in the ability of governments to deal with major destabilizing issues.&#xa0;This contention is entirely in line with the very recent statement by Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the Chairman of the IPPC, when announcing the release of the first of the series of reports prepared by the IPPC: -&#xa0;"Humanity has pushed the world's climate system to the brink, leaving itself only scant time to act."We cannot isolate ourselves from anything that happens in any part of this planet. It will affect all of us in some way or the other."&#xa0;The particular part of the planet on which AMEG focuses is the Arctic because of the speed of decline of the sea ice.  Unless there is rapid intervention to cool the Arctic, the ocean is likely to be largely free of ice by the end of summer 2015 or 2016 according to the leading expert, Professor Peter Wadhams.  &#xa0;The evidence that I would like to provide to the Joint Committee will underline and significantly augment the evidence of the forthcoming IPPC report on which Dr. Pachauri’s plea to the world’s governments was based.&#xa0;Further AMEG evidence concerns methane.  Methane is the main constituent of natural gas but it is a very powerful greenhouse gas if it is allowed to enter the atmosphere.  According to Shindell methane is 105 times more potent than CO2 over a 20 year period.  &#xa0;

[[[Recommended actions on methane]]]&#xa0;AMEG urges the UK government to take a lead in regulation to limit fugitive methane, i.e. the methane which escapes into the atmosphere during the process of extraction of oil and gas.  The government should also have a policy of obtaining natural gas from sources with lowest levels of fugitive methane.  AMEG also supports the Environment Audit Committee recommendation for a moratorium on drilling in the Arctic, where a blow-out could be catastrophic.&#xa0;To reduce regulation in such a sensitive area of climate change would be a gross dereliction of duty.&#xa0;I would be extremely grateful to the Joint Committee if I was granted the opportunity to expand on the evidence briefly outlined above.&#xa0;John Nissen, Chair, AMEG&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
