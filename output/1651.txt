[[[Summary]]]The publication of the revised Heat Strategy in March 2013 has caused industry to re-evaluate the Government’s approach to reducing carbon emissions from heating and the likely deployment of renewable energy efficiency measures. In the coming months, the Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive provides an exciting opportunity to encourage consumers to take action in their own homes.Over the past few years there have been many developments outside of the policy sphere which make this inquiry particularly timely. These include:As a manufacturer in the UK, it is our view that renewable heating technologies offer a net benefit to UK PLC both in terms of long-term sustainability and carbon emissions reduction. There is also increasingly convincing data to show that investment in renewable technology and energy efficiency- the low carbon agenda- will over time offer better cost savings and lower fuel bills to consumers, as well as ensuring that the Government meets its legally binding renewable targets.There is much to be positive about in terms of managing the UK’s future heating requirements. The expected launch of the Renewable Heat Incentive in spring 2014, with new tariffs for the existing commercial scheme and the first domestic tariffs, will bring a welcome boost to the growing renewable heating market in the UK. In addition, the ability to link the Green Deal with the Renewable Heat Incentive would enable more innovative finance packages which could see free renewable heating systems installed into consumers’ homes. However there have been some recent disappointments. The updated Building Regulations, for instance, will include no renewable heating technologies in its Part L requirements, and only the minimum possible requirements for energy efficiency measures. Outside of DECC, other Government departments must ensure they listen to a wider range of industry voices when taking policy decisions. On a positive note, the consultation on Community Energy has allowed us to make the case for the inclusion of heat pumps in any future strategy - as we are already installing our technology into communal heating schemes such as multiple occupancy social housing projects in urban centres. In conclusion, Mitsubishi Electric is broadly supportive of the Government’s current position and policy mix for heat decarbonisation. However, our optimism is tempered by caution. Views held within DECC are not necessarily supported elsewhere in Government and policies such as the Renewable Heat Incentive must be implemented and subsequently promoted effectively.

[[[Is the governmen]]]

[[[t taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand?]]]&#xa0;The current strategy towards reducing heat energy demand in the UK is to tackle both supply and demand of heating; we broadly agree with the Government’s approach to roll out energy efficiency measures, increase the deployment of renewable heating technologies, and seek to alter consumer behaviour. &#xa0;It is also appropriate to distinguish between technologies and industry sectors; the updated Heat Strategy of March 2013 highlighted different approaches for heating across domestic, industrial and community heating sectors. This is because many technologies are designed specifically for particular markets. &#xa0;Mitsubishi Electric heat pumps, for example, are modular systems which must be correctly specified for each property’s heat demand. Therefore, heat pump units and heat pump systems which are specified for commercial buildings tend to be much larger than the smallest 5-10kW domestic heat pump installation.&#xa0;Finally, while we agree broadly with the Government’s approach to reducing heat energy demand, it is important to note that the Heat Strategy, Energy Efficiency Strategy, and other relevant policies must not become overly prescriptive about solutions for decarbonisation and demand reduction. &#xa0;An example would be the current approach to Community Energy in the Heat Strategy, and the proposed Community Energy Strategy which is out for consultation at present. Both these documents imply a vision of community heating which is largely powered by large scale biomass or, more often, micro combined heat and power (mCHP) technologies. &#xa0;However we believe that there are other innovative solutions for community and collective heating coming forward. We routinely install heat pump systems into multiple occupancy buildings and have performed research which suggests that a collective heat pump system can offer consumer savings and encourage behavioural change. &#xa0;

[[[What progress is the government making on reducing the dema]]]

[[[nd for heat?]]]&#xa0;We recognise Government efforts to promote heat reduction, and believe that positive steps for the delivery of heat demand reduction have been made. The production of the strategy documents for Heat and for Energy Efficiency and the open Consultation on Community Energy Strategy are all sensible and comprehensive documents. From an over-arching policy point of view, therefore, the Government has taken several progressive steps to deliver its agenda. However, there have been significant delays to the key policies which aim to drive the strategic frameworks established by these overarching Government strategies. In particular, the Renewable Heat Incentive is now three years behind its originally proposed implementation date; with the domestic scheme and the revised non-domestic tariffs both due to come into force in April 2013. &#xa0;Industry confidence has been damaged by the delays to the policy, and will inevitably delay scaling-up supply chains until they have certainty over final tariffs and implementation dates. The impact that policy announcements have on the market can be seen from the Ofgem RHI deployment figures; there was a 90% increase in enquiries about the RHI to Ofgem in Jan-March 2013, the quarter after the September 2012 consultations (which closed in December 2012) and a three times increase in the number of RHI payments made (£5.1m to £1.5m). &#xa0;It is very important that the Government keep to their projected timelines. In particular, Air to Water Heat Pumps were originally consulted upon in the New Technologies consultation of September 2012, in what was understood to be a “fast track” to their integration into the RHI scheme. However, a proposed tariff for Air Heat Pumps in the commercial scheme was only recently announced (of 2.5p/kWh). With commercial installations taking up to 6 months to specify and agree, it is vital that the Government announces this as the final tariff level in the autumn, so that we can be ready to install the first new commercial air to water heat pumps in spring 2014.  &#xa0;In addition, the Green Deal, the Government’s flagship energy efficiency scheme for the domestic market (at present) has also had a low uptake against its projections (just over 300 Green Deal Plans are planned or pending as of July 2013, see below). Similarly, the Building Regulations- which will drive energy efficiency in the new build sector- have recently been announced as favouring the least stringent option for the new Part L regulations. With the second Phase of ECO under consultation, it is important that both DCLG and DECC remain committed to driving improved energy efficiency across the UK building stock and reflects this in regulation going forward. &#xa0;

[[[What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?]]]&#xa0;We have no comment on air pollution impacts of future heat generation technologies. However, we can comment on the issue of neighbourhood noise pollution. In January 2013, DCLG wrote to stakeholders about revising the permitted development rights for heat pump and micro wind turbine installations. &#xa0;Industry welcomed this decision, as in order to meet the current 42dB threshold for noise, the majority of ASHP installations have to be installed several meters away from the nearest dwelling or go through the additional process of applying for planning permission. We have found this unnecessarily burdensome, particularly as the RHI specifically targets small urban properties for the increased deployment of air source heat pump installations. &#xa0;In addition, industry-led research from 2011 under the Freedom of Information Act discovered that between 1 January 2008, and the 31st December 2011, only 0.08% of domestic ASHP installations resulted in a noise complaint across all 364 Local Councils in the UK. It was our recommendation that the 42dB limit was sufficient, and could be raised to 45dB without negatively impacting neighbourhood noise levels..&#xa0;Industry’s recommendation to DCLG was therefore that the noise limit for air source heat pumps was sufficient at 42dB, and could afford to be raised to 45dB without impacting on neighbourhood noise pollution. This would offer a more realistic reflection of heat pump noise levels. &#xa0;

[[[What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating co]]]

[[[mpared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? ]]]&#xa0;The Government’s Heat Strategy makes clear that the UK’s renewable future must be comprised of a mix of technologies. The revision to the Heat Strategy of March 2013 also gave more prevalence to gas in that energy mix.  However, the RHI and other policies will also drive a future with more renewable products on the grid, some of which, like heat pumps, use electricity. We have conducted research into some of the likely future combinations of heating technologies and centralised energy production; the graph overleaf represents our high-level findings.  As the graphic above shows, the best-case scenario in terms of CO2 emissions for the future UK energy mix would be to combine highly-efficient heat pumps with renewable electricity generation. Even if heat pumps are used in combination with electricity generated from a mixed source, as they are today, they remain a far better option than other forms of heating- which produce more carbon emissions and consume more raw energy. It makes sense, therefore, to continue to support the deployment of heat pumps and encourage the reform of the UK’s energy markets towards a broader energy mix.

[[[Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We believe that an opportunity has to date been missed by the Government to drive community heating for multiple occupancy dwellings, and in particular high rise buildings, in the UK. This is because there has been done little work in the UK to date to define “community energy” as it relates to the UK heating sector, and examine innovative new solutions to the community energy problem using technologies other than CHP. We were therefore are pleased that the Government recently consulted on the development of a Community Energy Strategy, to which we have offered evidence.&#xa0;There has been significant evidence put forward to suggest that community heating should be a priority for the UK Government going forward, as the 2013 Heat Strategy makes clear (below). Government models suggest that up to 20% of UK domestic heat demand could be met by community heating schemes by 2030, with such schemes offering energy efficiency benefits over traditional individual heating systems:In particular, the 2009 Poyry report suggested that heat networks could offer benefits to urban communities, where heat demand was concentrated. Deployment to this kind of property could halve carbon emissions compared with using existing technologies. We believe that recognising ground and air source heat pumps as a technology which could deliver this kind of community heating scheme efficiently and cost-effectively, would help drive the deployment of this kind of collective heating system.&#xa0;Our own research highlights the opportunity for policymakers of recognising heat pump systems for deployment as community heating in low and high rise flats in the UK, to replace existing heating technologies.  For the purposes of our research, we defined “low rise” as having 6 storeys or less and “high rise” as having more than 6 storeys. To identify the potential numbers of dwellings which could be eligible for a community heating system using heat pump technology, we sourced numbers from:Research focused on those properties which used Electric and Mains Gas Heating, as these are the key heating technologies used in this type of housing at present. There are additional properties which use communal heating which could be replaced with a heat pump (although this is relatively difficult); there are around 0.222 million properties which currently use communal heating.Our analysis is below: Our headline findings are:This represents 13.4 GW of potential heat met through community heating If existing communal heating systems were replaced with a heat pump system, the potential number of UK properties which could be impacted is 3,574,000. &#xa0;However, there are barriers to the deployment of such systems. There are inadvertent obstacles created by policymakers through over-looking solutions provided by technologies such as heat pumps.  There are also significant practical problems such as a lack of information and technical knowledge available and a lack of financing for systems which currently have a high capital cost of installation relative to mass-manufactured traditional heating alternatives.&#xa0;It is also possible to combine heat pump installations with CHP. All CHP installations need secondary heat sources, and a model which uses both heat pumps and CHP could provide further carbon savings. This is because the heat pump can use the electricity generated by CHP and upgrade it at high efficiency levels to make heat.&#xa0;The Low Carbon Pioneer Cities programme is an example of the kind of work needed to stimulate the growth of low carbon heat networks; we look forward to seeing the £3m outlined in the Heat Strategy for the Heat Networks Delivery Unit and the additional £6m for local authority procurement and technical reporting come into effect. &#xa0;

[[[8.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[What are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?]]]&#xa0;The selection of a heating system is a rare occasion for a consumer with conventional boilers lasting around ten years before replacement is required. Consumers typically rely on the advice provided by heating installers who are unlikely to recommend a heating solution that they cannot install. Thus, active promotion of alternatives is essential to inform/shape the choice of heating replacement. Failure to do so means lock in of costs and emissions for at least 10 years.&#xa0;For an individual system in a typical on-gas three bedroom semi-detached property, the impact of selecting a gas boiler over an Air Source Heat Pump could be around £100 in higher bills annually and just under 1 tonne of CO2 each year. 1.5 million boilers are installed every year in the UK meaning that in 2013 alone, UK consumers are theoretically missing out on £150 million of annual energy bill savings. These missed savings (both financial and GHG) are likely to be locked in at least until 2023.&#xa0;Supporting evidence for the assumptions above are set out in the following figures:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Should the government take any further any specific actions in relation to cooling?]]]&#xa0;The priority for policymakers should be on reducing heat demand, rather than focusing on cooling. It is of course right to be concerned with making cooling technologies as efficient and low carbon as possible, but with the current trajectory for low carbon and energy efficient heating being a key concern, it is important that policy and delivery remains focused on these technologies in order to meet legally binding emissions reduction and renewables targets.&#xa0;It is sensible, however, to ensure that cooling and ventilation issues remain part of the debate about the heating market as it develops over the coming years. It is sensible, for instance, that policy makers consider ventilation technologies as part of an energy efficiency strategy which will drive the installation of insulation, draught proofing and so on into retrofit properties. It is important to ensure that properties are thermally efficiency and do not over-heat when temperatures are high, as they have been in summer 2013. Ventilation may well be part of such solutions.&#xa0;The air conditioning market is being pushed hard to increase efficiency through the European Directive on Energy Using Products This Directive will encourage increased energy efficiency through innovation and development of technologies. Products which recover heat from server rooms, move heat build-up around buildings and recover heat from hot water are already in existence. Such technologies are also well developed in harvesting heat from the ground and air, known respectively as “ground source” and “air source”&#xa0;The government should be wary of technologies which simply deliver ‘active cooling’ such as ground to water heat pumps, which are pitched as increasing the efficiency of the heating element over the course of seasons. A better way of increasing the heating efficiency over seasons is to use passive cooling (cool water straight from the ground). In order to take advantage of the cooling properties of water pumped straight from the ground, heat emmitters would need to be sized bigger. However the process uses very little electrical energy (just the pump). &#xa0;The RHI currently supports heating-only technologies, and we support this as a policy principle because it is this market that needs stimulus for growth. Much more independent analysis would need to be performed on heating and cooling systems before it would be wise to consider it as a genuine policy solution. &#xa0;

[[[10.]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The commercial RHI has been under-deployed to date, and has favoured the deployment of biomass technologies, with over 90% of installations on the scheme so far being solid biomass burners:&#xa0;The government has already recognised and responded to this issue, however, by announcing a tariff review of the non-domestic scheme and the proposed tariff levels for several new technologies (including air to water heat pumps). These new tariff levels have taken into consideration updated modelling assumptions, such as the capital cost of installation, and has recalibrated tariffs at the appropriate level to drive the 12% rate of return on their investment that should motivate a consumer to install a new technology. &#xa0;Moreover, there has been a delay to the implementation of the domestic RHI scheme. The final proposals for this scheme were made in September 2012, and the announcement of the final Government proposals was made this summer 2013. This long awaited announcement contained the information industry needed to start gearing up supply chains, talking to consumers, and booking more installations, as it included vital information such as tariff levels, eligibility requirements, and technological details such as metering proposals. &#xa0;The reason for low deployment of the RHI so far has therefore been twofold, firstly the delay to announcing and implementing both domestic and non-domestic schemes impacted upon industry confidence, and dis-incentivised manufacturers and installers to increase their activity on the basis that the subsidy was uncertain. In addition the tariff levels which were in place were too low to generate the required rate of return for heat pump technologies, or had been proposed but not yet finalised or implemented (as is the case with the commercial air to water tariff).&#xa0;Therefore it is reasonable to expect that if the Government announces the finalised commercial RHI tariffs on time when parliament returns in the autumn of 2013, at the levels proposed (which should generate a 12% RoR), and implements both commercial and domestic schemes on time in Spring 2014, the RHI will promote heat pumps and all of the technologies it supports successfully. &#xa0;

[[[11.]]]&#xa0; 

[[[How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?]]]&#xa0;The most recent Impact Assessment of the Renewable Heat Incentive says that “the RHI is a subsidy scheme operating under a fixed budget with the objective of incentivising the deployment of renewable heat such that by 2020 12% of the UK’s heat demand comes from renewable sources”. The benefits are expected to be profound, with the larger domestic scheme estimated to deliver around £1,077m in benefits in deployment.&#xa0;The scheme also targets specific segments of the UK heating market, specifically the off-gas grid properties, and has been calculated on the same model as the existing heating market, where consumers would be looking to retrofit an old boiler (and are therefore locked in to their heating system for 15 years or more). DECC have said that the potential market size is “highly uncertain; both in terms of what may be technically possible and actually feasible”, because the scheme will be demand led. &#xa0;Furthermore, there is a budget management mechanism in place which should keep the scheme to its projected levels; no technology should be able to overrun its budgeted expenditure, and the scheme overall will be restricted to a prescribed budget. The budget management mechanism looks at both overall scheme deployment, and individual technology deployment, when deciding whether tariffs should be reduced. Expenditure (as of 1st Quarter of 2013) for the RHI (non-domestic only) is shown below:&#xa0;There is therefore reason to believe that when the domestic RHI is implemented in the spring of 2014, along with the revisions to the non-domestic tariffs, the scheme will build to a point of success commensurate with the projects made by DECC. In terms of installation this means around 745,000 domestic renewable heat installations in the UK will be supported by the RHI by 2020/21; the Government anticipates that 343,000 ASHP will be supported by the domestic RHI.

[[[Thermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually. What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, a]]]

[[[nd should it do more/different?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Thermal storage technologies are currently in their infancy, and are not yet appropriate both in terms of cost-effectiveness and scale, for individual properties. There is also a further question about the usefulness of thermal storage in a future scenario where there would be many more inverter-driven heat pumps on the grid; the nature of this technology is that thermal storage may be an unnecessary additional expense for balancing electricity demand. &#xa0;That said, as part of an organised reworking, at system level, of the grid, then thermal storage could be useful as part of the large scale demand side response efforts which should be being led by the district network operators and others in the electricity markets. There are also innovative new technology solutions which are being enabled through the development of storage technologies, for example, the combination of Solar PV and Electrical Storage could overcome the gap between the hours of peak generation and peak demand experienced in solar technologies. &#xa0;The most sensible approach for the government at this stage would be to encourage the development of cost-effective storage technologies, and look into innovative technology combinations. Where thermal storage could be utilised with immediate effect is in the future design of the electricity markets, where it offers a large-scale solution (or part solution) to the needs of demand side response and grid balancing. It is impractical to suggest, for instance, a subsidy for this technology for small-scale balancing at householder level at this stage of its development. &#xa0;September 2013&#xa0; Ofgem RHI Quarterly Statics, Jan-March 2013 Green Deal and ECO Monthly Statistics, DECC, June 2013 Ecuity LLP, 2011.
