[[[ Introduction]]]

[[[              ]]]1.1               The British Horseracing Authority (BHA), the Governing and Regulatory body for the sport of thoroughbred horseracing in Great Britain, welcomes the opportunity to respond on behalf of the sport (Racing) to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s inquiry in to the role of women in sport.1.2              As evidenced in the recent Deloitte Economic Impact of British Racing 2013, British Racing is not only the second-largest sport in the country in respect of revenues, employment and attendances – but is also an industry that makes a significant contribution to the wider rural economy, generating an annual economic impact of £3.45 billion. The industry directly provides over 20,000 full-time and part-time positions, alongside many tens of thousands more jobs in related industries including veterinary and farriery services and the British Betting industry, in line with the Government’s objective of providing employment opportunities for population groups less likely to engage with the labour market in a full-time role. 1.3               British Racing is unique amongst the most popular sports in the country in that it is the only sport where, on a daily basis, women are able to compete on an equal basis with men in the same events. We are an equal opportunities sport.1.4               Women are involved in high-level and varied roles within the industry, including as participants (jockeys and trainers), stable staff, at racecourses and in important positions within the sport’s governance and administration.

[[[Jockeys]]]2.1              Female jockeys compete in the same races as their male counterparts (with  the exception of races held for lady Amateur riders and a lady riders-only race meeting at Carlisle held every August for charity) and have the full respect of their male counterparts in the weighing room. 2.2              Furthermore, female jockeys have successfully ridden winners at the highest level of the sport. Hayley Turner, who in 2008 became the first female jockey to ride over 1,000 winners in a season, has won two Group One Races (the highest class of Flat Race) in Great Britain – the Darley July Cup at Newmarket and the Coolmore Nunthorpe Stakes at York. In 2013, Katie Walsh became the first female to ride the favourite in the John Smith’s Grand National – having achieved a third place finish in the 2012 race.2.3              Encouraged by the success of jockeys like Hayley Turner and Katie Walsh, alongside others including Kirsty Milzareck, Cathy Gannon and Amy Ryan, who in 2012 became the first ever female winner of the Apprentice Flat Jockeys’ title, female participation rates in the sport are healthy. While the number of Professional female jockeys remains relatively small, at approximately 11% of Flat Professional licences throughout 2013, this has grown slightly in recent years (9% in 2012). Moreover, 30% of Flat Amateur jockeys in 2013 are female while almost 70% of those holding Category A Flat Permits, allowing them to compete in Amateur Races, are held by women. Overall, at any one time in 2013, between 22% and 31% of all licence holders of any type are female.

[[[Trainers]]]3.1              Female participation in British Racing extends far beyond the parameters of the racecourse itself. The sport has, past and present, and particularly in Jump Racing, bore witness to magnificent training performances by women – including Henrietta Knight, a licensed trainer for 23 years and winner of three consecutive Cheltenham Gold Cups with Best Mate from 2002-04, and Jenny Pitman, who in 1983 became the first female Grand National winning trainer with Corbiere. Furthermore, the 2013 Grand National winner, Aurora’s Encore, was trained by Sue Smith.3.2              As of August 2013, 18% (102) of the 558 Trainers licensed to train thoroughbred racehorses by the BHA are female – alongside some 38% (45) of the 119 Permit (Amateur) Trainers also licensed by the BHA.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Stable Staff]]]4.1              British Racing employs over 6,500 people to provide constant care and attention for the 14,000 horses in training in this country at any one time, providing them with a level of care and a quality of life that is virtually unsurpassed by any other domesticated animal. These staff perform a number of roles around licensed training yards including as Stable Lads and Lasses and Work Riders – assisting with the preparation of horses for racing alongside the running of the yard.  &#xa0;4.2              As of August 2013, 2,773 women are registered as a Stable Employee with the BHA – which is just over 40% of the 6,823 strong workforce. Of these approximately 2,800 female employees, just over 57% work in a full-time position – and represent approximately one-third of full-time stable employees. Furthermore, the approximately 1,200 female part-time stable staff represent just over 56% of the registered part-time workforce in licensed yards.&#xa0;

[[[Racecourses, Industry Administration and Governance]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1              The British Racing industry also provides employment opportunities at all levels of seniority to women. &#xa0;5.2              A number of racecourses employ women in important business and racetrack management positions – with 16 of 58 racecourses (28%) in Great Britain having women as Managing Directors and 12 of 58 with women as Clerks of the Course. These include Amy Starkey, who having joined the industry through the BHA Graduate Development Programme, is now Regional Manager – East for Jockey Club Racecourses, incorporating most notably Newmarket – the home of the QIPCO 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas, the first two Classic races of the season.&#xa0;5.3              Women also hold senior positions within the governance of British Racing. The BHA Board has modern and effective sporting governance standards and meets many of the criteria as stipulated by Sport England in its funding requirements to National Governing Bodies (BHA does not receive direct grant-aid funding from DCMS). Within this governance framework, there has been a female representative on the Board of the BHA at all times since its creation in 2007 from the merger of the Horseracing Regulatory Authority and British Horseracing Board. The current female representative on the Board is Morag Gray. One of the four Executives of the organisation, under Chief Executive Paul Bittar, is Ruth Quinn, Director of Racing and the BHA’s current Chief Veterinary Officer is Jenny Hall. &#xa0;5.4              Outside of the BHA, women also hold a number of prominent positions within the principal stakeholder organisations in the sport. Rachel Hood, a successful human rights lawyer, is President of the Racehorse Owners Association. Louise Kemble is Chief Executive of the Thoroughbred Breeders’ Association – which represents the interest of thoroughbred racehorse breeders.&#xa0;

[[[Women in Racing]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1              In September 2009, Women in Racing was founded by a cross-section of women working with the industry, with the aim of enhancing mentoring and development opportunities, developing cross-industry working groups and the chance to network in order to share knowledge and best practice. The organisation, in its Mission Statement, intends “to encourage senior appointments at Board level across the industry and to attract more women into Racing, to strengthen connections and collaborate on approaches to help promote the health of the sport and to enhance its reputation as an attractive sector in which to build a career.”&#xa0;6.2              In February 2013, Women in Racing was awarded funding by the British Horseracing Grant Scheme, funded from the proceeds arising from the sale of the Tote and administered by the BHA on behalf of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, to support the development of the organisation’s mentoring programme. &#xa0;

[[[BHA Graduate Development Programme]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1              For more than two decades, British Racing has run an extremely successful Graduate Development Programme, which provides recent university leavers with the opportunity to learn about the industry and go on placement with a variety of employers including the BHA, Racecourses, Trainers Yards, Studs and racing charities. There have been a number of successful female graduates on the programme in its history and, in the last ten years, 47% of graduates on it have been female. Furthermore, for seven of the last ten years, at least 50% of the graduates on the programme are women. These statistics demonstrate that the British Racing industry provides opportunities for all capable young graduates, regardless of their gender.&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;8.1              If the Committee has any further questions regarding women in British Racing, then the BHA would be happy to answer these.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
