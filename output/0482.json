"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Adrian Camp (CLC001)&#xa0;\nMember of the Oxford Climate Sceptics Group, an informal grouping of scientists,  graduates and lay people with an interest in climate science and policy.\n&#xa0;\nThe questions before the committee are ill-posed. They assume things not in evidence and they presume a desired outcome which is not supported by the facts, such as they are.\n&#xa0;\nThe general public is not very interested in climate change. Their interest is decreasing and there is nothing to be done to stop it. The weather is not co-operating and absent any vestige of warmth in summer or winter it is very difficult to see how any evidence will convince anybody. It is not in the interest or the remit of the committee  to be telling the public what to think.\n&#xa0;\nThe evidence for climate change at all is thin. The evidence for climate change outside of the known range of natural variation is non-existent. Paleoclimatology tells us that the climate has been far warmer and far colder than the present at various times in the (geologically) recent past.  There is no evidence that any observed warming is attributable to human activity.  Those who claim to produce such evidence are heroic in their assumptions, especially those who base this claim on climate \nmodelling\n.  I or many better-qualified others can explain this in detail if required, it will not fit here.\n&#xa0;\nIf all the alarmist claims were true, there would be nothing that we in the UK could do about it. Our actions are lacking in global influence in CO2 terms and indeed in political terms. Nobody is going to stop the Chinese from burning coal.  But we here have decided to cut our economic throats voluntarily to prevent a non-existent disaster while being well aware that our actions are the merest token.\n&#xa0;\nWhen one reads the actual science, the various reports of the IPCC et al (NOT the executive summaries), one is struck by the level of doubt. Doubt is quite common in science, it is part of a process which can take a long time to resolve. Doubt is not welcomed by policy-makers. But doubt is what there is. No sure level of understanding of natural processes, no ability to predict the effects of a change. There is not enough certainty, in real life, to support a series of measures which are costing us our economy and will lead to power cuts in a matter of months if not reversed (Yes, that is another committee and not your purview, but I think it matters..)\n&#xa0;\nThe committee is wrong to want to convince the public of anything. It is wrong to assume that the problem with climate is lack of communication. What it ought to do is return to the evidence and examine it with a far more critical eye, and invite scientists from both sides to testify. There is still time to avoid a self-imposed disaster.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary\n&#xa0;\n It isn't getting warmer and there are no unprecedented weather events in wind, drought or flood.  It is time to revisit the whole thing just in case it is wrong.\n&#xa0;\n April 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
