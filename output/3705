defaultDraft Deregulation Bill Committeedefault&#xa0;defaultThank you for asking us to give oral evidence on 28 October. I wanted to take this opportunity following that to reiterate the CLA’s position. We are aware that you have received evidence concerned that the Stakeholder Working Group‘s proposals don’t go far enough. It is possible that the additional measures we have been calling for would meet some of the concerns which other groups, such as the Alternative Stakeholder Working Group, have expressed to the Committee.
