[normal]Q[bold] 2[bold]. [bold]How does the UK based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK ci[bold]tizens overseas?[bold]Q[bold] 3[bold]. [bold]Does UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive industries i.e. [bold]i[bold]n sales of [bold]machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?[bold]Q[bold] 4[bold]. [bold]Has the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?[bold]Q[bold] 5[bold]. [bold]What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for s[bold]uch businesses?[bold]Q 6. Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there e[bold]xamples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs? [bold]Collaboration and formal partnerships with global and regional conservation NGOs have shaped Rio Tinto’s global and regional biodiversity strategies and objectives
[normal] on “net positive impact”. Our learning from NGOs has contributed to the development of tools and methodologies used in this field. 
[normal]In mid-2010 Rio
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tinto signed a three year relationship agreement with the 
[normal]International Union for Conservation of Nature
[normal] (IUCN). This partnership includes the design and implementation of an assessment process that will be used to assess how Rio Tinto is doing is achieving its “net positiv
[normal]e impact” goals. Other biodiversity partners include: 
[normal]BirdLife International
[normal], 
[normal]Fauna &amp; Flora International
[normal] and 
[normal]Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
[normal] 
[normal]Q[bold] 7[bold]. [bold]Does the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to [bold]ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas?[bold]Q[bold] 8[bold]. [bold]What is the impact of the industry of the[bold] [bold]UK signing up to the EITI?[bold]Q 9. [bold]Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewher[bold]e or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?[bold]Q[bold] 10 [bold]. What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?[bold]&#xa0;
