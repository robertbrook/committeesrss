default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, t

default would be a very bad idea since such bags (both bio-degradable and

default, according to scientific studies released by DEFRA and the Environment Agency

defaultcannot be separated from conventional non degradable bags, so the whole stream will go to disposal rather than recycling default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultstudy released by the Environment Agency 
defaultstates
default: 
default 
default“
defaultStarch-polyester blend bags have a higher global warming potential and defaultabioticdefault depletion than conventional polymer bagsdefault….  This was partially due to it weighing approximately twice that of the conventional HDPE bags but also due to the high impacts of raw material production, transport and the 
defaultgeneration of methane from landfill.”default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultstudy 
defaultreleased by DEFRA states that
default “
defaultincorporation of additives… that cause plastics to undergo accelerated degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects… defaultOxodefault-degradable plastics are not suitable for recycling with main-stream plastics.”default&#xa0;defaultApart from the damaging environmental impact of such degradable materials, some of which contain 
defaultheavy metalsdefault, it is 
defaultnot possible to effectively sort and recycle themdefault. They will simply pollute other recycled materials. As a result the UK Government will fail to meet its stringent plastic recycling targets for 2017. 
default&#xa0;defaultAn exemption for degradable bags would 
defaultalso 
defaultbe 
defaulta 
defaultlicence to litter.default default&#xa0;defaultA better solution is to improve the recycling and reprocessing infrastructure in the UK for conventional carrier bags, 
default“Remade in Britain”. defaultA very recent APSRG report, Chaired by Caroline 
defaultSpelman
default MP, makes a series of 
defaultimportant 
defaultrecommendations to ensure the UK maximises value from its waste. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPlasRecycle
default has built the first plant in the UK to reprocess carrier bags and other post-consumer films back into a clean plastic granulate for reuse in new bags and in black sacks for sale in supermarkets
default. 
defaultThe plant has been funded
default by £10.7 million of investment, much of it from public funds, including 
defaultfrom 
defaultDEFRA’s delivery body 
defaultWRAP, The 
defaultMayor of 
defaultLondon
default’s 
defaultWaste &amp; R
defaultecycling Board and the 
defaultForesight Environmental Fund. The 
defaultplant can process over 20,000 to
defaultnnes per annum of post-consumer bags and 
defaultfilms, equivalent to 2.5 billion 
defaultsinglet 
defaultbags each weighing 8g or 600 million bags 
defaultfor life 
defaulteach weighing 33g. 
defaultWe have created 32 new jobs and will be expanding capacity in 
default2014. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA number of scientific studies have been conducted which are relevant to the 
defaultenvironmental impact of 
defaultcarrier bags:  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIn February 2011 the Environment Agency released a study that concluded that:
default• The environmental impact of all types of carrier bag is dominated by resource use and production stages. Transport, secondary packaging and end-of-life management generally have a minimal influence on their performance.
default• Whatever type of bag is used, the key to reducing the impacts is to reuse it as
defaultmany times as possible and where reuse for shopping is not practicable, other
defaultreuse, e.g. to replace bin liners, is beneficial.
default• The reuse of conventional HDPE and other lightweight carrier bags for shopping and/or as bin-liners is pivotal to their environmental performance and reuse as bin liners produces greater benefits than recycling bags.
default• Starch-polyester blend bags have a higher global warming potential and 
defaultabiotic
defaultdepletion than conventional polymer bags, due both to the increased weight of
defaultmaterial in a bag and higher material production impacts.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther the report states   “
defaultThe starch-polyester bag degrades fully to methane and carbon dioxide in landfill, producing a higher global warming impact from the end-of-life than the paper bag, which does not fully degrade in landfill”.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd further 
default“The starch-polyester bag had the highest impact in seven of the nine impact categories considered. This was partially due to it weighing approximately twice that of the conventional HDPE bags but also due to the high impacts of raw material production, transport and the generation of methane from landfill.”
default&#xa0;
defaultBiodegradable means capable of being broken down by bacteria or other living organisms. ‘
defaultBioplastics
default’ are made from natural materials such as corn-starch. Whilst this sounds like a green option, as per the EA report, the result is methane gas which is 23 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide. C
defaultompostable plastic is generally made from corn, a crop that is resource intensive, requiring large quantities land, water, and resources such as fertilizers for production. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAn alternative to starch based bio-degradable bags are bags that include “
defaultoxo
default-degradable additives” which are generally made of heavy metals. Oxidative degradation is a series of chemical reactions in which the long chains of polyethylene molecules are broken down into shorter lengths by the action of oxygen, ultra-violet light and/or heat. 
defaultDefra commissioned Loughborough University to undertake a research project which assessed the environmental impact of 
defaultoxo
default-degradable plastics across the life cycle. The key finding of this report was that 
default“defaultThe overall conclusion of this review is that incorporation of additives into petroleum-based plastics that cause those plastics to undergo accelerated degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects”.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther : 
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe length of time to degradation of 
defaultoxo
default-degradable plastic cannot be predicted accurately because it depends so much on the environmental conditions. It is suggested that 
defaultoxo
default-degradable plastics left in the open environment in the UK degrade to small fragments within 2 to 5 years. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-degradable plastics are not compostable, according to established international standards EN13432 and ASTM 6400. 
defaultOxo
default-degradable plastics should not be included in waste going for composting, because the plastic fragments remaining after the composting process might adversely affect the quality and saleability of the compost. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is thought that labelling the 
defaultoxo
default-degradable plastics as biodegradable can lead to confusion on the part of consumers, who may assume that biodegradable plastics are 
defaultcompostable. This may lead to contamination of the composting waste-stream with 
defaultoxo
default-degradable plastics. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBiodegradation of 
defaultoxo
default-degradable plastics can only occur after they have fragmented and then proceeds very slowly, for example, at a rate many times slower than that of a compostable plastic.
default

defaultOxo
default-degradable plastics are 
defaultnot suitable for recycling with main-stream plastics.default The 
defaultrecyclate
default will contain 
defaultoxo
default-degradable additives that will render the product more susceptible to degradation.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLitter  defaultSome 
defaultoxo
default-degradable producers maintain that their products are a solution to the littering problem because 
defaultoxo
default-degradable packaging will eventually degrade and then biodegrade. However, as the plastics will not degrade for approximately 2-5 years, they will still remain visible as litter before they start to degrade.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother review 
defaultpublished recently in Environmental Science and Technology
default by a group of scientists including the polymer science division of the Indian Institute of Technology, finds that “degradable 
defaultpolyethylenes
default,“ used in one type of “recyclable” plastic bag, do not really disintegrate back into nature. The 
defaultpolyethylenes
default in the plastic bags studied are made by adding metals such as iron and cobalt to the mix of ethylene polymers, to speed
default up their oxidation. 
defaultBut while such hybrid plastic bags once discarded, do indeed break into fragments relatively quickly, those shreds persist for a long timdefaulte.default

default. 
defaultThis 
defaultrecent 
defaultreport states
default: 
default“the results show that 
defaultedefaultven in quantities as low as 2% defaultdegradable plastic films cause significant, detrimental impacts to the quality of defaultplastic defaultrecyclatesdefault. These impacts are not only detrimental in terms of mechanical properties of the recycled material, but also involve visual impacts on the newly produced film”.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this report, MEPs are calling for a phase out and/or 
defaultbandefault of 
defaultoxo
default-degradable materials
default – paragraph 
default5 of the Report
default states
default: 
default“T
defaulthe most dangerous plastics, those that by scientific evidence are shown to be the 
defaultmost disruptive to human health and the environment (such as micro- and defaultoxodefault-biodegradable plasticsdefault) and those which contain 
defaultheavy metals and other substances that can also make recycling processes more difficult, should be phased out of the market or banned outrightdefault, as soon as possible before 2020 to develop a market for reused and recycled materials
default”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also concerned that certain manufacturers of degradable materials have been making misleading statements. We urge the Government to look at the underlying science 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrentl
defaulty, we can effectively recycle plastic film from 
defaultcarrier bags and other secondary packaging many times, creating a “closed loop of polymer recycling” and contrib
defaultuting to the circular economy. The 
defaultproposal to promote a 
defaultdegradable 
defaultplastic bag would have potentially disastrous consequences for the nascent plastic recycling industry in the UK. 
defaultC
defaultustomers require a premium recycled material that has virtually the same properties as virgin polymer. Mixing degradable polymers with standard 
defaultpolyth
defaultene 
defaultfeedstocks
default would result in premature degradation of the end product. This may manifest as a lack of impact or tensile strength, or an inability to process 
defaultaltogether as the resulting polymer matrix can potentially cause cross-linking, rendering impossible further processing into film or 
defaultother 
defaultproducts.

default 
defaultCustomers of recycled polymers want to manufacture a robust and reliable end product that will endure – they will not take the risk of their end product failing. Inclusion of bio
default or 
defaultoxo
default 
defaultdegradable bags in the waste stream will make them refuse to include recycled materials in their product. This will cause substantial increases in carbon footprint by a return to virgin materials made from petrochemicals.
default 
defaultAs a result defaultthe UK government will fail to meet its stringent plastic recycling targets set for 2017. default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, if consumers believe that plastic bags will degrade, then the litter problem will in fact worsen. 
defaultConsumers will see this “solution” as a defaultlicencedefault to litterdefault. There is no magic bullet – there is no magical material that will vanish once you have carried your groceries home. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn fact
default we should be promoting recovery of the carrier bag waste stream, to be recycled back into new products, rather than simply thrown away to degrade. The UK Government should be encouraging recovery of this and other 
defaultwaste resources 
defaultback into a recovery loop, also creating jobs in the UK. 
defaultThe APSRG's has very recently published a new report, Chaired by Caroline 
defaultSpelman
default MP, that makes clear recommendations for policy change designed to ensure the UK maximizes value from its waste. We would encourage you to read this important document. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also worth considering evidence from other parts of the world:
default&#xa0;
defaultUSA    defaultIn the USA, there are proposed laws for several states which will require compostable or biodegradable containers &amp; packaging to be labeled 
default“not recyclable, do not recycle”default (Senate Bill 298). The laws aim to prevent contamination of the recycled plastic stream and protect a progressive industry which adds $3 billion of value to the economies of the states involved. These conflicting messages to the consumer create more problems for recyclers, and diminish the faith that people have in the feedstock and products that are made from it. Further, many of the compostable polymers are actually only degraded when subject to high temperatures or a specialist environment. Simply putting them in a garden rubbish pile will not activate the additives used and the bag or receptacle will still be around for years. According to the California Organics Institute: 
default“the term biodegradable does not distinguish between a product that biodegrades in the soil in a thousand years, and one that biodegrades in a compost pile in 180 days.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultCanada     defaultThe City of Toronto has very strict procedures, according to their website: 
default“The City of Toronto 
defaultdoes notdefault accept
default&#xa0;
defaultbiodegradable plastic packaging, including biodegradable plastic bags in the Green Bin organics or
default&#xa0;
defaultthe
default&#xa0;
defaultBlue Bin
default&#xa0;
defaultrecycling programs
default.”  The reasons for not accepting this material include:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBiodegradable plastics are removeddefault&#xa0;defaultduringdefault&#xa0;defaultorganics processing.default 
defaultThere is no benefit or point for residents to add biodegradable plastic bags or packaging (i.e. snack food bags promoted to be compostable) into the Green Bin. All bags and packaging
default&#xa0;
defaultare removed at the beginning of Toronto's organics processing system. 
defaultThese products
default&#xa0;
defaultare not in the system long enough to break down
default. The 
defaultequipment used cannot distinguish between a compostable/biodegradable bag or package from ones that are not, so all are removed and treated as residue garbage sent to landfill

default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBiodegradable plastics can ruin recycling markets.default 
defaultThe plastics we recycle are used to manufacture new products such as landscape edging, decking and automotive parts. These products are manufactured to be durable and to not break down over time. The presence of biodegradable plastics puts the durability of these products with recycled plastic content in peril. 
defaultThe markets which buy waste plastic from municipal Blue Bin programs refuse to buy any material which may contain any bio-plastics
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBiodegradable plastics can put marketed recyclables revenue at risk.default 
default&#xa0;defaultIt is crucial that the integrity of our plastic recycling contracts remain intact. The City generates over $20 Million per year from the sale of recyclables to help offset the cost of collecting recyclables. Bio plastics put a portion of this revenue at risk. “
defaultIt is worth noting that where singlet bags have been levied in other countries, 
defaultthere is always an increase in the purchase of 
defaultboth thicker bags for life and of 
defaultblack refuse sacks, which require more plastic resin. This has happened in a number of other countries. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that Lord de 
defaultMauley
default used this argument recently in May 2013
default, quoting from an a
defaultrticle 
defaulton L
defaultetsrecycle.com
default: 
defaultThe Republic of Ireland’s levy had had the unintended consequence of causing an increase in sales of bin liners “because consumers no longer used free carrier bags to line their bins,” the minister said. “The production of bin liners has a bigger environmental impact than single-use carrier bags. In addition, following the introduction of the charge in Wales there was an increase in sales of bags for life. “As the aim of a charge is to reduce use, it could result in a worse environmental outcome if they are used only once or twice, because they need to be used at least four times to have a lower carbon footprint than single-use carrier bags”.defaultAs such, we suggest that a better solution would be to give an 
defaultexemption (or partial exemption) for bags that have been made from recycled plastic.default These bags have a much better carbon footprint and can themselves be recycled. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also very surprised to see a suggestion that paper bags might also be exempted from the levy. Paper bags have a far worse environmental impact that plastic carrier bags – see 
defaultEnvironment Agency, Life Cycle Assessment of supermarket carrier bags, 2011 (Report: SC030148). 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultsummary, the 
defaultpromotion of degradable 
defaultbags would be a disaster for recycling programs and we strongly believe that the best solution is to improve the infrastructure for recycling and reprocessing of carrier bags and
default 
defaultother consumer packaging films.
