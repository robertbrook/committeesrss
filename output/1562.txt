[[[ritten evidence submitted by Alan Ritchie]]]&#xa0;The views presented here are entirely my own. They are informed by over 30 years experience in a NI based bank, an element of academic challenge and a long term interest in current affairs, business &amp; banking. &#xa0;From the late 1980’s to 2000 when I retired I worked on a number of projects including what became Post Office Financial Services, the joint venture between Bank of Ireland and Post Office. As part of the work-based element of Open University MBA I also documented several other change initiatives which I was involved in. &#xa0;My starting point is that &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Northern Ireland is not a discrete nor self- contained marketplace,&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Financial institutions do not require a physical presence in NI to service either personal or business/corporate customers. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The essentially personal/ micro-small business nature of the marketplace is not attractive to ‘challenger’ banks -Barclays came to NI when it re-branded Woolwich Building Society, my recollection is that HSBC similarly re-branded another existing group business.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Of the 4 major high street banks currently operating in NI 3 -Allied Irish/First Trust, Bank of Ireland &amp; Ulster Bank are effectively zombies and the 4th a poorly performing subsidiary of a Danish bank&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The future structure &amp; governance of banking in NI will be largely dictated by the outworking of EC/EU State Aids programmes, not solely by bank management or national politicians. Local politicians will struggle to find effective voices.&#xa0;

[[[The structure &amp; governance of banks in Northern Ireland]]]&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The four major high street banks operating in NI all are owned externally. 2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local management has limited discretion and is more likely to be involved in administering Group /Corporate policy set in Dublin, Copenhagen or London/Edinburgh. 3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Core policy making such as Group Credit Risk management/ IT infrastructure / capital allocation across business units/ customer segmentation &amp; marketing policies are all in effect set outside NI. 4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Three of the four high street banks are subject to EC/EU State Aid restructuring programmes restricting or constraining their freedom of action at policy making level.5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although Santander for example has a high street presence its NI business customers will have their accounts handled by business banking centres in Glasgow or Newport or London in exactly the same way as any other customer anywhere in the UK and subject to exactly the same terms &amp; conditions, charges eligibility &amp; lending criteria. 6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The major issue in NI banking is that, bar the Progressive Building Society, there are no locally headquartered financial services business and therefore no local control of policy.7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The NI banking market has traditionally operated on the basis of cross-border / all-Ireland structures. 8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This model is now effectively dead largely for reasons of politics &amp; economic nationalism arising out of the need for EU/ECB funding to rescue both the Irish banks &amp; state. 9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This situation arose out of a failure of regulation leading Irish banks to over-extend themselves both domestically &amp; externally.10)&#xa0; This mistake will not be repeated, political and public opinion will not tolerate regulators in ROI allowing the major tax-payer rescued ‘pillar’ banks allocating scare capital to support business in outside the state at the expense of business &amp; individuals within the state.11)&#xa0; There will also be political, business public &amp; social pressure on ROI banks to focus on their domestic market and support local economic growth and development. This is not a narrow political point. In the UK we see the mirror image of this in the withdrawal of RBS/Lloyds for example from overseas markets and market segments nationally &amp; internationally.12)&#xa0; We must also recognize the different political &amp; legislative trajectories within &amp; between the UK &amp; Ireland and specifically issues arising from regulatory developments within the Eurozone sub-set of countries within the EU and the UK focus on re-negotiations/ opt-outs/ subsidiarity etc.13)&#xa0; The practical consequences for NI are likely to be concentration of banking in fewer players, less choice, less competition and higher costs. &#xa0;

[[[The possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bank.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]14)&#xa0; Resolution of this issue is not solely or even substantially in the hands of RBS management nor UK politicians - something which seems almost entirely missing from much public debate! 15)&#xa0; You should note that the EC has recently allowed Bank of Ireland to retain an insurance operation in Republic of Ireland which it had previously decided should be disposed of as a condition of State Aid. The EC rationale for this was that there were no realistic buyers for the business in the market.16)&#xa0; The quid pro quo is that BOI must shed its corporate &amp; business banking activities in GB either through run-down or by sale although it is able to retain those in NI. The NI businesses are now exposed in that there will be loss of scope &amp; scale in service provision.17)&#xa0; It should also be noted that the BoI is now focusing on serving personal business only in GB through Post Office Financial Services (POFS) delivered through PO branches &amp; supported by centralised deposit &amp; lending administration and on-line banking 18)&#xa0; The precedent has also been set &amp; the next revision of State Aid for BoI (&amp; there will almost inevitably be one) could require the disposal of its NI corporate &amp; business banking. This would leave the rump of its personal business which could be serviced via POFS. 19)&#xa0; The bank stake in POFS is a saleable asset in the last resort &amp; is now a hostage to fortune in that disposal may be mandated by EC/EU. The possibility of BoI exiting NI is no longer unthinkable.20)&#xa0; I cannot comment on the status of Allied Irish/First Trust businesses other than to note that there were apparently no buyers when the business was put on the market a number of years ago. Given that Allied Irish remains subject to EC/EU State Aids considerations then that business may also be vulnerable regardless of public positions taken by management.21)&#xa0; In this context the price of future State Aid approvals for RBS may well be disposal of at least the Ulster Bank business in RoI regardless of the ‘good bank/bad bank’ arguments propounded by politicians/RBS executive management/board.22)&#xa0; EC rules cannot however prevent individual customers opting to remain with their current bank regardless of whether or not ’their branch’ is sold. 23)&#xa0; The best forward-looking solution would seem to be to encourage the full absorption of the Ulster Bank NI business into RBS proper where it would benefit from the full resources of RBS unmediated by a ‘local’ headquarters.24)&#xa0; Given the lack of buyers for more substantial branch networks being disposed of by both Lloyds &amp; RBS disposal of the Ulster Bank business in NI would not seem to be a realistic option.&#xa0;

[[[The position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]]]&#xa0;25)&#xa0; I do not know enough about this issue to comment but difficult to see as a significant forward-looking issue, unfortunate as it may be for the individuals involved. Matters would seem to revolve around employment law &amp; the basis on which Anglo Irish/IBRC operated in the UK &#xa0;

[[[initiatives to help aid economic recovery]]]

[[[6 Lack of availability of detailed regional lending data]]]&#xa0;26)&#xa0; I regard these issues as being intimately linked. 27)&#xa0; My recollection is that the NI banks were never more than ‘bit players’ in national ’trade’ bodies such as British Bankers Association/APACs etc.28)&#xa0; Given their scope &amp; scale they would tend to be policy takers rather than makers.29)&#xa0; For that reason I suspect that national initiatives would receive only ‘lip service’ - the minimum necessary &amp; no more. Stats will show that use of for example SFLGS by NI banks was pathetic, the preference being to focus on own in-house products rather than develop the processes &amp; practices &amp; staff training necessary to support such initiatives, such lack of support in turn stifled demand - a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy in a sense!30)&#xa0; My understanding is that much business lending remains in effect asset backed lending, security over assets first then looking at profitability &amp; repayment capacity 31)&#xa0; For so long as there is a significant overhang of property, whether warehoused in NAMA or elsewhere, then property values will remain under pressure and represent a significant constraint on business lending. 32)&#xa0; In these circumstances access to national initiatives based for example on partial Govt guarantees for otherwise unsecured &amp; cash-flow based business lending will remain essential. 33)&#xa0; The overwhelming proportion of businesses in NI are in the micro to small category and more likely to benefit from or require cash-flow based rather than asset backed lending. Past experience of SFLGS does not offer much comfort in this respect.34)&#xa0; I think the point needs to be made that ‘SME’s’ are not a single market with common needs. 35)&#xa0; Many SME’s in the micro to small category will be largely locally orientated with substantial demand for transaction handling services - cash/ cheques/card payments - which are expensive to provide and largely unprofitable for banks36)&#xa0; Any borrowing requirements will be relatively small and only marginally profitable once all admin &amp; overhead costs are considered 37)&#xa0; Paradoxically many large businesses operating in NI will have similar profile - transaction-based needs for electronic payments of salaries &amp; wages, suppliers, &amp; receipt of payments with minimum local overnight balances with borrowings /deposits largely managed by corporate treasury &amp; held in GB based branches38)&#xa0; Businesses in the small to medium category are likely to have the more complex needs not just for transaction services but cash flow lending (overdrafts) and capital investment (term loans/ equity/venture capital finance, trade related financing. 39)&#xa0; This should /could be a profitable mix for banks but unfortunately banks have spent the last 20 years or so paying extolling the virtues of relationship banking whilst at the same time promoting financial promiscuity - by which I mean offering stand-alone products to non-current account holders.40)&#xa0; Whilst this promiscuity does bring competition to the market it also fractures the ‘relationship’ model with no bank having a clear overall picture of business needs hence driving the imperative for asset based lending and even then there may be differing views as to which lender has prior claim over which assets, all of which acts to constrain lending limits41)&#xa0; There is no excuse for excluding lending from the proposed post code reporting. How will direct banks with no physical presence in NI report their figures? 42)&#xa0; If Santander/Tesco/Sainsbury /M&amp;S/First Direct/ for example all report their UK lending by post code then the ’unclassified’ stuff could be considered NI by default (I know it won’t be that simple but deduction by exception is possible!) 43)&#xa0; Regional lending data must be made available otherwise public policy making will occur in a partial vacuum and risks being uninformed. 44)&#xa0; Likewise banks themselves will be acting in a vacuum, making assumptions about the potential market for financial services which may not be realistic (there are both upsides &amp; downsides to this)&#xa0;

[[[mmunities]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]45)&#xa0; This is I am afraid essentially yesterday’s issue.46)&#xa0; Branches have been closing for years &amp; the trend - visible across the UK &amp; Europe - will continue and indeed is accelerating. I believe that recent stats based on research by a UK university confirm this but may not show that rural communities are being anymore affected by this than deprived urban communities.47)&#xa0; It needs to be recognized that the role of the branch has changed over the years, currently configured largely as ‘sales outlets’ even that function is becoming redundant with much marketing/sales /account servicing being done remotely by phone /on-line or social media. Salaries &amp; wages &amp; benefits have been paid electronically for decades. It is stated Govt policy to encourage payment into accounts – the basic bank account is an outrun of this. Financial inclusion policy is about bank accounts for all not dependence on cash transactions.48)&#xa0; An increasing number of transactions are by card &amp; card technology is changing almost by the day. No-one any more has a need to visit a branch49)&#xa0; Recent entrants to the NI personal financial services market - Tesco, Sainsbury &amp; M&amp; S for example- use their supermarket outlets as service points.50)&#xa0; The example of the BOI /Post Office joint venture is relevant here with cash transactions available through Post Offices/ATM‘s etc, not branches. 51)&#xa0; All other services including accounting transaction processing, credit scoring for personal lending including mortgages, personal loans &amp; credit cards can be centralised &amp; handled remotely.52)&#xa0; Even business lending seems increasingly based on ’credit scoring’ principles.53)&#xa0; It is strange to note however than in respect of investment advice ‘past performance is no guarantee of or guide to future performance’ whereas behaviour based credit scoring relies precisely on extrapolating past performance to predict future behaviour54)&#xa0; ‘Relationship banking’ no longer seems to require face to face contact being replaced by contact by phone/internet/social media channels - the traditional branch has no future and only a limited lifespan.55)&#xa0; The issue should really be about adapting to new reality rather than preserving the past.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
