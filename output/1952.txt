[[[Evidence]]]Lessons of Iraq before Libya.In deciding the most appropriate instrument for action, we will need to balance two factors: legitimacy, and effectiveness. These factors tend to work in opposite directions. The United Nations, for example, confers the ultimate legitimacy on any multilateral action. But the very process of securing that legitimacy can undermine its effectiveness – as we saw, for example, in the Balkans. … [L]egitimacy means more than going through the right channels.Lessons of Libya before Syria.&#xa0;The Syria crisis10 September 2013     &#xa0;&#xa0; Jason Ralph, ‘No longer special?

Ralph ‘No longer special?’ Between March 28th and 30th 2003 a poll for Populus revealed 61% agreed with the statement the UK should not have gone to war without UN backing. Between June 5th and 7th 2007 a Channel 4/You Gov poll showed only 22% agreed that there were times the UK should send troops abroad to defeat tyranny within another country without UN.  This figure went up to 51% with UN backing.
