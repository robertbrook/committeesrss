"&#xa0;\nGeoff Eyre â€“ Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCan you send my concerns to the \noffroading\n \ncommittee.\n&#xa0;\nI enclose photos of damage caused and the Peak National Park \nseem\n to allow is to continue?\n&#xa0;\nI farm an upland area and the \ntracks to the moor was\n a green lane and one could drive an escort van around when visiting stock. (\nonly\n 15 years ago) now even a hard walk\n&#xa0;\nThe routes used are basically drover routes and now 4x4 s quad bikes and trials bikes come in their 100s and are wrecking the place.\n&#xa0;\nThe Planning committee promised a TRO once they had the powers to close and now \nthats\n years ago.\n&#xa0;\nPlease get the area around \nBrough\n and \nShatton\n as restricted (farm and access to land only)\n&#xa0;\nI have had to stop complaining as I have seen retaliation by \noffroaders\n knocking my walls down, I take photos and am often chased by trespassing offenders (a dodgy job instructed by the Police ? ) , as a farmer if we did any land damage it would \neffect\n our single farm payment on environmental reasons.\n&#xa0;\nThe Planning authority should plan and find sites for the \noffroaders\n to play on, good sites could become a business and then taxed rather than the 85 k the DCC have just paid out to repair (just sections)\n&#xa0;\n9 September 13\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
