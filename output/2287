[normal]THE EXTENT OF WHITE W[bold]ORKING CLASS PUPILS’ EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT[bold]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Pre-
[normal]2013 data
[normal] show that White
[normal] British
[normal] pupils do less well than their peers 
[normal]in Leicester and are over-
[normal]represented 
[normal]amongst 
[normal]pupils
[normal] 
[normal]falling in the lowest
[normal] 20% performance 
[normal]band for the LA, with increasingly more FSM pupils represented (2010 - 23%, 2011-26%, 
[normal]2012-27%) than non-FSM. In 2013 fewer disadvantaged White British pupils were at a good level of development in all prime areas plus literacy and maths (25%) than their non-disadvantaged peers (35.1%).

[normal]At Key S
[normal]tage 2 
[normal]the
[normal] performance of White British pupils
[normal] 
[normal]is a
[normal] concern. 
[normal]The five year trend of the performance in 
[normal]r
[normal]eadin
[normal]g, 
[normal]w
[normal]riting and 
[normal]m
[normal]aths from 2009
[normal]-13 shows a consistent gap in performance between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged
[normal] White 
[normal]British pupils
[normal] 
[normal]overall.
[normal] 
[normal]In 2013 the gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged
[normal] White British pupils was 16
[normal]% for
[normal] reading, 17% for writing and 15% for Maths.
[normal] 
[normal]In 2012 
[normal]84% 
[normal]of FSM
[normal] 
[normal]White British 
[normal]boys made expected progress 
[normal]in English 
[normal]compared to 89% 
[normal]of pupils nationally. Although this was an improvement on last year’s progress in English for FSM pupils (73%)
[normal],
[normal] it still fell short of the LA percentage of 91% and the FSM White British girls’ 
[normal]percentage of
[normal] 88% (Figure Five).
[normal] 
[normal]Equally
[normal],
[normal] White disadvantaged b
[normal]oys perform less well than the
[normal]ir peers nationally for Level 4
[normal]+ in English and 
[normal]Maths. Therefore
[normal], when the White British group is considered as a whole
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]both girls and boys perform less well than their peers nationally and boys perform less well than girls o
[normal]verall (S.Welford

[normal]In 2012 there was a notable 
[normal]difference between
[normal] the percentage of 
[normal]WWC
[normal] boys on FSM making expected progress in English (41%) when compared to their peers (70%) and to national (67%) and local (71%) 
[normal]percentages. White
[normal] working class girls’ expected progress in English in 2012 (57%) equally fell short of that of their peers
[normal] (81
[normal]%) and 
[normal]of local and national
[normal] percentages. In Maths, the percentages for expected progress were of even greater concern with only 37% of White British boys 
[normal]eligible for
[normal] FSM making expected progress compared to 58% of non-disadvantaged boys and 62% of pupils
[normal] at LA level and 68% of pupils nationally. For White girls in receipt of FSM the figure was 41%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The gap in attainme
[normal]nt increases across the Key stages and by 19 it is significant.
[normal] Prior attainment at Key S
[normal]tage 4 impacts on student performance at Key stage 5.
[normal] 
[normal]At Key Stage 5 females attain consistently better than males and White British males are amongst the groups that 
[normal]consistently perform
[normal] 
[normal]less well
[normal]. 
[normal]For one very large group of Leicester young people – White boys – almost one half fail to attain Level Two by age 19 after
[normal] five
[normal] years of secondary education and, for many, a further three years in post-16 education and train
[normal]in
[normal]g 
[normal]The future for these under-attaining groups is bleak
[normal], risking unemployment and low paid work.
[normal](
[normal] 
[normal]A.Suddaby, 
[normal]The Leices
[normal]ter 13-19 P
[normal]artnership board,19 January 2012
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Students will not improve their attainment
[normal] if they are not participating in the education and training system available. In August 2013 13.2% of White British students were NEET. Such pupils who already had low attainment at Key Stage 4 will fall further behind peers the longer the
[normal]y remain NEET (A
[normal].Suddaby, 2012)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Different progression 
[normal]and repetition 
[normal]rates are exhibited by different ethnic groups
[normal] which impact on their attainment at 19
[normal]. 
[normal]90% of Asian females who attain level 2 at 16 progress directly to a level 3 qu
[normal]alification whereas only approximately 50% of White males do so
[normal]. 
[normal]Instead
[normal],
[normal] a
[normal] higher number of White males repeat level 2 qualifications post-16
[normal] (most often by studying a vocational qualification)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]delaying their entry to level 3 and 
[normal] thus  reducing 
[normal]the pote
[normal]ntial of attaining this level by the age of 19 (
[normal]A.
[normal]Suddaby, 2012 - 
[normal]see Figure Six).
[normal] 
[normal]Two thirds 
[normal]of Asian females who attain Level One at 16 progress to Level Two.  Conversely, only about 20% (one in five) White males make this progression
[normal],
[normal] with four out of f
[normal]ive remaining at Level One
[normal] (A.Suddaby,
[normal] 
[normal]2012)
[normal].

[normal]H
[normal]aving started behind, White British males 
[normal]fall further behind their peers over the course of their three years between 16 and 19.  The outcome is that almost a half of the young people 
[normal]in 
[normal]2010 
[normal]failed
[normal] to attain even a Level Two after up to 14 years in t
[normal]he education system (A.Suddaby
[normal], 2012
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are a number of factors that impact on pupils’ attainment.
[normal] Non-attendance at school either by choic
[normal]e or because of exclusions will impact 
[normal]on learning and subsequently on attainment. Excl
[normal]usi
[normal]ons data for the White g
[normal]roup of which 
[normal]White British is a large subset shows that generally this group is more likely to be excluded from school than other 
[normal]ethnicities. 
[normal]2012 to
[normal] 2013 data shows 
[normal]that, of
[normal] the population of pupils excluded from school, b
[normal]oys
[normal] 
[normal]are more likely to be excluded whatever the 
[normal]ethnicity and
[normal] White female FSM have higher numbers of exclusions when compared to all other ethnicities’ cumulative 
[normal]dat
[normal]a.
[normal]              
[normal]It is no coincidence that the lowest performing schools in Leicester are in 
[normal]the west of Leicester.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Responses from local schools suggest
[normal] programmes to raise aspirations, improve self-esteem as well as academic intervention
[normal].
