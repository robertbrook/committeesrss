defaultFuture UK and EU food security cannot be considered in isolation from global food security
default. 
defaultIt is essential, therefore, that this EFRA committee inquiry takes full account of the
default 
defaultreport and 
defaultrecommendations of the
default inquiry into Global Food Security that was conducted by the International Development Committee 
default(‘IDC’) 
defaultearlier this year
default. 
defaultThe main points from the Food Ethics Council’s submission to the IDC inquiry were summarised as follows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultWe would particularly stress the first of the above points, which applies equally to domestic and global food security, and underpins the Food Ethics Council’s approach to the question of food security. 
defaultThe world current
defaultly produces more than enough food to feed the population, but around a billion people are still living in hunger
default. 
defaultThis doesn’t mean that measures to increase food production and productivity have no place in addressing global food insecurity – they clearly
default do – but it does mean that the central priority for successful efforts to reduce hunger and improve food security must be to tackle inequality.
default&#xa0;
default5. In the UK context, this means that levels of social security benefits, and of wages, need to be high enough
default to enable all members of society to afford healthy, sustainable diet
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultOne of the most glaring inefficiencies of resource use is using crops that could be used to feed people to feed animals instead
default. 
defaultThis is not only a grossly inefficient way of provi
defaultding people with the protein they need, it is also a major factor in the adverse environmental impact of today’s food system.
default However, we recognise that livestock farming and meat eating (in moderation) can deliver benefits, which is why we advocate ‘less 
defaultand better’ meat consumption.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultIt is widely recognised that food prices do not currently reflect the full social and environmental costs of food production and consumption
default. 
defaultThis is
default generally seen as creating an impossible dilemma for policy-makers
default. 
defaultOn the one hand, we surely cannot continue to ignore the massive, and increasing,
default cost to the NHS of dealing with diet-related illness (for example); or,
default to take another example
default from the 
defaultenvironmental perspective, the cost of dealing with the pollution of our water system as a result of current approaches to agricultural production
default. 
defaultOn the other hand, however, we 
defaultalready have a very serious problem of food security among the UK population,
default so any measure that might exacerbate that problem – such as pushing up food prices so that they reflect these wider social and environmental costs – seems an equally untenable option.
default&#xa0;
default8. We suggest that there are two 
defaultconsiderations that point the way tow
defaultards resolving this dilemma:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9. 
defaultThe first point that we would make on this issue is that we do
default&#xa0;
defaultnot feel that this question is well framed by linking science to GM technology directly, and that it therefore risks intr
defaultoducing an unhelpfully narrow focus into the committee’s deliberations. We think that it would be more helpful for the committee to address the broader question about 'The potential value and contribution of science to UK food security' separately from any
default discussion of one specific application of knowledge arising from that science such as GM food and feed.
default&#xa0;
default10. 
defaultIn debates about different ways of delivering food security, GM food and feed is often considered. At the Food Ethics Council, we are open to 
defaultexploring a range of options that move us towards a world where all eat healthily and sustainably, enjoying food that is produced and traded fairly and humanely. However, we think it is essential that GM is not regarded as 'the default option', whereby the
default discussion focuses exclusively on the merits or demerits of GM food and feed. There are many other areas of science around soils and agronomy, for example, that may be equally important for underpinning sustainable food production systems, but which are g
defaultiven much less attention than we believe they merit.
default&#xa0;
default11. 
defaultIn exploring the potential contribution of different technologies, our view is that there is no such thing as a ‘good technology’ or a ‘bad technology’. It is the application of the technology, rath
defaulter than the technology itself, that should be of concern. In considering different technologies, we believe it is important to address questions such as (i) who has or will have what power and control over the technologies developed and (ii) who gets the b
defaultenefits and who carries the risks from the technologies being used – or to put it another way, who does the technology empower and disempower?
default&#xa0;
default12. 
defaultIn relation to food and agricultural research more broadly (including more specifically in relation to novel
default technologies), we feel it is essential that we have a strong publicly funded research effort to balance and complement commercial sector research.
default&#xa0;
default13. 
defaultOn the general question of the potential value and contribution of science in relation to food security
default,
default&#xa0;
defaultwe think that science has a considerable role to play. In noting that, we should also recognize that there are other important factors that contribute to food security (or insecurity). These include geo-political shifts, the way governments and societies
default respond to the growing pressures brought about by the need to adapt to the effects of climate destabilisation, competition for resources and growing inequality – all of which could disrupt existing trading patterns, supply chains, growing conditions and l
defaultead to conflicts. Science has a role in providing greater understanding of how to respond to these but gives no guarantee that we have the wisdom to choose to do the right thing with that knowledge. Here much depends on the research agenda being pursued an
defaultd the key questions that should be asked of any technological application of the increasing knowledge arising from human endeavour.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default14. 
defaultIn short, no. Th
defaultere are a number of reasons why climate change risks should be better incorporated into UK food security strategies and planning, which include:

defaultOn the basis of the Food Ethics Council’s recent work, the 
defaultfu
defaultndamental problem
default for small farmers
default is that power imbalances mean they can
defaultno
defaultt get a fair price for their produce
default. 
defaultThis adversely impacts
