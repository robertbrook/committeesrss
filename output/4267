[normal]The Food Ethics Council is a charity that provides independent advice on the ethics of food and farming. Our aim is to create
[normal] a food system that is fair and healthy for people and the environment. In pursuit of this aim, we:

[normal] members of the Food Ethics Council are all leaders in their relevant fields, and appointed as individuals. They bring a broad range of expertise to our work, from academic research through to practical knowledge of farming, business and po
[normal]licy.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]Future UK and EU food security cannot be considered in isolation from global food security
[normal]. 
[normal]It is essential, therefore, that this EFRA committee inquiry takes full account of the
[normal] 
[normal]report and 
[normal]recommendations of the
[normal] inquiry into Global Food Security that was conducted by the International Development Committee 
[normal](‘IDC’) 
[normal]earlier this year
[normal]. 
[normal]The main points from the Food Ethics Council’s submission to the IDC inquiry were summarised as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]We would particularly stress the first of the above points, which applies equally to domestic and global food security, and underpins the Food Ethics Council’s approach to the question of food security. 
[normal]The world current
[normal]ly produces more than enough food to feed the population, but around a billion people are still living in hunger
[normal]. 
[normal]This doesn’t mean that measures to increase food production and productivity have no place in addressing global food insecurity – they clearly
[normal] do – but it does mean that the central priority for successful efforts to reduce hunger and improve food security must be to tackle inequality.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. In the UK context, this means that levels of social security benefits, and of wages, need to be high enough
[normal] to enable all members of society to afford healthy, sustainable diet
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]One of the most glaring inefficiencies of resource use is using crops that could be used to feed people to feed animals instead
[normal]. 
[normal]This is not only a grossly inefficient way of provi
[normal]ding people with the protein they need, it is also a major factor in the adverse environmental impact of today’s food system.
[normal] However, we recognise that livestock farming and meat eating (in moderation) can deliver benefits, which is why we advocate ‘less 
[normal]and better’ meat consumption.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]It is widely recognised that food prices do not currently reflect the full social and environmental costs of food production and consumption
[normal]. 
[normal]This is
[normal] generally seen as creating an impossible dilemma for policy-makers
[normal]. 
[normal]On the one hand, we surely cannot continue to ignore the massive, and increasing,
[normal] cost to the NHS of dealing with diet-related illness (for example); or,
[normal] to take another example
[normal] from the 
[normal]environmental perspective, the cost of dealing with the pollution of our water system as a result of current approaches to agricultural production
[normal]. 
[normal]On the other hand, however, we 
[normal]already have a very serious problem of food security among the UK population,
[normal] so any measure that might exacerbate that problem – such as pushing up food prices so that they reflect these wider social and environmental costs – seems an equally untenable option.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. We suggest that there are two 
[normal]considerations that point the way tow
[normal]ards resolving this dilemma:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. 
[normal]The first point that we would make on this issue is that we do
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]not feel that this question is well framed by linking science to GM technology directly, and that it therefore risks intr
[normal]oducing an unhelpfully narrow focus into the committee’s deliberations. We think that it would be more helpful for the committee to address the broader question about 'The potential value and contribution of science to UK food security' separately from any
[normal] discussion of one specific application of knowledge arising from that science such as GM food and feed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]In debates about different ways of delivering food security, GM food and feed is often considered. At the Food Ethics Council, we are open to 
[normal]exploring a range of options that move us towards a world where all eat healthily and sustainably, enjoying food that is produced and traded fairly and humanely. However, we think it is essential that GM is not regarded as 'the default option', whereby the
[normal] discussion focuses exclusively on the merits or demerits of GM food and feed. There are many other areas of science around soils and agronomy, for example, that may be equally important for underpinning sustainable food production systems, but which are g
[normal]iven much less attention than we believe they merit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. 
[normal]In exploring the potential contribution of different technologies, our view is that there is no such thing as a ‘good technology’ or a ‘bad technology’. It is the application of the technology, rath
[normal]er than the technology itself, that should be of concern. In considering different technologies, we believe it is important to address questions such as (i) who has or will have what power and control over the technologies developed and (ii) who gets the b
[normal]enefits and who carries the risks from the technologies being used – or to put it another way, who does the technology empower and disempower?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. 
[normal]In relation to food and agricultural research more broadly (including more specifically in relation to novel
[normal] technologies), we feel it is essential that we have a strong publicly funded research effort to balance and complement commercial sector research.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. 
[normal]On the general question of the potential value and contribution of science in relation to food security
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]we think that science has a considerable role to play. In noting that, we should also recognize that there are other important factors that contribute to food security (or insecurity). These include geo-political shifts, the way governments and societies
[normal] respond to the growing pressures brought about by the need to adapt to the effects of climate destabilisation, competition for resources and growing inequality – all of which could disrupt existing trading patterns, supply chains, growing conditions and l
[normal]ead to conflicts. Science has a role in providing greater understanding of how to respond to these but gives no guarantee that we have the wisdom to choose to do the right thing with that knowledge. Here much depends on the research agenda being pursued an
[normal]d the key questions that should be asked of any technological application of the increasing knowledge arising from human endeavour.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. 
[normal]In short, no. Th
[normal]ere are a number of reasons why climate change risks should be better incorporated into UK food security strategies and planning, which include:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. 
[normal]On the basis of the Food Ethics Council’s recent work, the 
[normal]fu
[normal]ndamental problem
[normal] for small farmers
[normal] is that power imbalances mean they can
[normal]no
[normal]t get a fair price for their produce
[normal]. 
[normal]This adversely impacts

[normal] food security in the following 
[normal]ways:
