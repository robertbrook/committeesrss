VEP 0002[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written Evidence Submitted by the [bold]Criminal Justice[bold] Alliance[bold] (VEP 0002[bold])[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Criminal Justice Alliance believes that all prisoners should have the right to vote, regardless of the length of their sentence. 
[normal]None of the options given in this consultation are 
[normal]entirely 
[normal]satisfactory, therefore, and they are inconsistent with successive rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). 
[normal]Voting is not a privilege but a fundamental right
[normal]. The 
[normal]disenfranchisement
[normal] 
[normal]of prisoners represents
[normal] an additional
[normal] punishment
[normal],
[normal] on top of their sentence
[normal]s handed down by the judiciary and magistrates
[normal].
[normal] The ECtHR
[normal] ruling in the case of Hirst v. UK
[normal] (2005)
[normal] found that imposing a voting ban on prisoners contravenes Protocol 1 Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
[normal]Despite repeated warnings from the Council of Europe and further judgements from the ECtHR, there has been remarkably little action since then as successive governments have prevaricated on the issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While we
[normal] we
[normal]lcome 
[normal]action being taken to introduce legislation 
[normal]on voting rights for prisoners, 
[normal]i
[normal]t is regrettable that
[normal] there is no consideration of allowing all prisoners to vote. A
[normal]ll three options 
[normal]in this consultation 
[normal]retain an automatic ban on sentenced prisoners, indiscriminate of their crime.
[normal] 
[normal]The Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe has made clear that retaining the existing ban is in breach of the Court ruling
[normal] and the Convention on Human Rights
[normal].  
[normal]Of the options in consultation, the Criminal Justice Alliance favours option A., 
[normal]while calling for an additional option of enfranchising prisoners, regardless of the length of their sentence.
[normal] Limiting the right to vote to those prisoners serv
[normal]ing less than four years is 
[normal]unlikely to survive a challenge to the European Court of Human Rights, which has recently ruled in another case that an approach base
[normal]d on sentence-length is illegal. 
[normal]There is nothing about prisoners serving longer terms that should or does make them an exception to the simple rule that voting is a right and not a privilege.
[normal] 
[normal]Indeed, it may be particularly important to ensure that prisoners serving longer sentences remain engaged with wider society while they are in prison
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When they are sent to custody
[normal],
[normal] offenders temporarily lose their liberty but they retain their status as citizens. 
[normal]C
[normal]itizens in democracies should have the right to vote as a standard and default position. 
[normal]Indeed, their status as citizens should arguably play a role in the rehabilitation of offenders. The Criminal Justice Alliance maintains that disqualifying prisoners from voting is 
[normal]an in
[normal]appropriate additional
[normal] punishment
[normal] to their sentence
[normal]. It does not act as a deterrent and serves no 
[normal]useful 
[normal]purpose
[normal] whilst damaging efforts to rehabilitate prisoners and reduce reoffending.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is mounting pressure from prisoners making claims against the government for their disenfranchisement and there is precedent in Europe for compensation being paid. 
[normal]In 2010 Mark Harper 
[normal]MP 
[normal]warned that “there is a real risk that judges will award millions of pounds in damages to be paid by our taxpayers to prisoners who have been denied the vote.”
[normal] There would potentially be a fine for breaking EU law if, as the High Court has ruled, compensaton claims are to be blocked.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There
[normal] would be no legal consequences of seeking to comply with the 
[normal]ECtHR ruling and enfranchising prisoners so as to be consistent with international legal obligations. The ban on prisoners voting is contained in the Representation of the People Act (1983) but there is no other statute which would be contravened by rescinding the ban.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There would be no significant practical problems in extending voting rights to prisoners.
[normal] 
[normal]Prisoners in custody on remand
[normal] already have the right to vote. T
[normal]he Electoral Commission has procedures in place to facilitate them doing 
[normal]so and has already 
[normal]identified 
[normal]them as hard to reach voters. The prison system, similarly, already has procedures in place for remand prisoners to vote. There is little evidence to suggest that there would be significant problems expanding these structures to allow all prisoners to vote should they want to. 
[normal]A system of postal or proxy voting was set out by the electoral commission in its response to the Ministry of Justice’s consultation in 2009. The Ministry of Justice is known to have received positive responses to its audit seeking prisoner’s interest in voting. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Martin Narey, former Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service, affirmed in 2001 that implement
[normal]ing
[normal] procedures for prisoners to vote “poses no problem for the Prison Service.”
[normal] This has been confirmed more recently by the Electoral Commission, who stated in evidence to the Ministry of Justice second consultation in 2009 that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As far as possible, any enfranchised prisoner should be treated the same as any other elector. While it may not be desirable or indeed possible for a prisoner to attend a polling station, pris
[normal]oners should be given the same 
[normal]rights to a postal or proxy vote as any absent voter who could not show that they have a good reason for not being able to attend their polling station. Furthermore, prisoners should have the right to register anonymously on the same basis as a regular voter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prisoners would vote
[normal] by post or proxy
[normal] in the constituencies in which they resided before
[normal] being sent to custody. Though p
[normal]risoners on remand cannot register at the prison address, an amendment to the Representation of the People Act (2000) enabled them to register using a declaration of local connection, allowing them to use the address where they would be living if they were not on remand or an address where they have lived in the past. This allowance could easily be made available to the rest of the prison population.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK is among only a handful of countries in Europe that enforces an automatic ban, which includes Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary and Liechtenstein. 
[normal] 
[normal]In a Commons debate in February 2011, Denis MacShane 
[normal]MP
[normal] spoke in support of the ECHR, pointing out that in other European countries the right to vote is removed according to individual sentences: “in France, a judge adds a loss of civic rights to sentences for serious crimes, which is a compromise that satisfies the European Court of Human Rights and could easily be introduced here.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All p
[normal]risoners can vote in Albania, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta,
[normal] Moldova,
[normal] 
[normal]Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine.
[normal] Recent changes in Ireland and Cyprus have modified their systems to allow convicted prisoners to vote. 
[normal] In many others, such as Portugal, Luxembourg, and Greece there is only a partial ban which excludes certain categories of prisoners from voting. 
[normal]Some countries, like France, Netherlands, and Germany, impose bans for certain crimes, such as electoral fraud.
