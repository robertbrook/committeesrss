VEP 0002default&#xa0;defaultWritten Evidence Submitted by the defaultCriminal Justicedefault Alliancedefault (VEP 0002default)default&#xa0;defaultThe Criminal Justice Alliance believes that all prisoners should have the right to vote, regardless of the length of their sentence. 
defaultNone of the options given in this consultation are 
defaultentirely 
defaultsatisfactory, therefore, and they are inconsistent with successive rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). 
defaultVoting is not a privilege but a fundamental right
default. The 
defaultdisenfranchisement
default 
defaultof prisoners represents
default an additional
default punishment
default,
default on top of their sentence
defaults handed down by the judiciary and magistrates
default.
default The ECtHR
default ruling in the case of Hirst v. UK
default (2005)
default found that imposing a voting ban on prisoners contravenes Protocol 1 Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
defaultDespite repeated warnings from the Council of Europe and further judgements from the ECtHR, there has been remarkably little action since then as successive governments have prevaricated on the issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile we

defaultlcome 
defaultaction being taken to introduce legislation 
defaulton voting rights for prisoners, 
defaulti
defaultt is regrettable that
default there is no consideration of allowing all prisoners to vote. A
defaultll three options 
defaultin this consultation 
defaultretain an automatic ban on sentenced prisoners, indiscriminate of their crime.
default 
defaultThe Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe has made clear that retaining the existing ban is in breach of the Court ruling
default and the Convention on Human Rights
default.  
defaultOf the options in consultation, the Criminal Justice Alliance favours option A., 
defaultwhile calling for an additional option of enfranchising prisoners, regardless of the length of their sentence.
default Limiting the right to vote to those prisoners serv
defaulting less than four years is 
defaultunlikely to survive a challenge to the European Court of Human Rights, which has recently ruled in another case that an approach base
defaultd on sentence-length is illegal. 
defaultThere is nothing about prisoners serving longer terms that should or does make them an exception to the simple rule that voting is a right and not a privilege.
default 
defaultIndeed, it may be particularly important to ensure that prisoners serving longer sentences remain engaged with wider society while they are in prison
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen they are sent to custody
default,
default offenders temporarily lose their liberty but they retain their status as citizens. 
defaultC
defaultitizens in democracies should have the right to vote as a standard and default position. 
defaultIndeed, their status as citizens should arguably play a role in the rehabilitation of offenders. The Criminal Justice Alliance maintains that disqualifying prisoners from voting is 
defaultan in
defaultappropriate additional
default punishment
default to their sentence
default. It does not act as a deterrent and serves no 
defaultuseful 
defaultpurpose
default whilst damaging efforts to rehabilitate prisoners and reduce reoffending.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is mounting pressure from prisoners making claims against the government for their disenfranchisement and there is precedent in Europe for compensation being paid. 
defaultIn 2010 Mark Harper 
defaultMP 
defaultwarned that “there is a real risk that judges will award millions of pounds in damages to be paid by our taxpayers to prisoners who have been denied the vote.”
default There would potentially be a fine for breaking EU law if, as the High Court has ruled, compensaton claims are to be blocked.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere
default would be no legal consequences of seeking to comply with the 
defaultECtHR ruling and enfranchising prisoners so as to be consistent with international legal obligations. The ban on prisoners voting is contained in the Representation of the People Act (1983) but there is no other statute which would be contravened by rescinding the ban.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere would be no significant practical problems in extending voting rights to prisoners.
default 
defaultPrisoners in custody on remand
default already have the right to vote. T
defaulthe Electoral Commission has procedures in place to facilitate them doing 
defaultso and has already 
defaultidentified 
defaultthem as hard to reach voters. The prison system, similarly, already has procedures in place for remand prisoners to vote. There is little evidence to suggest that there would be significant problems expanding these structures to allow all prisoners to vote should they want to. 
defaultA system of postal or proxy voting was set out by the electoral commission in its response to the Ministry of Justice’s consultation in 2009. The Ministry of Justice is known to have received positive responses to its audit seeking prisoner’s interest in voting. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin Narey, former Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service, affirmed in 2001 that implement
defaulting
default procedures for prisoners to vote “poses no problem for the Prison Service.”
default This has been confirmed more recently by the Electoral Commission, who stated in evidence to the Ministry of Justice second consultation in 2009 that:
default&#xa0;
defaultAs far as possible, any enfranchised prisoner should be treated the same as any other elector. While it may not be desirable or indeed possible for a prisoner to attend a polling station, pris
defaultoners should be given the same 
defaultrights to a postal or proxy vote as any absent voter who could not show that they have a good reason for not being able to attend their polling station. Furthermore, prisoners should have the right to register anonymously on the same basis as a regular voter.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrisoners would vote
default by post or proxy
default in the constituencies in which they resided before
default being sent to custody. Though p
defaultrisoners on remand cannot register at the prison address, an amendment to the Representation of the People Act (2000) enabled them to register using a declaration of local connection, allowing them to use the address where they would be living if they were not on remand or an address where they have lived in the past. This allowance could easily be made available to the rest of the prison population.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK is among only a handful of countries in Europe that enforces an automatic ban, which includes Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary and Liechtenstein. 
default 
defaultIn a Commons debate in February 2011, Denis MacShane 
defaultMP
default spoke in support of the ECHR, pointing out that in other European countries the right to vote is removed according to individual sentences: “in France, a judge adds a loss of civic rights to sentences for serious crimes, which is a compromise that satisfies the European Court of Human Rights and could easily be introduced here.” 
default&#xa0;
defaultAll p
defaultrisoners can vote in Albania, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta,
default Moldova,
default 
defaultMontenegro, Norway, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine.
default Recent changes in Ireland and Cyprus have modified their systems to allow convicted prisoners to vote. 
default In many others, such as Portugal, Luxembourg, and Greece there is only a partial ban which excludes certain categories of prisoners from voting. 
defaultSome countries, like France, Netherlands, and Germany, impose bans for certain crimes, such as electoral fraud.
