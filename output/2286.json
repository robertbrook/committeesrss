"RCH0007&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Children’s Services Development Group&#xa0;This briefing set\ns out the views of the Children’s Services Development Group (CSDG) regarding the Government’s planned reforms\n to the regulation of residential children’s homes. It addresses the two questions posed by the Education Select Committee: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Children’s Services Development Group (CSDG) welcomes the intention of the proposed reforms to the regulation of children’s homes, but is concerned that the narrow focus of the proposed changes will\n not be effective in ensuring that the system protects vulnerable children and acts in their best interests.\n&#xa0;\nOur concerns stem from both the exclusive focus on out-of-authority placements in children’s homes, which risks ignoring the majority of vulnerabl\ne children, and from the decision to simply increase regulation when care failings are caused by existing regulations not being followed. \n&#xa0;About CSDG&#xa0;\nThe Children’s Services Development Group is a policy coalition of leading independent providers of spec\nialist services for looked after children and young people with complex needs. Its members\n \n‒\n Acorn Care &amp; Education, Hesley Group, National Fostering Agency, Options Group,\n Priory Education Services,\n SENAD Group, Witherslack Group and Young\n Foundations \n–\nprovide services to vulnerable young people, delivering excellent outcomes and value for money across the UK.\n&#xa0;Q.1 Are the DfE’s proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes appropriate and sufficient?&#xa0;The Children’s Services \nDevelopment Group (CSDG) welcomes the intention of the proposed reforms to the regulation of children’s homes, but is concerned that the narrow focus of the proposed changes will not be effective in ensuring that the system protects vulnerable children and\n acts in their best interests.\n&#xa0;\nAll children should have safe, effective care whether in fostering, kinship care or children’s homes, and whether placed in- or out-of-area. \nMany children at risk will still be living with their birth families, as was the ca\nse in Rochdale and in Oxfordshire, and the regulation does nothing to safeguard them.\n Rather, it detracts attention from them, and so makes it less likely that abuse will be noticed and acted upon. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nDfE itself recognised that the \nexisting notification\n process is not always followed, and our concern is that whilst the intentions are good, in practice the changes will not have an impact or could in fact make it worse by delaying children and young people’s access to needed support.\n&#xa0;\nThere is nothing in t\nhe proposed reforms that makes it more likely that regulations will be implemented effectively. Where the proposed reforms are followed, they have the potential to introduce significant delay to the system. \n&#xa0;\nThe involvement of the Director of Children’s S\nervices and the need to consult the area authority should not be allowed to needlessly delay placement decisions being made, whilst the child or young person has to \nremain in a short-term placement and cope with the uncertainty of not knowing where they wi\nll be living. Target timescales for the placement decision process should be set out and consideration should be given to the impact a temporary placement will have or be having whilst decisions are being made.\n&#xa0;Below we set out our response to specific parts of the proposed reforms: \n&#xa0;Risk assessments&#xa0;CSDG would welcome clear guidance on what should be included in risk assessments, which is currently lacking. CSDG members have recently trialled risk assessments \nand have been met with very varied responses from police services and local authorities. There needs to be requirements on all parties to co-operate, not just children’s homes, for this to be effective. \n&#xa0;\nOngoing communication between agencies, not just at\n the beginning of a placement or at annual reviews, is essential. Where one party becomes aware of a risk in a local area this should be communicated to all as it arises and acted upon to safeguard all vulnerable children in the area, not just those in chi\nldren’s homes. \n&#xa0;\nWhere homes are inadequate or located in unsafe areas, this must be addressed and quickly, but the majority of children’s homes provide young people with intensive and specialist therapeutic support that will enable them to live fulfilled \nadult lives. The DfE’s own data shows that 71% of children’s homes are rated good or outstanding, and there is no direct correlation between level of deprivation and location of children’s homes. \nWhere local authorities lack provision, and so turn to out-o\nf-area placements, we would encourage them to work in partnership with providers to develop high quality provision that meets children’s needs. \n&#xa0;Distance&#xa0;\nThe focus on out-of-area placements ignores the risks to all vulnerable and looked-after children, many of whom will already have a history of neglect or abuse before entering care. All placement decisions should be carefully planned and considered, in par\ntnership between local authorities, providers and other agencies, in order to support children in safe and therapeutic environments to achieve good outcomes. \n&#xa0;\nThe most important consideration is that a placement meets the needs of a child and is in their \nbest interests. Distance is just one factor in this. Indeed, it can be necessary to use out-of-area placements in order to access specialist provision – especially \nfor looked-after children with special educational needs\n – or to remove a young people from \nharmful environment for their own protection and wellbeing.\n&#xa0;\nPlacement decisions must be in the best interests of the child, and not based on short-term costs. Research by the LGiU shows that 86% of local authorities say that achieving excellent outcomes i\ns their priority in commissioning, but for 40% or more of all placement decisions, cost is their primary concern.\n&#xa0;\nDistance in itself need not have a negative impact as long as good contact and communication between agencies is well maintained. Some local\n authorities do not establish this communication and multi-agency approach for children in-authority and the focus on out-of-area placements risks ignoring the needs of all vulnerable children.\n&#xa0;\nIn determining whether there is a ‘correct’ level of out-of-a\nrea placements, it is necessary to look at the reasons why each child is being placed out-of-area and the provision they are accessing. Where shortages in \ncapacity \nexist, local authorities should look to work with providers to develop services that, in tim\ne, will meet the needs of the local population\n, using demographic data to plan for the future\n.\n&#xa0;\nCare leavers&#xa0;\nThe presumption should always be that young people will leave care later than age\nd \n17, and any decisions for a young person to leave before that s\nhould be exceptional circumstances. Local authorities, working in partnership with providers, should regularly review the type of support young people are receiving and how this meets their current needs and prepares them for independent adult life. \n&#xa0;\nLeav\ning care is too often treated as an event, not a process. Planning for care leaving should start early and the intensity of support phased to help young people adjust to increasing levels of independence. This would help ensure corporate parents mirror the\n kind of support offered by birth families, and would improve outcomes in education, training and employment for looked-after children.\n&#xa0;\nRaising the care leaving age would be more effective\n than simply requiring sign off\n. Decisions about care leaving are \nstill too often driven by short-term cost factor and not long-term outcomes for young people.\n&#xa0;Workforce&#xa0;\nCSDG broadly welcomes the proposals to increase the quality and level of qualifications of the care workforce. \nIt is important that all looked-after c\nhildren have access to high quality care, and qualified staff is one of the key factors in achieving this. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, up-skilling the workforce will require significant resource investment and it is not clear whether Government, provider or the individual\n will be asked to meet the cost of training. In addition to this, better qualified staff will attract higher salaries, which may have a knock on impact on the cost of provision and must be incorporated into local authorities’ commissioning. \nRecent comments from Education Secretary Michael GoveCSDG were very disappointed to read the Education Secretary’s recent article in the Daily Telegraph, which was misleading and\n harmfully\n sensationalist.\n In a number of instances data\n \nfrom the DfE’s \nChildren’\ns Homes D\nata \nP\nack\n was,\n willfully or mistakenly,\n misrepresented\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe DfE’s own data shows that 71% of children’s homes are rated good or outstanding, and there is no direct correlation between level of deprivation and location of children’s homes.\n&#xa0;\nQuality is not\n a question of whether the provider a local authority or independent provider. Indeed, independent homes were less likely to be rated inadequate, and cost on average over £14,000 less per child per year, than local authority-run homes. Quality is a questio\nn of whether a placement meets the often complex needs of a vulnerable child in a safe and fulfilling environment. \nQ.2 Are the reforms likely to prove effective or further measures are needed?CSDG welcome the intentions of these changes to i\nmprove multi-\nagency working and\n communication. However, current problems in the system are often caused by poor implementation and so changing regulations may not have much impact without also looking at the way local authorities commission services and communicate wit\nh providers and other agencies. \n&#xa0;\nRevising regulations without acting to ensure effective implementation and better strategic commissioning of placements will not truly make a difference in the lives of children in the care system. \n&#xa0;\nBetter commissioning a\nnd collaborative, constructive relationships with providers are needed to ensure that placements work to support, encourage and safeguard looked-after children in their care, as well as to develop the right kind of provision locally to meet their needs. \nWithout this foundation of better commissioning and a \nmore \npositive attitude to partnership working, the regulations will not be effective and in some local authorities, short-term costs, not the value of long-term outcomes, will continue to drive decision\ns. \n&#xa0;\nWithout a wider strategic approach to the care system, the Department for Education is simply tinkering with isolated parts of the s\nystem – such as the adoption reforms – which will mean nothing for the majority of children in care. \n&#xa0;\nSpecifically the way children’s homes \nare used in the care system needs to be reviewed. \nThe Department for Education has recognised that too often children’s homes are used by local authorities as a ‘last resort’. 7,900 of the 67,000 looked-after children \nin England are cared for in residential homes,\n and \nCSDG\n believe\ns\n that residential care can and should play a vital role as part of a range of provision for children with complex needs.\n&#xa0;\nMany young people in residential homes will have had multiple placeme\nnt breakdowns and often have the most complex needs. Statistics released in the \nChildren’s Homes Data Pack\n show that nearly a third of children in children’s homes have had 6 or more placements.\n This is \nthe real\n scandal, with poor commissioning denying ch\nildren stable and secure placements that\n meet their needs, and robbing them of positive outcomes. \n&#xa0;\nRecent parliamentary questions have revealed that the Department for Education decided against developing a care strategy.\n Instead the department has chosen to implement piecemeal reforms – such as to the adoption system – which makes no difference to the majority of looked-after children. \n&#xa0;\nWe would encourage the Education Select Committee to ask the Government to rethink th\nis decision as a matter of urgency and take a strategic approach to reforming the wider care system, rather than making piecemeal changes in isolation. Only by doing so will they safeguard vulnerable children and help to provide the high-quality care and s\nupport they deserve.  \n&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0; \nhttp://www.csdg.org.uk/images/pdfs/In%20It%20Together%20I\nn%20Practice%20-%20CSDG%20and%20LGiU%20report%202012.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/10304696\n/Michael-Gove-Im-ending-this-scandal-over-childrens-care.html\n \nhttp://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/c/childrens%20homes%20data%20pack%202\n013.PDF\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/219210/sfr20-2012v2.pdf\n \n \nhttp://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/c/childrens%20homes%20data%20pack%202013.PDF\n \n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0001.htm#130909-0001.htm_wqn15\n \n"
