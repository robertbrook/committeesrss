default1 defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1 
defaultCelesio
default UK, which includes Lloydspharmacy, is one of the largest healthcare providers in the UK
default with a significant presence across
default secondary, primary and home care sectors.
default Each day millions of people either use or rely upon the services which we provide.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultWe are a large and successful group which works in partnership with the NHS to help UK citizens live longer and healthier lives.
default Our corporate vision is a healthier world where more people can live life to the fullest.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultIn 2012, our 
default1500+ 
defaultLloydsphar
defaultmacies
default dispensed around 150
default million prescriptions, 
default70+
default% of which related to me
defaultdicines to treat those with long-term conditions
default. Other 
defaultCelesio
default UK businesses
default also provide 
defaultessential 
defaultsupport and services to those with long-term conditions. Some examples include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.4 
defaultTherefore, from several different angles, 
defaultbut 
defaultprimarily from 
defaulta
default community pharmacy perspective, 
defaultCelesio
default UK has a broad and deep understanding 
defaultof the needs of those with long-term conditions, 
defaultthe extent to which
default those needs are being met currently and 
defaultwhere service improvement
defaults
default could be made.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 
defaultThe vast majo
defaultrity of those who suffer from long-term condition
defaults will be on some form of medication and often multiple medicines fo
defaultr co-morbidity, particularly
default the elderly. 
defaultAs a result
default, community pharmacy already plays a
defaultn important and central
default role 
defaultin supporting t
defaulthose with long-term conditions 
defaultto understand and manage their medicines.
default&#xa0;
default1.6 
defaultIn England, this is achieved 
defaultprimarily 
defaultthrough
default the New Medicine Service and Medicine User Reviews as well as ad-hoc advice and interventions by pharmacists and pharmacy staff
default when appropriate
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.7 
defaultThe New Medicine Service
default provides support for people with long-term conditions 
defaultwho have been 
defaultnewly prescribed a medicine to help improve medicines adherence
default. 
defaultMedicine User Reviews
default (MURs) consists of accredited pharmacists undertaking structured adherence-
defaultcentred
default reviews with patients on multiple medicines, particularly those receiving medicines for long term conditions.
default&#xa0;
default1.8 
defaultAs we will argue later these are important services, but not yet developed 
defaultand embedded in commissioned care pathways 
defaultas fully as they need to be.
default&#xa0;
default1.9 
defaultCommunity pharmacy also plays a key role 
defaulthelping 
defaultto 
defaultidentify those most at risk of developing long-term conditions
default. Community pharmacies
default provid
defaulte frontline
default professional advice 
defaultand information, 
defaultrefer individuals to their GP
default and 
defaultmany, including Lloydspharmacy, 
defaultoffer patient services/checks for conditions such as 
defaultdiabetes, high blood pressure etc
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.10 
defaultOn its own Lloy
defaultdspharmacy has provided over 1.5
default million free Type 2 diabetes screening tests with
default 
default75,000 people referred to their GP and over 1.
default8
default million blood pressure tests have completed to date.
default&#xa0;
default2 defaultCommunity Pharmacy Futuredefault 
defaultproject default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultThe CEOs from Boots, Co-operative Pharmacy, Lloydspharmacy and 
defaultRowlands
default Pharmacy met with the Department of Health in October 2011 to discuss the future funding for community pharmacy. A “Community Pharmacy Future project” was initiated as a result with a vision of demonstrating the 
defaultbenefits pharmacy can offer, with an approach of reducing primary care admissions and delivering benefits for all parties. The project group looked at the delivery of services that address key objectives for Governments three areas of focus including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultTwo services were developed to demonstrate pharmacies ability to manage long term conditions. The services were developed and a pi
defaultlot launched in September 2012 
defaultwith the following services:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultAll local GP practices and relevant professional groups were engaged in the service including the 
defaultPSNC
default,
default LMC, CCA and LPC.
default 
defaultThe service has been live for over 6 months and the initial results are extremely encouraging. The six month consultations for patients signed up to the service will all be completed by the end of June and the four companies will be able to share the detailed health economic data that will illustrate both the quantitative benefits of the pilot in addition to the qualitative benefits.
default&#xa0;
default3 defaultThe need for a new approachdefault&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultAs a consequence of t
defaulthe growing number of those with long-term conditions
default,
default healthcare commissioners will need to review how services and support are delivered in the years ahead as current arrangements leave too many patients not accessing advice, getting available checks or taking their medicines as directed if at all. The consequence
defaults
default of this 
defaultare
default an unacceptable 
defaulthigh 
defaultnumber of people dying prematurely, ending up in hospital requiring costly secondary care treatment 
default–
default and often social care support – or becoming economically inactive (at a wider cost to the economy and benefits system).
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultThere are several indicators that current approaches to identifying those most at risk of developing long-term conditions as well as providing on-going professional support to those who do are not adequate:
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLarge numbers of people with long-term conditions who may not be aware that is the case (
defaulteg
default. around 
default850,000
default people with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes);
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLarge numbers of those with long-term conditions (between 30-50%) do not take their medication as directed if at all leading to premature deaths, avoidable hospital admissions and poorer quality of life;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAvoidable deaths. For example, each year around 1000+ asthma sufferers die prematurely because they are not using their inhaler properly
default (according to Asthma UK only 12% of asthma patients receive a written action plan from their GP or asthma nurse while one in five has not been invited for an annual asthma review);
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe number of
default diabetic patients who do not receive the regular check ups they require leading to avoidable amputations, strokes and heart attacks.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultThe essential problem is well known: the lack of a joined up approach to healthcare provision which leaves the patient to navigate their way through service silos.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultWe support fully the concept of patient-centric care pathways and joint professional working based around the needs of the patient. 
defaultThis is particularly important in the case of those with long-term conditions
default,
default many of whom require support from a range of healthcare professionals.
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultWe want to see patient pathways in which GPs and community pharmacists share responsibility for providing 
defaultcontinuing
default care through a 
defaultjoint
default care plan for those with long-term conditions.
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultAn interesting
default example
default of this approach is being rolled out in
default Scotland
default.
default 
defaultThe
default Chronic Medication Service 
default(CMS) is a national core service which all community pharmacies will eventually have to provide in order to be gra
defaultn
defaultted a community pharmacy contract. CMS requires 
defaultGPs and community pharmacists 
defaultto
default share responsibility 
defaultfor
default develop
defaulting
default a care plan fo
defaultr patients with long-term conditions
default with much of the regular 
defaultcontinuing
default care, 
defaultsupport
default and health checks
default being undertaken by the pharmacist or pharmacy staff.
default It is not without its issues, but it is an example of 
defaulthow 
defaultjoined up care 
defaultcan be 
defaultdelivery.
default&#xa0;
default3.7 
defaultThere are other models and approaches worthy of consideration. For example, 
defaultwhy don’t we see condition
default specialist
default nurses or even GPs undertaking outreach activity based in local community pharmacies working alongside the pharmacist or pharmacy staff to provide better support to those with conditions at high risk of developing avoidable complications? After all, the bricks and mortar, the consultation rooms as well as the professional expertise in medicines already exist.
default That would better utilise the community healthcare assets which 
defaultare 
defaultalready 
defaultin place
default.
default&#xa0;
default4 defaultSo what do we need going forward?default&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultThere are a number of areas which need to be addressed if we want to improve the service and support given to those with long-term conditions and implement patient-centric care plans.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
default1 We need a new fit-for-purpose defaultand appropriately funded defaultcommunity pharmacy contract based on patient services, not defaultalmost exclusively on defaultvolume dispensing.default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultThat means a contract which provides the right kind of incentives to encourage partnership working with other healthcare professionals, particularly GPs. That in turn means the GP and community pharmacy contracts need to be aligned
default. 
defaultThe Chairman of NHS England has stated that he wants to review the GMS contract so now would be an appropriate time to consider alignment with the community pharmacy contract.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultIt also means clearly defining the role of community pharmacy – as CMS in Scotland 
defaultis seeking to do
default – as a core requirement for managing those with long-term conditions, not an add-on extra.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultCurrently, not all community pharmacies provide the 
defaultNew Medication Service which
default means 
defaultsome
default patients do not automatically receive
default it.
default 
defaultSimilarly, the number of Medicine Use Reviews which a community pharmacy can carry out is capped at 400 per month: again this means some patients who would benefit from this service cannot access it.
default 
defaultWe believe
default both services should form 
defaulta core 
defaultpart of an on-going healthcare plan for those with long-term conditions
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
default2 Patient care recordsdefault&#xa0;
default4.6 
defaultThere needs to be a
default single patient record which both GPs and pharmacists can access
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default              
default3default Avoiding illness as well as treating conditionsdefault&#xa0;
default4.8 
defaultIt is preferable to stop people becoming patients. That will require a greater emphasis to promote healthy living and wellbeing. 
defaultCommunity
default pharmacies are ideally placed to act as local community health hubs.
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default              
default4default New models and service deliverydefault&#xa0;
default4.10 
defaultWe need to see service commissioners considering n
defaultew models 
defaultto service delivery including 
defaultonline, 
defaulttele
default-care
default and home
default based support. Companies like 
defaultCelesio
default UK already operate across the primary, secondary and home care sectors and are therefore well placed to provide integrated healthcare services in partnership with commissioners.
