default2. Introductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultIn April 2013, 
defaultt
defaulthe 
defaultLGiU
default carried out a consultation of the local government sector to find out how the Ombudsman might better use the information it holds to enhance local accountability.
default The findings also strengthen our understanding of the effectiveness of the LGO’s current operation and activities.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo gain insight, the 
defaultLGiU
default 
defaultundertook a national online survey of the 
defaultsector. 
defaultThe survey received 402 responses representing 232 councils.
default 
default59 per cent of respondents were council officers, including chief executives, heads of legal, heads of democratic
default services and LGO Link Officers. 
default39 per ce
defaultnt of respondents were 
defaultcouncil
defaultlors
default, including council leaders, opposition council leaders and chairs of overview and scrutiny committees.
default 
defaultWe also had a small number of responses including from Members of Parliament and other repr
defaultesentative groups of local gov
defaulternment.
default 
defaultThe high response rate to this survey suggests that local accountability, and the role of the LGO is a significant issue for local government at this time.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe findings were published in a report, entitled 
default‘The LGO and the future of local accountability: An 
defaultLGiU
default Inquiry’
default, in a report in June 2013.
default The 
defaultfindings provide insight into 
defaulthow we can understand and assess the Ombudsman’s current offer, as well as how the Ombudsman might develop the prov
defaultision of its support. 
default&#xa0;default3. The LGO today: understanding and assessing its offerdefaultIn the first stage of our consultation, we wanted to understand how councils perceive the LGO in its current form: whether the LGO was regarded as a positive force within the local government sector; which functions local authorities found useful and which they found less useful. Key themes to emerge are highlighted below.
default&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultSupport for the LGO
defaultThere was a strong view among respondents that the LGO represents a positive influence both in terms of its impact on the local government sector and the public more broadly, with 91 per cent and 92 per cent respectively agreeing with statements to this effect.
defaultExplain
defaulting why local gov
defaulternment benefited from having its own ombudsman, council representatives hig
defaulth
defaultlighted the important role the LGO plays in enhancing transparency within the sector through its role as an independent arbiter.
default 
defaultThe LGO’s local government expertise and knowledge was also 
defaultemphasised
default by several respondents as crucial to the value of its insights and interventions.
defaultRespondents thought the public benefited from the presence of the Ombudsman as well. They highlighted the important 
defaultrole the LGO plays in enabling fair and just treatment of complainants.
default 
defaultThe LGO was seen as playi
defaultng a key role in protecting their rights.
defaultRespondents also broadly agreed that we have the correct mechanisms in place both to respond to complaints from service users as well as the public (with 88 per cent and 81 per cent affirming such statements positively).
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultBalance: the importance of the LGO maintaining its independence, while engaging positively with local government
defaultThe perceived independence and neutrality of the LGO was seen as a vital element of its relationship with local authorities. Respondents highlighted 
default‘providing independent investigation and redress for complaints’
default as the most useful function of an ombudsman, and both officers and 
defaultcouncillors
default referred repeatedly to the independence of the 
defaultorganisation
default as one of its core values to the sector. 
defaultRespondents also highlighted 
default‘providing a clear line of accountability to the citizen’
default and 
default‘supporting your council’s own complaints process’ 
defaultas important.
defaultRespondents were cautious about the idea of increased involvement of the LGO in the day-to-day activities of the council, as it was felt this could erode its independent 
defaultstatus and potentially undermine local democracy.
default&#xa0;default4. The LGO and the future of local accountabilitydefaultIn the second part of our consultation, we wanted to develop an understanding of local authorities’ perception of the future of local accountability and how it can be enhanced. More specifically, we wanted to understand what future roles the LGO could perform, which functions of the LGO they would they like to be developed and what other forms of support they would like to see.
defaultWhilst most council representatives felt that we have the right mechanisms in place to deal with complaints, some common themes emerged as to how the LGO might best expand its offer.
default These findings highlight how the LGO might further improve its performance as we look to the future.
default&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultDemand for increased provision of information
defaultThe LGO holds detailed data on a wide range of complaints across local govern- 
defaultment
default, including housing, planning, social care, transport, waste and council tax. We asked councils whether better access to this data would be of value.
default A large proportion (
default77 per cent
default) said they
default would like greater access to statistical data, enabling them to make thematic comparisons and learn about best practice.
defaultThe consultation also sought to 
defaultfind
default out whether councils would find
default more focus reports helpful, and if so on what topics.
default 
defaultFocus reports are themed publications, published by the LGO, that investigate particular subjects of complaint in detail. The reports draw from lessons learnt from the complaints the Ombudsman has investigated and include recommendations on good practice.
defaultResponses suggested significant support for greater information of this kind.
default 
default70 per cent of local authority representatives would like to see more focus reports from the LGO, with the issue of planning emerging as an important subject for participants
default. Other popular topics included housing and welfare reform.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultThe need for a distinct offer to officers and elected members
defaultWhen seeking to 
defaultanalyse
default the work of the LGO, it is important to consider how the Ombudsman might vary if offer. 
defaultConsultation responses revealed some divergence of perspective on accountability from 
defaultcouncillors
default and officers. 
defaultCouncillors
default were broadly very positive about the notion of an expanded and evolved role for the LGO. 73 per cent of elected members wanted more support for their work from the LGO, and 64 per cent felt that the LGO could help the work of overview and scrutiny committees.
defaultOfficers did not perceive the need for this form of support to the same extent, but highly valued the LGO’s capacity for independent investigation, and their ability to support the councils’ own complaints procedures. This suggests that a more articulated and discrete offer to officers and 
defaultcouncillors
default could be valuable, particularly with reference to the latter group.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultSponsorship of the LGO
defaultThe final part of our consultation looked at the sponsorship of the LGO. The LGO is currently sponsored by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), and we sought to establish councils’ views on this arrangement.
defaultThere was a lack of consensus regarding how the LGO should be sponsored, with no option receiving a majority.
default5default. ConclusionsdefaultIn summary, respondents 
defaultto our inquiry were clear that the LGO 
defaultplay
defaults
default a crucial role in 
defaultenhancing 
defaultlocal accountability. While there was a broad sense that we have the correct mechanisms in place to address the complaints of services users and the wider public, responses demonstrated clear opportunities to enhance the LGO offer, particularly in relation to the provision of accessible and comparative data and information. There is also a need to develop a distinct offer to officers and elected members to reflect their different preferences. 
defaultHowever, it is clear that the work of the LGO is seen as integral to safeguarding the future of local accountability.
