[normal]2. Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In April 2013, 
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]LGiU
[normal] carried out a consultation of the local government sector to find out how the Ombudsman might better use the information it holds to enhance local accountability.
[normal] The findings also strengthen our understanding of the effectiveness of the LGO’s current operation and activities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To gain insight, the 
[normal]LGiU
[normal] 
[normal]undertook a national online survey of the 
[normal]sector. 
[normal]The survey received 402 responses representing 232 councils.
[normal] 
[normal]59 per cent of respondents were council officers, including chief executives, heads of legal, heads of democratic
[normal] services and LGO Link Officers. 
[normal]39 per ce
[normal]nt of respondents were 
[normal]council
[normal]lors
[normal], including council leaders, opposition council leaders and chairs of overview and scrutiny committees.
[normal] 
[normal]We also had a small number of responses including from Members of Parliament and other repr
[normal]esentative groups of local gov
[normal]ernment.
[normal] 
[normal]The high response rate to this survey suggests that local accountability, and the role of the LGO is a significant issue for local government at this time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The findings were published in a report, entitled 
[normal]‘The LGO and the future of local accountability: An 
[normal]LGiU
[normal] Inquiry’
[normal], in a report in June 2013.
[normal] The 
[normal]findings provide insight into 
[normal]how we can understand and assess the Ombudsman’s current offer, as well as how the Ombudsman might develop the prov
[normal]ision of its support. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3. The LGO today: understanding and assessing its offer[bold]In the first stage of our consultation, we wanted to understand how councils perceive the LGO in its current form: whether the LGO was regarded as a positive force within the local government sector; which functions local authorities found useful and which they found less useful. Key themes to emerge are highlighted below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]Support for the LGO
[normal]There was a strong view among respondents that the LGO represents a positive influence both in terms of its impact on the local government sector and the public more broadly, with 91 per cent and 92 per cent respectively agreeing with statements to this effect.
[normal]Explain
[normal]ing why local gov
[normal]ernment benefited from having its own ombudsman, council representatives hig
[normal]h
[normal]lighted the important role the LGO plays in enhancing transparency within the sector through its role as an independent arbiter.
[normal] 
[normal]The LGO’s local government expertise and knowledge was also 
[normal]emphasised
[normal] by several respondents as crucial to the value of its insights and interventions.
[normal]Respondents thought the public benefited from the presence of the Ombudsman as well. They highlighted the important 
[normal]role the LGO plays in enabling fair and just treatment of complainants.
[normal] 
[normal]The LGO was seen as playi
[normal]ng a key role in protecting their rights.
[normal]Respondents also broadly agreed that we have the correct mechanisms in place both to respond to complaints from service users as well as the public (with 88 per cent and 81 per cent affirming such statements positively).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Balance: the importance of the LGO maintaining its independence, while engaging positively with local government
[normal]The perceived independence and neutrality of the LGO was seen as a vital element of its relationship with local authorities. Respondents highlighted 
[normal]‘providing independent investigation and redress for complaints’
[normal] as the most useful function of an ombudsman, and both officers and 
[normal]councillors
[normal] referred repeatedly to the independence of the 
[normal]organisation
[normal] as one of its core values to the sector. 
[normal]Respondents also highlighted 
[normal]‘providing a clear line of accountability to the citizen’
[normal] and 
[normal]‘supporting your council’s own complaints process’ 
[normal]as important.
[normal]Respondents were cautious about the idea of increased involvement of the LGO in the day-to-day activities of the council, as it was felt this could erode its independent 
[normal]status and potentially undermine local democracy.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4. The LGO and the future of local accountability[bold]In the second part of our consultation, we wanted to develop an understanding of local authorities’ perception of the future of local accountability and how it can be enhanced. More specifically, we wanted to understand what future roles the LGO could perform, which functions of the LGO they would they like to be developed and what other forms of support they would like to see.
[normal]Whilst most council representatives felt that we have the right mechanisms in place to deal with complaints, some common themes emerged as to how the LGO might best expand its offer.
[normal] These findings highlight how the LGO might further improve its performance as we look to the future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]Demand for increased provision of information
[normal]The LGO holds detailed data on a wide range of complaints across local govern- 
[normal]ment
[normal], including housing, planning, social care, transport, waste and council tax. We asked councils whether better access to this data would be of value.
[normal] A large proportion (
[normal]77 per cent
[normal]) said they
[normal] would like greater access to statistical data, enabling them to make thematic comparisons and learn about best practice.
[normal]The consultation also sought to 
[normal]find
[normal] out whether councils would find
[normal] more focus reports helpful, and if so on what topics.
[normal] 
[normal]Focus reports are themed publications, published by the LGO, that investigate particular subjects of complaint in detail. The reports draw from lessons learnt from the complaints the Ombudsman has investigated and include recommendations on good practice.
[normal]Responses suggested significant support for greater information of this kind.
[normal] 
[normal]70 per cent of local authority representatives would like to see more focus reports from the LGO, with the issue of planning emerging as an important subject for participants
[normal]. Other popular topics included housing and welfare reform.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]The need for a distinct offer to officers and elected members
[normal]When seeking to 
[normal]analyse
[normal] the work of the LGO, it is important to consider how the Ombudsman might vary if offer. 
[normal]Consultation responses revealed some divergence of perspective on accountability from 
[normal]councillors
[normal] and officers. 
[normal]Councillors
[normal] were broadly very positive about the notion of an expanded and evolved role for the LGO. 73 per cent of elected members wanted more support for their work from the LGO, and 64 per cent felt that the LGO could help the work of overview and scrutiny committees.
[normal]Officers did not perceive the need for this form of support to the same extent, but highly valued the LGO’s capacity for independent investigation, and their ability to support the councils’ own complaints procedures. This suggests that a more articulated and discrete offer to officers and 
[normal]councillors
[normal] could be valuable, particularly with reference to the latter group.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]Sponsorship of the LGO
[normal]The final part of our consultation looked at the sponsorship of the LGO. The LGO is currently sponsored by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), and we sought to establish councils’ views on this arrangement.
[normal]There was a lack of consensus regarding how the LGO should be sponsored, with no option receiving a majority.
[normal]5[bold]. Conclusions[bold]In summary, respondents 
[normal]to our inquiry were clear that the LGO 
[normal]play
[normal]s
[normal] a crucial role in 
[normal]enhancing 
[normal]local accountability. While there was a broad sense that we have the correct mechanisms in place to address the complaints of services users and the wider public, responses demonstrated clear opportunities to enhance the LGO offer, particularly in relation to the provision of accessible and comparative data and information. There is also a need to develop a distinct offer to officers and elected members to reflect their different preferences. 
[normal]However, it is clear that the work of the LGO is seen as integral to safeguarding the future of local accountability.
