              Written evidence from the Local Government Association (WRT 044)&#xa0;Dear Louise,&#xa0;

[[[Winter Readiness Survey 2013/14]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Thank you for inviting me to give evidence to the Transport Select Committee last month, in relation to your inquiry into winter resilience. As promised at the session, I enclose a copy of the LGA’s 2014 Winter Readiness Survey, which is also available online at http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/economy-and-transport-research/.&#xa0;Having learnt from the experience of the 2010 winter, local government has been working hard to ensure it is ready to keep local areas moving in the face of significantly challenging winter weather. As you will see from the report, councils have made sure they are well-equipped. On average, each council will be this winter using ten full-size gritters and one mini-gritter as well as ploughs, footways gritters and snow blowers. 95 per cent of councils are armed with the same or increased amounts of salt compared to last year.&#xa0;Local government has an impressive record in finding efficiencies and innovating through new models of working, even when it comes to winter resilience. For example, almost half of councils surveyed will be sharing services to deliver their winter resilience programmes. This includes community empowerment with over 70 per cent of councils seeking to more effectively facilitate public use of grit bins. Community engagement will be essential for this winter’s preparations; 93 per cent of councils were already making plans in the autumn for communicating their winter service plans. From a digital perspective, 95 per cent of councils will be using their websites and social media to provide live updates about gritting, which is expected to cover nearly half of their entire road networks.&#xa0;However, while councils want to do even more of this sort of work, with cuts to our sector totalling 43 per cent this Parliament, they are having to make tough decisions about where they prioritise resources. Current LGA analysis demonstrates that there will be a funding gap of £15.6 billion by 2020 if Whitehall continues to make cuts to local government. This could result in councils failing their local communities as with decreasing funding and increasing demand there is only so much local authorities will be able to do.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
