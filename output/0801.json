\nFailure to secure a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment for continence problems can have a significant \nsocietal\n impact and downstream costs for NHS services\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn ageing population means more people living with long-term health conditions (LTCs), such as LUTS, will have a significant impact on the demands placed on adult social care and health services\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCare for patients with LUTS takes place across different NHS and social care settings, it is therefore imperative that they are able to access fully integrated services\n \nthroughout the whole patient pathway \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the existence of clinical guidelines on provision of effective continence services, there is evidence of gaps and variations in the quality of care available to patients across England\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHealth and social care quality standards for LUTS and continence \nwill provide useful tools for commissioners and providers when designing and monitoring performance of their local continence services\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo deliver consistent improvements in continence care, these \nquality \nstandards \nmust be closely aligned and translated into \nkey levers and mechanisms within the NHS and social care quality improvement framework\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAstellas Pharma Ltd (“Astellas”) \nwelcomes the opportunity to respond to the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into \nthe management of \nLTCs\n.\n \nAstellas\n is committed to working in \npartnership\n with \nhealth and social care services in England \nto \ndeliver \nhigh quality\n, integrated \ncare\n,\n and support the best possible outcomes for patients\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe content of our submission \nfocuses on the experiences and insights from our urology business\n where we have been working \nwith patient, clinical and NHS partners \nover a number of years \nto build consensus \non the core components of\n high quality care for patients with LUTS including urinary incontinence\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLUTS cover a diverse range of conditions from the relatively mild to more severe and debilitating and it is estimated that \nthe prevalence of at least some form of LUTS will be a\nlmost two in every three \na\ndults\n.\n \nThese symptoms\n can have a significant impact on quality of life with the potential to negatively affect an individual’s mobility, their sleep, their ability to carry out day-to-day activities as well as their mental wellbeing\n,\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important to know that LUTS are not simply a natural consequence of ageing.\n \nWith high quality advice and support, and early access to the right interventions, most conditions are manageabl\ne\n.\n \nUnfortunately, m\nany continence problems are left undiagnosed, partly because individuals are often too embarrassed to come forward and seek help\n.\n \nFailure to secure a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment for continence problems can \nlead to poorer outcomes for patients, and escalating care costs through increased morbidity and mortality, for \nexample through the \npossible \nheightened \nrisk of falls and fractures amongst older people\n, unnecessary cat\nh\ne\nte\nrisation and associat\ned\n urinary tract infections, pressure ulcers linked to poor continence care and acute hospitalisations\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding high quality continence care and support is a key test of the capacity of the health and social care system to \nuphold\n every patients’ right to dignity and respect.\n \nWith an ageing population, the number of people affected across England is set to rise – the need\n to \naddress the current variations \nin quality of care provision \nis increasingly pressing.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCare for patients with LUTS takes place across different NHS and social care settings, it is therefore imperative that they are able to access fully integrated services.\n \nA\n fully integrated continence service should deliver joined-up, patient-centred care throughout the whole the patient pathway across NHS and social care settings.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPractical guidance for commissioners and providers on developing an integrated continence service w\nas\n set out by the Department of Health in \nGood Practice in Continence Services\n in 2000, and reinforced in the \nNational Service Framework for Older People\n, published in 2001.\n \nHowever, despite the existence of these resources, evidence from the \nNational Audit of Continence Care \npublished \nby the Royal College of Physicians \nduring 2010 \nrev\nealed\n worrying gaps and variations in the standards of care available to patients and a lack of local \ndesignated \nleadership in local services\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe lack of designated local leads responsible for coordinating services \ncoupled with patchy implementation of best practice guidelines \nhas led to the \nmajority of continence services \nbeing \npoorly integrated across acute, medical, surgical, primary, c\nare home and community settings\n.\n \nWidespread under-\nprioritisation\n \nhas resulted in\n \ndisjointed care, sub-optimal patient outcomes and downstream costs associated with \npoor\n care\n.\n \nThe NHS reforms provide an opportunity to address these shortcomings and appropriate services are in place to reflect the prevalence of LUTS. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the new NHS \nstructures\n, health and wellbeing boards (HWBs) will have a key role \nin addressing the fragmented nature of continence services in England.\n \nBringing together the experiences and perspectives of \nrepresentatives \nfrom across local authorities, the NHS and patient and public representatives, HWBs are well placed to provide the necessary strategic \noversight required to ensure integrated services are designed to reflect the needs of the local health population and scrutinise how effectively \nthese services\n are being delivered.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe recent NHS reforms provide a clear opportunity to address these poor practices and focus on improving outcomes for people affected by LUTS.\n \nA key part of the new NHS quality improvement framework is the introduction of quality standards, prepared by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which \ndescribe markers of high quality care that, when delivered collectively, should improve the effectiveness, safety and experience of care for people with a particular condition.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAstellas welcomes \nNICE’s \nplans to develop quality standards for LUTS in men and urinary incontinence in women \nwhich will provide a set of concise statements designed to drive quality improvements across a pathway of care.\n \nThese will provide useful tools for commissioners and providers when designing and monitoring performance of their local continence services.\n \nTo succeed, we believe that the final set of statements and supporting metrics should focus on those approaches and interventions that will ultimately make the most difference in terms of patient outcomes, including increased symptom awareness, earlier identification of symptoms and timely access to the best possible quality treatment and supportive care.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs part of its expanded remit, \nNICE\n now also has\n responsibility for developing \nguidance and \nquality standards \nin\n social care. \nEncouragingly, \nNICE is considering\n developing a social care quality standard on promoting continence and preventing and managing incontinence in adults in care homes and the community.\n \nIt is important that any supporting statements and metrics for social care are closely aligned with those included in health quality standards to ensure consistency in the provision of care across both settings.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo embed high quality care continence care throughout the health and social care system, \nquality standards \nfor both\n health \nand social \ncare must be translated into key levers and mechanisms within \nthe NHS Outcomes Framework, NHS Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework and \nthe clinical commissioning group outcome indicator set (CCGOIS). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAstellas supports the Committee’s focus on the capacity of social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions, such as LUTS, in the community.\n \nThe prevalence of LUTS amongst the over 65s is higher than in the general population, and of the \nthousands of people enter\ning\n the social care system\n each year\n, \na large proportion will be experiencing some form of continence problems – faecal and urinary in\ncontinence \nhas been cited as \nthe second most common reason for \npeople \nbeing admitted\n to residential and nursing homes\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere i\ns widespread recognition that an \nageing \npopulation\n means more people living with long-term health conditions, \nincluding\n \nLUTS\n, \nwill have a significant impact on the demands placed on adult social care and health services\n.\n \nSocial care services must work closely with health services \nto \nensure that \nservice\n users receive the treatment and support they need to \nmanage their condition effectively \nand prevent complications which will result in \nunplanned \nhospital admissions.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Care Quality Commission’s\n \nHealth care in care homes: A special review of the provision of health care to those in care homes\n,\n \nwhich \nlooked at how well the health care needs of people living in care homes were met, based on commissioning and provider behaviours\n, found worrying gaps in the provision of personalised care, treatment and support \nfor social care\n service users\n: \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA quality standard on ‘p\nromoting continence and managing incontinence\n’\n featured\n within the long-list of social care \nquality standards\n recently proposed by the Department of Health, to be developed by NICE.\n \nA \nsocial care quality standard on continence problems \nwould support commissioners and providers in assessing how they \nidentif\ny\n and monitor symptoms, \nhow they support patients with continence needs, and deliver appropriate staff training.\n \nAstellas\n therefore believes that a quality standard on incontinence has the potential to significantly improve the standards of care identified in the Care Quality Commission’s report, and has a key role to play in supporting the delivery \nof \nhigh quality continence care in social care settings. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
