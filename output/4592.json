"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Joint written evidence from Avincis Group, Bristow Helicopters Limited and CHC Helicopter (HCS0001)&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn its Terms of Reference for this inquiry, the Committee makes reference to the ‘industry’ involved in the provision of helicopter flights in the UK North Sea. This industry includes helicopter manufacturers, helicopter operators and the energy companies whose staff and contractors travel between the mainland and offshore installations. The industry works together on safety. This submission represents the collective views of the industry’s three main helicopter operators:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorldwide\n, combined\n, the three operators employ \nover 10,000 people\n. In 2012, they carried\n around 3 million \npassengers using a fleet of \nnearly 1,000\n helicopters. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the UK, the operators together employ \nalmost 2,000 \npeople. \nIn 2012, they carried over half a million \npassengers to installations in the North Sea \nwith a combined \nUK fleet of over 80 helicopters. Over the period from 1981 to 2010, there were almost 3 million flight hours in the UK Continental Shelf sector of the North Sea with over 54 million passengers carried. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs operators, \nit is \nour duty above all else is to provide the safest possible operating environment for our crews and passengers. All three operators are dedicated to safety – not only independently, as commercial organisations driving quality \nand safety \nfor our customers through innovation, but also increasingly in collaboration. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNotwithstanding our collective commitment to safety, the North Sea oil and gas industry operates in a challenging environment and there are many inherent risks. \n \nAberdeen is home to the largest helicopter operation in the world and is considered one of the safest. A recent study commissioned by the UK Offshore Oil and Gas Industry Association Limited\n found that for the period from 1995 to 2010, the safety record of helicopter operations in the UK Continental Shelf compared favourably with other operations in the North Sea and those elsewhere in the world. The following table compares the global fatal and non-fatal accident rates of UK Continental Shelf helicopter operations from 1995 to 2010 with all North Sea and worldwide operations, based on 100,000 flying hours.\n&#xa0;\nREGIONPERIODFATAL ACCIDENT RATES (Flying hours)NON-FATAL ACCIDENT RATES (Flying hours)UK Continental Shelf\n*\n1995-2010\n0.26\n0.91\nAll North Sea\n1995-2010\n0\n.21\n1.07\nWorldwide\n1995-2010\n0.57\n1.48\n&#xa0;\n*99% of UK oil and gas production occurs under the seas surrounding the UK, from the seabed known as the UK continental shelf (UKCS).\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 2010\n, the end-\npoint of this study, there \nhas \nbeen three \naccidents\n in the UK North Sea. \nTwo of the accidents were controlled landings on water and \nall passengers and crew returned safely to shore. The third, on 23 August 2013, resulted in the tragic deaths of four of the 18 people on board. The Air Accident Investigation Branch is continuing to investigate \nto establish \nthe full facts surrounding this tragic accident.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRotary aviation is a highly regulated sector. All operations are overseen by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA). Each operator holds an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) issued by the UK CAA. To secure an AOC, operators go through rigorous scrutiny and audits of their procedures, people, assets, and systems. We also provide evidence of how we prioritise the safety of our people and passengers above all else. This certificate approves the operators to provide commercial passenger flights for the oil and gas industry.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, airworthiness is underpinned by strict compliance procedures laid down by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Agency promotes common standards of safety and environmental protection in Europe and worldwide. It provides for a single European market in the aviation industry. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs well as the UK CAA and EASA regulations, operators are \nobliged to comply with OGP standards for helicopter operations. We are also \nsubject to the contractual requirements of our customers, which often include customer-specific aviation standards (e.g. a minimum number of flight hours before a pilot can fly offshore). Although most standards are routinely met by all operators, there can be significant \nadditional \nvariations. An operator with 10 clients, for example, might be expected to operate flights to 10 different standards. And, as each customer company has its own standard, each must conduct its own audits. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNone of these additional customer requirements individually erode safety\n, nor do they \nconflict with regulations, but as a whole they introduce \ncomplexities \nto an operator’s Operations Manual. \nPotential areas for improvement include a move to a single set of high standards and more common audit processes.\n A \nmore joined-up approach would improve clarity and reduce complexity.  The UK CAA is centrally positioned to be able to help drive this effort.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnother example of where the UK CAA could contribute to driving standards further still\n is through the already valued\n work of its Helicopter Safety Research Management Committee, \nthe profile and scope of which could be increased\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSafety starts in our own procurement of aircraft; we expect safety excellence and innovation from helicopter manufacturers. The North Sea is served by a mixed fleet including AgustaWestland, Eurocopter, \nand \nSikorsky.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEach operator manages operational safety using integrated Safety Management Systems (SMS). In 2012, a regulatory requirement to have an SMS was introduced in the UK although we had implemented SMS long before the requirement was introduced.  The SMS \nis \nused to manage Safety Policy, Safety Risk Management, Safety Assurance and Safety Promotion.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEach operator also employs Safety and Quality teams \nto \ndevelop and implement comprehensive internal quality\n and safety programmes agreed by the UK CAA. \nOur operations are overseen by the CAA through processes including approval of operating and maintenance manuals\n and \ninternal audit programmes.  The CAA also participates in our monthly safety review boards.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the years, many technological developments, which began at the initiative of one operator, have been shared with other operators and adopted by the wider industry. Examples of such technological enhancements are set out below:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsuring safety is not just about reducing technical risks. \nThe managing of h\numan factors play\ns\n an important role in aviation \nsafety\n. Training of crews and pilots is critical to our approach to safety, especially as the aircraft used are increasingly more complex. Flight crew simulators are now routinely used and these are increasingly sophisticated and able to replicate the characteristics of the aircraft we use, as well as different weather conditions and approaches. There are three simulator training locations in Aberdeen. Training packages are approved by the relevant authorities and include packages which replicate the flying conditions for both routine operations and emergency procedures.\n&#xa0;4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOperators also use mandatory Crew Resource Management training programmes designed to \npromote positive \ncrew behaviour and improve performance in the cockpit.  This training includes situational awareness, decision making, threat and error management and crew cooperation. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInnovation has helped \nto improve quality and safety standards, raising the \nbar \non what is possible and what has already been achieved\n, whilst collaboration through various industry bodies and initiatives has encouraged the benefits of safety improvements to be shared.\n&#xa0;5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough a number of \nforums\n, operators engage with each other and with the industry. These include\n, but are not limited to\n:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn September 2013, \nin addition to the above forums\n, the main operators established a Joint Operators Review (JOR) Working Group to further share best practice, to identify any changes that we can make, and to drive improvements in a coordinated way. \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis Group was\n set up by, involves, and reports to \nthe CEOs of the three \nmain operators of helicopter services in the North Sea\n. \nT\nhe JOR \nis \nto become the principal vehicle for safety improvement cooperation. Its mission is “to review current processes, procedures and equipment in order to identify best practice in the offshore helicopter industry with a view to further enhancing safety”. \n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe areas of focus for the JOR, as stated in a terms of reference letter signed by the CEOs of the three operators, are:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOnce the first tranche of prioritised work is complete, the JOR Working Group will \nreview progress and \nconsider the benefits of increasing further \nits \nengagement with OEMs, oil and gas customers, regulators and others so that together we \ncan \ncontinue to \nfurther \nraise \nsafety \nstandards\n in our operations.\n&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;\n UK Offshore Commercial Air Transport Helicopter Safety Record 1981 - 2010\n"
