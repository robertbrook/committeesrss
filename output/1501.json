"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from pteg (TIC 033)\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npteg represents the six Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) which between them serve more than eleven million people in Greater Manchester (Transport for Greater Manchester), Merseyside (Merseytravel), South Yorkshire (SYPTE), Tyne and Wear (Nexus), the West\n Midlands (Centro) and West Yorkshire (Metro). Bristol and the West of England\n Partnership\n, Leicester and Nottingham City Councils, Transport for London and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport are associate members of \npteg though this response does not r\nepresent their views.\n \nThe PTEs plan, procure, provide and promote public transport in some of Britain's largest city regions, with the aim of delivering integrated public transport networks accessible to all.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the Committee's recognition \nthat isolated communities are an issue for urban, as well as rural areas.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccessibility Planning is a key tool used by transport authorities to identify demand for passenger transport but should be used more widely to implement both transport \nand\n non-trans\nport solutions to accessibility problems. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdeally, public transport should provide a general service that is available, affordable, accessible and acceptable to all. Where this is not the case, certain groups are particularly vulnerable to experiencing is\nolation. PTEs are involved in a range of initiatives to ensure their needs are taken into account.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities include funding; the deregulated nature of \nthe bus market outside London; land-use planning decisions; and a lack of recognition among other sectors of the importance of transport to the successful delivery of their policy objectives.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent to which transport authorities can address these chal\nlenges is constrained by cuts to local government and transport funding, however, interventions include: the provision of tendered 'socially necessary' \nbus \nservices; use of alternative transport solutions; use of Local Transport Act 2008 powers; more effic\nient use of existing transport resources; and marketing and behaviour change initiatives. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nonnecting isolated communities to services and opportunities is the responsibility of all those involved in the planning and delivery of public services - not just \nthe transport sector.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity Transport is effective at understanding the needs of local people but, as services come under increasing pressure, operators \nface challenges in ‘scaling up’\n to meet demand or make the most of opportunities for sustainability\n. Capacity building as well as closer working with transport authorities could be helpful.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nServices in isolated communities should be tailored to demand. If demand levels suggest that a taxi or demand-responsive transport would meet the needs of communitie\ns, then provision of these services should be sufficient. However, it is important to ensure that these services are\n well publicised as well as\n affordable, accessible and acceptable to users.\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nwelcome\n the Committee’s recognition that isolated communities are an issue for urban, as well as rural areas. \nIn both \narea types\n, communities can become \nisolated if public transport is not available, affordable, accessible or acceptable.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRural residents\n can experience isolation due to their geographical distance\n from\n key centres. In urban areas, distances to key services are often shorter, but communities \nca\nn still find themselves isolated when transport services do not connect the\nm to the places they want to go,\n at the times they need to travel or if those services are not affordable or accessible.\n \n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUrban communities may\n, for example,\n find themselves cut o\nff from\n key employment sites \nbecause transport is\n unavailable at times which correspond to late night or early morning shifts. Furthermore, \ntransport services may not connect employment sites with the communities who have the skills to fill available jobs\n. \n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the key tools \nused\n to identify demand for passenger transport\n is Accessibility Planning, a\n cornerstone of the 2003 Social Exclusion Unit \nreport ‘Making the Connections’.\n Accessibility Planning\n was designed to provide an opportunity for local part\nners, from across sectors, to develop a systematic approach to \nidentifying gaps in the network and \nimproving people’s access to key services and employment sites.\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccessibility Planning was intended to \ndeliver\n both transport and non-transport solutions to \naccessibility problems, recognising that changes to where and how key services are delivered can be as important as the provision of transport.\n \nHowever, perhaps because the production of an Accessibility Strategy became a Local Transport Plan requirement, \naccessibility\n is\n, in many areas,\n primarily seen as the responsibility of transport authorities, undermining the partnership approach originally envisaged.\n A \nrecent evaluation of Accessibility Planning for the\n Department for Transport\n (DfT)\n \nconfirmed this t\no be the case\n.\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccessibility Planning is in widespread use among transport authorities, but we would welcome a re-emphasis – across departments – of \nits value\n and \nthe\n need for a \npartnership approach\n to explore both transport and non-transport solutions\n. T\no underline this, all relevant government departments should issue or update their own Accessibility Planning guidance.\n The recent Environmental Audit Commission\n (EAC) inquiry into transport and the accessibility to public services\n \nsupports thi\ns recommenda\ntion, stating: \n‘The Government should publish up to date guidance which makes a compelling case for accessibility to be addressed, not just by local authorities but by all central government departments.’\n \n \nIndeed, we would suggest that a number of the EAC’s recommendations are of relevance to this inquiry and are something that the Committee may wish to \nmake reference to\n.\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlongside Accessibility Planning, \ndemand for passenger transport\n \nis identified\n \nthrough\n:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReference to the Local Transport Plan for the area.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnalysis of passenger data including patronage, revenue and \nlocation of boardings\n (where available)\n.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnalysis of statistics such as household income and car ownership levels.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdentification of changes in land use, \nsuch as\n planned ne\nw housing/\nindustrial estates or \nrelocation of\n public and other services.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdentification of where significant numbers of jobs are located, for example, through analysis of the Office for National Stat\nistics Inter-Departmental Business Register.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPartnership working and integration of delivery programmes with Local Enterprise Partnerships and other \npublic and private sector agencies.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitoring of changes to commercial transport networks.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSurveys of tran\nsport users and non-users.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSchool travel planning processes. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\negular Customer Forums and \nengagement\n \nwith community groups and other forums.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReques\nts from residents, businesses, \nCoun\ncillors and other organisations, includi\nng via neighbourhood petitions (\nof\nten \ntriggered by\n withdrawal\ns\n of commercial bus \nservices\n)\n.\n3.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving identified a demand, transport authorities then face the challenge of prioritising the limited funding available to achieve the most socially and economically advantageous outcome\n (see section eight)\n.\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Transport Plans (LTPs) are the core strategic documents used by transpor\nt authorities to set the context for \ndeveloping\n public transport networks and servic\nes. Equality impact assessments \nform part of the LTP proc\ness and test\n the likely impacts of\n proposals on\n different \ncommunities and \ngroups.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdeally, public transport should \nprovide a general service that is available, affordable, accessible and acceptable to all, regardless of where they live, their income, age, ability or level of confidence. \n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransport for Greater Manchester’s (TfGM) \n‘\nLocal Link\n’\n \nservices\n for example,\n provi\nde transport for many of the area’s isolated communities. Anyone living in the community can use the service – there are no age or disability restrictions and vehicles used are accessible. The services\n are often tailored to\n link to Greater Manchester’s hos\npitals, colleges and ra\nil stations, with markets determined through Accessibility Planning principles.\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nP\nublic transport\n \nthat \nis not available, affordable, accessible and acceptable\n risks leaving people isolated. Certain groups, including people with disabi\nlities, people on low incomes, older people and young peo\nple are particularly vulnerable as they are more likely to rely on public transport as their main means of getting around. \n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPTEs are involved in a range of initiatives to ensure the needs of differen\nt groups of passengers are taken into account.\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPTEs f\nund concessionary fares schemes\n including the statutory national concessionary fares scheme for older and disabled people, \ndiscretionary \nenhancements to that scheme and concessions for other groups\n such \nas\n children and young people and jobseekers.\n \n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPTEs work to ensure that tendered bus services are compliant with accessibility regulations.\n Where individuals are unable to use conventional public transport, they provide specialist services to ensure people \nare not left without an independent means of getting around. \nIn more isolated communities t\nhese \ncould, for example,\n take the form of \ndemand responsive door-to-door services\n or support \nfor the use of accessible taxis\n.\n4.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPTEs also consult with different groups\n of passengers directly. Taking the time to understand the needs of different user groups is vital to ensure that the services provided are the right ones and ones that people will use and value. \nTfGM\n, for example, has a Disability \nDesign Reference Group w\nhich is \nrecognised as a model of best practice by the Equality and Human Rights Commission\n.\n Me\na\nnwhile, a\nll PTEs work to involve you\nng people in transport decision \nmaking, for example, through attending local you\nth council meetings and holding \nyouth forums.\n \n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key\n challenge concerns\n the\n funding of bus and rail s\nervices to isolated communities,\n \ncovered in section eight of this response.\n \nAside from funding issues, \nanother \nchallenge \nfor \ntransport authoritie\ns is that\n bus services outside London \nare\n privately operated under a deregulated framework. In practice, this means that \ntransport authorities\n h\nave no direct control over which communities \nreceive \ncommercial\n bus service\ns\n \n(\nwhich comprise \nalmost 80% of total bus mileage). \nTransport authorities\n also have no direct control over the \nfares\n, quality or frequency of commercial services or the extent to wh\nich they form part of an integrated transport network.\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn this environment, bus operators – as private companies – need to ensure that, overall, their operations are profitable. They are unlikely to run services that lose money, even if \nthere i\ns a need for\n them in the community. Often, this means bus operators pull out of running services to isolated housing estates or rural areas, focusing instead on profitable major corridors and commuter routes.\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis may result in gaps in transport connectivity for some \ncommunities, impacting on access to employment, education, key services and so\ncial activities. In these cases\n \n(\nand where budgets allow\n – see section eight)\n,\n transport authorities may step in to fund extra ‘socially necessary’ bus services (also known as te\nndered services). They may also assess whether\n alternative \nsolutions such as\n demand responsive transport; taxis; Wheels to Work schemes; community transport; car sharing; o\nr walking and cycling provision might represent a more efficient use of resources.\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe challenges of a deregulated market for bus can\n also\n be tackled through the use of powers granted under the Local Transport Act 2008 which: \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nade it easier to negotiate \nV\noluntary \nPartnership Agreements\n with bu\ns operators to improve services\n. All PTEs ar\ne investing heavily in voluntary partnerships to benefit passengers.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMade it easier for transport authorities to facilitate voluntary Qualifying Agreements (QA) between competing operators to coordinate their timetables. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExpanded the scope of Statutory Qu\nality Partnerships\n (SQPs)\n whereby binding agreements can be voluntarily entered into between \ntransport authorities\n and bus operators, including on\n fares, frequencies and timings\n. PTEs were the first to introduce an SQP (in Sheffield) and a number of other \nagreements have b\neen reached since, with Bath and North East Somerset Council being the first to make a scheme embracing the full range of measures available.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMade Quality Contracts (QC\ns\n) a more realistic option. A QC involves replacing the existing deregu\nlated bus markets with a franchising system (similar to that in London) where the local transport authority specifies what the bus network will provide and the private sector competes for the right to provide it. Services to \nisolated communities can be spe\ncified as an integral part of the package that \noperators\n bid for\n, allowing cross-subsidisation of such services by more profitable routes\n. \nSeveral PTEs are developing proposals for QCs, with Nexus the first to launch a formal public consultation.\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA further\n challenge is that l\nand-use planning decisions are frequently made with little consideration for people who do not have use of a car, leading to communities being cut off from accessing key services\n and the creation/\nexpansion of isolated housing estates\n. T\nhe problem is exacerbated by trends towards the centralisation of public services, such as healthcare and education, which mean that people have to travel further or to differen\nt locations to access services, running the risk that real choice across servic\nes is more constrained for communities that are dependent on public transport.\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe increasing liberalisation of the planning system\n \nruns the risk of creating further isolated communities if development is permitted in inaccessible areas on the grounds of \nshort-term economic growth benefits.\n \n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLand-use planning decisions at their earliest stages should look at locating developments so that they connect to existing public transport networks.\n \nIn South Yorkshire, close partnership working between \nthe \nPTE\n (SYPTE\n)\n and the South Yorkshire districts\n through the South Yorkshire Land Use and Transport Integration (SY LUTI) project\n has helped to ensure that new developments are prioritised around existing public transport corridors and that any sites which are poorly c\nonnected have been outlined as requiring developer contributions towards public transport services. This work has been welcomed on a city region basis, with partners outside of South Yorkshire now requesting LUTI modelling.\n5.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMixed use developments should\n al\nso\n be encouraged to allow people to walk or cycle to key services.\n \nTogether with taking transport into account at the earliest stages of planning, t\nhis could avoid communities becoming isolated and save money on costly trans\nport interventions to fill gaps.\n5.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important to note that connecting isolated communities to services and opportunities is not just a problem for the transport sector to solve, it is the responsibility of all those involved in the planning and delivery of public services.\n \nThere needs\n to be greater recognition among other sectors of the importance of transport to the successful delivery of their policy objectives, and a willingness to invest in it accordingly. Furthermore, there needs to be a \nreadiness\n to consider, and fund, non-transp\nort solutions to the accessibility problems of isolated communities.\n \nC\nloser city region working models\n should help in this respect, although\n \nf\nurther devolution of \nthe \ncontrols and funds that shape public service restructuring would \nalso assist\n.\n \n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity Transport\n (CT)\n operations are embedded in the communities they serve, meaning that they can be very effectiv\ne at understanding what types of services residents want and what gaps \nexist\n.\n CT can offer a flexible means of filling the\nse\n gaps in commercial and tendered bus services.\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCuts to tendered bus services, together with policy developments such as personalised \nsocial care \nbudgets\n and cuts to local authority in-house transport services\n, are leading to more pressure on \nCT\n services which are not always \nready\n to meet demand.\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForms \nof grant funding that the sector has traditionally relied upon \nare fast disappearing\n, impacting on staffing, fare levels and ability to maintain and replace vehicles\n.\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome \nCT operators \nmay\n lack the skills and resources needed to bid for local transport con\ntracts which could potentially offer more financial sustainability.\n \nThe sector could be supported through capacity building to assist in understanding the opportunities available, the surrounding legislation and in\n how to\n meet the basic tendering criteria.\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCloser working with transport authorities can be helpful\n in building understanding and relationships on both sides\n. \nTfGM\n, for example\n, is delivering f\nour new or improved services in partnership with CT operators to connect isolated communities with key em\nployment sites.\n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDfT\n may wish to look at how government and local authorities could promote a healthy CT sector, for example, through a ‘Better Community Transport’ initiative linked to funding to improve fleets. The Department for Business Innovation a\nnd Skills could look at how the sector could be up-skilled \nand how innovation could be encouraged.\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding transport s\ner\nvices\n \nto\n isolated communities\n will always be costly\n and\n,\n at a time when budgets are under pressure, \nmust\n be tailored to demand\n. Demand is rarely\n static\n, meaning that flexibility is required\n. If demand levels suggest that a taxi or demand-responsive transpo\nrt (DRT) service would adequately serve that community’s needs, then provision of thes\ne services should be sufficient, as long as they are well \npublicised\n.\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nervices must\n also\n be affordable for \npassengers\n. Taxis in particular can be \nprohibitively\n expensive.\n \npteg commissioned research in two\n urban\n communities experiencing\n isolation as a result \nof cuts to tendered bus services\n. Residents \n(particularly older and younger people)\n were having to rely more on costly taxi services to get around and were having to cut back on their journeys as a result. \n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is potential to make it easier for taxis to fill gaps in the network through smartcard technology, so that journeys can be pai\nd for without the need to carry cash, or even allow for a certain number of journeys to be pre-paid or discounted\n for certain groups\n, as with the Nexus TaxiCard\n.\n Smartcards also have the potential to enable taxis to be better integrated into local public \ntransport networks, forming\n part of a package for mobility where one card unlocks a range of transport options.\n7.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn respect of taxis, it should\n also\n be noted that there are issues around standards and safety, given that drivers and operators are not bound b\ny safety standards that apply to public service vehicle\n (PSV)\n operators\n (e.g. mandatory breaks, limits on working hours). There should be greater synergy between taxi licensing and passenger transport/PSV licensing regimes.\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key issue is that transport priorities at national level are centred \non creating economic growth - a\n \nvital goal -\n but one that has \nresulted \nin the side-lining of\n social inclusion issues. \nEconomic growth\n priorities are reflected in funding criteria which can make it difficult to secure resources for initiatives serving isolated communities, wher\ne economic returns may be lower or more difficult \nto quantify.\n At local level, this can\n result in such initiatives\n being scaled back and focus shifting towards projects aimed at creating growth, in recognition of Government priorities. \n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe EAC inquiry into transport and accessibility to public services\n \nrecommended that the Government should review its transport funding for local authorities to ensure that pro-accessibility services that are particularly depe\nndent on revenue, rather than\n capital\n,\n expenditure are not disproportionately curtailed.\n8.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunding t\nransport \nin\n isolated communities will\n, however,\n always be challenging as often passenger numbers are low and demand is limited\n, making services costly to provide.\n8.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith regard to rail, for example, new stations or increased services at existing stations are\n \noften unaffordable\n. For isolated communities there would need to be careful consideration given to whether levels of d\nemand would justify the costs, including those associated with\n the slowing down of other services to accommodate an additional stop.\n \n8.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn \nbus, as described above, the bus market outside of London is deregulated and commercial operators are unlikely to choose to run a service that is unprofitable. Where gaps in services emerge, transport authorities must decide whether to fund a \ntendered \nbus \nservice to \ncover unmet transport needs\n.\n Whether they do this will depend on factors such as cost and available budget; the number of people who would use it; whether there are other ways people could\n get around if there was no bus; and likelihood of self-sufficiency in the future.\n8.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCuts to \npublic spending have left transport authorities less able to fill gaps in this way. Tendered bus services are a non-statutory area of spend making them vulnerable as\n transport authorities seek to ensure they can continue to meet their core legal responsibilities (such as funding free off-peak bus travel for older and disabled people).\n8.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUrban areas have been particularly hard hit\n by public spending cuts\n overall\n. In the \n2011-12 Local Government Funding Settlement, funding for Metropolitan Districts fell by around 10% in real terms, compared to a 5% cut in Shire areas, relative to the previous year\n. This impacts on transport spending in the cities as PTEs derive nearly th\ne entirety of their revenue budget income from a levy on District Councils.\n8.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPTEs are doing all they can to mitigate the effects of these funding challenges, including using the powers and options granted in the Local Transport Act 2008 to protect and impro\nve bu\ns services (see\n section five\n)\n as well as investigating alternative solutions such as walking, cycling, DRT, community transport, car sharing/community car initiatives and taxi services.\n8.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘Total Transport’\n approaches\n could also help to ensure that the \nfunding and resources that are available for transport are used as efficiently as possible.\n The public sector provides and funds collective transport in a variety of forms\n,\n \nincluding conventional bus services,\n healthcare services, \nsocial services and educa\ntion transport. \nIn addition,\n there is community transport and other voluntary sector collective provision. These services are often provided through different budgets and by different administrative arrangements and can \nsee\n vehicles\n \nunderutilised for large\n parts of the day whilst elsewhere transport needs go unmet. There is scope for greater pooling of budgets and vehicle fleets to provide a single service more cost effectively. \nInvestigation of such an approach was also recommended in the EAC’s transport a\nnd the accessibility to public services inquiry\n.\n8.10.\n \nThis \nTotal Transport\n approach is already being applied in some areas of the UK but so far to a very limited effect. Some countries in mainland Europe have gone much further and pooled public transport, educ\nation, healthcare and social services budgets into one pot to provide a single transport service – capable of providing a mainstream service which can also flexibly respond to the needs of particular users. \n8.11.\n \nTotal Transport on a large scale is probably mos\nt easily achieved in isolated communities where most public transport is publicly supported, and where the scale of the administration for currently separate budgets and vehicle fleets is more manageable.\n This is not to say that such an approach is straigh\ntforward to deliver or that it will be a suitable in all circumstances. However, there are a range of \nexperiences, both from\n \nthe UK\n and abroad that can be drawn upon.\n Following the publication of our report into Total Transport\n, we hosted a practitioner e\nvent in 2012 aimed at kick-starting the sharing of lessons \nlearnt\n.\n8.12.\n \nMarketing and behaviour change techniques also have a role to play in making transport for isolated communities more affordable by boosting patronage and thereby making services more financ\nially sustainable. Customer engagement and research can help identify passenger needs and motivations and ensure that services provided are the ones people want and will use.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n See for example Clayton, N., Smith, R. and Tochtermann, L.
