[normal]1. I am a private person with a science degree (BA Chemistry, Oxon) and a strong interest in the climate and energy debate, in which I have read widely.

[normal]2.  G
[normal]entlemen, the great difficulty for both Government and the media in this debate is that the British public is not as stupid and uneducated as they might wish.  The public in general might not have an advanced scientific education, but they are not all ignorant and 
[normal]many 
[normal]have a strong sense that they are being mislead and ill-informed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]. Public understanding of the issues involved is quite good, even if
[normal] it does 
[normal]disagree with the present political stance.  People have been told for years that global warming will destroy mankind, and it is all the fault of human civilisation.  However, seeing the climate of the planet has never been stable for 4 billion years, it might be sensible for those trying to get the message across to begin by acknowledging this fact, and to 
[normal]admit
[normal] that human activities are only contributing a proportion to any drivers of change which is happening anyway, and 
[normal]that climate change is
[normal] 
[normal]absolutely unavoidable, and will happen anyway regardless of any steps taken by humans.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]. The matter of who is trusted in this debate is extremely vexatious, as both politicians and much of the media have destroyed trust over the years.  Sadly a proportion of the scientific community is also implicated in some of the reprehensible attitudes and activities, which really does raise the question as to who will be trusted.
[normal]  The IPCC claimed the right to be the authoritative voice, but has been shown to have employed flawed methodologies which have led to nonsensical forecasts.  The BBC, to take another example, has taken such an extreme and biased view, shutting down any balanced debate in total breach of its charter, that it is now not trusted at all in this matter.  Politicians have spent years 
[normal]telling us o
[normal]f the imminence of disaster
[normal] - but that their energy policies would prevent Armageddon and cost little.  We are now faced with rapidly escalating fuel bills, the closure of sections of our manufacturing industry with commensurate loss of jobs and no significant change to global emissions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]. If a more credible picture was described by politicians and their tame scientists it would come across better to the public.  If the public could see that the position being put forward was being genuinely debated by scientists on both side of the 
[normal]argument
[normal] they would be more likely to believe the 
[normal]consensus
[normal] arrived at.  To merely demonise any scientist who has the temerity to disagree is totally self-defeating for proponents of climate change.  David Bellamy was vilified for daring to say that he found the global warming thesis (as it was being expressed then) unconvincing, 
[normal]and many other serious scientists have experienced the same thing.  Even the supposedly serious journal New Scientist published an extraordinarily distorted article by a proponent of wind farms, but would not publish a balancing view on the grounds that the first one was “an opinion”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]. However, public opinion should certainly not be significant in developing climate change policy.  All policy should be developed educated experts in the area who understand all the issues and, more importantly, the positive and negative consequences of any policy arrived at.  There will inevitably be both, and the public knows this, so they will only accept policy if both aspects are explained.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]. It is surely a general truth that the public attitude to any policy will affect their engagement with it.  The two crucial issues are the understanding the public has and their belief that all are working in the same direction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]. The question as to whether the Government has sufficient expertise to understand the rela
[normal]tionship is truly horrifying.  I
[normal]t appears to presuppose that Government is always right, and that it is merely a matter of manipulating public understanding to achieve their aims.  The answer is that while the public have such a deep distrust of politicians and the press there is now little chance 
[normal]that
[normal] the public will follow in a docile manner.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]. Lessons probably can be learnt from other countries, but when the British public see that Spain is cutting its subsidies to wind power, China and America have refused to sign up to the various international agreements to limit greenhouse gases, and that Germany is now building coal-burning power stations, it is a question of what lesson the Government wants to learn.  Both Germany and Switzerland changed their stance on nuclear power post Fukushima, presumably because they feared a tsunami would strike, so are these sound models for our policy makers?
