"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Marie Stopes International &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnsafe abortion that each year causes around\n 5 million women to suffer temporary or permanent disability\n,\n with rates highest amongst poor and rural women. One in four women who undergo an unsafe abortion is likely to develop temporary o\nr\n lifelong disability requiring medical care.\n Women who are dis\nabled as a result of an unsafe abortion \ncan\n face \nparticularly \nhigh levels of stigma \nor can\n lack access to appropriate levels of care and support\n.\n Disability \nresulting \nfrom unsafe abortion is preventable\n,\n and can and should be prevented through the promotion of sex education, family planning, safe abortion services to the full\nest\n extent of the law and post\n-\nabortion care in all cases.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nObstetric fistula, a hole in the birth canal\n,\n \nhas severe physical and soc\nial consequences and a devastating impact on women\n, \nparticularly\n young \nwomen and girls\n who are at most at risk.\n \nThe WHO estimates that more than two million \nyoung \nwomen \nlive \nwith\n untreated obstetric\n fistula in \nAsia and sub-Saharan Africa\n,\n with \n50,000 to 10\n0,000 new cases each year.\n Obstetric fistula is preventable and\n can largely be avoided by delaying t\nhe first pregnancy, preventing female genital mutilation/c\nutting \nand \nensuring \ntimely access to obstetric care. \n&#xa0;\nPersons with disabilities have the same SR\nH needs as other people. Yet they often face barriers to information and services. The ignorance and attitudes of society and individuals, including health-care providers\n, raise most of these barriers -\n not the disabilities themselves. In fact, existing se\nrvices usually can be adapted easily to accommodate persons with disabilities. Increasing awareness is the first and biggest step. Beyond that, much can be accomplished through resourcefulness and involving persons with disabilities in programme design and\n monitoring.\n \n              \n              \n              \nWHO/UNFPA Guidance Note, 2009\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs352/en/\n \nPromoting sexual and reproductive health for persons with disabilities, WHO/UNFPA Guidance Note, 2009 \nhttp://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598682_eng.pdf\n \nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs352/en/\n \nhttp://www.unfpa.org/upload/lib_pub_file/741_f\nilename_UNFPA_DisFact_web_sp-1.pdf\n \nhttp://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70914/1/9789241548434_eng.pdf\n \nhttp://www.who.int/features/factfiles/obstetric_fistul\na/en/\n"
