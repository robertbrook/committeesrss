"&#xa0;\nMemorandum by the BBC Trust The BBC Trust is pleased to offer this written evidence to the Lords Communications Committee as it considers the broadcast of General Elections Debates.  \nGovernance Structure We appreciate that the Committee will be well versed in the governance structure of the BBC, but as this evidence will be available publicly on the Committee’s website, we thought we might be helpful to readers if we begin by explaining the different functions of the BBC Trust and the BBC Executive in general before explaining how the Trust regulates with regard both to the broadcast of the Prime Ministerial Debates in the 2010 election and with regard to any projected General Election Debates. \nIn accordance with the Royal Charter\n, the Trust is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction of the BBC and for exercising a general oversight of the work of the Executive. It is also worth noting that the Trust is responsible for securing the effective promotion of the Public Purposes of the BBC which are set out in the Charter in Article 4 and include sustaining citizenship and civil society (which is of particular relevance to this \ninquiry\n).\n \nThe Executive is responsible for making operational decisions on a day to day basis about the delivery of the BBC's services. The Executive is also primarily responsible for ensuring that the BBC complies with any legal and regulatory requirements imposed on it. Editorial decisions are (ultimately) for the Director General of the BBC to take because he is designated by the Charter to be editor-in-chief and \"accountable for the BBC's editorial and creative output\" (Charter Article 40(3)).\nThe Trust's role is to hold the Executive to account for its performance of its functions, including the BBC's compliance with the general law, regulatory requirements, and the policies, editorial and other guidelines, codes, strategies and priorities set by the Trust. \nThe Trust performs its duties in the public interest, particularly in the interests of licence fee payers. (Charter Article 7) At the highest level, the Trust is stated to be \"the guardian of … the public interest in the BBC\" (Charter Article 22).\nThe Editorial Standards Committee (ESC)\n \n of the BBC Trust has primary responsibility for the exercise of the Trust's functions in relation to editorial standards and policy. This includes leading the Trust's reviews of the Editorial Guidelines; monitoring of editorial standards, \nespecially accuracy and impartiality; considering serious breaches of standards reported to it by the Executive; and determining appeals about editorial issues. The appeals function can lead it to investigate in some depth issues raised by audience complaints. \nIn summary, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is the responsibility of the Executive. The job of the Trust is to set an appropriate regulatory framework and exercise a supervisory function, holding the Executive to account for such compliance.\nThe BBC Editorial Guidelines and Election Guidelines&#xa0;\nThe Trust approves the BBC Editorial Guidelines which apply to the content of the BBC’s services and are designed to “secure appropriate standards”. (Article 24(2\n)(\nd) of the Charter, and clause 43(1) of the Agreement\n.)  \n&#xa0;\nIn 2009 – 2010, the Trust reviewed the 2005 Editorial Guidelines which had been set by the BBC Governors. The Trust publicly consulted on new Editorial Guidelines. They were approved by the Trust and came into force in October 2010.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Trust is the sole regulator for impartiality and accuracy and thus of election coverage in BBC output. \nThe Agreement requires the BBC to do all it can to ensure that controversial subjects are treated with due accuracy and impartiality. This includes drawing up a code giving guidance as to the rules to be applied and doing all it can to secure compliance with it. The code is included within the Editorial Guidelines.  The Trust also approves significant guidance which assists in the application of the Guidelines.\n&#xa0;\nThe guidelines are reviewed every five years. They can be found at this link:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/\n&#xa0;\nThe guidelines which are particularly applicable to any general election debates are Accuracy, Impartiality, Politics, Public Policy and Polls and Editorial integrity and Independence from External Interests. \nIn addition the ESC approves Election Guidelines for every election. Prior to approval the guidelines are placed on the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines site and are brought to the attention of relevant political parties who are invited to submit comments. These comments are reviewed by the ESC alongside correspondence with the Electoral Commission. The BBC must have regard to the views of the Electoral Commission before approving the Election Guidelines\n. (Representation of the People Act 1983, s.93 (3)) As an example of this practise - the current proposed election guidelines for the European and local elections can be found at:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/news/news-2014-01-28-draftelectionguidelines/\n&#xa0;\nAny election debate therefore would also have to comply with bespoke General Election Guidelines. \n&#xa0;\nThe Complaints Framework and complaints procedures set by the Trust&#xa0;\nThe Trust has a role in overseeing and enforcing the BBC's compliance with the Editorial Guidelines through the BBC’s complaints process. \n&#xa0;\nThe Trust sets a framework and procedures within which the BBC will handle complaints. All appeals that raise a matter of substance are subject to a right of appeal to the Trust, and the Trust is the final arbiter as to whether an appeal is for the Trust to determine or not. (Article 24(2\n)(\ng) of the Charter, and clauses 89 and 90 of the Agreement.) The framework and procedures were set by the Trust following public consultation and audience research in 2008 and again in 2012. \nThe overarching Complaints Framework is contained in a Trust protocol beneath which sit specific procedures for particular types of complaint. The editorial complaints procedure which is the procedure which would be applicable to complaints about the election debates can be found here: \nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/protocols/2012/complaints_fr_work_ed_complaints.pdf\nDuring an election significant complaints about election coverage are fast tracked. \nGenerally the Trust considers complaints on appeal regarding broadcast content after it is transmitted. However, there have been occasions where the Trust has considered the principles prior to transmission.\nFor example, the Trust assessed the BBC's decision not to include the leaders of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Plaid \nCymru\n (PC) in the televised Prime Ministerial dates during the 2010 election campaign. The Trust did not seek to substitute its own editorial judgment for that of the Director-General (which would have been contrary to the requirements of the Charter and Framework Agreement), but rather it considered whether all relevant factors had been taken into account in reaching the decision and that the exercise of discretion was a reasonable one.  A link to this decision follows:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/ad_hoc/snp_pl_cymru/snp_pl_cymru.pdf\nAn overarching page covering the press release and the terms of reference of the ad hoc committee that made this decision can be found at:\nhttp://www.bbc.co\n.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/2010/snp_pl_cymru.html\nAn application for judicial review of the exclusion of the SNP and PC leaders was rejected by the Scottish courts. The decision can be found here:\nhttp://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/scot/cases/ScotCS/2010/2010CSOH56.html&amp;query=bbc+and+snp&amp;method=boolean\nConclusionThe Trust is the sole regulator for impartiality and accuracy in BBC output. It acts in the public interest. It has a particular role in ensuring that the integrity and independence of the BBC is protected so that the editorial staff are free to make editorial and creative decisions on behalf of the licence fee payer to inform, educate and entertain and to promote the BBC’s public purposes. It sets Editorial Guidelines which cover impartiality and accuracy and also sets bespoke election guidelines. It can consider fast tracked appeals regarding election content and has done so in 2010 regarding Prime Ministerial Debates.   \nThe Trust sets particular value on the rights of licence fee payers to receive information and ideas and the right of the BBC to impart it (Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights) without interference by public authority. Accordingly it sets a very high premium on the freedom of expression accorded to political speech and is aware that any interference with that must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society. With this in mind the Trust considers that any attempt to circumscribe the arrangements for election debates should be approached with extreme caution. \nLord Patten, in his evidence to the \nLeveson\n Inquiry said that “Producers of BBC content should not only meet the standards set by the Trust and Ofcom but they should aspire in their daily behaviour to set their compass by what is in the public interest and what the audience expect of them.” That is the gold standard that the BBC should aspire to in the creation of all its content and such an approach would serve to protect the public interest in General Election debates on the BBC.\n&#xa0;\n30 January 2014\n1\n&#xa0;\n              \nThe Royal Charter can be found at: \nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/about/how_we_govern/charter.pdf\n              \nInformation on this public purpose can be found at:\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/whoweare/publicpurposes/citizenship.html\n              \nThe terms of reference of the ESC can be found at: \nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/about/how_we_operate/committees/2011/esc_tor.pdf\n              \nThe Agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and amendments can be found at: \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/governance/regulatory_framework/charter_agreement.html\n              \nThe standards protocol which explains the procedure for setting election and other guidelines can be found here:\n              \nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/protocols/2013/b2_editorial_standards.pdf\n&#xa0;\n"
