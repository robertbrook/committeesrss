defaultWdefaultritten Evidence Submitted bydefault NAPIT defaultRegistrationdefaultResponse SummarydefaultCombatting Lack of Consumer Awareness of Competent People:default 
defaultThe creation of
default one consumer facing
default quality mark
default for all competent electricians
default, 
defaultunderpinned by a
default 
defaultlist
default to allow
default 
defaultconsumer marketing to ali
defaultgn across all electrical scheme providers
default should help to increase consumer awareness of compe
defaulttent people
default.
default The additional requirement in the DCLG 
defaultconditions
default of authorisation will also help combat this 
defaultissue:
default 
defaultThe scheme operator shall advertise the scheme, explaining its purpose and benefits, to encourage potential members to join and use by customers.
defaultCombatting Lack of Consumer Awareness ofdefault Building Regulation Requirements:default defaultthe complexity of conveying 
defaultwork that is and is not notifiable coupled with a lack of enforcement of building regulation compliance result in consumer awareness being low.
default 
defaultIf all 
defaultelectrical work which warrants an electrical certificate require
defaultd
default notification under Part P, and the nu
defaultmb
defaulter of routes to notification was
default reduced to 
defaulttwo, 
defaultCPS registered 
defaultelectrical installers
default or DIY signed off by LABC
default, the message would be a lot easier to convey and understand. This approach coupled with giving Local A
defaultuthorities greater powers, such as the abi
defaultlity to issue on the spot fines,
default 
defaultfor
default non-compliance or lack of necessary notification
default would also help raise awareness.
defaultThe edefaultxtent and defaultadefaultdequacy of the review of those carrying out electrical works to which building regulations apply:default If those carrying out work to building regulations are registered with a Competent Person Scheme (CPS), their 
defaultinstallation and testing 
defaultwork, 
defaulthealth and safety measures, indemnity and liability insurance, proof of qualifications, relevant technical documen
defaultts, complaints log, correct testing and safety instruments, in-date calibration certificates, details and evidence of the monitoring of subcontracting staff 
defaultare
default 
defaultinspected 
defaultannually to ensure compliance
default with scheme requirements and building regulations
default.
defaultThe defaultextent of training of those carrying out electrical work under CPS: defaultNAPIT do not agree with t
defaulthe Qualified Supervisor model, requiring only one person within an enterprise to meet the required standard set out in the EAS document
default.
default 
defaultThe removal of the phrase 
default‘defaultor adequately supervised’default at 
defaultclause
default 
default11.1 in the EAS 2012 document
default would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve 
defaultoverall 
defaultsafety levels in the industry. 
defaultEffect of Cdefaultompetition on standards and review of electrical work:default The introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high stan
defaultdards set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain.
defaultAdequacy of Supervision by DCLG of accreditation schemes: defaultS
defaultupervision of scheme providers will be signific
defaultantly improved under DCLG
default’
defaults new Conditions of Authorisation
default which involve rigorous inspections by UKAS
default an independent committee for each scheme operator and an increase in reporting to the Department
default. 
default&#xa0;defaultAbout NAPIT RegistrationdefaultNAPIT Registration is authorised by DCLG to operate 
defaulta
default 
defaultCompetent Person Scheme. The scope of our 
defaultauthorisation enables us to register
default a variety of tradespeople 
defaulta
defaults
default 
defaultcompetent to self-certificate their own work, including: electricians, plumbers, heating speci
defaultalists
default,
default ventilation/ air conditioning 
defaultand building fabric installers

default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere have recently been concerns expressed over the potential for confusion amongst consu
defaultm
defaulters as there is more than one register that references electrical firms registered 
defaultunder Part P of the Building Regulations. In order to overcome these concerns we have recently held a meeting with 
defaultECA, Certsure and the Electrical Safety Council
default and have agreed to seek to develop one ea
defaults
defaultily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a reg
defaultister of all full scope Part P registered electr
defaulti
defaultcians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an ele
defaultc
defaulttrician to do electrical work in their home.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part
default P Scheme Operators in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline, and would lead to the removal from the market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the Electrical Safety Register).  We along
default with the above mentioned organisations have written to the Parliamentary Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe combined resources of all electrical CPS provider
defaults 
defaultshould 
defaultgo a long way to improving awareness of electrical safety in the home and the importance of using com
defaultpetent, registered electricians.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAwareness of the Building Regulationsdefault1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAwareness of the Building Regulations 
defaultrequirements 
defaultalso remains low.
default 
defaultA
default surv
defaultey 
defaultcommissioned by ElectricSafe
default, highlighted
default that only 28.40 per cent of respondents knew what the term “Part P registered electrician” meant and 
defaulta worrying 41 per cent of householders 
defaultwere not aware that it was their responsibility to ensure notifiable 
defaultelectrical work complies with the Building Regul
defaulta
defaulttions. 
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthis is 
defaultlikely to be 
defaultdue to the complexity of the different notifications routes available
default 
defaultand the technical nature of the distinction between notifiable an
defaultd non-
defaultnotifiable electrical work (made mo
defaultre 
defaultcomplicated
default following the re
defaultcent changes to Part P which 
defaultcame into force in April 2013).
default 
defaultWe therefore propose that all electrical work which warrants a defaultBS7671default defaultelectrical defaultinstallation defaultcertificate should redefaultquire notification under Part P, anddefault that the nudefaultmber of routes to notificdefaultadefaulttion defaultbedefault reduced to defaultcertification by defaultCPS defaultregistered electriciansdefault or defaultBuilding Controldefault, defaultallieddefault with an individual licence to practicedefault. defaultThis would make the message to consumers a lot easier to convey.
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the problem is not just
default one of complexity
default. Lack of e
defaultnforcement also undermines the Competent P
defaulte
defaultrson S
defaultcheme provider’s ability to raise awareness among the general public. Householders are currently responsible for compliance 
defaultbut, due to Local Authorities’ lack of resources and r
defaulteluctance to bring sanctions against people with an understandable lack of electrical knowledge, 
defaultare rarely
default penalised
default for
default non-
defaultcompliance.
default There is also no legal requirement for homeowners to have regul
defaultar electrical safety checks, meaning unsafe work 
defaultcan o
defaultften go unnoticed until an accident occurs.
default 
defaultThis enforcement landscape meansdefault there is little to no financial incentive defaultfor the defaultconsumer to make sure work compliesdefault, defaultand therefore little defaultincentive for them to pursue a better understanding of the regulations.default We therefore propose that the CLG Select committee consider recommending that Local authorities are given greater powers, such as the ability to issue on the spot finesdefault to electricians and/or homeowners responsible for instances of Building Regulatidefaulton nodefaultn-compliance or lack of necessary notificationdefault. default&#xa0;

defaultTdefaulthe extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to defaultthe same level of skills;default&#xa0;default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdequacy of training requirementsdefault2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHistorically, the 
defaultentry 
defaulttra
defaultining requirements demanded
default by
default 
defaultscheme providers 
defaulthave been variable.
default NAPIT
default’s
default com
defaultpetency requirements have always 
defaultbeen 
defaulthigh
default. 
default In the past, we
default have required the following qual
defaultifications and experience
default from those wishing to register on the full scope electrical scheme:
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2012 the G
defaultovernment set new Conditions of Authorisation for CPS self-certification schemes following the recommendation of a previous Select Committee
default.
default These con
defaultditions 
defaultmandate much more precise and uniform standards.
default 
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAmong these 
defaultnew conditions is the requirement that all CPS providers
default achieve and maintain UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN 45011: 1998 
default(or
default latest equivalent)
default. 
defaultUKAS deliver accreditation to 
defaultthis standard by ensuring all
default CPS providers
default comply with the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification
default (EAS)
default.
default The EAS 
defaultinterprets and applies the 
defaultgeneric 
defaultstandards set out in the latest conditions of authorisation mandated by DCLG and sets out the minimum r
defaultequirements to be met by an 
defaultEnterprise 
defaultfor them to be recognised as technically competent
default 
defaultby a 
defaultRegistration Body.
default 
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEAS 2012 is a significant improvement on its predecessor (2010). For examp
defaultle
default the
default route to being deemed competent 
defaultwithout
default prior 
defaultexperience is 
defaultno longer
default a
defaultvailable
default under EAS 2012
default. This 
defaulteffectively closes the route to “competency” previously referred to within the trade as the “five day wonder” (an electrician deemed competent after only a short course). NAPIT have never 
defaultjust 
defaultaccepted such minimal 
defaulttraining criteria but it is a positive step for the industry as a whole that this loophole in previous competency requirements has been closed
default. 
defaultThe entry requirements 
defaultnow 
defaultspecify 
defaultthe
default exact
default qualifications requ
defaultired
default,
default leaving no room for
default misapplication
default.
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultC
defaultorrec
defaultt application of t
defaulthes
defaulte specifications will be adequate in preparing
default those applying to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations. Moreover, because 
defaultall CPS providers will be required to assess the qualifications 
defaultand experience of their members in li
defaultne with the
defaultse
default 
defaultrobust criteria
default from 2014
default, steps have already been taken to improve the standard and enforcement of trainin
defaultg requirements which 
defaultshould 
defaultbe allowed to
default take full effect before they 
defaultcan be evaluated for success.
defaultThe extent to which all those workdefaulting for a company are brought up to the same level of skillsdefault2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThough NAPIT broadly support 
defaultthe requirements of the EAS, there is one aspect of this
default document we 
defaultdo not agree with;
default the documents’ 
defaultreference to “assessed enterprises” and 
default“qualified supervisors”
default 
default(QS)
default.
default 
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the EAS document, t
defaulthe term QS
default 
defaultmeans
default that CPS 
defaultproviders
default are 
defaultonly 
defaultrequired
default 
defaultto assess the compe
defaulttency of one individual within each
default register
defaulted enterprise. 
defaultThe QS model may
default 
defaultallow “electricians” who may be 
defaultneither properly trained nor genuinely 
defaultmonitored to carry out electrical installations
default.
default 
defaultQualified supervisors 
defaultare ultimately responsible for confirming the saf
defaultety 
defaultand compliance 
defaultof
default these
default installation
defaults
default but, as part of a busy electrical contracting firm, perhaps supervising multiple individuals, 
defaulttheir ability to adequately check electrical works at all stages of the installation process is questionable. 
defaultT
defaulthe removal of the phrase 
default‘or adequately supervised’ defaultat 
defaultclause
default 
default11.1 in the EAS 2012 document
default  would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve safety levels in the industry.
default2.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNAPIT have ne
defaultver subscribed to this model. Our current application form requires the a
defaultpplicant 
defaultto 
defaultdeclare that they 
defaultprovide evidence of training and or experience for all operatives carrying out installation work
default.
default W
defaulte require the person who takes responsibility for the inspection, tes
defaultt
defaulting and certification to be qualified and to be 
defaultthe
default defaultcomp
defaultetent person
default (often resulting in nume
defaultr
defaultous competent people within a company)
default. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every individual within a company must be assessed every year, but that the same amount of inspection effort can be refocused to look beyond th
defaultis single QS individual and see how competent work is deli
defaultv
defaultered by other individuals
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIndividual licence to practicedefault&#xa0;
default2.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultour 
default2012 submission to 
defaultthe CLG
default Select Committee, we made the case for an individual licence to practice.
default 
defaultAn individual license to 
defaultpractice would mean that every electrician undertaking work which requires an electrical certificate would need to be registered and assessed as co
defaultm
defaultpetent in order to carry out electrical work. 
defaultWe emphasised that 
defaultthis was widely supported by electricians, 
defaulthighlighting an in
defaultdustry wide consultation
default that
default showed
default 78 per cent 
defaultof our members 
defaultsupported the c
defaultase for individual licensing. 
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThough a licence to practice would require new legis
defaultlation, we noted that it 
defaultwould 
defaultremove the need for local authority inspecti
defaulton and create a clear marketplace for the consumer which would improve understanding and awareness. 
defaultRequiring a licence to work on notifiable electrical installations has the
default very real
default potential to significantly reduce dangerous work carried out by un-regi
defaultstered tradespeople
default,
default simplify the process of enforcement
default, ensure sufficient training is unde
defaultr
defaulttaken by all those being paid to undertake electrical work
default and
default push rogue electricians to the p

default&#xa0;&#xa0;

default 
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUpdated technical assessment cri
defaultteria, with which compliance will be mandatory from 
defaultJune 2014, are set out in section 15 of the EAS 
default2012 
defaultdocument
default.
default 
default We feel these require
defaultments are adequate and reflect those
default historically required by NAPIT. 
default4.3 
defaultIn a recent survey, the NAPIT Trade association found that 
default86.4%
default of full scope electrical members thought that the review of elect
defaultrical work carried out by us is
default ad
defaultequate.
default 
default4.4 In surveys carried out over the 
defaultlast 
defaultfour years over 4000 consumers have been 
defaultasked if they were satisfied with the quality of work carried out 
defaultby the NAPIT member involved and 99% have said that they were satisfied with 96% saying that the would recommend the electrician to others.
default4.5 The number of complaints we receive about our 
defaultmembers is also a useful indica
defaulttor of the quality of their 
defaultwork and therefore
default the adeq
defaultuacy of our review procedures
default. NAPIT’s complaint ratio is currently 1 compliant in every 
default5000 
defaultjobs 
default(
defaultor 0.5 complaints a year per 
defaulthundred 
defaultmember
defaults)
default.

defaultTdefaulthe effect of competidefaulttion between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domedefaultsdefaulttic electrical work; default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCompetition between accreditation bodies has a number of effects. Lowering standards to compete is not something NA
defaultPIT have subscribed to as we believe that many competent electricians reject this approach. 
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAny tendency to lower standards is 
defaultalready 
defaultbeing counteracted by the 
defaultcondition that all CPS providers adhere to the revised EAS document (2012)
default which includes higher standards
default. NAPIT believe this will 
defaultmitigate any 
defaultopportunity 
defaultfor s
defaulttandards to be lowered,
default as those who do so 
defaultafter June 2014
default 
defaultwill 
defaulthave their DCLG auth
defaultorisation revoked
default. 
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnother negative aspect of competition wh
defaultich has been seen in th
defaulte past was
default “scheme
default provider
default hopping
default”, where a member of 
defaulta scheme could be excluded, but then join another scheme and carry on working even though they were not deemed to be able to do so by a previous CPS provider
default. 
defaultT
defaulthis is already being addressed by CPS pr
defaultoviders in line with point 14 of DCLGs new conditions of authorisation
default.
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe other side of this argument is that competition gives electrician’s choice. If they are unhappy with a particular aspect of a scheme, they are able to vote with their feet and mov
defaulte to another.  
defaultNAPIT believe this is very positive for the provision of the competent person scheme 
defaultin general 
defaultas it prevents providers from becoming complacent and enco
defaultur
defaultages them to provide 
defaultan efficient service that also represents value for money
default.
default This
default has encouraged scheme providers to 
defaultoffer their members more
default services
default and was one of the factors that influenced NAPITs
default Complete Solution approach
default, an approach which enables our
default members to more easily and cost effectively 
defaultnotify work across multiple work a
defaultreas
default which they have demonstrated competence in
default. 
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high standards
default set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain. 
defaultf) Tdefaulthe adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes. default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDCLG has responde
defaultd
default to the concerns
default a
defaultbout the adequacy of the supervision of CPS providers by introducing standardised 
default Conditions of Authorisation 
defaultwhich all scheme must comply with by June 2014
default.
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe conditions of authorisation mean all scheme providers are now required to gain UKAS accredit
defaultation. UKAS now assess NAPIT
default several 
defaulttimes 
defaulteach 
defaultyear. 
defaultIn 2013 to date UKAS have spent 17 person-days with NAPIT both at the headquarters and witnessing NAPIT at work assessing scheme members. This far exceeds the degree of monitoring that the Department wa
defaults conducting prior to accreditation.
default6.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll the CPS providers 
defaultare also 
defaultnow 
defaultrequired by DCLG to 
defaultsubmit a detailed report on the English and Welsh provision of the Competent Person Scheme, including details of; marketing, complaints
default and 
defaultmembership 
defaultstatistics. 
defaultU
defaultKAS also report their findings to the Department. 
defaultThis gives DCLG a lot more insight in to the way CPS providers are operating.
default6.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne key element of accreditation is that EN45011 requires an independent committee (sometimes called an impartiality committee, 
defaultin NAPIT’s case it
defaults Governing Board) who independently review the operations of a scheme operator, make recommendations as they see fit, and have the power to report the scheme operator to UKAS or the Department if their advice is not followed. DCLG requir
defaulte this to be in place by June 2014 but NAPIT’s Governing Board has been in place since 2009 and has been found to be of great value in helping us to identify and deliver real improvements to the benefit of scheme members, consumers and the government.
