[normal]W[bold]ritten Evidence Submitted by[bold] NAPIT [bold]Registration[bold]Response Summary[bold]Combatting Lack of Consumer Awareness of Competent People:[bold] 
[normal]The creation of
[normal] one consumer facing
[normal] quality mark
[normal] for all competent electricians
[normal], 
[normal]underpinned by a
[normal] 
[normal]list
[normal] to allow
[normal] 
[normal]consumer marketing to ali
[normal]gn across all electrical scheme providers
[normal] should help to increase consumer awareness of compe
[normal]tent people
[normal].
[normal] The additional requirement in the DCLG 
[normal]conditions
[normal] of authorisation will also help combat this 
[normal]issue:
[normal] 
[normal]The scheme operator shall advertise the scheme, explaining its purpose and benefits, to encourage potential members to join and use by customers.
[normal]Combatting Lack of Consumer Awareness of[bold] Building Regulation Requirements:[bold] [bold]the complexity of conveying 
[normal]work that is and is not notifiable coupled with a lack of enforcement of building regulation compliance result in consumer awareness being low.
[normal] 
[normal]If all 
[normal]electrical work which warrants an electrical certificate require
[normal]d
[normal] notification under Part P, and the nu
[normal]mb
[normal]er of routes to notification was
[normal] reduced to 
[normal]two, 
[normal]CPS registered 
[normal]electrical installers
[normal] or DIY signed off by LABC
[normal], the message would be a lot easier to convey and understand. This approach coupled with giving Local A
[normal]uthorities greater powers, such as the abi
[normal]lity to issue on the spot fines,
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] non-compliance or lack of necessary notification
[normal] would also help raise awareness.
[normal]The e[bold]xtent and [bold]a[bold]dequacy of the review of those carrying out electrical works to which building regulations apply:[bold] If those carrying out work to building regulations are registered with a Competent Person Scheme (CPS), their 
[normal]installation and testing 
[normal]work, 
[normal]health and safety measures, indemnity and liability insurance, proof of qualifications, relevant technical documen
[normal]ts, complaints log, correct testing and safety instruments, in-date calibration certificates, details and evidence of the monitoring of subcontracting staff 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]inspected 
[normal]annually to ensure compliance
[normal] with scheme requirements and building regulations
[normal].
[normal]The [bold]extent of training of those carrying out electrical work under CPS: [bold]NAPIT do not agree with t
[normal]he Qualified Supervisor model, requiring only one person within an enterprise to meet the required standard set out in the EAS document
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The removal of the phrase 
[normal]‘[bold]or adequately supervised’[bold] at 
[normal]clause
[normal] 
[normal]11.1 in the EAS 2012 document
[normal] would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve 
[normal]overall 
[normal]safety levels in the industry. 
[normal]Effect of C[bold]ompetition on standards and review of electrical work:[bold] The introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high stan
[normal]dards set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain.
[normal]Adequacy of Supervision by DCLG of accreditation schemes: [bold]S
[normal]upervision of scheme providers will be signific
[normal]antly improved under DCLG
[normal]’
[normal]s new Conditions of Authorisation
[normal] which involve rigorous inspections by UKAS
[normal] an independent committee for each scheme operator and an increase in reporting to the Department
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]About NAPIT Registration[bold]NAPIT Registration is authorised by DCLG to operate 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]Competent Person Scheme. The scope of our 
[normal]authorisation enables us to register
[normal] a variety of tradespeople 
[normal]a
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]competent to self-certificate their own work, including: electricians, plumbers, heating speci
[normal]alists
[normal],
[normal] ventilation/ air conditioning 
[normal]and building fabric installers

[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Th
[normal]e 
[normal]issue 
[normal]of
[normal] the
[normal] lack of consumer awareness of ‘Competent People’ 
[normal]was
[normal] raised as early as 2009 
[normal]by DCLG
[normal].
[normal] It was 
[normal]also 
[normal]emphasised during the consultation stage preceding the April 2013 changes to Part P of the Building Regulations.
[normal] 
[normal]In response to these concerns
[normal], 
[normal]the Governm
[normal]ent
[normal] agreed to
[normal] in
[normal]troduce
[normal] new provisions which required scheme 
[normal]providers
[normal] to promote and publicise the benefits of Competent Person Schemes and raise public awareness of the
[normal]ir
[normal] responsibility to comply with the Building Regulations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NAPIT have adhered to 
[normal]this requirement. We
[normal] have always invested 
[normal]in the promotion of our members
[normal] 
[normal]via NAPIT 
[normal]but
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in the past 18 mo
[normal]nths
[normal],
[normal] we have gone one step further and have invested 
[normal]in significant
[normal] marketing efforts
[normal] and a considerable amount of money 
[normal]in advertising
[normal] 
[normal]to promote 
[normal]the use of 
[normal]all[bold] 
[normal]competent
[normal] registered electricians via
[normal] the ElectricSafe
[normal] R
[normal]egister
[normal]. 
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NAPIT accept that awareness is still low but have reason to believe that 
[normal]recent 
[normal]marketing ef
[normal]forts 
[normal]have g
[normal]one some way to improving this. Our c
[normal]onsumer facing promo
[normal]t
[normal]ion 
[normal]has been 
[normal]considerable
[normal], including
[normal]: a
[normal] local
[normal] radio campaign, reaching
[normal] 29 sta
[normal]tions; a
[normal] local newspa
[normal]per campaign featured in
[normal] 80 newspapers on a quarterly ba
[normal]sis;
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] roadside billboard campai
[normal]gn with advertisements in
[normal] 50 prominent road
[normal]side sites 
[normal]across the country
[normal];
[normal] and a Lon
[normal]don underground marketing drive saw tubecar posters displayed inside 500 trains
[normal].
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There have recently been concerns expressed over the potential for confusion amongst consu
[normal]m
[normal]ers as there is more than one register that references electrical firms registered 
[normal]under Part P of the Building Regulations. In order to overcome these concerns we have recently held a meeting with 
[normal]ECA, Certsure and the Electrical Safety Council
[normal] and have agreed to seek to develop one ea
[normal]s
[normal]ily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a reg
[normal]ister of all full scope Part P registered electr
[normal]i
[normal]cians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an ele
[normal]c
[normal]trician to do electrical work in their home.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part
[normal] P Scheme Operators in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline, and would lead to the removal from the market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the Electrical Safety Register).  We along
[normal] with the above mentioned organisations have written to the Parliamentary Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he combined resources of all electrical CPS provider
[normal]s 
[normal]should 
[normal]go a long way to improving awareness of electrical safety in the home and the importance of using com
[normal]petent, registered electricians.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Awareness of the Building Regulations[bold]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Awareness of the Building Regulations 
[normal]requirements 
[normal]also remains low.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] surv
[normal]ey 
[normal]commissioned by ElectricSafe
[normal], highlighted
[normal] that only 28.40 per cent of respondents knew what the term “Part P registered electrician” meant and 
[normal]a worrying 41 per cent of householders 
[normal]were not aware that it was their responsibility to ensure notifiable 
[normal]electrical work complies with the Building Regul
[normal]a
[normal]tions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]his is 
[normal]likely to be 
[normal]due to the complexity of the different notifications routes available
[normal] 
[normal]and the technical nature of the distinction between notifiable an
[normal]d non-
[normal]notifiable electrical work (made mo
[normal]re 
[normal]complicated
[normal] following the re
[normal]cent changes to Part P which 
[normal]came into force in April 2013).
[normal] 
[normal]We therefore propose that all electrical work which warrants a [bold]BS7671[bold] [bold]electrical [bold]installation [bold]certificate should re[bold]quire notification under Part P, and[bold] that the nu[bold]mber of routes to notific[bold]a[bold]tion [bold]be[bold] reduced to [bold]certification by [bold]CPS [bold]registered electricians[bold] or [bold]Building Control[bold], [bold]allied[bold] with an individual licence to practice[bold]. [bold]This would make the message to consumers a lot easier to convey.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, the problem is not just
[normal] one of complexity
[normal]. Lack of e
[normal]nforcement also undermines the Competent P
[normal]e
[normal]rson S
[normal]cheme provider’s ability to raise awareness among the general public. Householders are currently responsible for compliance 
[normal]but, due to Local Authorities’ lack of resources and r
[normal]eluctance to bring sanctions against people with an understandable lack of electrical knowledge, 
[normal]are rarely
[normal] penalised
[normal] for
[normal] non-
[normal]compliance.
[normal] There is also no legal requirement for homeowners to have regul
[normal]ar electrical safety checks, meaning unsafe work 
[normal]can o
[normal]ften go unnoticed until an accident occurs.
[normal] 
[normal]This enforcement landscape means[bold] there is little to no financial incentive [bold]for the [bold]consumer to make sure work complies[bold], [bold]and therefore little [bold]incentive for them to pursue a better understanding of the regulations.[bold] We therefore propose that the CLG Select committee consider recommending that Local authorities are given greater powers, such as the ability to issue on the spot fines[bold] to electricians and/or homeowners responsible for instances of Building Regulati[bold]on no[bold]n-compliance or lack of necessary notification[bold].

[normal]Adequacy of training requirements[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Historically, the 
[normal]entry 
[normal]tra
[normal]ining requirements demanded
[normal] by
[normal] 
[normal]scheme providers 
[normal]have been variable.
[normal] NAPIT
[normal]’s
[normal] com
[normal]petency requirements have always 
[normal]been 
[normal]high
[normal]. 
[normal] In the past, we
[normal] have required the following qual
[normal]ifications and experience
[normal] from those wishing to register on the full scope electrical scheme:
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2012 the G
[normal]overnment set new Conditions of Authorisation for CPS self-certification schemes following the recommendation of a previous Select Committee
[normal].
[normal] These con
[normal]ditions 
[normal]mandate much more precise and uniform standards.
[normal] 
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Among these 
[normal]new conditions is the requirement that all CPS providers
[normal] achieve and maintain UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN 45011: 1998 
[normal](or
[normal] latest equivalent)
[normal]. 
[normal]UKAS deliver accreditation to 
[normal]this standard by ensuring all
[normal] CPS providers
[normal] comply with the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification
[normal] (EAS)
[normal].
[normal] The EAS 
[normal]interprets and applies the 
[normal]generic 
[normal]standards set out in the latest conditions of authorisation mandated by DCLG and sets out the minimum r
[normal]equirements to be met by an 
[normal]Enterprise 
[normal]for them to be recognised as technically competent
[normal] 
[normal]by a 
[normal]Registration Body.
[normal] 
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]EAS 2012 is a significant improvement on its predecessor (2010). For examp
[normal]le
[normal] the
[normal] route to being deemed competent 
[normal]without
[normal] prior 
[normal]experience is 
[normal]no longer
[normal] a
[normal]vailable
[normal] under EAS 2012
[normal]. This 
[normal]effectively closes the route to “competency” previously referred to within the trade as the “five day wonder” (an electrician deemed competent after only a short course). NAPIT have never 
[normal]just 
[normal]accepted such minimal 
[normal]training criteria but it is a positive step for the industry as a whole that this loophole in previous competency requirements has been closed
[normal]. 
[normal]The entry requirements 
[normal]now 
[normal]specify 
[normal]the
[normal] exact
[normal] qualifications requ
[normal]ired
[normal],
[normal] leaving no room for
[normal] misapplication
[normal].
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]C
[normal]orrec
[normal]t application of t
[normal]hes
[normal]e specifications will be adequate in preparing
[normal] those applying to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations. Moreover, because 
[normal]all CPS providers will be required to assess the qualifications 
[normal]and experience of their members in li
[normal]ne with the
[normal]se
[normal] 
[normal]robust criteria
[normal] from 2014
[normal], steps have already been taken to improve the standard and enforcement of trainin
[normal]g requirements which 
[normal]should 
[normal]be allowed to
[normal] take full effect before they 
[normal]can be evaluated for success.
[normal]The extent to which all those work[bold]ing for a company are brought up to the same level of skills[bold]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Though NAPIT broadly support 
[normal]the requirements of the EAS, there is one aspect of this
[normal] document we 
[normal]do not agree with;
[normal] the documents’ 
[normal]reference to “assessed enterprises” and 
[normal]“qualified supervisors”
[normal] 
[normal](QS)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the EAS document, t
[normal]he term QS
[normal] 
[normal]means
[normal] that CPS 
[normal]providers
[normal] are 
[normal]only 
[normal]required
[normal] 
[normal]to assess the compe
[normal]tency of one individual within each
[normal] register
[normal]ed enterprise. 
[normal]The QS model may
[normal] 
[normal]allow “electricians” who may be 
[normal]neither properly trained nor genuinely 
[normal]monitored to carry out electrical installations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Qualified supervisors 
[normal]are ultimately responsible for confirming the saf
[normal]ety 
[normal]and compliance 
[normal]of
[normal] these
[normal] installation
[normal]s
[normal] but, as part of a busy electrical contracting firm, perhaps supervising multiple individuals, 
[normal]their ability to adequately check electrical works at all stages of the installation process is questionable. 
[normal]T
[normal]he removal of the phrase 
[normal]‘or adequately supervised’ [bold]at 
[normal]clause
[normal] 
[normal]11.1 in the EAS 2012 document
[normal]  would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve safety levels in the industry.
[normal]2.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NAPIT have ne
[normal]ver subscribed to this model. Our current application form requires the a
[normal]pplicant 
[normal]to 
[normal]declare that they 
[normal]provide evidence of training and or experience for all operatives carrying out installation work
[normal].
[normal] W
[normal]e require the person who takes responsibility for the inspection, tes
[normal]t
[normal]ing and certification to be qualified and to be 
[normal]the
[normal] [bold]comp
[normal]etent person
[normal] (often resulting in nume
[normal]r
[normal]ous competent people within a company)
[normal]. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every individual within a company must be assessed every year, but that the same amount of inspection effort can be refocused to look beyond th
[normal]is single QS individual and see how competent work is deli
[normal]v
[normal]ered by other individuals
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Individual licence to practice[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 
[normal]our 
[normal]2012 submission to 
[normal]the CLG
[normal] Select Committee, we made the case for an individual licence to practice.
[normal] 
[normal]An individual license to 
[normal]practice would mean that every electrician undertaking work which requires an electrical certificate would need to be registered and assessed as co
[normal]m
[normal]petent in order to carry out electrical work. 
[normal]We emphasised that 
[normal]this was widely supported by electricians, 
[normal]highlighting an in
[normal]dustry wide consultation
[normal] that
[normal] showed
[normal] 78 per cent 
[normal]of our members 
[normal]supported the c
[normal]ase for individual licensing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Though a licence to practice would require new legis
[normal]lation, we noted that it 
[normal]would 
[normal]remove the need for local authority inspecti
[normal]on and create a clear marketplace for the consumer which would improve understanding and awareness. 
[normal]Requiring a licence to work on notifiable electrical installations has the
[normal] very real
[normal] potential to significantly reduce dangerous work carried out by un-regi
[normal]stered tradespeople
[normal],
[normal] simplify the process of enforcement
[normal], ensure sufficient training is unde
[normal]r
[normal]taken by all those being paid to undertake electrical work
[normal] and
[normal] push rogue electricians to the p
[normal]e

[normal]ery
[normal].

[normal]ans does not just include the

[normal]electrical work carried out by the registrant, it
[normal] also requires that
[normal] th
[normal]ey demonstrate; compliant health
[normal] and safety measures
[normal], adequate indemnity and liability insu
[normal]rance, proof of qualifications, relevant technical documents, a complaints log, correct testing and safety instruments, in-date calibration certificates, details and evidence of the monitoring

[normal]teria, with which compliance will be mandatory from 
[normal]June 2014, are set out in section 15 of the EAS 
[normal]2012 
[normal]document
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] We feel these require
[normal]ments are adequate and reflect those
[normal] historically required by NAPIT. 
[normal]4.3 
[normal]In a recent survey, the NAPIT Trade association found that 
[normal]86.4%
[normal] of full scope electrical members thought that the review of elect
[normal]rical work carried out by us is
[normal] ad
[normal]equate.
[normal] 
[normal]4.4 In surveys carried out over the 
[normal]last 
[normal]four years over 4000 consumers have been 
[normal]asked if they were satisfied with the quality of work carried out 
[normal]by the NAPIT member involved and 99% have said that they were satisfied with 96% saying that the would recommend the electrician to others.
[normal]4.5 The number of complaints we receive about our 
[normal]members is also a useful indica
[normal]tor of the quality of their 
[normal]work and therefore
[normal] the adeq
[normal]uacy of our review procedures
[normal]. NAPIT’s complaint ratio is currently 1 compliant in every 
[normal]5000 
[normal]jobs 
[normal](
[normal]or 0.5 complaints a year per 
[normal]hundred 
[normal]member

[normal]T[bold]he effect of competi[bold]tion between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of dome[bold]s[bold]tic electrical work; [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Competition between accreditation bodies has a number of effects. Lowering standards to compete is not something NA
[normal]PIT have subscribed to as we believe that many competent electricians reject this approach. 
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Any tendency to lower standards is 
[normal]already 
[normal]being counteracted by the 
[normal]condition that all CPS providers adhere to the revised EAS document (2012)
[normal] which includes higher standards
[normal]. NAPIT believe this will 
[normal]mitigate any 
[normal]opportunity 
[normal]for s
[normal]tandards to be lowered,
[normal] as those who do so 
[normal]after June 2014
[normal] 
[normal]will 
[normal]have their DCLG auth
[normal]orisation revoked
[normal]. 
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Another negative aspect of competition wh
[normal]ich has been seen in th
[normal]e past was
[normal] “scheme
[normal] provider
[normal] hopping
[normal]”, where a member of 
[normal]a scheme could be excluded, but then join another scheme and carry on working even though they were not deemed to be able to do so by a previous CPS provider
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]his is already being addressed by CPS pr
[normal]oviders in line with point 14 of DCLGs new conditions of authorisation
[normal].
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The other side of this argument is that competition gives electrician’s choice. If they are unhappy with a particular aspect of a scheme, they are able to vote with their feet and mov
[normal]e to another.  
[normal]NAPIT believe this is very positive for the provision of the competent person scheme 
[normal]in general 
[normal]as it prevents providers from becoming complacent and enco
[normal]ur
[normal]ages them to provide 
[normal]an efficient service that also represents value for money
[normal].
[normal] This
[normal] has encouraged scheme providers to 
[normal]offer their members more
[normal] services
[normal] and was one of the factors that influenced NAPITs
[normal] Complete Solution approach
[normal], an approach which enables our
[normal] members to more easily and cost effectively 
[normal]notify work across multiple work a
[normal]reas
[normal] which they have demonstrated competence in
[normal]. 
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high standards
[normal] set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain.

[normal]The conditions of authorisation mean all scheme providers are now required to gain UKAS accredit
[normal]ation. UKAS now assess NAPIT
[normal] several 
[normal]times 
[normal]each 
[normal]year. 
[normal]In 2013 to date UKAS have spent 17 person-days with NAPIT both at the headquarters and witnessing NAPIT at work assessing scheme members. This far exceeds the degree of monitoring that the Department wa
[normal]s conducting prior to accreditation.
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All the CPS providers 
[normal]are also 
[normal]now 
[normal]required by DCLG to 
[normal]submit a detailed report on the English and Welsh provision of the Competent Person Scheme, including details of; marketing, complaints
[normal] and 
[normal]membership 
[normal]statistics. 
[normal]U
[normal]KAS also report their findings to the Department. 
[normal]This gives DCLG a lot more insight in to the way CPS providers are operating.
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One key element of accreditation is that EN45011 requires an independent committee (sometimes called an impartiality committee, 
[normal]in NAPIT’s case it
[normal]s Governing Board) who independently review the operations of a scheme operator, make recommendations as they see fit, and have the power to report the scheme operator to UKAS or the Department if their advice is not followed. DCLG requir
[normal]e this to be in place by June 2014 but NAPIT’s Governing Board has been in place since 2009 and has been found to be of great value in helping us to identify and deliver real improvements to the benefit of scheme members, consumers and the government.
