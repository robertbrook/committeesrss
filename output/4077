defaultWritten submission from Stephen Biddle (BRC 63)default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefaultI did some electrical work for a domestic customer, as part of a conservatory construction.
default 
default The builder to whom I was subcontracted did a substandard job and was replaced by the customer.
default 
default The replacement builder had all the work to date surveyed.
default 
default NAPIT 
defaultwere requested to survey the electrical work. NAPIT produced a report stating that the electrical work was not compliant
default with current safety standards.
defaultI found the NAPIT report to be incomplete and incorrect and took this up with NAPIT, who failed to res
defaultpond to my phone calls and emails.
default 
default During one phone call I was told by a NAPIT employee that I should file an official complaint to which they must respond within three weeks.
defaultÂ  
default I filed a complaint and had no response. 
defaultAfter further repeated phone calls
default I made contact with a NAPIT director and explained the situation.
default 
default The director sent me an email acknowledging the defects in the report and committed to: 
default1 Send an apology to myself and the customer 
default2 Send a full refund to the customer 
default3 Issue a new r
defaulteport within 3 weeks 
defaultNone of these happened and I arranged to meet a NAPIT inspector at the customer site.
default 
default He stated that the installation was safe and that I could proceed to register it. 
defaultI did not receive a new report or an apology.
default 
default The customer di
defaultd not receive the refund. 
defaultThe customer refused to pay my bill using the NAPIT report as justification.
default 
default I took the case to the county court and the judge dismissed the report and ordered the customer to pay. 
defaultNAPIT are refusing to re-issue the report an
defaultd the refund on the basis that the director who made the commitment has left the company. 
defaultConclusiondefaultAll this leads me to conclude that NAPIT are organisationally and technically incompetent and not fit to hold their status as a register of compete
defaultnt persons.
default 
default I would like to see their contract as such withdrawn.
