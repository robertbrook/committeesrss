[normal]Written submission from Stephen Biddle (BRC 63)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]I did some electrical work for a domestic customer, as part of a conservatory construction.
[normal] 
[normal] The builder to whom I was subcontracted did a substandard job and was replaced by the customer.
[normal] 
[normal] The replacement builder had all the work to date surveyed.
[normal] 
[normal] NAPIT 
[normal]were requested to survey the electrical work. NAPIT produced a report stating that the electrical work was not compliant
[normal] with current safety standards.
[normal]I found the NAPIT report to be incomplete and incorrect and took this up with NAPIT, who failed to res
[normal]pond to my phone calls and emails.
[normal] 
[normal] During one phone call I was told by a NAPIT employee that I should file an official complaint to which they must respond within three weeks.
[normal]Â  
[normal] I filed a complaint and had no response. 
[normal]After further repeated phone calls
[normal] I made contact with a NAPIT director and explained the situation.
[normal] 
[normal] The director sent me an email acknowledging the defects in the report and committed to: 
[normal]1 Send an apology to myself and the customer 
[normal]2 Send a full refund to the customer 
[normal]3 Issue a new r
[normal]eport within 3 weeks 
[normal]None of these happened and I arranged to meet a NAPIT inspector at the customer site.
[normal] 
[normal] He stated that the installation was safe and that I could proceed to register it. 
[normal]I did not receive a new report or an apology.
[normal] 
[normal] The customer di
[normal]d not receive the refund. 
[normal]The customer refused to pay my bill using the NAPIT report as justification.
[normal] 
[normal] I took the case to the county court and the judge dismissed the report and ordered the customer to pay. 
[normal]NAPIT are refusing to re-issue the report an
[normal]d the refund on the basis that the director who made the commitment has left the company. 
[normal]Conclusion[bold]All this leads me to conclude that NAPIT are organisationally and technically incompetent and not fit to hold their status as a register of compete
[normal]nt persons.
[normal] 
[normal] I would like to see their contract as such withdrawn.
