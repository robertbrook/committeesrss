Further defaultwritten evidence from Simon Creighton (LAI 0087)default&#xa0;
default1. During the oral evidence session, the Committee asked if we could provide written evidence
default 
defaultabout the responses made by the prison authorities to inquiries made by Members of
default 
defaultParliament for their constituents (and also the possible impact of the proposed legal aid
default 
defaultreforms on the work load of Members of Parliament). Unfortunately, we are not aware of
default 
defaultany statistics specifically relating to prisoners that may assist the Committee and can only
default 
defaultprovide anecdotal feedback. However, we are aware of some general research concerning
default 
defaultthe impact of legal aid cuts on MPs and their caseloads.
default2. The right of prisoners to send confidential correspondence to MPs is not protected by the
default 
defaultPrison Rules 1999. The Rules only protect confidential correspondence with legal advisers
default 
defaultand the courts.
default It is, however, prison service policy that correspondence between prisoners
default 
defaultand their MPs in relation to constituency business should be treated as confidential in the
default 
defaultsame way as legally privileged communications.
default This does not have any statutory footing.
default“Correspondence between prisoners and their MP, AM and MEP must be treated as privileged but only where they are acting in a constituency capacity (not in a social capacity). This privilege does not extend to Members of the House of Lords, who have no constituency responsibilities, or to Local Councillors. All outgoing correspondence must be appropriately addressed i.e. to the particular Member at (i) the House of Commons, (ii) the National Assembly for Wales and (iii) the European Parliament and should also bear the prisoner’s home or current (prison) address.
default All
default 
defaultincoming correspondence should be written on and enclosed in officially recognised
default 
defaultstationery and displaying an official identifying mark of the appropriate
default 
defaultauthority. However, if an MP, AM or MEP is writing to a prisoner in a purely social
default 
defaultcapacity, i.e. that individual is a personal friend or colleague, then the letter is not
default 
defaultcovered by this privilege and official stationery should not be used.
default”
default3. The Prison Service Instruction on the complaints process (PSI 2012/02) contains advice on
default 
defaultthe right of prisoners to contact MPs in relation to the presentation of petitions but not in
default 
defaultany other context:
default“Every prisoner is entitled to petition Parliament. As a general rule, petitions to
default 
defaultParliament are presented in the House of Commons; a prisoner who is not sure which
default 
defaultHouse to petition should be advised to petition the House of Common 
defaultthrough a Member of Parliament
default. The MP need not necessarily be the constituency MP of the
default 
defaultprisoner. Petitions may also be presented to the House of Lords via a member of that
default 
defaultHouse.”

default4. The terms of reference for the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman, the body that may
default 
defaultreview the work of the Prisons and Probations Ombudsman and deal with complaints arising
default 
defaultfrom the healthcare treatment of prisoners, requires a referral from the constituency MP.
default5. Prior to the introduction of the complaints system in the early 1990s (following the 
defaultWoolf Report
default), it was extremely common for prisoners to contact their MPs for assistance.
default 
defaultAnecdotally, our experience is that this is now far less common. We would, however, expect
default 
defaultthis to again become a routine method of complaint for prisoners and their families if access
default 
defaultto legal advice is removed.
default6. In cases where MPs do raise issues for their constituents in custody, the general practice is
default 
defaultfor a reply to be sent explaining the policy background and assuring the MP that the prisoner
default 
defaulthas been treated fairly and in accordance with that policy. We are not aware of any cases
default 
defaultwhere a substantive decision has been altered as a result of a MPs intervention.
default The
default 
defaultHoward League’s focus on the wider policy issues as well as individual case work means that
default 
defaultmatters affecting individuals are often brought to the attention of MPs. While this is
default 
defaultincredibly important in terms of advocating for systemic change, it has not proved an
default 
defaulteffective means of achieve redress or justice for individuals on its own. In fact, the
default 
defaultinvolvement of MPs very often triggers a referral to a solicitor to provide legal advice and
default 
defaultassistance.
default7. We are able to provide an example for the Committee. This concerned a question that arose
default 
defaultover the legality of the prison service’s policy barring all resettlement leaves for prisoners
default 
defaultwho had default terms for non payment of confiscation orders still to be served.
default 
defaultThe
default 
defaultfollowing is an extract from the court documents lodged by one prisoner who had contacted
default 
defaulther MP for assistance:
default“The claimant also sought the assistance of her Member of Parliament, Sadiq Khan,
default 
defaultwho wrote on her behalf to the Ministry of Justice. On 17 September 2007 Maria
default 
defaultEagle MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State responded to Mr Khan’s letter on
default 
defaultbehalf of the defendant. On the issue of the application of PSO 6300, she stated:
default—
default‘Ms H is also concerned about her ability to maintain her family ties. Once a
default 
defaultperiod in default for non-payment of a confiscation order is enforced, the
default 
defaultprisoner is immediately ineligible for [ROTL] on the original criminal
default 
defaultsentence; ROTL can only take place on the default term to serve providing
default 
defaultthe period is [sic] default is of a reasonable length. Prison Service Order
default 
default6300 Release on Temporary Licence (ROTL) was introduced in January 2006
default 
defaultfollowing a lengthy consultation period. One of the key principles of ROTL is
default 
defaultto maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Although Ms
default 
defaultH’s case appears to be an extreme example, with such a small period to
default 
defaultserve, there are many cases where the confiscation sum itself involves an
default 
defaultextremely large amount of money and a lengthy term in default for non
default 
defaultpayment. The current policy is designed to encourage prisoners to pay the
default 
defaultproceeds of their crime.’
defaultShe went on to explain that a post-implementation review of the PSO had begun
default 
defaultwhich had been delayed but would be completed at the earliest opportunity. Finally
default 
defaultshe expressed sympathy for the claimant.
defaultOn 25 February 2008 Maria Eagle responded to a further letter from Mr Khan
default 
defaultexplaining that the review had not been recommenced as planned due to other
default 
defaultpressing priorities. She said that the Ministry would ensure that the review balances
default 
defaultthe needs of prisoners and their families as well as public confidence in the
default 
defaultadministration of justice.”
default8. In the event no review took place and a subsequent application for judicial review
default 
defaultestablished that the policy was unlawful as it had placed a fetter on the discretion of the
default 
defaultprison Governor.
default Had the prisoner not taken legal proceedings, the situation would not
default 
defaulthave 
defaultchanged at all and the MP would simply have been assured that the system was
default 
defaultoperating properly.
