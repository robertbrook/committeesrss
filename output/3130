[normal]Written submission from AEW Electrical (Edinburgh) [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I have just watched your committee meeting with regards to the above. As an approved electrical with 38 years experience I have never been so dismayed to w
[normal]atch in my view a bunch of self-
[normal]interested 
[normal]Scheme operators who have systematically ran our industry into the ground.
[normal]I live in Scotland so do not have to deal with Part P thank God but I am part of a nationwide forum for electricians and the consensus is that the Scheme providers are out of contro
[normal]l where they run and dictate to the industry and give nothing in return. Interviewing them on a single scheme was quite frankly irritating as they are not interested.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As for a single register I am and have been registered with the Scottish Joint Industry 
[normal]Board of SJIB the English version is the JIB so there is a single registration system that actually works plus let me explain.
[normal]In Scotland I can submit electrical certification “By Enquiry” or in other words I submit the following:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yet if I am a Scheme member I just have to submit my certification with my Scheme number only problem is this in my view
[normal] is abused because it is not policed by the Scheme Providers and it is only when you probe and ask for calibration certificates and qualifications you find there is problems.
[normal]In England a Electrician has to register with a Scheme so when he or she complete
[normal]s certification for the local planning at a cost of £1.90p yet if an electrician who is not scheme registered want to submit certification then its £190.00p
[normal].
[normal] So in my view this does not comply with the European Free Trade Act and discriminates against a le
[normal]gally qualified insured electrician.
[normal]As for Part P well what you were not told was that the Schemes to get more revenue run 6 week courses to train individuals to be domestic electricians good grief it took me 4 years to get to Electrician grade than a fur
[normal]ther 2 to get to Approved status 6 years in total. As for the Scheme policing the system what a joke in my view it is a conflict of interests or turkeys voting for Christmas they just ain
[normal]’
[normal]t going to kick anyone out and lose their revenue stream as for char
[normal]ity status great no shareholders just more money for pay rises pensions and bonuses.
[normal]In my view our industry is being flooded by 6 week Scheme trained and registered “electricians” and the public are aware of this. The Scheme providers are even poaching ea
[normal]ch others members to get their numbers up never mind standards.
[normal]My business is run by referral because in my view the public have no faith in the Scheme providers so please feel free to check my reviews on my 
[normal]Freeindex
[normal] site 
[normal]www.aewelectrical.freeindex.co.uk
[normal] or on my main site 
[normal]www.aew-electrical.co.uk
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] not hard and as for a single body its already exists via the SJIB of JIB and to add they could run a 
[normal]register where Joe public could see if an individual is competent qualified and insured for a fraction of the confusing Scheme Providers.
