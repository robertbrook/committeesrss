"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Alan Reid\n [PH 23]\n&#xa0;\nParliament’s Ombudsman Service&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThis submission is a\n separate\n response \nto \nthe PASC’s questions 11, \n12 and 13, \nbased on my \nrecent \nsuccessful \ncompletion of the PHSO\n’s\n \n“\nobstacle course\n” for \nadmissible \ncomplaints\n.\n \n&#xa0;11. What should be the relationship between the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman andAnswer: As a body of final appeal, when a department’s complaints procedure has not given satisfaction to the citizen.\nAnswer: The Ombudsman should cease to be an officer of Parliament, should become independent, and should be financed by the departments it covers.As a creature of Parliament\n, the\n PHSO has not b\neen properly held to account\n by Parliament.\n \nTo the citizen\n, PHSO accountability \nseems to consist\n of producing \na glos\nsy annual\n report\n,\n and an annual \ncant\ner by the Ombudsman before \nthe PASC. \n&#xa0;\nA citizen \nwith a complaint \ncan \nbe made to \nfeel he is \ntaking on the \nEstablishment\n \nfronted \nby the PHSO, \nwhich g\nives a privileged position not only \nto the \nDepartment \n(vis-à-vis the citizen\n) but \nto \nthe MP who gets the f\ninal letter from the Ombudsman (on first-name terms in my case) \nwi\nth \njust \na copy \nto the citizen\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe office of Ombudsman would surely be more conv\nincing to the citizen \nif the\n holder was not seen as \npart of the Establishment. The current Ombudsman was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire \n‘for services to equal opportunities’ \n- after heading the Equal Opportunities Commission for eight years.  All other Ombudsmen with one exception have been ‘Sirs’.\n  The PASC published a report criticising the giving of honours to people for doing their day job, \nyet it went \nalong with \n(presumably) \nappointing such a member of the Establishment as the current Ombudsman.\n&#xa0;\nThe Ombudsman should \nbe independent, financed by the departments\n it covers. For every \nadmissible complaint \nthat reaches the Ombudsman, a department should \nalso \npay a fee. \nIn this way, each \nselect committ\nee \ncan get involved\n with its de\npartment’s complaints procedures\n and outcomes\n.\nAnswer: Continuation of the present relationship, but on a less chummy basis.Any \nkind of broader relationship between the PHSO and the PASC is difficult to envisage\n.  \nIt is \nsurely \nthe\n PASC \nwhich \nhas allowed the present sorry state of affairs to develop. \nT\nhe PASC works mainly in private, meeting only \noccasional\nly in public, \nto ‘take evidence’.  At the time of writing (mid-September 2013), the Committee has not met since publ\nicly since 2 July 2013, and \ncurrently \nhas \nno scheduled \npublic \nmeetings (although a hearing is \nmentioned \nfor October\n 2013\n).  \n&#xa0;\nThe PASC secretariat may share the same address \nas the PHSO, but they can hardly \ntake any initiative without the say-so of the\nir\n MPs. \n  \n&#xa0;\n12. How effective is the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman as a service for handling complaints that have not been adequately dealt with elsewhere?Answer: On the basis of my experience, ‘ineffective’. Yes\n, \nthe \nMP did forward my \ncomplaint \nand\n,\n \nyes\n,\n \nthe \nPHSO \ndid obtain an apology f\nrom the UK Border Force, but \nto \ng\net the PHSO to act I had to allow myself to become \nangry with a\n PHSO employee, whose one-sided questioning \non the telephone \nwas designed to mak\ne me drop the case. Prior to knowing whet\nher the PHSO would indeed take up \nmy complaint,\n and in connection with the annual hearing of the Ombudsman\n,\n I \nsubmit\nted\n \nevidence \nto the PASC \non the procedural\n \n‘story so fa\nr’\n.\n This was also designed to put pressure on\n the \nPHSO \nto \ntake up my complaint, following that telephone call.\n&#xa0;How should complaints about the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman be handled?Answer: By an Independent Assessor, as an appeal body when a clearly laid-out internal complaints procedure has not given satisfaction.This sh\nould also obviate any \nidea of (theoretically) \nexpand\ning\n \nthe \npresent \nrole of the PASC.\n&#xa0;How effectively does the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman deal with complaints?Answer: On the basis of my experience, unconvincingly. I did get some acknowledgments of \nprocedural \nfaults\n, but I was not convinced that ‘lessons would be learned’.  In one\n case, the PHSO \nwould have been better just to acknowledge that they had made a mistake, instead of giving me a cock-a\nnd-\nbull story about the department’s arrangements\n. \n&#xa0;13. Should citizens have direct access to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman for all complaints, as people already have in respect of complaints about the NHS?Answer: Direct access for all, without having to go through an MP.As things stand, there is even a lack of precision as to whether one can go through \nany\n MP, or only the constituency MP. In my case, as a complainant living outside the UK, PHSO wording implied I could only go though Mr Jenkin MP (as chairman of the PASC). \n&#xa0;\nThe arguments for retaining the ‘MP filter’ seem to rest on a rather idealised view of MPs’ relationships with their constituents. Most people do not know who their MP is (80 %?). People move residence between elections. Many will have never voted for their MP, given the UK electoral system, and may be disinclined to go to the ‘opposition’. Some may know another MP better, through circumstances. Then people get ‘disenfranchised’ for weeks when there are by-elections and general elections, and a new MP has to recruit staff and learn the ropes.  There must be nagging doubts about whether, or when, a certain MP will deal with a case, because of some highly-publicised activity which clearly impinges on their ‘day job’, or because the MP is an important Minister, or simply because of the many recesses when people are not sure if the MP is around. Others might wonder if the MP \nwould indeed forward the case, because the complaint fortuitously goes against that MP’s known\n political agenda, or sponsors\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhat should be the relationship between the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman and MPs and how can it work?Could the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman do more to support MPs’ handling of complaints on behalf of constituents?&#xa0;Answer: This is more for the 650 MPs to answer (11 MPs are on the PASC).&#xa0;\nSeptember\n 2013.\n&#xa0;\n"
