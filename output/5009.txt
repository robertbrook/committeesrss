&#xa0;Written evidence from theAssociation of Policing and Crime Chief Executives [PCC Progress 03]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We note with interest that the terms of reference for the upcoming HASC refer to “the role of the PCP in holding to account the PCC”. As this is not an accurate reflection of the legislation we believe that this has the potential to confuse the public understanding of the way in which police and crime panels actually work. The more accurate view is that police and crime panels must be established by local authorities in order to scrutinize the decisions and actions of their PCC and to exercise their functions in a way that supports the PCC.&#xa0;The distinction between ‘holding to account’ and any other relationship in the governance arrangements may seem slight but this is not semantics; it is a key component of the new constitutional model, something that – as Committee members will be aware - was evident in the debates during the passage of the Bill and the subsequent statutory framework established under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011.&#xa0;The express duties of ‘holding to account’ and the relationship that this implies are fundamental to the new governance arrangements for policing and crime.   The PCC (or the London equivalent) holds their chief officer of police to account for the delivery of policing in their area, while the PCC is, in turn, held to account by their electorate.  &#xa0;The PCP has a number of key statutory functions, principally around the setting of the local precept, the Police and Crime Plan and the appointment of senior officer holders; the panel is also responsible for dealing with non-criminal complaints about the conduct of the PCC and their deputy if they have one. The PCP must support the effective exercise of the functions of PCC.&#xa0;&#xa0;We request that this issue of clarification is brought to the attention of the Chair and hope that these brief but important points will assist the committee in their deliberations.&#xa0;&#xa0;                                                        Miranda Carruthers-Watt
