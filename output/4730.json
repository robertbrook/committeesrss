"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) (HCS0015)\nThe National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) welcome the opportunity to submit \nour views as part of TRANSCOM’s inquiry into the Government’s maritime policy\n strategy\n.\nThe RMT \norganises\n \naround 7\n,000 \noffshore workers, including\n d\nrilling, engineering/maintenance, diver, \nand catering grades\n,\n \nand \nall of these workers \nrequire helicopter \ntransport to and from installations on the UK Continental Shelf\n a\nt the start and end of their 2 or 3\n week long tours\n.\nKey Points&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1 \n              \nThe offshore unions, RMT, Nautilus, Unite, Balpa and GMB are\n calling \nfor \na public inquiry into \nthe safety\n off\n \nhelicop\nter transport\n in the\n offshore\n industry\n which would cover\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 1980 there have been nine fatal accidents involving helicopters operati\nng in the offshore oil and gas industry, claiming the lives of 114 offshore workers and helicopter crew. There were 44 reportable non-fatal helicopter incidents in the offshore sector over this period.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is 25 years since the Piper Alpha disaster in the \nNorth Sea and 23 years since the publication of the Cullen Report which was a watershed moment for operational \nsafety\n in the offshore oil and gas industry. \nKey amongst Cullen’s 106\n recommendations (all of which were accepted by the Government of the day an\nd industry) \nwas to institute a safety culture of ‘continuous improvement’ in the offshore industry. \nWe believe that this culture of continuous improvement is critical to improving the safety record of offshore helicopter operations. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe cost of such an \ninquiry would not be prohibitive, given the scale of the industry’s annual contribution to\n national tax revenue (\n£10.6 billion in 2011-12\n). \nFor example,\n the House of Commons Library recently estimated that the \nfull \ncost of the Cullen Inquiry in today’s pr\nices would be £5.7m\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the wake of the Clutha bar tragedy in Glasgow\n on 29\nth\n November this year\n, RMT also accept that there is a serious case for a full public inquiry into all aspects of helicopter transport\n \ncovering operations \nbeyond the offshore \nsector\n, including\n police, air ambulan\nce and air-sea rescue\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is notable that the\n model of helicopter, EC\n 135, involved in the \nClutha Vaults incident is a Eurocopter\n manufactured machine\n. The models of helicopter that transport the vast majority of offsh\nore workers, the EC225 Super Puma and AS332 L, L1 and L2 are all Eurocopter models.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nfive incidents, two of them fatal, involving helicopters in the North Sea since February 2009 should press th\ne Government into concerted and effective action to improve the \nsafety record of helicopter \noperators\n and their operations\n in the UK Continental Shelf. Yet the current approach is purely reactive, in terms of the Air Accident Investigation Branch and Civil\n Aviation Authority reports, as demonstrated in response to the fatal accident involving a Eurocopter AS332 L2 on 23\nrd\n August this year which claimed the lives of four offshore workers. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRMT\n is concerned at the variation i\nn practice that exists amongst he\nlicopter companies operating in the North Sea\n and the potential consequences of this in terms of the safety of offshore oil and gas workers\n. For example, Bristow Helicopters operate to a \"gold standard\"\n,\n essentially the set of standards applied in the Norwegian sector \nwhich are widely acknowledged\n as more robust than those in place for the UK sector. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf\n the “gold standard” in inspection, \noperating procedures, \ntraining and maintenance in operation at Bri\nstow and in the Norwegian sector had been in place in the UK sector,\n \nwe believe that \nfour \nout \nof the five incidents \nsince February 2009 \npotentially could \nhave been avoided\n, including the fatal incidents on 1\nst\n April 2009 and 23\nrd\n August 2013 which claimed \na total of 20 lives\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVariations between minimum and “gold” standards amongst offshore helicopter operators are a source of concern in the specific area\ns\n of pilot training\n and operating procedures\n. Bond and CHC, for example, only train their pilots to the\n minimum standard and industry sources tell RMT that this is because the companies are under no statutory obligation to achieve higher standards in this and other\n areas, so this extra cost is avoided. In our view, Norwegian standards should be adopted acro\nss the industry and this standardisation should be set in law.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHistorically, helicopter transport in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was not as safe as that provided for their offshore colleagues in the UK. Between 1966 and 1989 the fatality rate wa\ns 4.1 for the Norwegian sector and 3.7 for the UK sector per million person flight hours. This difference continued over the 1990s with a fatality rate of\n \n1.6 in the UK compared to 2.3 in the Norwegian sector between 1990 and 1998. \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the decade between \n1999 and 2009, however, there were no fatal accidents in the Norwegian sector (a nil rate) whilst the UK’s fatality rate shot up to 5.6 – a deeply worrying reversal of the historic, downward trend across the North Sea. Furthermore, 11 out of the 12 helicop\nter accidents in the North Sea between 2001 and 2009 were in the UK sector.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Norwegian sector has a different inspection regime and different regulations applying to helicopters and helicopter flights in the North Sea. All of these have been introduced over the last 12 years or so and explain the marked improvement in the safet\ny record. \n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRMT welcome the C\nivil \nA\nviation \nA\nuthority\n’s announcement on 24\nth\n September \nof the review of helicopter operations in the North Sea. We note that t\nhis will involve work with the h\nead of helicopter operations at the Norwegian CAA\n (as well as officials from the European Aviation Safety Agency)\n, comparing the record of helicopter operations in the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. \nWe await with interest\n the publication of the CAA’s recommendations in early 2014.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n \nRMT also s\nupport the introduction of a system of guaranteed access to seats for trade union officials on helicopters travelling to and from offshore installations. Not only would this \nremove a significant barrier to improving \nthe\n health and safety culture offshore, \nit would also provide offshore workers with greater awareness of their workplace rights, as well as benefiting the performance of helicopter operations in the North Sea which is in the interests of all concerned.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.11\n \nFollowing the fatal incident on 23\nrd\n Augu\nst, the RMT met with industry representatives to discuss a number of issues, including regular trade union access to offshore workers at heliports and on installations\n with some positive progress being made\n. S\nome \nsubsequent progress has been made in terms\n of \naccess to the workforce at \nbut\n progress on trade union access to offshore workers in their place of work (i.e. on installations in the North Sea) has slowed. RMT support amendment to the existing law, if necessary, to ensure that \noffshore workers have \nregular access to their trade union representatives when they are working on installations\n which can be\n for period\ns\n of up to three weeks at a time\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role and effectiveness of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) \nis at risk \nfrom two recent developments. Firstly, we believe that proposals\n to extend the regulatory remit of the \nE\nuropean \nA\nviation \nS\nafety \nA\ngency (EASA)\n \nto cover helicopter operations in the UK continental shelf will dangerously undermine the responsiveness and loca\nl knowledge of the UK offshore sector that the CAA has built up over a number of years\n. \nRMT argue that member states with extensive helicopter operations central to the transport of workers in an industry should retain the powers to regulate that sector. \n&#xa0;3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecondly, the Coalition Government’s decision to\n \ncut\n 120 posts \nat the CAA is a serious threat to effective enforcement of the regulatory framework and, therefore, increases the risk to offshore workers obliged to use helicopter transport because transport\n by sea takes too long. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is not to say, however, that there are no complaints about or concerns over the CAA’s regulatory performance. For example, the CAA’s response to the fatal incident off the coast of Shetland on 23\nrd\n August was not widely regar\nded as sufficiently strong to prevent a further decline in confidence of offshore workers in this mode of transport or the Super Puma models.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also worrying that the CAA \nhave only limited powers of enforcement on \nhelicopters\n operating within the UK, \nbut registered elsewhere.\n Clarity needs to be established in this area and we would prefer those regulatory standards to be brought up to a high level, rather than down to a lower level which is a potential consequence of EASA’s regulatory power grab.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nour view, the Government should take its cue from the H\nelicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG)\n on which the offshore trade unions, Health and Safety Executive, \nCAA, \noil and gas industry representatives and helicopter operators sit, before taking any decisio\nns that affect the regulations applying to helicopter operators in the offshore sector.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, in order to regain the confidence of the offshore workforce in helicopter transport, any decisions that the Government makes on the future regulatory fram\nework applied to offshore helicopter operations should be consulted on with workers and their trade union representatives,\n at the very least.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1 \n              \nWe are also concerned at the reliability of the Department for Transport’s \nstatistics on the offshore helicopter fleet, including the range of helicopter models used to transport offshore\n workers. Our concern has been \ncaused by a recent written answer\n to a question from Grahame Morris MP requesting information on the composition\n of the offshore helicopter fleet. I\nncredibly, the Super Puma EC225 and\n AS332 L1\n \nmodels were not included in the Government’s answer.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nSuper Puma models AS332 L, L1, L2 and EC225 account for 60% of the helicopter fleet currently transporting the vast m\najority of the 30,000 strong workforce employed in the UK offshore oil and gas industry. That is 45 out of a fleet of 75\n which has clocked up millions of flight hours and passengers \nover the last ten years alone\n. \nT\nrade unions on the H\nelicopter Safety \nS\nteer\ning \nG\nroup\n agreed with the operators’ decision to ground Super Puma models following \nthe fatal incident on 23\nrd\n August 2013.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nThe EC225 model was taken out of service following two non-fatal emergency ditchings in the North Sea in May and October 2012. \nIt had only been returned to service in the offshore sector a matter of weeks before the fatal accident on 23\nrd\n August 2013 involving a Super Puma AS332 L2.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nTwo events prior to the 23\nrd\n August incident are \nvital to consider in the context of offshore\n \nworkers’ \nconfidence in the safety of helicopter transport in the North Sea. Firstly, a survey of 1,600 offshore workers in May 2013 by the Step Change in Safety body, a coalition of the safety regulator HSE, the 5 trade unions and the oil and gas industry,\n found that nearly 9 in 10 (86%) of offshore workers did not trust the EC225 model. It was clear from this that trust in helicopter transport in general had declined significantly amongst the offshore workforce, before the fatal accident on 23\nrd\n August. As\n the Step Change in Safety official Les Linklater commented in industry press coverage of the May survey’s finding: “\nWe cannot think of this as an EC225 issue...The EC225 will come back and will be safe to fly again, but there are other airframes out there\n and there are confidence issues.”\n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nSecondly, the reported comments\n of a helicopter company (CHC) employee in response to an offshore worker’s concern over the safety of the EC225s has served to anger offshore workers and highlight a culture of macho bullying that exists with the tacit acceptance of the employers. Again t\nhis episode occurred before the accident on 23\nrd\n August, but also serves to highlight the problems over confidence in helicopter transportation that are ingrained in the workforce in the offshore sector.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 \nIt should also be noted that the “Boots On” cam\npaign to reassure and support offshore workers was agreed and launched by\n members of\n the HSSG, in response to the \nfurther concern over \nhelicopter safety raised by the fatal incident on 23\nrd\n August. RMT believe that this unified approach is the most effecti\nve way of improving the health and safety of all offshore workers, on installations and on the helicopters used to transfer them to and from the workplace.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1 \nThe RMT supports Patricia Ferguson MSP’s \nInquiries into Deaths (Scotland) B\nill \nand would urge \nTranscom to consider\n apply\ning\n pressure on the Scottish Government, via the Scotland Office, HSE and CAA to support this Bill which contains much needed reform to the fatal accident inquiry process in Scotland that attends such tragic acc\nidents. \nThe consultation on the Bill is open to responses until 31\nst\n January 2014\n. \nWhilst all effort must be expended in protecting the lives and well being of offshore workers in the North Sea, they must also be assured that access to justice will be swi\nft, straightforward and effective should \nthe worst case scenario be realised\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 To further illustrate the need for reform in this area, we point to \nthe \nunacceptable \nexperiences of the families of the 14 offshore workers and 2\n air\n crew who died on 1\nst\n April 2009 in an incident north east of Peterhead involving a Super Puma AS332 L2, the same helicopter model involved in the 23\nrd\n August \nincident. The families of those who died in April 2009 are still waiting for the Procurator Fiscal to open the Fatal A\nccident Inquiry into this tragic episode. Whilst that inquiry will finally commence on 6\nth\n January 2014, a preliminary hearing \nin November\n was cancelled at the last minute, leaving the bereaved relatives who had travelled to Aberdeen from all over the UK s\neverely inconvenienced and again asking why such a significant inquiry into the death of their loved ones should be subject to constant delay and its terms of reference, powers and scope, so severely \nrestricte\nd.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n6\n&#xa0;\n Quoted at \n3.2 \nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/07/5746/3\n \n \nHansard \n27\nth\n November 2013, Col 127\nWH\n.\n \nhttp://www.itfglobal.org/news-online/index.cfm/newsdetail/9430\n \n \nhttp://www.easa.europa.eu/rulemaking/docs/npa/2013/NPA%202013-10.pdf\n \n \nHansard \n2\nnd\n December 2013 col. 506W\n \nhttp://www.energyvoice.c\nom/2013/06/nine-in-10-oil-workers-dont-trust-ec225s-after-ditchings-survey-finds/\n \n \nhttp://ww\nw.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/10268574/Helicopter-crash-workers-told-to-put-big-boy-pants-on-after-expressing-safety-fears.html\n \n \nhttp://www.scottish.parliament.uk/getti\nnginvolved/66152.aspx\n \n"
