defaultThe following evidence is submitted on behalf of the Scottish Ladies’ Golfing Association (SLGA) and the Scottish Golf Union (SGU), the respective bodies for the governance of amateur golf for women and men in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;defaultThere are 25,974 female adult playing golf club members in Scotland and 2660 female juniors (under 18). In addition, there are 6576 non-playing female members. Since 2004, the number of female adult playing members has fallen by 26.88% whilst the number of male adult playing members has fallen by 14.59% during the same period. Of all the playing members in Scotland, 12.37% are adult female and 1.27% are junior female.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 2011 Scottish household survey indicates that 8% of Scots over 16 play golf but that when gender is considered, 15% of male Scots and only 2% of female Scots play.
default&#xa0;
defaultFacilitiesdefault&#xa0;defaultScotland does not suffer from a lack of supply with one of the highest rates of golf course per head of population in the world (1 per 9,800 people). Furthermore, there is adequate provision of practice facilities thanks to a combination of private sector development (clubs) and investment from Sportscotland.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe barrier facing a growing number of female golfers is access to these facilities. Historically, golf was a sport played by working men at the weekend and by non-working women during the week. Accordingly, it was typical to find a club where lady members paid a lesser fee than her male counterparts with a proportionate loss of benefit or more specifically, access to the course at weekends. For many existing lady golfers, such a situation was not just acceptable but desirable.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, since the Equality Act (2010) and in accordance with advice from SLGA and SGU, clubs have removed inequality of membership cost based on gender and accordingly, many female members are paying a much higher price for their membership than previously. The challenge that is emerging is one of some clubs now charging the same fees for membership for men and women but continuing to provide access to the course on historical precedent. This provides a significant barrier to women who work during the week in that women’s competitions continue to be arranged on weekdays and access to the course at weekends is restricted.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinancedefault&#xa0;defaultThe SLGA has found it consistently difficult to attract sponsorship over recent years whereas SGU has enjoyed much success in this area. In 2012/13, SLGA generated £10,000 in cash sponsorship and £5,500
default in kind whereas SGU generated £353,667 in cash and £213,750 in kind. To some extent, this disparity can also be attributed to the staff resource at SGU which enables a significant commercial approach whereas SLGA is a much smaller organisation.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn recent years, some sponsors have approached both organisations, for example, to sponsor both men’s and women’s teams, and there is increasing evidence that some sponsors take the issue of gender equality very seriously.
default&#xa0;
defaultInformation regarding prize money can be obtained from the European Tour and Women’ European Tour.
default&#xa0;defaultMediadefault&#xa0;defaultAccurate data specific to golf in Scotland is not available. However, our experience would reflect more general data regarding the lack of media coverage for women’ golf.
default&#xa0;
defaultParticipation decreasingdefault&#xa0;
defaultIronically, the Equality Act (2010) has served to decrease the number of female memberships in Scotland, as we predicted in our consultation response at the time. As highlighted above, historically, women paid a lesser fee and so the equalisation of fees has driven women out of golf club membership for economic reasons. It is hoped that the financial equality now in place will attract a new generation of lady golfer but there is no evidence of this to date.
default&#xa0;
defaultPerhaps a more significant issue is the access to facilities for women. As outlined above, women typically played during the week and men at weekends. Unfortunately, this practice still tends to prevail in many clubs due to a combination of factors. In some cases, it is a male dominated committee who fail to understand that many women golfers work Monday to Friday and so don’t provide access to the course at weekends. In other cases, the committee does provide such access but the women’s committee fall foul of the same assumption and reject access at weekends because they are quite happy to play during the week. Both scenarios provide an unwelcoming message to prospective women who work for a living.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs with most sports, golf enjoys great levels of equality when introducing the game to school children but the participation rates amongst girls falls significantly from age 13. One factor on golf’s favour is that body image can be less of a barrier than in other sports, golf being a game that can be played by almost any person, irrespective of body shape, age or gender.
default&#xa0;
defaultVariety of sports at schoolsdefault&#xa0;
defaultIt is assumed that the Inquiry will already have statistics from Sportscotland regarding participation in school sports. Golf enjoys the highest levels of participation through our ClubGolf programme, with 81% of 9-year olds (P5) being introduced to golf in 2011/12 and over 220,000 since the programme’s inception.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, we are acutely aware of the level of provision across a wide range of sports and we seek to position golf alongside other sports, especially for those girls who for whatever reason, are less engaged by the more physically demanding sports.
