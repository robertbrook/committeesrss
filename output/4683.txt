[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;ii. As part of improving their provision for financial education we encourage the schools involved to form meaningful and lasting partnerships with the supporters (funders) of the programme. Supporters currently include Experian, Santander, JP Morgan, the Building Societies Trust, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Threadneedle and M&amp;G Investments. We facilitate financial education employee volunteering opportunities to make financial education real and relevant to young people’s lives, and to help pupils link learning in the classroom with life outside. Appropriate inputs from private sector industry experts can make a real impact on outcomes for students and can add significant social capital to disadvantaged young people, particularly in relation to their aspirations around work, career choices and future lifestyle.iii. Crucially, as an independent charity with financial education expertise, we provide an essential quality assurance role in ensuring that information and resources used by teachers and students are impartial and free from branding. We also ensure supporters’ employees are adequately prepared for their volunteering experiences so the best possible outcomes are achieved for students. 

[[[pfeg]]] also facilitates a strong, practice-based teacher network on behalf of the schools involved with the programme.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
