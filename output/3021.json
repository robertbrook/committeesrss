"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Country Land and Business Association &#xa0;&#xa0;\nQuestion 1: Do you think the Government should introduce a biodiversity offsetting system in England? \n&#xa0;\nYes, very much so. We have been \nmaking the case for market based solutions, to environmental problems, including offsetting, since 2009 and the publication of our report “Private Solutions to Public Problems”.\nIn an age of austerity, \nwe need to be looking at new ways to pay \nfor biodivers\nity. \nEven if the budget for the new CAP is only marginally less than the current one, it is unlikely that there will be sufficient public funds to do meet all of society’s aspirations in the long term.  One of the most straightforward ways of levering in m\nore funding is through ecosystems markets by which those who benefit from the provision of environmental  services contribute to the costs; particularly developers being required to provide offsets to replace \nthe loss of \nbiodiversity as a condition of obta\nining planning permission. \nSimilarly, there is of course the requirement for the \nprovision of compensatory habitat under the Habitats Directive. \nHowever, we would emphasise that \nall \nthese arrangements will only find favour with landowners if they enter\n in\nto them \nvoluntarily. \nAny system based on or involving the comp\nulsory acquisition of land will\n be unacceptable to the vast majority of landowners. \nAs such we see \noffsetting \nas being primarily a commercial matter with the landowner deciding that he wishes to dedicate his land for conservation purposes so long as the price is right. \nQuestion 2: D\no you think the Government’s objectives for the system and the characteristics the\n Government thinks a system would display are right? \n&#xa0;\nAlthough we do not claim to speak for the sort of developers likely to be obliged to provide offsets, we think that anything that brings certainty to the planning system by enabling developers to predi\nct from the outset what is expected of them will result in a faster \nand almost certainly cheaper \nsystem. Nevertheless, the system must not have the effect of making much needed small scale developments in the countryside unviable. \n&#xa0;\nWe strongly believe tha\nt offsetting will bring net benefits for biodiversity. \nWe agree with the proposed characteristics. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 3: Do you think it is appropriate to base an offsetting system on the pilot metric? If not is there an alternative metric that should be used? \n&#xa0;\nW\ne support the aspiration that the metric needs to be both simple and able to cope with a range of habitat types.  We are not aware of any other metric which better achieves this.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 4: If you think the pilot metric is the right basis for an offsetti\nng system: \n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre there \nany other factors which should be considered when quantifying biodiversity loss and gain?\n&#xa0;\nWe think the factors themselves are correct, but some subdivision may be appropriate.  For example, it would be useful to include a specific reference to “age” under distinctiveness. \n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre the weights given to the different factors appropriate?\n&#xa0;\nYes \n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre there any other changes you think should be taken into account? \n&#xa0;\nWe are not aware of any. \n&#xa0;\n(Please also refer to questions under section 6) \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 5: Do you think offsetting assessment should be used when preparing a planning application for a pr\noject? \n&#xa0;\nYes, subject to considerations such as thresholds.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 6: D\no you agree that it should be the responsibility of planning authorities to ensure the mitigation hierarchy is observed and decide what offset is required to compensate for any \nresidual loss\n?  \nIf not, why, and how do you think offsetting should be approached in the planning system? \n&#xa0;\nWe do think it should be the responsibility of the planning authority.  But we are very conscious of the need to avoid placing additional burdens on\n developers. \nThe amount of information a developer is obliged to supply in support of an application is already excessive. \nAs such we suggest a short statement\n, for consideration by the planning authority, \nsetting out how he has complied with the hierarchy\n should be sufficient. \nIf a developer is required to spend time and money in obtaining consultants reports it will defeat one of the main objectives of offsetting. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 7: Do you think biodiversity offsetting should have a role in all development con\nsent regimes?\n \n&#xa0;\nYes. We see no reason to differentiate between the various terrestrial development consent \nregimes. We would support the introduction of an offsetting obligation for HS2\n and \nother\n large infrastructure projects.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 8: Do you think developers should be able to choose whether to use offsetting? If so what steps could Government take to encourage developers to use offsetting? \n&#xa0;\nAlthough instinctively we would prefer a voluntary approach we suspect, to be viable, the system will need to \nbe mandatory\n, subject to thresholds, \nboth in terms of the \nassessment and \nthe requirement \nto offset\n.  Unless the system is mandatory we \ndoubt we \nwi\nll be able to ensure the level of investor confidence required to produce the number of offset sites required. Landowners will not think it worth their while looking into offsetting if there are only a few random developers looking for offsets. \n&#xa0;Question 9: If\n you think developers should be required to use offsetting do you think this requirement should only apply above a threshold based on the size of the development? What level should the threshold be? \n&#xa0;\nYes.  We support the use of thresholds rather than\n requirements to assess the significance of the developments impact. \nFrom our experiences with the concept\n’\ns use under the Habitats Regulations and the EIA Directive, s\nignificance\n is \ndifficult to measure and invariably requires the use of consultants.  \n&#xa0;\nWe suggest that the threshold should be based on the viability of the development.  It should certainly not be so low as to discourage the small scale developments in rural villages or settlements tha\nt are required to deal\n with the lack\n of housing in the c\nountryside.\n On this basis we believe it should be at least 10 units. \n&#xa0;\nThere is no discussion in the consultation paper about what the thresholds would be for other developments, such as road building. We suggest there should be no thresholds in such cases\n. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 10: Do you think there should be constraints on where offsets can be located? If so what constraints do you think should be put in place? \n&#xa0;\nThe location of offsets is a difficult issue. We can see merits in consolidating the offsets resulting \nfrom a number of small developments in one location to create something bigger and better, or to fill in the gaps between protected sites as per the Lawton report.  \n&#xa0;\nMoreover, if \nthere is a\n requirement that the offset must be local to the development, the\nre may be a difficulty with the number of potential offset providers available. In some localities with only a small number of landowners, those landowners could charge “ransom values” to provide the requisite offsets. \n&#xa0;\nNevertheless, we understand the con\ncerns that \nsuch an approach may result in the offset being some distance from the related development and local people suffering the possible detrimental impact of the development without obtaining the benefit of the offset.  \n&#xa0;\nAs such whilst the offset do\nes not have to be next to the development it should not be too far away\n.  \nAs a compromise between these various factors we suggest that\n,\n at \nthe very least\n,\n the\n development and the offset \nshould be in the same county, although we \nappreciate that this is not\n an ideal situation. If you develop on the northern border of a county then your perfect offsetting site may be a mile away across the boundary and you may be searching for a suitable site 30 miles away further south to stay with the same county\n.\n \nIt may be\n that localities based on other than \nadministrative \nboundaries could also be used, such as water catchments.\n \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 11: D\no you have any comments on the analysis set out in the impact assessment? \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 12: Do you have evidence that would help refine the Government’s analysis of the costs and benefits of the options considered in this paper? In particular, evidence relating to: \n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe amount of compensation already occurring where there is residual biodiversity\n loss which cannot be avoided or adequately mitigated \n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe method for estimating costs and their magnitude \n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe method for estimating benefits and savings and their magnitude \n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow to capture the wider social and environmental benefits of maintaining England’s stock of biodiversity and delivering a coherent ecological network \n(e)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLikely take up of offsetting under a permissive approach \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 13: Do you think offsetting should b\ne a single consistent national system without scope for local variation? \n&#xa0;\nYes, \na single consistent national system\n is essential.\n  \nTo \nwork offsetting will require a nationwide market and that in turn requires one nationwide system.  \nThere are already a \nmass of local schemes out there\n, each\n with \ntheir own exponents. It will make developers and landowners lives difficult if everyone has to get their minds around different schem\nes in every part of the country.\n \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 14: Do you agree with the proposed e\nxceptions to the routine use of biodiversity offsetting? If not, why not? If you suggest additional restriction, why are they needed? \n&#xa0;\nYes. We agree with the analysis in the Consultation paper. \n&#xa0;Question 15: W\nhich\n habitats do you think should be considered irreplaceable? \n&#xa0;\nNo.  The importance of an irreplaceable habitat should be taken into account through the planning system and the mitigation hierarchy.  The question is the multiplier for destroying such habitats.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe suggest particular attention needs to be given to connectivity and the possibility that a habitat may have an added value because of its location. For example the value of a particular site may not be high in itself, but it may have considerable sign\nificance as part of a corridor. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 16: Do you think offsetting should in principle be applied to protected species? \n&#xa0;Yes.  We do, although we accept the complexity of the issue.  \n&#xa0;\nThe extent to which the suspected or possible presence of, in \nparticular bats, newts and dormice can frustrate or delay farm diversification projects such as barn conversions is a significant concern, particularly since under resourced planning departmen\nts are increasingly inclined to\n err on the side of caution. \n&#xa0;Question 17: H\nas the Government identified the right constraints and features that need to be addressed when applying offsetting to protected species? \n&#xa0;\nWe believe so.  They certainly reflect the complexity of the legal regime. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 18: D\no you agree \nthat great crested newts should be the first area of focus? \n&#xa0;\nWe would prefer it to be bats, but would not object to great crested newts. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 19: D\no you have any comments on the Government’s thinking on how to apply offsetting to great crested newts\n? \n&#xa0;\nWe support it, and suggest it provides a suitable model for other species. \n&#xa0;Question 20: S\nhould offsetting be considered for any other species in the near future taking account of the constraints on species offsetting? \n&#xa0;\nYes. Bats and dormice. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 21: Do you think conservation covenants should be put in place as part of an offsetting system? If they are required, who do you think should be responsible for agreeing conservation covenants? If not, how else do you think offsets could be secure\nd for the long-term? \n&#xa0;\nWe accept the limitations of both freehold and leasehold covenants in th\nis context.  However we have been closely engaged with the Law Commission’s work in this area and \nsuspect that what the\ny \ndescribes as “workarounds” may have grea\nter potential than \nthey believe\n. \nNevertheless we accept the desirability of creating new legal mechanisms\n and a simple way of avoiding the problems with conventional covenants. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 22: D\no you think management agreements should be put in place as part of an offsetting system? If they are required, who do you think should be responsible for agreeing management agreements? \n&#xa0;\nIn our view a management plan setting out the parties aspirations f\nor the land, rather like the Views about Management statement required for SSSIs, would be more useful than an agreement.  We suspect any agreement would simply be a parallel document to the conservation covenant. \nIf management plans were to be introduced\n, we\n maintain they should be a \nmatter for negotiation between the parties.\n \n There are plenty of priva\nte organisations, such as FWAG \nwhich think would be capable of acting as facilitators. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 23: D\no you think an offset register should be put in plac\ne as part of an offsetting system? If so, who do you think should be responsible for maintaining an offset register? \n&#xa0;\nWe \ndo not see any need for any \ncentral recording of \noffsets\n; but \nwe would not object to \nthat responsible bodies \nbeing encouraged \nto \npublish information voluntarily, with the agreement of the relevant landowner.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 24: How long should offsets be secured for? \n&#xa0;\nWe are pleased the question has been asked. The presumption that offsets should be secured in perpetuity has been a parti\ncular cause for concern.  We think it fundamentally wrong to dictate the use of a particular piece of land for ever. We suggest that few people would think that a land use determined in 1813 still had any great relevance, and similarly that in 2213, few wi\nll think a use set now was still appropriate. Moreover, we suspect that many landowners will see little that is attractive about \ndedicating land in perpetuity. \nThey might as well sell it. \n&#xa0;\nAs such, we suggest that the default position should be something \nless than perpetu\nity –\n66\n years may be a more reasonable timescale. \n In any event a \ncertain amount of flex\nibility in the management plan will be required so that \nso that it can adapt in the l\night of changing circumstances.\nQuestion 25: A\nre there any long-term factors, besides climate change, that should be taken into account when securing offsets? \n&#xa0;\nStatutory designations allow for revocations or modifications in the light of changing circumstances.  We see no reason why conservation cove\nnants should be any different.  Climate change, in particular  will result in many changes to the uses to which particular land can be put and will also impact on the location o\nf suitable habitats for certain \nspecies, as such we should be encouraging the d\nevelopment of flexible structures. \nAttention should also be given to other sources of biodiversity funding. \n In particular, with the increasing probability that the CAP budget\n will be significantly reduced \nover the coming years, the need to secure other s\nources of funding becomes all the greater. \nQuestion 26: Do you think biodiversity offsetting should be” backdated” so it can apply in relation to any planning applications under consideration at the point it is introduced?\n&#xa0;\nWe see no reason why it should \nnot be introduced on the basis that the developer can volunteer to provide an offset rather than go through the s.106 procedure.  If it were mandatory we can envisage developers who had already begun commissioning reports in anticipation of having to negot\niate a s.106 agreement being prejudiced. \nQuestion 27: Do you think an offsetting system should take a national approach to the question of significant harm and if so how? \n&#xa0;\nAs noted\n above, an obligation to asses\ns significance creates uncertainty and expenditure. We would very much prefer the test to be based on thresholds. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 28: Do you think any additional mechanisms need to be put in place to secure offsets beyond conservation covenants? If so why and w\nhat are they? If this includes measures not listed above, please explain what they are. \n&#xa0;\nThe developer is bound by a requirement to acquire an offset by the terms of the planning permission.  If the developer does not provide it personally it will do so o\nn the basis of a contract with an offset provider. \nIn either instance there are sufficient enforcem\nent mechanisms available. The pl\nanning authority can enforce ag\nainst the de\nveloper and the developer can take action und\ne\nr the contract with the provider. \nWe \nsuggest that for \nconservation covenant\ns\n \nto be an effective mechanism certain additional mechanisms should be put in place.  Firstly they \nshould be \nable to be \nregist\ne\nred\n as a\n \nlocal land charge, and that from the date wh\nen a conservation covenant is \nregis\ntered it will be enforceable against successors in title to the original \ncovenantor.\n&#xa0;\nSecondly, injunctions and contractual damages should be available to the beneficiary of the covenant in the event of the covenant being breached.  However\n,\n t\nhe only circu\nmstances in which we can see \nexemplary damages \nbeing legitimate is where the perpetrator has committed the act with a view to making a financial gain.  Exempl\nary damages could be ordered which would effectively\n confiscate it. \nWe do not believe these contractual remedies should be available to any third party, including the state.  It is a matter of a private agreement between the parties. \n&#xa0;Question 29: Do you think there should be constraints on what habitat can be provided as\n an offset? If so what constraints do you think should be put in place, and how should they work in practice? \n&#xa0;\nWe see no reason why this should not be a matter for the local planning authority to determine when determining the planning application. If it \nconsiders that an offset should require be similar to the destroyed habitat, it could so require, subject to conventional public law constraints. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 30: Do you agree an offsetting system should apply a strategic approach to generate net ecological \ngain in line with \nMaking Space for Nature\n? If so, at what level should the strategy be set and who by? How should the system ensure compliance with the strategy? \n&#xa0;\nAs discussed above in the context of the location of offsets, we see a place for this but it\n cannot be the sole approach.  We suggest it should be set at county level, although this need not mean that the offsets could only be provided within the \ncount\ny boundary. \n&#xa0;\nIn the early stages\n \nof the roll out of offsetting, a strategic approach could \ncreate more obstacles than benefits.  The aspiration should be to ensure the system is functioning effectively and has the necessary “buy in” be\nfore deciding to regulate it \nby means of a strategic overview.  \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 31: Do you think habitat banking should be allowed? Do you think a provider must show intent to create a habitat bank to be allowed to sell it as an \noffset? Do you think habitat banks should be “retired” if they are not used to provide an offset? If so, after \nhow long? \n&#xa0;\nYes it should and for the reasons given.  We suggest that an obligation to show intent is a prima facie an unnecessary imposition and this section of the consultation reads a little like it is trying to create obstacles. \nThe imperative should \nbe for the landowner \nto improve the biodiversity and \nenvironmental  management on his land. If he can subsequently sell as part of an offset providing business then that is all to the good. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 32: Do you think maintaining an environmental gain that\n might otherwise be lost should count as an offset? If so, how should a value be attached to the offset? \n&#xa0;\nYes.  We suspect that with the decline in agri environment budgets, a number of sites that have hitherto benefited from public funding will be at ris\nk of deteriorating.  Offsetting is one of the few ways of preventing that happening. \n&#xa0;Question 33: Do you think it is acceptable or not to use biodiversity gain created for other purposes as an offset? If you do, how should it be decided what is allowed t\no be used as an offset? \n&#xa0;\nYes. We suggest that anything which creates additionality should be included. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 34: How do you think the quality of assessments should be assured and who by? \n&#xa0;\nIt should be a matter for the local planning authority.  The creation of some overarching body will simply result in additional bureaucracy for marginal, if any, gains. A system based on assessors will be even worse. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 35: H\now should differences o\nf opinion over assessments be addressed? \n&#xa0;\nDifferences of opinion can be addressed via the planning system.  We do not see any issues that woul\nd fall outside its competence. \nThere is no need to create a parallel structure. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 36: Do you think the m\netric should take account of hedgerows? If so do you think the current approach is the right one or should it be adjusted? \n&#xa0;\nWe \nhave no strong views on this and \nwould not want the introduction \nof an offsetting system to be delayed by concerns regarding the inclusion of hedgerows. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 37: D\no you think it should be possible to offset the loss of hedgerows by creating or restoring another form of habitat? \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 38: If conservation covenants are put in place, do you think providing for offsetting through planning guidance will be sufficient to achieve national consistency? If not, what legislative provision may be necessary? \n&#xa0;\nWe believe planning guidance should be su\nfficient. If it transpires that is not the case, further consideration can be given to the issue.   \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n17 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
