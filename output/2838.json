"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Professor Nigel White, Professor of Public International Law,University of Nottingham (PCD 01)1.\n \nThis \nsubmission\n consider\ns\n \nthe issue of Parliament’s role in war powers \nfrom \nthree\n perspective\ns: democracy, military efficiency and\n international law. \nThe latter is the primary legal focus since\n the constitutional law of the UK provides for very little regulation of decisions to go to war, \nto \nuse force or \nto\n \ndeploy\n \nsignificant UK forces abroad (which are all seen as core prerogative powers in the hands of the \ne\nxecutive branch of government)\n.\n \nT\nhe \ncontention\n is that international law should be the primary framework and that, indeed, public law should be built on this framework either in the form of a War Powers Resolution or a War Powers Act of Parliament. The relative merits of each will be discussed. \nSyria and Parliament2.\n \nThe debate\n held in the House of Commons at the end of August\n,\n and \nthe \nfailure to \napprove\n a\n proposal to use force against Syria \nin response to the \nuse of chemical weapons\n,\n ha\nve\n been \ndiscussed \neither as a triumph for democracy or as \na \nfailure to enforce fundamental norms of international law\n and to \nfulfil\n the UK’s \ninternational \nresponsibilities\n, when it is probably neither\n.\n \nHowever,\n in my view the \nepisode\n leans more towards the former than the latter given that the necessity to use force, certainly at that time, was not \nestablished\n and clearly many MPs\n,\n as well as the public\n,\n were sceptical about the involvement of British forces in Syria.\n \n \n3.\n \nThe debat\ne turned on the issues of evidence and timing of military action,\n \na\nlthough \nit also raised \nquestions of international law\n. A\ns with many \nParliamentary \ndebates on \na proposed \nuse of force, \na number of \nspe\nakers\n addressed the \ninternational l\negal issues, \nal\nthough opinion seemed to be split on whether the UK had the right to act without the authority of the Security Council\n.\n There was \na \nvery brief \nsummary provided by\n the A\nttorney \nG\neneral\n \nput\n before the House of Commons \nahead of the vote\n,\n \nclaiming a clear legal basis in the doctrine of \nhumanitarian \nintervention\n,\n which is of doubtful pedigree under international law\n.\n \nT\nhe proposed intervention was \nprimarily \na \npunitive r\neprisal, \ntaken as a response \nto a use of chemical weapons\n \nwhich constituted a violation of fundamental norms\n and a crime against humanity\n \n-\n a different proposition\n to humanitarian intervention\n, but one equally problematic in international law (at least \nif taken \nwithout UN Security Council authority)\n.\n \n4.\n \nThus\n, international law was central\n to the discussion\n and in a way \nmay have \nhelped to shape the outcome\n, despite the assertions and counter-assertions about the legality of the proposed use of force\n. The proposed use of force was not primarily about protecting the Syrian people but about punishing \nthe \nAssad \nregime \nfor the \ncriminal \nuse of chemical weapons \nbut \nalso preventing him from using them again. The latter could be said to be a humanitarian justification but until the regime’s responsibility \nand the imminent need to use force to prevent another use \nhad clearly been established the \ncase for air and missile strikes was unconvincing. \n \n \n \n \nA Role for Parliament in Conflict Decisions5.\n \nSyria has been important for democracy because it showed that although executives have the legal power to go to war or to use force, they are increasingly concerned \nwith \ngain\ning\n approval from the \nwider polity\n.\n It almost seemed that Parliament and Congress were alternative fora for gaining authorisation in the absence of a functioning Security Council. \nL\negally speaking this does not make sense \ngiven that \nthe Security Council has the power to authorize enforcement action against another state while the \nUK \nor US \nclearly do not have such a power\n.\n I\nn terms of legitimacy\n, however,\n it makes more sense \nif\n the proposed use of force is necessary to tackle imminent \nhumanit\na\nr\nia\nn catastrophe and the Security Council is, because of its institutional flaws\n, \nabjectly failing to address the issue. \nThis was arguably the position in Kosovo in 1999.\n \n6.\n \nThere is little doubt that until force was threa\nt\nened against Syria\n,\n leading to the current process of chemical weapons inspection and removal,\n the Security Council had achi\ne\nved very little in terms of diplo\nmacy\n or action \nin \nre\nla\ntion to \nthe violence in \nSyria.\n The Resolution agreed on 27 September 2013 does not authorise any use of force to enforce Syrian compliance with the requirement to hand over its chemical weapons\n, although it \nmay well\n be interpreted in this way\n.\n \nA\nrguably the current process\n of disarming the chemical stockpile\n simply frees up the regime to use conventional force against the rebels and their strongholds irrespective of civilian casualties – something that it has been doing since 2011 and something that was deemed a crime against humanity \nin a UN Report\n that year.\n \nA humanitarian catastrophe \ncontinues to unfold in Syria but this should not prevent Parliament from making judgments about when to intervene in such a conflict where there is no guarantee that military intervention will improve the situation for civilians. \n7.\n \nParliamentary approval for a\nny\n use of force has become essential \nprimarily because of t\nhe anachronism \nof \nunregulated \nprerogative powers. Powers that on\nc\ne belonged to monarchs should not be wielded without proper democratic accoun\ntability\n; indeed \nthey \nshould be effectively \nre\ngulated/r\ne\nplaced\n by \nclear statutory rules. In medieval times monarchs could decide to go to war without having to seek any approval but they of\nten\n struggled to raise both armies and mon\nies\n, issues which still remain but seem less pressing.\n Military efficiency\n has improved over the c\ne\nnturies enabling the \ngovernment \nt\no\n deploy forces overseas more easily, and yet d\ne\nmocratic accountability has not increased \nsufficiently \nto match this. \n‘\nWar powers\n’\n is a topic \nof\nten\n characterised by arguments about milit\na\nry efficiency versus democratic accountability\n. The\n former has been allow\ne\nd to \noutst\nrip\n the latter\n; but in any case one should not be achieved at the expense of the other\n.\n  \n8.\n \nFurther reasons for greater democratic control of the armed forces include: p\nublic dis\ns\natisfaction with \nthe \nnumber of wars and the number of British casu\na\nlties\n, without any \nperceived\n improvement in the international security situation\n; and a r\ne\na\nlis\nat\nion that such dec\ni\nsions should not be solely made by a handful of individuals in the war cabinet\n, a perception heightened by the ‘sofa’-form of government of recent years\n.\n \n9.\n \nOne of the \nmain \nreasons \noften given \nfor allowing quick executive \ndecision-making to take military measures\n was to enable a government to defend the realm from attack.\n \nThe core of sovereignty, the \nraison \nd’être\n of a state, is to protect the country from attack, invasion and occupation. This is \nembodied in \nthe inherent right of self-defence recognised in international law in both the UN Charter and customary law.\n \nSince 1945 t\nhe UK has \nc\nlaimed the right of self-defence in relation to its response to the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands in 1982 and in a collective response \nalongside\n the US to the attacks of 9/11 in 2001. \nHowever,\n even in these situations the defensive response was not immediate and allowed significant Parliam\nentary\n debate \nal\nthough no vote\n was taken\n.\n The \northodox \napproach\n that the ex\ne\ncutive took the dec\ni\nsion and then Parliament could comment and evaluate aft\nerwards\n prevailed\n.\n \nThis \nprovi\nd\ne\ns\n a retrospective form of accountability but in reality \nit\n \nput\ns\n Parli\na\nm\ne\nnt in an une\nn\nviable position of being critical of an exis\nt\ning war which would \npotentially \nundermine national and milit\nary\n morale.\n \nFurthermore, \nmost significant deployments\n and \nuses of force are not taken to defend the country from attack.\n Thus\n,\n what was \nonce \nthe rationale for the prerogative power to go to war should no longer dictate the decision-making process.\n10.\n \nMost uses of force are no\nt\n \ntaken to \ndefen\nd\n the territorial integrity o\nr\n poli\ntic\nal inde\npe\nndence of the UK \nfrom outside attack, \nbut are conce\nrned\n with enforcing international laws\n (Iraq in 2003 and proposed \nin\n Syria in 2013)\n,\n or pr\ne\nventing h\numanitarian\n catastrophes\n (Kosovo 1999, Libya 2011)\n. \nInternational law does not provide any clear rights or duties here in the absence of an authorization from the Security Council.\n The emergence in the 21\nst\n century of the ‘Responsibility \nto Protect’, when a government fails to protect its population from crimes against humanity,\n has not (yet) shaken off the shackles of the Security Council in part due to the perceived lack of alternative and legitimate security communities.\n \nIn these controversial cases\n where military action is proposed in order to prevent crimes against humanity\n there \nare \nvery few instances when the executive has to take action without having time to go to Par\nliament\n, \nal\nthough it \nha\nd\n to \nin the face of imminent humanit\na\nr\nia\nn catastrophe thre\nate\nned by the Gaddafi regime against \nBenghazi\n in 2011\n when force was used under clear UN authority before a vote was held in the House of Commons\n.\n \n11.\n \nThus, in most instances \n(including of self-defence and humanitarian ne\ncessity\n) \nthere is time for Parliament to be involved in a meaningful way in decisions to deploy significant forces or \nto \nuse\n military \nforce. It would be an exceptional situation where the government has to deploy forces in an emergency\n without seeking Parliamentary approval\n. Parliamentary involvement would not hamper the \noperational \neffectiveness of any military action, \nbut \nit would mean that Parliament may prevent the deployment or use of force because the majority of MP\ns\n \nare\n not convinced \nby the Government’s arguments \nthat there \ni\ns a need t\no\n use force. \nBearing in mind the Government’\ns strong position in Parliament, giving Parliament a say in conflict decisions should not be seen as a permanent barrier to the effective prosecution of wars, but only a barrier that might come down if Parliament remains unconvinced by the Government’s arguments and justifications. \nThe Insufficiency of Recent Practice12.\n \nT\nhe \nrecent\n practice\n (starting with Iraq in 2003\n and most recently Syria in 2013\n)\n of seeking approval in Parliament prior to a use of force does not jeopardize the prerogative power\n.\n A\nlthough the Prime Minister may cho\no\nse\n,\n for political or democratic reasons\n,\n not to exercise prerogative powers in the face of Parliamentary disapproval as in the Syr\nian debates\n, there is no \ndoubt that such a power remains and all \nthat \nParliament is doing \nlegally \nis commenting upon its proposed use. Accountability is in effect being brought forward to before the use of force commences, as opposed to waiting to a later point, but it remains an exercise in \nlimited \npolitical accountability nonetheless.\n13.\n \nRequiring positive approval in the form of a substantive resolution not ‘approving’ or ‘supporting’ the \nG\novernment’s decision, but \nforming part of that \n‘deci\nsion\n’ to authorize the use of force\n,\n \nmight appear to\n \njeopardize\n \nParliament\n’s\n role\n \nas a mechanism of accountability. \nNevertheless, \nParliament’s\n powers of scrutiny\n \nwould be\n enhanced. The executive prop\no\nsal \nwould be\n s\nc\nrutinised by Parliament and\n,\n if it passes that scrutiny\n,\n then Parliam\ne\nnt will \nultimately \ndecide on the use of force\n. Parliament\n not only \nperforms\n an accountability function it takes \nco-\nresponsibility for the decision that emerges.\n \nIt makes Parliament’s role central in conflict decisions \nand further\nmore\n \nit makes it central at the crucial time. \n14.\n \nIn addition, \nthe current position is that \nthe G\novernment can \nuse its \nprerogative powers \nto \ndeploy troops and forces ready to use force \nand \nthen go to the House for support just before the actual use of force \nis planned \n(as in Iraq in 2003)\n,\n making it \nextremely \ndifficult for the House to vote against \nit \nin the face of a build up to war knowing in any case that the prerogative power remains. Arguably\n,\n when the UK is threatening\n to use\n force\n and backs that threat by the deployment of forces\n,\n it has already potentially violated international law (which prohibits both the threat and use of force) and\n,\n therefore\n,\n any \n UK \n‘decision’ to do so should have been made prior to the deployment\n and accompanying \nthreat\n of force\n.\n15.\n \nIt follows that \nthe current position is unsatisfactory not only because it leaves the prerogative untouched, at least in legal terms, it allows the \nG\novernment to manipulate the agenda, to make threats, to deploy forces and then go to the House for political reasons to seek approval for its decision to use force. The fact that this now normally takes place before the actual use of kinetic force is an improvement on much of the earlier practice\n,\n but it does not increase democratic input \nin\nto decision making sufficiently in this era of legally controversial uses of force. The Syrian debate may mislead us into thinking that we have finally tipped the balance in favour of democracy but, although it does nudge us in that direction, the evidence is that better executive management of the build up to the debate would have enabled the \nG\novernment to have gained approval. \nResolution or Statute?16.\n \nW\nould a War Powers Resolution constitute a real legal limitation on prerogative powers? \nThe reform proposal that was due to be laid before Parliament for approval before the general election in May 2010, \ntook \nthe form of a non-binding war powers resolution,\n  giving the Prime Minister maximum flexibility as to the timing of seeking approval from the House of Commons for a Government decision authorising the use of force by British armed forces outside the UK. As with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, this may mean that the timing of the vote will be such as to ensure that it is too late for the House of Commons to realistically say no. In addition, under the draft resolution, there would have been no need for the Government to seek retrospective approval when the operation \nwas\n urgent or secret. Furthermore, the proposed resolution would not have required the Attorney General \nto \nmake his full advice available to Parliament, though legal reasons would normally be given.  \nI\nn reality \nthis \nrepresented little change from the current constitutional position and had the added advantage, from the Government’s point of view, of being in a non-\nstatutory\n form thereby making sure that the Courts are not enticed into the debate about the legality of decisions to go to war.  \nEven an improved Resolution would not replace the prerogative although its acceptance and usage would produce a convention\n. This\n would have some value in constitutional law in qualifying the prerogative\n further by recognising the entitlement of Parliament to vote and not simply to be consulted prior to a use of force\n.\n \n17.\n \nThis leads to the issue of whether a\n War Powers Statute \nwould \nreduce military efficiency too much by introducing the possibility of judicial review\n.\n \nSuch a \npath might be seen as not only increasing democracy b\ny\n making Parliament \nco-responsible for a \ndecision to go to war but \nalso \nmoving \nthe \naccountability\n function towards the Courts in the form of judicial review. \nHowever, while the\n Courts would be concerned with whether the procedure of the Statute was being complied\n with\n, for instance\n,\n whether a vote in the House of Commons was undertaken in \na \nprocedurally correct way; or whether the House of Commons had been given sufficient information, including on the legality of the proposed operation, upon which to make an informed decision. \nUnder a War Powers Statute t\nhe Courts may declare, in \nobvious \ncases where there is clearly no emerg\nency\n situation, that the \nG\novernment had not been enti\nt\nled to take action first and ask Parliam\ne\nnt later. Thus\n,\n the Courts would be conce\nrned\n with clear abuse of the process, \nbut \nnot with detailed arguments about the legality of going to war under international \nnorms. \n \nProceedings before the Courts would not delay military action and any declaration by the Courts that the Statute had not been complied \nwith \nshould lead to the Government \nmodifying its behaviour in the future\n.\n In this way jurisprudence would help develop and \nembed\n the Statute\n \nin a way that \nwould\n not hamper effective military action.\n \n18.\n \nGiven that i\nnternational law is a much more open-textured system than domestic law\n,\n and the area is in a state of flux particularly with arguments \nabout the nature and extent of the \nR\nesponsibility to \nP\nrotect\n, it would not be appropriate for \na \nBritish \nc\nourt to decide or even comment on the legality of the use of force itself, although it would be concerned with \nthe \nquestion of whether Parliament had been given sufficient information on the legal basis so as to make an informed decision.\n \nThere is s\nu\nffi\ncient\n evid\nence\n of the Courts\n’\n deference on \nsuch \nmatters to be confident that they would not see this as an opportunity to assert \npowers of review\n over Government and Parli\na\nm\nent\n. \nThe Courts \nalready \nrecognise that these are dec\ni\nsions for the political organs \nma\nking difficult judgments in constantly changing \ninternational \nsecurity situations.\n \n19.\n \nWhile a War Powers Resolution may be a useful interim step and a practical limitation on prerogative powers, only a Statute would clearly ground the \nfinal \ndecision to go to war in Parliament. \nThe\n price is the possibility of greater judicial involvement\n. \nHowever, while the Courts have moved towards the assertion of jurisdiction over prerogative powers\n since the \nGCHQ \ncase of 1985,\n they have seen issues of war powers as not suited to judicial determination and have therefore declared such issues non-justiciable.\n \nT\nhe reason behind this\n \nis\n that \nthe Courts\n should \nnot become involved in \nm\natters of foreign policy and in issues of use of force\n in that these are decisions for the elected Government and not for the Courts.\n \nSuch an \napproach would continue \nu\nnder a War Powers Act given the rationale is that it is the type of \ngovernmental \ndecision that is not reviewable whether it is derived from prerogative powers or not. \nGiven this \nabstinence,\n the reality is that the Courts would not present a brake on \noperational \neffic\niency\n or the general ability of the executive to prosecute a war\n, but they would keep the Government \nand \nParliament honest in the way they interpret \na\n War Powers\n Act\n.\n \n20.\n \nDecisions to deploy significant forces or to use force would normally be made prior to deployment or use; but an \nex post\n decision would have to be catered for in cases of \nnecessity of \nself-defence and humanitarian \naction\n,\n \nbut only \nwhere \nimmediate \nforce is necessary to combat an imminent attack or \nto prevent an imminent \nhumanitarian catastrophe where there is \n‘\nno choice of means and no moment for deliberation\n’\n.\n Indeed\n, British deployments and uses of force since 1945 show that\n in most instances there is time for debate and decision so that \nprior co-decision making\n should be the norm and the exception\ns\n should be \ncarefully defined in order to \nprevent exploitation. \n \nOutline of Content of a War Powers Resolution/Statute21.\n \nGiven the difficulty international law has in providing precise definitions it should only be used as \na \nframework for\n the conditions that should trigger the application of \na\n War Powers Resolution/Statute. On this basis non-legal language should be used and the triggers \nfor co-decision making \nshould not be the ‘use of force’ or the presence of ‘armed conflict’, but any proposed \ndecision to deploy significant numbers \nof \nBritish troops/forces to an overseas crisis, conflict or post-conflict situation\n. Given that the desire is to have meaningful decision-making at a stage when force is being contemplated rather than actuated, it should occur at the point when troops/forces are being identified and plans are being drawn up\n. Ther\ne\n is the danger that this \nmight\n give too much information to \na\n potential enemy, but most interventions are not premised on surprise (with the exception of Suez in 1956)\n,\n but are taken in response to invasions (Korea 1950, Falklands 1982, \nIraq 1990) or as part of an incremental response to threats to the peace (for instance in Bosnia in 1992-5).\n22.\n \nA\n Resolution/Statute should apply to any significant deployment of UK forces whether they are bound for peacekeeping, peace support, peace enforcement or war fighting\n. T\no\n ex\nc\nlude peacekeeping forces on the basis that they trad\ni\ntionally do not become en\ngaged\n as combatants might tempt the \nG\novernment into sending the w\nro\nng sort of force in order to escape scrutiny, but in any case most modern peacekeeping operations are authorised by the Security Council to use force not only to defend themselves, but to defend civil\nians\n an\nd\n, more broadly, the\ni\nr mandates. \nIn addition, mission creep can lead to soldiers being tasked with additional duties leading to long-term and dangerous military commitments. \nThus, sending a UK contingent of 1,000 sold\ni\ners to a peace operation\n in what appears to be a post-conflict situation\n would be, I argue, a significant deployment and\n,\n therefore, ought to be covered by any \nWar Powers Resolution/S\ntatute.   \n   \n  \n23.\n \nThe Government needs to give sufficient information to Parliament in order for it to make an informed decision. \nInformation to be laid before the House \nwould include the \nfull \nlegal opinion of the Attorney General\n,\n which if not s\nufficiently\n detailed \nor otherwise\n satisfactory \nsh\nould be suppleme\nn\nted by further advice sought by Parliament or a Committee of the House of Commons. T\nhis\n would enable Parli\na\nm\nent\n \nto\n take a bal\nanced\n dec\ni\nsion\n. I\nt might feel\n, for example, \n that the pro\np\nosed action is not fully grounded in international law but is legitimate and necessary; or it might reject the assertions of legal\ni\nty by the Government. \n24.\n \nOnly very exceptionally in cases of imminent attack\n or humanitarian catastrophe\n, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation\n,\n can the decision \nby Parliament \nb\ne\n made after threat/deployment\n/use of force\n and then it should normally be given within \na short period (\nwithin seven\n days\n would seem reasonable\n)\n.\n \nOn\n-\ngoing prosecution of the war should be undertaken by \nthe \nexecutive with regular review by Parliament and \nrelevant Select \nCommittee\ns\n (or a newly constituted War Powers Committee).\n Any substantial change of direction i\nn the \nprosecution of \nthe \nwar\n, for example\n from protection of civilians to regime change\n,\n would require a new \ndecision\n.\n \n     10 October 2013\n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The Government’s proposal stipulated that the Security Council should immediately consider the initial findings of the UN’s investigating team and that every effort should be made to secure a Security Council resolution and, in any case, a further vote would be held in the House of Commons before force would be used. The Opposition’s proposal imposed a number of additional conditions, including that there was a clear basis in international law for taking military action -   Hansard HC, Vol 466, col 1425 and 1440 (29 Aug\nust\n 2013). \n \nAlthough both David Cameron and Edward Milliband accepted that there was scope in international law for military intervention without the authority of the Security Council – Hansard\n HC\n, Vol 466, col 1444 (Milliband), col 1426 (Cameron citing the AG’s opinion).\n For examples of contrary opinion see col 1427 (Lucas), \ncol 1443 (Huppert), col 1489 (Blunt), \ncol \n1524 (Meacher)\n.\n \n \n \n‘Chemical Weapon Use by Syrian Regime – UK Government Legal Position\n’ paras 2 and 4.\n Although the UK has argued the case for hum\na\nnit\na\nr\nia\nn inter\nv\ne\nn\ntion since the limited milit\na\nry action in northern Iraq to protect the \nK\nurds in 1991\n (and again in Kosovo in 1999)\n, there is little \nlegal support for this from other states. Indeed the Foreign Affairs Committee’s inquiry into Kosovo in 2000 found that NATO’s action over Kosovo was unlawful though legitimate\n on the basis that humanitarian intervention was of doubtful pedigree in international law\n \n– HC Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Fourth Report 1999-2000, 7 June 2000, paras 124-44.\n This was raised in the debate over Syria – see Hansard \nHC, \nV\nol 466, col 1516 (Abbott).\n \nReprisals, as with humanitarian intervention, are generally seen as prohibited uses of force under international law\n since the UN Charter prohibited force in 1945\n. In 1970 the UN General Assembly declared in a consensus resolution, commonly seen as part of the fabric of international law\n,\n that reprisals were unlawful – UNGA Res \n2625 (1970), \nknown \nas the Declaration on Friendly Relations\n. This point was raised in the Syrian debate in Hansard\n HC\n, \nV\nol 466 col 1541 (Alexander).\n \n After being defeated in the vote over proposed military action against Syria the Prime Minister was asked whether he would still use the royal prerogative to order military action. He answered that although he strongly believed in the ‘need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, \n… \nI believe in respecting the will of the House of Commons. It is very clear tonight that … the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the Government will act accordingly’ – Hansard \nHC, \nV\nol 466, col 1555-6 (Cameron).   \n Article 42 UN Charter.\n \nThe Security Council had \nfound \na threat to the peace but had not authorised the use of force – see UNSC Res\nolutions\n \n1199 and 1203 (1999).\n See UNSC Res\nolution\n \n2118, 27 Sept\nember\n 2013, para 21 ‘\nDecides\n, in the event of non-compliance with this resolution, including unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in the Syrian Arab Republic, to impose measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter’.\n \nHuman Rights Council-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry Report of November 2011, \nUN Doc \nA/HRC/S-17/2/Add\n \n1, 23 November 2011.\n \nConservative Democracy Task Force, \nAn End to Sofa Government: Better Working of Prime Minister and Cabinet \n(2006).\n The Courts have recognised this for example in \nAttorney General v Tomline \n(1880) 14 Ch.D 66 – ‘There is a duty on the King, by reason of his being King, to defend the realm, and therefore of course all his realm and every part of his realm’.\n \nArticle 51 of the UN Charter\n states in part that ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations …’\n. Customary law is often said to be embodied in the statement found in the \nCaroline\n incident of 1837 \nthat the state exercising the right of self-defence has to ‘show a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’ - \nThe Caroline (Exchange of Diplomatic Notes between the United Kingdom … and the United States)\n, Letter from Mr Webster to Mr Fox (24 April 1841), (1842) \nBritish and Foreign State Papers \n1129, 1138.\n N.D.

Joseph, \nThe War Prerogative \n(Oxford University Press, 2013)\n 215\n.\n \n Many examples could be given to support this. One is Richards J\n \n in \nThe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament v The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n [2002] EWHC 2777\n at para 59: ‘\nA plain purpose of \nthe \npresent claim is to discourage or inhibit \nthe \nGovernment from using armed force against Iraq without a further Security Council resolution. Thus \nthe \nclaim is an attempt to limit \nthe \nGovernment's freedom of movement in relation to \nthe \nactual use of military force as well as in relation to \nthe \nexercise of diplomatic pressure in advance. That takes it squarely into \nthe \nfields of foreign affairs and defence. In my view it is unthinkable that \nthe \nnational courts would entertain a challenge to a Government decision to declare war or to authorise \nthe \nuse of armed force against a third country. That is a classic example of a non-justiciable decision. I reject Mr Singh's submission that it would be permissible in principle to isolate and rule upon legal issues e.g. as to whether \nthe \ndecision was taken in breach of international law. \nThe \nnature and subject matter of such a decision require it to be treated as an indivisible whole rather than breaking it down into legal, political, military and other components and viewing those components in isolation for \nthe \npurpose of determining whether they are suited to judicial determination. \nThe \nsame objections of principle apply to an attempt to isolate in advance a potential legal component of a possible future decision with a view to limiting \nthe \nGovernment's freedom of movement when taking \nthe \ndecision itself’.\n \nCCSU v Minister for the Civil Service \n[1985] AC 374.\n \nCND \ncase, above note 21, para 50, Kay J described non-justiciability as rules ‘the courts have imposed upon themselves in recognition of the limits of judicial expertise and of the proper demarcation between the role of the courts and the responsibilities of the executive under our constitutional settlement’. \n See for example, the judgment of the Constitutional Court of Germany which consid\ne\nred arguments about the legality of German contributions to KFOR in Kosovo, but concentrated on compliance with constitutional processes and laws rather than legality under international\n l\naw – \nParliamentary Group of the Left Party v Federal Government of Germany\n, 13 October 2009.\n \nCaroline \nincident, above note 1\n2\n.\n See also \nJoseph, above note 20,\n 195.\n"
