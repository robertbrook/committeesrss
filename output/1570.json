"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Association of Community Rail Partnerships (ACoRP) (TIC 056)&#xa0;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n&#xa0;ACoRP &#xa0;\nRailways serving Isolated Communities&#xa0;\nCommunity Rail PartnershipsLocal Authority Support&#xa0;\nAccessibility – platform stepping distances&#xa0;\nQuestions Raised by the Committee \n \n&#xa0;\nIn relation to buses in England, this is left to the market to \ndetermine, with local authorities having powers to support non commercial services or to support community transport where they contribute to solving local transport problems, including social isolation.  In relation to local rail services, the level of se\nrvice is determined by the Department for Transport which specifies the franchise requirement.  \nLocal authorities are able to support additional local train services but are frequently constrained from doing so by the reduction in rate support grant by cen\ntral government and the inadequate remit on the provision of local rail services described above.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe railway \nhas responded well in recent years \nto the needs of different groups of passengers\n, and this\n brings benefits to \nthose\n in isolated communities as well as those in more populous areas.  For example, all new trains are built to \nmeet the requirements of \nthe Rail Vehicle Accessibilit\ny Regulations, \n1998\n.  Even those that are not \nyet \nfully compliant are generally accessible and\n the increasing number of holders of Disabled Persons Railcard\ns\n is evidence of the success of the policy of steadily improving accessibility over a period of 30 years. \n Accessibility at some stations serving isolated communities \nis being\n improved through u\nse of the ‘Harrington hump’ (see above.\n)\nYoung people and older passengers benefit from the various railcards available which offer discounted fares.  On \na number of\n routes serving isolated communities, the benefits are extended to all passengers who hold the local line railcard.  Most of these cards have been introduced as a result of the initiative of the \nCRP\n.  \nA few e\nxamples are:\n&#xa0;\nC. \nWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail \nservices to isolated communiti\nes? How can these challenges be \novercome?\nOne challenge on \na few rail\n routes is to be able to offer a frequency of service adequate to meet the various needs of people in the communities it serves.  A few rural railway routes \noffer a service of just four trains a day each way, which limits \njourney \nopportunities.  \nThe lines concerned are:\nIn the case of Esk Valley, for example, the timetable is built around the need to bring schoolchildren to Whitby from the villages along the Esk Valley, and to bring in day trip visi\nt\nors to Whitby on Sundays.  (The permanent Sunday service results from \nthe initiative of the CRP).  It cannot meet other demands, such as travel to\n \nwork from Whitby to Middlesbrough, for example, or for longer day trips from the line to Leeds or London.  \nThese limited services were introduced by BR many years ago as part of \na resource-led timetable to save money, but have become embedded in the \nfranchise specifications.  They severely limit the journey opportunities possible by rail and a great deal more could be achieved with a higher frequency.  As the\n lines\n serve isolated \ncommunities, demand levels will always be lower than those on the busier suburban or interurban routes which will \ntherefore \nalways show better value for money in any \ncompetition for resources\n.  However, as these lines are few in number and atypical, AcoRP \nwould argue that funding and rolling st\nock should be made available\n, exceptionally,\n to \nimprove services to the rural communities they serve, at least on a trial basis.  \nA number of long rural routes serving isolated commun\ni\nties in Scotland also have just \nthree or four trains a day, but a positive example of tackling \nthis \nis currently planned\n on the West Highland line between Glasgow and Oban.  Here, through skil\nl\nful timetabling and \ndiagramming\n of the Scotrail fleet\n,\n it will be possible to double the frequency between the junction at Cr\ni\nanlarich and Oban from three to six trains a day by using just one additional two-car train.  The additional cost of this is being met by Transport Scotland, but the benefits to passen\ngers are widespread\n,\n providing new journey opportunities, better ferry connections \nto the islands \nand a link with the Fort William to London sleeper.     \n&#xa0;\nD. \nHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated commu\nnities? How could Community Transport be improved?\nBecause of its flexibility and frequent use of accessible vehicles, Community Transport organisations can provide services that are tailored very specifically to local needs, offering a cost-effective tran\nsport option in rural areas.  Furthermore, their not-for-profit status and close links with the communities they serve meet the government’s localism agenda admirably.  However, as with CRP’s, reductions in local authority funding and other sources of inco\nme, such as BSOG, are putting the long-term future of many of these groups in doubt.  \nThere is no doubt that closer integration of community transport operations with community rail routes \nc\nould be of significant benefit to rural communities and could off\ner greater value for money across the board.  Several Community Rail Partnerships are already experimenting with minibus links to and from their local stations and these are proving successful. \nSimilarly, the Heart of Wales Line partnership runs minibuses \nto bring people from the train to visit tourist attractions in the isolated communities along its route.  \nIt is our view however that wider introduction of this concept could only be achieved with proper financial support and encouragement through \nmodifying competition legislation.\nACoRP fully supports community transport operations, and maintains contact with the Community Transport Association, although they are not \ndirect\nly within our remit. \nE. \nTo what extent should passengers in isolated commun\nities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?\nRail is a \nhigh volume\n transport mode \nand\n even the smallest train of one coach has a seating capacity \nfor \n75 p\nassengers\n, so inevitably, some isolated communities will be bett\ner served by demand responsive transport services, including cars and bicycles.  The important point then is to ensure an easy transfer at the railhead with adequate car parking, secure cycle storage and good interchange \nbetween\n bus, taxi\n,\n community transport\n and \nrail\n.\nIn general, deep rural areas have few taxis available and fares will inevitably be high, simply because of the distances to be covered.  Accessibility and the cost of living in rural areas remains a deep-seated problem, and the cost of a taxi fare will fre\nquently outweigh the ability of someone to pay. In an urban environment, the taxi \nc\nan \nbe an affordable \noption, whereas for rural dwellers it becomes more often a distressed purchase.\n&#xa0;\nF. \nWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport servic\nes in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?\nWith its own infrastructure and high safety and accessibility standards, rail is a relatively expensive mode, although costs are being reduced through the regulated \nsettlement for \nControl Period 4 involving a reduction in Network Rail costs of around a third.  At the same time, reducing franchising payments or \nincreasing premia for train operators \nmean that train operators \nin aggregate \nare \nnow net contributors to Government, rather \nthan a net\n cost to the taxpayer.  \nT\nhe principles of community rail \ndevelopment have enabled costs savings to be made (for example the Harrington hump) but community r\na\nil lines are generally run with minimal resources and the scope for significant further r\neduction of cost is limited.  \nHowever, CRPs are very effective in increasing ridership which reduces the subsidy per passenger kilometre and so increases the value for money to the taxpayer of the service provided.\nThe Heart of Wales Line Forum is actively\n investigating whether some form of local management of their long route can be used to enhance services at low cost. They aim to have a scheme in place in time for the implementation of the new Wales and Borders franchise in 2018. They have the active sup\nport of Welsh Government, ORR and ACoRP in this.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAppendix A63&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsmall Stations listed by the Office of Rail Regulation&#xa0;Stations within Community Rail Partnerships\n              \n+\nStations in \nurban areas\n              \n              \n              \n              \n*\n&#xa0;EnglandAscott under Wychwood\n              \nBardon Mill+\n              \n              \nBeaulieu Road\n              \nBraystones\nBroomfleet+\n              \n              \n              \nBugle+\n              \n              \nCauseland+\n              \n              \nChathill\nClifton*\n              \n              \n              \nCommondale+\n              \nCombe\n              \n              \nDenton*\nDockyard*+\n              \n              \n              \nDorking West*\n              \nDunston\n              \n              \nEastrington\nEccles Road\n              \n              \n              \nHavenhouse+\n              \nHensall\n              \n              \nHopton Heath+\nHubberts Bridge+\n              \n              \nInce &amp; Elton*\n              \n              \nLelant+\n              \n              \nLuxulyan+\nManors*\n              \n              \n              \nPegswood\n              \n              \nPolesworth\n              \n              \nRoche+\nSampford Courtenay\n              \nSandplace+\n              \n              \nShippea Hill\n              \n              \nShipton\nSnaith\n              \n              \n              \n              \nSpooner Row\n              \nSt Andrews Road*\n+\n              \nSt Budeaux \n(\nF\nerry\n Rd\n)\n*\n \n              \nStanlow &amp; Thornton\n*\nSwale+\n              \n              \nThree \nOaks+\n              \nWinchelsea+\n&#xa0;Scotland: Altnabreac\n              \n              \n              \nAttadale\n              \n              \nBreich\n              \n              \n              \nBroughty Ferry\nCulrain\n              \n              \n              \nFalls of Cruachan\n              \nGolf Street\n              \n              \nKildonan\nKinbrace\n              \n              \n              \nLochailort\n              \n              \nLochluichart\n              \n              \nMonifieth\nStromeferry\n&#xa0;\nWalesButlins Penychain\n+\n              \n              \nCynghordy\n+\n              \n              \nDolau\n+\n              \n              \nDolgarrog\n+\nGlan Conwy\n+\n              \n              \nKnucklas+\n              \n              \nLlanbister Road+\n              \nLlandecwyn\n+\nTal y cafn+\n              \n              \n              \nTygwyn+\n              \n              \n&#xa0;Appendix BExamples of stations serving isolated communities&#xa0;Berney Arms (Norfolk) on the Wherry Line.  No road access to this isolated community on the Norfolk Broads.  Access by footpath across Halv\ne\nrgate marshes or by boat.  \nTwo trains a day each way call on request and five on Sundays.\nCauseland (Cornwall) \non the Looe Valley line.  Remote community linked by narrow lanes.  No regular bus service.  Ten trains a day from Liskeard call on request. \nChathill (Northumberland) on East Coast Main Line.  Terminus of local \ntrain \nservice from Newcastle twice a day\n.  O\nne bus a week (Thursday) provides a shopping trip to Alnwick (no rail connection). \n \nCommondale (North Yorkshire) on Esk Valley Line.  \nServes an isolated community within the North York Moors.  \nFour trains a day u\nsed by walkers\n,\n and by local residents to a\nccess work and services.
