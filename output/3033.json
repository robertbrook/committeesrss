"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by At-Bristol science centre (CL0065)&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1. IntroductionAt-Bristol is an award winning science and discovery centre based on Bristol’s historic \nharbourside\n, and a landmark Millennium project.\n At-Bristol is a member of the national Association of Science and Discovery Centres UK (ASDC).\n&#xa0;\nWe are submitting evidence to this select committee as we strongly believe that At-Bristol, and other science and discovery centr\nes in the our national network\n, are playing and \ncan\n continue to\n play a significant role in engaging the wider public with climate change. \n&#xa0;\n2. ContextAt-Bristol’s vision is to ‘make science accessible to all’. We welcome over 200,000 visitors annually, working with diverse audiences i\nncluding families, schools, teachers and community groups. The science centre is host to over 200 interactive exhibits, allowing visitors to have hands-on experiences with science, technology, engineering and maths. Changing \nlearning \nprogrammes, including \nscience shows, workshops, experiments, competitions, lectures and special events are tailored to specific audience interests and needs.\n&#xa0;\n3. ExperienceSince opening in 2000, At-Bristol has \nused core funds, grants and sponsorship to \nsuccessfully engage\n the \npublic with emerging ‘science and soci\nety’ topics and issues, such as nanotechnology, synthetic biology and climate science.\n Some e\nxamples include:\n&#xa0;\nSchools audience\n&#xa0;\nPublic audience\n&#xa0;\nSupporting public \nengagement and\n science research\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. \nScience and discovery centres such as At-Bristol are ideal venues for bringing science research and the public together, for investigation \nand dialogue.\n              \nOver the last 2 years, At-Bristol has undertaken a significant programme of energy reduction and sustainability activity. We have won multiple awards, from food procurement standards, to carbon and energy reduction. \nAchievements include:\n&#xa0;\nWe use the technology and systems of the science centre building (e.g. 50 kW peak \nPhotovoltaic\n array, green roof, eutectic tank heat exchange system\n, advanced energy monitori\nng\n) to bring the science of sustainability to life, to act as a ‘living case study’ and provide positive and engaging examples of success. \n&#xa0;\nBy leading the way as an exemplar centre of positive change for energy reduction, we provide an exciting and truste\nd informal learning environment, and a fantastic springboard for climate science discussion and debate.\n&#xa0;\n5. \nAt-Bristol and similar centres for informal learning and public engagement with science should be seriously considered as agents in successfully \neng\naging\n the p\nu\nblic with climate science\n and research. \nThis activity is already underway in many centres. \nWe \noffer:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ninspiring and ‘neutral’ environments for learning\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsignificant experience in engaging the public with challenging and emerging science\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsignificant experience of bringing science \nresearch\n \nand\n the public\n together\n (\nincluding\n public engagement training for researchers)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npassionate, professional science communicators\n, with expertise in dialogue and facilitation\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nlarge public footfall, and \nestablished databases of specific audiences\n, and existing relationship with key audiences\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na shared passion for developing a scientifically literate and engaged UK population\n&#xa0;\nAt-Bristol would welcome any further opportunities arising from this Select Commi\nttee enquiry\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
