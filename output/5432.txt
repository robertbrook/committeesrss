[[[Written evidence submitted by Professor Jonathan Bradbury (DWB 18)]]]

[[[Introduction]]]Debate of the Draft Wales bill has raised a number of linked questions on electoral representation.  I address two here:  (1) whether there should be a rise in the number of Assembly Members to 80 members; and (2) whether the right to dual candidacy as opposed to single candidacy should be adopted.  The latter of course is in Part 1 of the draft bill, while the former has been advocated in evidence to the Committee.  In this evidence I wish to draw the attention of the Committee to the relevance of some recent research on Assembly Members and constituency work and then debate the issues of AM numbers and candidacy rights to encourage reflection on the roles of Assembly Members.    The discussion assumes the continuation of the existing electoral system, though of course if this were the subject of reform we would be opening up deeper issues regarding electoral representation.  

[[[Assembly Members and Constituency Work ]]]A neglected issue in addressing questions of electoral representation is the relatively high level of time spent by Assembly Members on constituency representation.  In 2004 a UK research study found that constituency AMs in Wales claimed to spend on average 12 hours per week on constituency casework; and 26.6 hours per week overall in locally oriented activities, comprising casework, working with local businesses, community meetings, local party meetings and promoting the constituency.  List AMs devoted even more time, dedicating 13.9 hours per week to local casework and 31.2 hours overall on local matters.  In the first international survey of this issue conducted between 2009 and 2012 of politicians in 15 European states, members of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly spent an average of 14.2 hours per week on constituency casework.  The European survey average for regional level elected representatives was 8.3 hours per week, with Germany (having comparable regional electoral systems) providing one of the lowest levels of time spent on constituency casework of 5.8 hours.  The relatively high commitment to constituency representation among Assembly Members in Wales, representing nearly a day per week more than the European average, is very significant.  Comparative analysis suggests that commitment varies according to both electoral and non-electoral motivations that include incentives determined by electoral systems and district magnitude, socio-economic characteristics of constituencies, distance of seat from the parliament and whether individual representatives are senior and/or in leadership positions or not.  Two key factors that also explain variation are whether representatives explicitly choose to emphasise the constituency delegate role in their work and the saliency placed on constituency representation generally by members within a particular regional context.  In the case of Wales it should be remembered that the National Assembly for Wales was originally conceptualised as primarily a representative body; setting a great premium on the roles that AMs should play in connecting the Assembly to voters.   In this light comparative analysis would point to the conclusion that while the relatively high constituency representation among AMs in Wales resulted from a range of factors it does at least in part emanate from a tendency towards personal commitment to the constituency delegate role and the significance attached to local representation in the original set up of the Assembly.  More research would be required to clarify exactly how much time spent on constituency work is a function of each of the potential causes.  Of course it is possible to emphasise institutional and socio-economic factors and these constituency service statistics may add to the case generally highlighting the over stretch of AMs and the need for more AM capacity.  But we may also reflect on the likely significance of commitment to constituency work and an institutional ethos of committing particularly to local representation adopted both by list and constituency AMs.

[[[Roles ]]]In this context as well as addressing  whether the Assembly needs more members we probably also need to ask whether the implications of the Assembly becoming a legislature need to be reflected more strongly in a reconsideration of qualitative aspects of how existing Assembly Members address their roles. Reflection may lead to the conclusion that the current situation simply has to be accepted as a function of various cultural, institutional and political factors or indeed is a good thing and what is needed is the election of a further 20 similarly oriented AMs.  Alternatively, reflection may conclude on the need to readdress the balance of time spent on local representative functions and tasks to be conducted within the legislature.   It may raise concern over the need to address the roles that AMs can and/or wish to play; for parties over whether they need to consider promoting different kinds of candidates; and for the Assembly over whether they need to adjust the working terms and/or hours to structure a greater focus on legislative as opposed to local constituency roles. It is of course the case that Assembly Members still afford themselves a great deal of time to focus on local work.  They pursue an approach to Assembly terms which limits the weeks in which they sit to school term dates; and an approach to the working week which limits the days on which they are in the Assembly for plenary sessions and committees to three days.  All members are free to conduct constituency focused work on Fridays and virtually all on Mondays.  Only the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs committee sits on a Monday afternoon, currently comprising five members.  The average time that Scottish Parliament and National Assembly Members spend on constituency work (14.2 hours) currently directly reflects in the case of Wales the two days generally allotted for the function.  Should this be reduced?If by whatever means the time spent on local constituency casework were to be reduced to the European average the Assembly would gain anything up to a net 12 AMs worth of time.  Such a focus on the behaviour of AMs and the manner in which institutional mechanisms shape that behaviour could be adopted ahead of any sustained debate over whether there is really a need to increase the number of AMs.  It would of course be recognised by many members as a battle to try and turn back the tide of constituent inquiries that come in relentlessly not least through email.  But it would repay reflection on how we have reached such levels of expectation not simply of a constituency service but of being personally dealt with by the AM, and how AMs have themselves dealt with the challenges and may deal with them more efficiently.  It would also imply the need for public education on the qualitative dimensions of the roles of AMs as legislators as opposed to local social welfare case workers rather than simply public education on the need for an increased quantity of AMs.  While an increase from 60 to 80 members may well ultimately be desirable it may well simply be too hard a sell to a sceptical public; leaving a focus on enhancing the efficient deployment of the existing 60 members a more practical agenda to pursue.

[[[ and Representation]]]The issue of the high emphasis on local constituency work also has a bearing on whether to favour dual candidacy over single candidacy in National Assembly elections.  Before looking at this specifically, I want to clarify some general points in defence of maintaining single candidacy.  These include the following:-(i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mixed member (MM) electoral systems are marked by their openness to experimentation, lack of fixed practice and account for national context.  As a result across MM systems variation has been suggested or practiced on seat linkage in the allocation of list seats; vote linkage in the allocation of list seats; whether voters have one or two votes; the formula used for allocating list seats; the operation of vote thresholds; district magnitude for constituency and list seats; and whether list seats are open or closed.  Variation on any of these issues has implications for both parties and individual candidates.  Rights to individual or dual candidacy at the upper and lower tiers of an MM system are but another source of variation and it would be wrong to suggest that the choice of single candidacy is an option that is entirely beyond reasonable consideration.  It is also worth noting that within the family of MM systems the electoral system for the National Assembly was consciously termed an Additional Member System, and in having only 33% list members is right at the bottom end of the range of proportionality that would allow it to be described post hoc as a mixed member proportional (MMP) system.  As a result it would be more appropriate to describe it as a system influenced by both majoritarian and proportional ideas, and not simply by the prescriptions of proportional systems.  Majoritarian systems place a high focus on individual candidate as opposed to simply party competition, voter choice (rather than party choice) of individual representatives, and individual representative-constituent relations.   It is to be expected in the sense that the Welsh electoral system adds to the diversity of international experience that experimentation might combine a focus on these issues with the priorities of PR-MMP in developing electoral competition.    &#xa0;(ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In reflecting on the central gerrymandering charge made against the move to single candidacy in Wales in 2007, it is difficult to sustain an argument in the specific case of Wales that the move from dual to single candidacy has impacted unfairly on party representation.  Indeed, theoretically the incentives for hard campaigning in constituency seats by candidates who know it is their only chance of election are substantially higher than the incentives for candidates who know that they have the safety net of virtually guaranteed election in a list seat if they are placed high on their regional party list as well.  In practice, the results of the 2007 and 2011 National Assembly elections have been accompanied by regret over individual AMs losing their seats but not by an outcry that Labour won 26 seats in 2007 or 30 in 2011 because their opponents were so shackled by the abolition of dual candidacy in the 2006 Government of Wales Act.  We have no firm evidence on either side to suggest the need for further change on the rights to candidacy because of its impact on party fortunes.  &#xa0;(iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the same time in the specific case of Wales single candidacy has established a greater equality of competitive experience for individual candidates.  Of course single candidacy has had an impact on list members who have not retained their seats because constituency candidates for their party in the same region have been successful.  This was notably the case in 2011 for the Conservatives in Mid and West Wales.  However, this is theoretically the same for candidates of all parties and it has meant that defeat has impacted on the fortunes of individual candidates equally for members from all parties whether in constituency or list contests. Prior to 2007 there was an inequality at an individual level as defeat for Labour candidates in constituency elections virtually guaranteed defeat overall in at least four of the five electoral regions, while defeat for other party candidates did not.  The pain of regret over the defeat of individual candidates considered to be of high quality such as Wayne David in the Rhondda in 1999 or Nick Bourne in Mid and West Wales in 2011 is now the same.  The adoption of single candidacy to achieve an equality of experience for individual candidates within the constraints of the 60 member MM system also has been preferable to the main alternative advanced within the Labour party during the 2000s, i.e. the introduction of vote linkage as well as seat linkage into the allocation of list seats to give Labour candidates more chances of election as list members so equalising up to virtually guarantee favoured Labour candidates election as well.  This would have deserved to be been seen as nakedly partisan as it would indeed have increased overall Labour party representation as well as increasing the chances of individual election.  &#xa0;(iv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Adoption of single candidacy does pose a potential internal competition dilemma for candidates in that it is recognised that success in a constituency contest may be at the expense of the chance of winning a list seat.  This potentially sets constituency and list candidates against each other within a party in any given electoral region, and it is right that it is highlighted as a potential problem of single candidacy.  There are many issues that would profit from detailed research as to how this plays out in practice but two points should at least be acknowledged that underline the incentives that the ‘You win I lose’ dilemma provides more broadly for electoral competition .  First, a long term aim for the electoral system must be to seek to encourage voters to regard their votes on equal terms.  Classic MM systems theory would suggest that the constituency vote is for who people want to represent them locally and the list vote is for the party who they wish to govern them.   Currently, there is the fear that the list /party vote appears to be often interpreted as a second preference vote or a protest vote and is not related to parties, their list candidates and who they wish to govern them in the Assembly.    Sustained adoption of single candidacy gives list candidates incentives to educate the electorate on the significance of the party list vote and the candidates who are standing for election on the list for each party.  Secondly, it is also presumably an aim of an electoral system to give candidates incentives to seek higher votes and increase party strength.  In this context, of course it is a static defensive approach to how list candidates approach Assembly elections that might produce a zero sum analysis of electoral prospects in which a constituency victory means a list loss.  It is possible that dual candidacy encourages such a static approach and instead it is single candidacy that encourages more expansive positive sum strategies within parties to increase representation to win a constituency seat whilst also winning list seats.  Individual list as well as constituency candidates may fall in the battle to achieve expansive aims, but at least they have been encouraged and over the medium-long term it may have dynamic and positive consequences for patterns of representation overall.  &#xa0;(v)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Of course, the claim may also be made that this electoral competition pressure falls unfairly on candidates in parties other than the Labour Party.  The contrast is made between candidates in other parties facing difficult decisions and the greater certainty of Labour candidates because of Labour’s apparent hold on constituency seats.  This is certainly an issue to investigate thoroughly but the contrast in party positions appears a dubious one to make starkly, if at all, as a constant situation.  Following the 2007 elections Labour held only 60% of constituency seats and nearly 40% of those that they held were defended in 2011 as marginal seats.  This meant that going into the 2011 elections all parties had candidates defending either some apparently safe constituency seats or almost guaranteed list seats or both, while individual candidate vulnerability across all parties was also relatively high in both constituency and list elections.  The relative levels of certainty and vulnerability of candidates between parties will generally vary across elections but principally it may be expected to vary with the success of the parties rather than any other factor. &#xa0;(vi)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To turn the quality of representation argument further on its head single candidacy may over the long term also help to widen the pool of candidate recruitment by giving more chances of winnable candidacy in all parties.  In contrast to the heady days of interest in candidacy before 1999 the reality by 2003 was that 17 of the 20 list members elected had also been constituency candidates, and interest in candidacy had dwindled.  The shortcomings of the exercise of dual candidacy were in fact first recognised within the parties.  Labour in Wales and Plaid Cymru both used positive discrimination procedures in list selection, involving a de facto subversion of the rights to dual candidacy in party selection procedures, to improve the quality of candidate recruitment.  Labour in Scotland voluntarily has used single candidacy selection procedures to similar purpose.  Providing for a greater availability of winnable candidacy positions prevents candidate recruitment becoming a party-determined closed shop for candidates selected to both contest the most winnable constituency seats and a high position on the party list.  This conforms with the majoritarian electoral system value of seeking to prioritise voter over party choice that is antithetical to the notion of guaranteeing a seat to any one candidate, even a favoured party candidate.  This combined with the maximisation of incentives to compete in constituencies, knowing that there is no safety net of a regional list seat, and in list elections to drive up the party vote, knowing that this is essential for personal election, may create improvements in both recruitment and electoral competitiveness.         On the basis of these arguments I would argue that single candidacy is logically consistent with the ideas informing the original electoral system, and there is a strong case for its defence.  To these points may be added an observation that the adoption of single candidacy while not affecting Assembly Members basic commitment to local constituency work may have had a further benefit in not encouraging the kind of additional competitive constituency representation between sitting constituency and list members seen in the early years of the Assembly.  Prior to the 2006 Government of Wales Act knowing that they could stand as constituency as well as list candidates at the next election list members frequently pursued approaches of shadowing particular constituency AMs, within their electoral region.   In the same way a return to dual candidacy may accentuate competitive constituency representation among Assembly Members in a situation where unusually in Wales the level of devotion to constituency related representation is an issue. It is important of course to draw comparisons with other MM systems to make the point that such competition may be seen as just part of the competitive politics of healthy democratic election contests.  Equally, it may well be a normative choice that the framers of Wales’ constitutional development wish to make: that the rights to dual candidacy go hand in hand with the expectation of competitive constituency representation among sitting constituency and list AMs ahead of future electoral contests and strong orientation to local constituency work generally, all of which are seen as integral to the kind of Assembly that people want.  However, it is at least worth reflecting on the likelihood that at the very least a return to dual candidacy would not provide incentives for AMs to seek to reduce constituency work to make more room for legislative roles; rather the opposite.  If the ambition of the framers of the bill is to enhance the capacity of the Assembly members to conduct their legislative roles then a return to dual candidacy does not fit easily.  Indeed, paradoxically, for those who may support the return to dual candidacy but oppose a rise in the number of AMs, the effects of the return to dual candidacy may well be to add to the case for an increase in AMs to ensure the successful carrying out of legislative scrutiny.  In this context a better route may well be to recognise the potential for single candidacy to sustain strong healthy democratic competition by the different means of incentivising all list and constituency candidates in elections and encouraging a widening of the recruitment pool, whilst also facilitating a situation in which both sitting constituency and list members of course exercise their rights to conduct constituency and local party work, but also as far as possible focus on legislative roles once elected.   In this way the maintenance of single candidacy as well as the reflection on the representative roles that Assembly Members play, discussed earlier, could be key parts of sustaining a practical approach to making the most of 60 members.  22 January 20146&#xa0; J.Bradbury and J.Mitchell, ‘The constituency work of members of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales: approaches, relationships and rules’ Regional and Federal Studies, 17, 1, 2007, 117-146 A.
