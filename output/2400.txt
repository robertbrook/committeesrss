The current filtering arrangements have been in place for 9 years and work well with very few complaints about children viewing 18 classified content on their mobile devices.  Customers who believe content or websites have been misclassified can email safeguard@ee.co.uk.  This email box is forwarded to the Safeguard Product Manager and issues are dealt with within 48 hours.Our Digital Living website provides detailed information on our parental controls, the full list of the categories blocked for each setting and how to report abuse or misclassified content http://explore.ee.co.uk/digital-living/keeping-children-safe
