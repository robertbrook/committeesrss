"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Robin Porter, Visiting Professor in the Global Insecurities Centre at the University of Bristol (USA 15)&#xa0;\nThis note\n has been written in response to a request for comment on the UK’s relationship with the United States, and on the implications for the UK of the US ‘pivot to Asia’ policy.  A fuller version of the arguments presented here is due to appear in a collected volume on ‘British Foreign Policy and the National Interest’ to be published in2014.\n&#xa0;The special relationship with the USIt will be the contention of this paper that by reason of its recent history, its geographical location, its economic circumstances, its commercial aspirations, and its distinct views on scientific and environmental matters, justice and human rights, the UK may not automatically be presumed to share foreign policy objectives with the United States, which quite legitimately has its own national interests to protect. It will be suggested here that a re-examination of the ‘special relationship’ may be overdue, so that a more nuanced posture may be arrived at in the relationship with the United States which, while respecting America’s important and positive contribution in international diplomacy, will safeguard Britain’s fundamental interests.\n&#xa0;\nIn the first instance, it should be noted that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Historically, certa\nin fundamental principles\n have guided British foreign policy as the country sought to protect and advance its interests in its relations with other st\nates. Core among these have been\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere have been strong echoes of these concerns in the ‘global objectives’ of Britain’s foreign policy in recent times.  To these, since 2001, have been added terrorism\n,\n and the security of energy supplies, while collaboration on climate change and on scientific projects of all kinds have also featured heavily among the objectives of our diplomacy.  It is the contention of this paper that the principles encompassed in these objectives are as close as it may be possible to come to an explicit statement of the UK’s ‘national interests’ where they relate to our foreign policy today.\n \n&#xa0;\nIf we take the UK’s list of global objectives as a benchmark by which to judge the degree of coherence between UK and US priorities, there are a number of points of concern.  Among these, in contrast to the UK position :\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIf this is the case, why is it that the ‘special relationship’ with the United States has continued to be\n regarded as\n the m\nost attractive option\n?  This, it is suggested here, \nhas been\n for a number of rea\nsons which appear to be highly subjective. Among these are:\n&#xa0;\nThat we share a common language and are said to share a common culture. Yet\n: it is predicted that the majority first language in the States may be Spanish in j\nust a few decades from now\n; much of what we think we know about the USA in this age of virtual reality\n may be more illusory than real;\n if there is a residual affection for the UK in the United States, it may be confined to pockets of the Eastern Seaboard.\n&#xa0;\nThat the popular perception in the UK is that, compared to America, Europe is ‘foreign’: \nEuropeans speak foreign languages, \nwhich we seem reluctant to learn; \nEurope has been a major historical source of conflicts into which we \nhave been dragged, as we see it; a\n significant part of our political spectrum has been influenced by the ‘little England’ strand of thinking, which has long maintained that we should hold ourselves aloof from continental entangle\nments. \nLittle wonder, then, that som\ne of our other allies feel \nwe are an advocate for the American agenda – a kind of ‘fifth column’ within Europe for the interests of the US\n.\n&#xa0;\nThat we can no longer conceive of UK intelligence and defence policy and operations which are not closely linked to those of the USA.  \nAs William Wallace and Christopher Phillips observed in 2009, there is\n ‘\nan embedded military and intelligence substructure’\n binding the UK to the US, \nwhich involve\ns\n significant derogations of UK sovereignty\n, and which is carried forward by its momentum. Yet: \nintelligence is \nnot without an agenda, and\n it may be naïve to assume that the US agenda is going to be our own, or even that intelligence supplied will not be ‘shaped’ in some way to produce a desired policy response on the part of the UK\n; we seem \nat present to be led by these inputs from outside, \nresponding almost automatically, making support for US initiatives the default setting of our security policy.  Moreover, t\nhe argument\n sometimes heard\n that the UK ‘owes’ the US a debt of gratitude for the intelligence the latter provides has a circular character to it.  \nUK involvement in US-led military expeditions overseas in recent years may have exacerbated for Britain precisely the problems for which US intelligence is said to provide a partial solution, in that these foreign wars have actually contributed to inciting minority populations within the UK. At the same time,\n recent revelations about the extensi\non of US monitoring \nto the ordinary citizens, and even the leaders, of supposedly friendly European countries have rendered British involvement in US intelligence gathering toxic in the eyes of many of our European neighbours.\n&#xa0;\nThat we support America’s foreign policy and defence initiatives so that we can thereby exercise influence over them.  This argument, advanced especially during the Blair premiership, has been disproved both by the statements of prominent US policy-makers and by what actually happened during both the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns, and was heavily \ncriticized in testimony appearing in the House of Commons Library Research Pap\ner \n‘British Foreign Policy since 1997’.\n&#xa0;\nThe past sixty years have been hard for us.  No longer (partly by choice) a power broker in Europe, we have also suffered the psychological impact of the loss of Empire, appear as well to have lost interest in the Commonwealth, and remain destructively ambivalent towards the European Union – a project in which we might once have played a leading role.  Against this background, a ‘special relationship’ with the United States may have appeared an attractive option.\n&#xa0;\nBut we do still have a choice.  \nW\ne are an island nation firmly located in the European region of the globe\n. \n Recognizing that we are now a pre-eminent mid-sized power with very many positive attributes, but no longer a great power\n, that quite reasonably we can expect to have reduced responsibilities\n, we may seek to adopt a more limited set of diplomatic and defence objectives which we can pursue independently.  Or, we may seek to continue to play a significant global role\n through multilateral initiatives\n, but in company with our immediate neighbours in Europe.  These seem to be the alternatives.\n&#xa0;\nWe should also re\ncognize that while we are less able to exercise ‘hard power’\n, we may in recent years have increased our capacity for  influence in terms of what is often referred to as ‘soft power’ – the respect internationally for our political institutions and legal system, our science and technology, our engineering and architectural achievements, \nour business acumen, \nour educational practices, our culture – theatre, dance, literature, cinema, -  our sporting achievements, and so on, activities through which our particular skills and values are expressed.\n&#xa0;\nPolicies which display these skills and promote these values abroad should be the foundation of our diplomacy, as they encourage respect for the UK internationally.  Conversely, policies, I would suggest, which are led by military intervention abroad, especially when it is not sanctioned by the very international institutions and legal framework in which we profess to believe, do the exact opposite. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe US pivot to AsiaIt is contended that \nthe ‘pivot to Asia’ in US foreign and defence policy, initiated in 2009 and reiterated more recently, represents a recognition both of the commercial opportunities and challenges posed by the newly prosperous region and of the need for the US to reassert its military primacy in the Pacific on one hand, and a retreat from responsibility for security arrangements in some other parts of the world on the other hand – the notion being that the Europeans could do more in those other areas. This comment will focus on the implications of the Asia-Pacific dimension for the UK.\nSince \nthe end of the Second World War\n US policy in Asia has been conditioned by a paramount concern over the intentions of China\n.  This concern was built upon a longstanding ‘love-hate’ relationship between the US and China which could be seen as going back to the middle of the Nineteenth Century, rooted initially in extensive US missionary activity there, and later in a frustrated desire to educate the Chinese for democracy.  Related issues after 1945 were the security of American-occupied Japan, and the fate of Taiwan.  \nIn some ways, therefore, the ‘pivot to Asia’ policy is not new; nor is the focus on China.  The US became involved in the Korean War because of the perceived threat from the Communist bloc, represented by China.  For similar reasons the US took up the mantle in Viet Nam in the wake of the failure of the French at \nDienbienphu\n in 1954.  The policy of isolation and containment of China, first conceived during the McCarthy period of the early 1950s, saw a ring of US bases around China in South Korea, Japan, Guam, South Viet Nam, the Philippines and elsewhere, and a hiatus in full American diplomatic relations with China until 1979.\nThe legacy of all of this has been a profound distrust of US intentions among Chinese policy-makers, which sits uncomfortably with the Chinese desire for trade with and technology transfer from what is perceived to be the world’s most advanced nation.  Although the US ‘pivot to Asia’ is said to involve,\n‘…\nstrengthening bilateral s\necurity alliances; deepening (US)\n working relationships with emerging powers, including with China; engaging with regional multilateral institutions; expanding trade and investment; forging a broad-based military presence; and advan\ncing democracy and human rights…’\nit is the military dimension of the ‘pivot to Asia’ that preoccupies China, which sees it as a renewal of ‘containment’ at one remove.  The strengthening of US naval and other military capabilities in the region, the retention and updating of bases, the beginnings of a new US military presence in Darwin, all are seen as potentially hostile by China.\nWhat, then, should the \nBritish reaction\n be to the ‘pivot to Asia’ policy of the United States ?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n25 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n Robin Porter was Counsellor for Science and Innovation at the British Embassy, Beijing, from 2002 to the end of 2005, and is currently Visiting Professor in the Global Insecurities Centre at the University of Bristol.\n"
