"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Hospedia (PEX 0026)&#xa0;\nAbout Hospedia:Hospedia is the world’s leading operator of Point of Care software and services in healthcare, covering 70,000 beds in \n158\n sites, delivering Patient Media, Patient Engagement and Clinical Workflow to the bedside.  Hospedia is also the UK’s leading provider\n of Patient Flow Management software to over 20 hospitals.\n&#xa0;\nSummary: &#xa0;\nContext&#xa0;1.1 Hospedia’s\n services are directly aligned with the Department of Health’s Information Strategy, which aims to transform the way information is used in the NHS, and can play a ke\ny role in delivering on the pledge to find \n£15bn-£20bn \nof savings in the NHS by 2014, the ambition of a paperless he\nalth service by 2018, and serve\n as a robust response to the Francis Report’s call for a more patient-centered focus.\n&#xa0;\n“The driving ambition \nunderlying the challenge to deliver greater productivity and a stable financial position is not only to maintain the quality of services of patients, but to improve it”\nKings Fund, February 2013&#xa0;\n1.2 \nTherefore\n,\n a\ns Trusts continue to find ways of improving \npatient care while delivering their annual CIPs, the\nre is a clear\n need to engage with IT solutions \nto deliver on these objectives\n.\n \nHospedia’s point of care services can deliver significant benefits to patients and \nclinicians, from improvements in patient w\nell-being and reduced length of stay to clinical efficiencies, streamlined workflows and reduced paperwork.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHospedia’s Services&#xa0;\n2.1 \nHospedia has developed a range of services\n, which include Electronic Meal Ordering (EMO), Clinical Access, Real Time \nPatient Feedback (RTPF) and the Extramed Patient Flow Management System\ns\n. These services\n allow Trusts to deliver clinical support services at the bedside without the need to invest in new IT infrastructure.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nIn more detail, the individual Deloitte repo\nrts identify that NHS Trusts have the potential to deliver on key priorities via one or more of the following services:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nElectronic Meal Ordering (EMO)3.1 \nEMO \nsupports\n not only cost improvement goals but also \nfood wastage reduction\n and \npatient experience improvements,\n such as \nimproved patient nutrition\n and reduced length of stay\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nEMO \nalso reduces the time between order and delivery from 15\n hours to just 2 hours, releasing\n staff time spent printing, distributing and collecting paper menus, \ninstead \nenabling staff to focus on patient care.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nNHS catering managers estimate that \nreduction in \nfood waste could b\ne as high as 60%. With over £27m \nworth of hospital food being waste\nd\n across the NHS\n, reducing the number of untouched meals represents a massive economic advantage.\n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nIn a recent survey, 85% of patients identified that fo\nod and catering services were a significant contributor to their overall satisfaction during a hospital stay\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nWith EMO, patients are offered an improved choice of meals compared to paper systems, an\nd are able to receive personalis\ned menus based on \ndietary requirements.\n&#xa0;\n“The EMO system means patients get a wider choice of menu, and they order and consume their meals on the same day. This greatly enhances patient experience within this hospital”\nDenise Richardson, Hospital Catering Manager, Bournemouth &amp; Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust&#xa0;\n3.6 \nHospitals should \nalso \nregularly evaluate their food services an\nd act on feedback from patients.\n EMO provides the tools for hospital caterers to gather patient opinion using ordering patterns that are ca\nptured electronically.\n&#xa0;Clinical Access4.1 \nAs well as delivering financial benefits, investing in Clinical Access also supports patient engagement and involvement at the point of care, improvements in care and \nalso in delivering \nNHS initiatives such as the drive to become paperless by\n 2018.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nThe service provides staff with decision-making information and data capture in real time\n. It also serves as \na platform from which \nstaff\n can access a range of applications directly at the bedside, including Picture Arching and Communications Sy\nstems (PACS), blood results and ordering, e-pharmacy, patient admissions systems, and even patient records, thereby reducing the reliance on paper based processes.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nInterviews with NHS Managers confirm that using the service releases the equivalent of \n14 members of staff per year, releasing time to be spent on delivering patient care and producing a time saving valued at £335k per annum, while the production saving generated through avoiding the volume of paper currently produced for each in-patient\n saves £60k.\n \nThe sites at which \nClinical Access\n is already in use include Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\n&#xa0;Real Time Patient Feedback (RTPF)5.1 \nOne of the key themes identified by the Francis Report was the importance of \nlistening to patients, in real time, and using that feedback to improve outcomes\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nRTPF collects and aggregates patient feedback in real time, providing the opportunity to review the data from hospital-wide results to granular, ward-level feedback, s\nupporting immediacy in responding to the information captured.\n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nAnalysis by Picker Institute Europe reveals that the service provides higher response rates providing a more representative view, unbiased data and a respondent profile that includes tradi\ntionally hard-to-reach demographics such as young and \nethnically diverse\n patients\n.\n&#xa0;\n“We use Hospedia to deliver the new friends and family survey requirement…This requirement is delivered by the same system Hospedia provide us to capture in-patient survey\ns – consolidating our feedback real time into one easy to use, organisation-wide system” \nLynn Thomas, Head of Patient Experience &amp; Public Engagement, Mid Essex Hospitals Trust&#xa0;\n5.4 \nMid Essex Hospitals Trust have been using RTPF since 2011 to deliver in-pa\ntient surveys to \nnot \nonly recognise timely opportunities for service improvements but also reward success. The Trust is now also using the service to deliver the\n Government’s\n Friends and Family Test requirement.\n&#xa0;InPatient Flow Manager (IPFM)6.1 \nThis service is a software-based system that supports clinical best practice through electronic whiteboards and desktop applications, mo\nnitoring patient flow and bed availability in real time. \n&#xa0;6.2 \nIt records and tracks the status of each patient, sharing this data between departments, clinical staff and administrative functions. This in turn saves time and improves accuracy\n, optimising p\natient journeys, delivering significant savings, and improving patient experience.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.3 \nAs an example, patient information can be input directly into the electronic system, saving 1,000 clinical hours per annum. It also drives a reduction in average \nlength of stay by 13%\n and \nthe benefit of reduced infection rates through IPFM is equal to 42 QALYs (quality adjusted life years\n), translating to a value of £864k per annum to patients.\n&#xa0;\n“[Hospedia’s] patient flow expertise and understanding of the challen\nges involved were compelling factors in our decision to purchase. This system allows us to manage beds in real time down to the individual bed level, free up nursing time to focus on patient care and improve our discharge planning”\n  \nSiobhan Jordan, Deputy Director of Nursing, Mid Essex NHS Trust&#xa0;\n6.4 \nEast Lancashire NHS Trust has used IPFM for the \npast\n \nfour\n years to manage patient flow across 1,000 beds in \nfive\n hospitals. In 2013 it decided to utilise\n IPFM to support new CQUIN targets for Dementia Assessmen\nts. Within \ntwo\n months of using it, the Trust had completely transformed their performance, consistently over-achieving against the 90% compliance required for each of the three stages of the target, necessary to release the CQUIN funding associated with th\ne improvement of dementia assessments.\n&#xa0;Emergency Patient Flow Manager (EPFM)7.1 \nThere are over 20 million \nadmissions\n at A&amp;\nE departments each year across the NHS in England\n and, with pressure on NHS resources rapidly increasing, manual methods of managing patient flows are time consuming and inefficient.\n&#xa0;\n7.2 \nEPFM\n is designed to replace the traditional whiteboard method of tra\ncking patient flow from A&amp;E through to admission or discharge. \n&#xa0;\n7.3 \nLike the \nIPFM\n product\n, the system records and tracks the status of each patient, sharing this data in real time and avoiding the need to locate available beds by telephoning individual \nwards.\n&#xa0;\n7.4 \nIn an example of the service’s broad utility, the effective management of patient flow can help to reduce elective surgery cancellations, alleviating ward bed unavailability, one of the causes of surgery cancellations\n. As approximately a quart\ner of patients attending emergency care are subsequently admitted to hospital, tracking the status of these patients is fundamental in managing bed availability. Therefore the value of reducing surgical cancellations, estimated at a 17% reduction\n, represe\nnts a benefit of £137k per annum.\n&#xa0;\n7.5 \nEast Cheshire NHS Trust turned to EPFM to deliver a solution \nthat would help \nclinical front line staff manage the four hour wait-time target and enable data capture to support payment-by-results income. Through a clos\ne working relationship during the implementation \nand change management process, EPFM has \ngone\n beyond the initial offering, delivering enhanced functionality and increasing staff engagement.\n&#xa0;\n“The [Digital] Whiteboard is the first time we’ve had a visual cl\nue as to what’s happening in the department. If you see someone who is starting to near breach point you can follow it up and find out why. Everyone is really keen to use it, because it’s actually fun and easy to operate” \nChristine Scott, Operational Lead Nurse, East Cheshire NHS Trust&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Source: SSentif report, January 2013\n Source: Hospedia survey of 24,434 hospital patients, 2013\n Number of pages estimated by Deloitte to be between 75 and 125 sheets.
