[[[Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more ]]]

[[[in prison from voting]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Disqualifying only those prisoners serving four or more years would have the undesirable effect of enfranchising a substantial proportion of convicted prisoners.  According to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on 31 March 2013 there were 26,972 convicted adult British prisoners serving sentences of less than four years (excluding fine defaulters); a figure that represents almost a third (32.2%) of the total prison population.Many of those individuals sentenced to less than four years in prison are guilty of extremely serious and violent crimes.  They include those convicted of rape, robbery and causing death by dangerous driving.  It would be totally inappropriate to extend the right to vote, during the period of their imprisonment, to individuals who have violated so seriously the rights of their fellow citizens.&#xa0;

[[[Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]If only those prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison were disqualified from voting, this would still enfranchise thousands of prisoners. According to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on 31 March 2013 there were 4,623 prisoners (excluding fine defaulters) serving sentences of six months or less.  Even allowing for the foreign national prisoners in that group, the House of Commons Library has estimated that around 4,000 British prisoners would be enfranchised if the rules were changed in this way.Among the prisoners serving six months or less in prison are those convicted of theft, assault and drink driving.  If the offence committed is deemed sufficiently serious by a British judge to justify the decision to deprive the perpetrator of his or her liberty, even for a relatively short period, it is right that he or she is also denied the civic right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.&#xa0;The case law of the European Court of Human Right is haphazard, but has gradually moved towards the enfranchisement of all prisoners.  It is unlikely to accept any ‘compromise solution’ such as disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting.  In the case of Frodl –v- Austria the European Court of Human Rights ruled unlawful the Austrian law banning prisoners from voting if they had been sentenced to one year or more in prison.  This demonstrates that, if the Government sets a fixed ‘length of sentence’ threshold above which prisoners automatically lose their right to vote, that law would risk being ruled incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  In Frodl, the Court suggested that denial of the right to vote, as a sanction, had to be linked to the character of the crime, a qualification that would lead to the enfranchisement of all prisoners bar a small group such as those guilty of electoral fraud.In addition, if the Government did allow prisoners sentenced to less than six months to vote in elections, and this was deemed unlawful by judges in Strasbourg, the Government would have accepted the principle that judges of the European Court of Human Rights have the final say even on the minutiae of UK penal policy, but could continue to face further demands from the Court to give the vote to those prisoners who were still disqualified from voting, and further demands for compensation from British prisoners claiming that their rights were being breached.  It is arguably the worst solution, sacrificing a key democratic principle, but leaving a high risk of future legal challenge in Strasbourg.&#xa0;

[[[Disqualifying ]]]

[[[all prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting – a restatement of the existing ban]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In 2005 the European Court of Human Rights held, in the case of Hirst v United Kingdom, that the UK ban on prisoner voting violated the right to free and fair elections in Article 3 of the Protocol to the ECHR.  The Court reasoned that the ban was ‘disproportionate’, amounting to an automatic blanket ban on all convicted prisoners.Second, the Court noted that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they forfeit the right to vote.&#xa0;Third, the Court argued:‘...there is no evidence that Parliament has ever sought to weigh thecompeting interests or to assess the proportionality of a blanket banon the right of a convicted prisoner to vote ... it cannot be said thatthere was any substantive debate by members of the legislature on thecontinued justification … for maintaining such a general restriction ...’The Court’s first argument, that the current UK ban on prisoner voting is an automatic blanket ban on all convicted prisoners, is factually incorrect.  The UK ban does not apply to prisoners on remand, nor to prisoners convicted for contempt of court nor for defaulting on fines.  The Court is also incorrect to describe the ban on prisoner voting as disproportionate.  Under the law as it stands, every prisoner over the age of 18 and who is a British national will regain the right to vote once he or she is released from prison.  The length of time for which each prisoner loses the vote is lost is therefore directly proportionate to the seriousness of the crime he or she has committed, as the length of the voting ban mirrors exactly the length of the sentence served.&#xa0;The Court’s second argument, that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they will lose the right to vote, can be addressed easily through a minor change to sentencing guidelines requiring judges to inform those given a custodial sentence that they will lose the right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.  There is no need to lift the ban on prisoner voting in order to address this issue.&#xa0;The Court’s third argument, that Parliament had not held a substantive discussion on the issue of prisoner voting, was incorrect and ill-informed at the time of their judgment.  The matter had been dealt with by Parliament.  In 1999 the then Home Office Minister George Howarth led a working party on electoral procedures which, as part of its work, examined this issue in detail.  Following on from this review, in the year 2000, the legislation on prisoner voting was modified (under the Representation of the People Act 2000) to permit remand prisoners to vote.  Along with two consultations under the last Labour government, one in 2006 and the other in 2009, the matter was further addressed on 10 February 2011, when an extensive debate was held in the House of Commons. Members of Parliament from all sides of the House voted, by 234 votes to just 22, to retain the current ban on prisoner voting.  This emphatic statement of Parliament’s support for the status quo on prisoners’ voting rights should take precedence over the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights on this issue. &#xa0;

[[[Additional Questions]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There are strong historical justifications for denying prisoners the vote.  British law has de jure restricted the voting rights of prisoners since the passing of the Forfeiture Act 1870. In fact a ban of sorts had existed, de facto, since 1832 as the franchise during that period was extended only to men who owned land worth ten pounds or more, while common law directed that felons forfeited their lands.  Since 1870, four Representation of the People Acts - in 1918, 1969, 1983 and 2000 – have retained restrictions on prisoners’ right to vote.In the case of Hirst v UK the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK’s restrictions on prisoner voting were incompatible with the ECHR.  In fact, voting rights for prisoners were specifically excluded from the ECHR from the outset.  When British representatives were negotiating the text of the ECHR in 1949, the French proposed including in the document the right to vote by “universal suffrage”.  Britain expressly rejected this wording on the grounds that it was too vague, and could lead to the right to vote being given to those who were denied it under British law - including prisoners. As UK delegate Sir Oscar Dowson told representatives from other European nations at the negotiations:&#xa0;“[i]n no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by citizens without qualifications…it is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of a variety of qualifications”&#xa0;In Britain, these qualifications included restrictions on the voting rights of “peers, felons and lunatics”.  The UK Government’s objection was accepted by those negotiating the ECHR, and the phrase ‘universal suffrage’ was specifically and deliberately omitted from the Convention.&#xa0;The philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the vote are clear.  Individuals keep most of their basic human rights whilst serving a custodial sentence.  They retain the right to humane treatment, to be adequately fed and clothed.However, for someone to receive a custodial sentence in England, he or she has to have committed a serious crime.  By doing so, that person has broken their contract with society to such a serious extent that they lose a number of rights; their liberty, their freedom of association, and the right to vote.  When British voters elect a government they choose the men and women who will make laws on their behalf.  Convicted prisoners should have no say in this; those who break the law should not make the law.&#xa0;The prisoner voting debate raises important questions about where the authority of national parliaments ends and that of the European Court of Human Rights begins.  When Britain signed up to the ECHR, it was to help prevent a repeat of the catastrophic devastation, unprecedented suffering and appalling human rights violations caused by the Second World War.&#xa0;However, in Tyrer v United Kingdom, judges in the European Court of Human Rights adopted the view that the Convention was what it termed “a living instrument”.  Similarly, in  Cossey v United Kingdom the Court stated that it had a duty to “ensure that the interpretation of the Convention reflects societal changes and remains in line with present day conditions.” What that has meant in practice is that the Court assumed a legislative function fundamentally at odds with its judicial mandate.  It did so with no mandate from the Council of Europe member states.&#xa0;It is not disputed that the European Court of Human Rights has authority to hear and make authoritative rulings relating to cases involving alleged breaches of fundamental human rights by governments within the Council of Europe.  However, the signatories to the ECHR would never have envisaged that the Court would attempt to interfere in the minutiae of an individual nation’s electoral and penal laws, let alone try to overrule the clearly stated view of a national parliament on the issue.&#xa0;This was the argument made in the dissenting judgments in the case of Hirst v UK.  Among those judges who dissented from the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment against the UK was the President of the Court, Judge Jean-Paul Costa.  In his judgment Judge Costa said:&#xa0;“With due respect, I see no convincing arguments in the majority’sreasoning that could persuade me that the measure to which the applicantwas subject was arbitrary, or even that it affected the free expression ofthe opinion of the people...it is not for the Court to prescribe the way in which national legislatures carry out their legislative functions. It must be assumedthat section 3 of the Representation of the People Act [2000] reflects political,social and cultural values in the United Kingdom.”&#xa0;The European Court of Human Rights’ own case law allows member states a “margin of appreciation” which accepts the ECHR can be validly interpreted in different ways by different member states according to their own cultural, historical and philosophical traditions.&#xa0;As Judge Costa added in the conclusion of his dissenting judgment:&#xa0;“The point is that one must avoid confusing the ideal to be attained and whichI support – which is to make every effort to bring the isolation of convictedprisoners to an end, even when they have been convicted of the most seriouscrimes, and to prepare for their reintegration into society and citizenship – andthe reality of Hirst (no. 2), which on the one hand theoretically asserts a widemargin of appreciation for the States as to the conditions in which a subjectiveright (derived from judicial interpretation!) may be exercised, but goes on tohold that there has been a violation of that right, thereby depriving the State ofall margin and all means of appreciation.”&#xa0;In seeking to redefine the details of UK electoral and penal law, the European Court of Human Rights has exceeded its proper judicial authority and set itself on course for a constitutional clash with the elected and accountable legislative bodies in the UK.  If the Court insists on expanding its influence and eroding the margin of appreciation, Strasbourg judges will find themselves more frequently in direct opposition to national courts and parliaments. Democratic parliaments across Europe will find themselves, with increasing regularity, forced to choose between the will of their people and the views of foreign judges. &#xa0;Furthermore, on good constitutional authority from senior judicial figures, it is legitimate for Parliament and UK courts to reject the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. Lord Chief Justice Igor Judge used the 2010 annual Judicial Studies Board lecture to state that, although the decisions of the European Court of Justice bind UK courts, decisions of the Strasbourg court do not.&#xa0;“As a matter of statute the decisions of the European Court of Human Rightsdo not bind our courts. The statutory obligation on our courts is to take accountof the decisions of the court in Strasbourg...We can follow the reasoning and if possible identify and apply the principle to be found in these decisions,particularly those of the Grand Chamber.  But I venture to suggest that that isnot because we are bound to do so, even if the decision is that of the GrandChamber, or because the Supreme Court is a court subordinate to the Strasbourg court, but because, having taken the Strasbourg decision into account andexamined it, it will often follow that it is appropriate to do so.  But it will notalways be appropriate to do so.  What I respectfully suggest is that statuteensures that the final word does not rest with Strasbourg, but with our Supreme Court.”&#xa0;In the same speech, Lord Chief Justice Judge argued that “Too many decisions from Strasbourg, and too many domestic decisions, are cited in argument, and, I’m sorry to have to say this to my brother and sister judges, in all our judgments.”&#xa0;Lord Neuberger, currently President of the Supreme Court, said the following in 2011, shortly after Parliament had voted to retain the current ban on prisoner voting:“The fact remains though that when Strasbourg speaks, it is ultimately forParliament to consider what action needs to be taken...Placing such decisionsin the hands of the judicial branch of the state poses a danger for the judiciaryand for liberal democracy, because it removes the debate from the public andtheir elected representatives. &#xa0;It is the clear view of two of this country’s most respected and senior judges that decisions of the European Court of Human Rights are binding neither on UK courts nor Parliament.  The Strasbourg court has issued judgments on UK prisoners’ voting rights, but the question of whether to enfranchise more prisoners or retain the current ban is one for Parliament. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]The right to vote is not a human right; it is a civic right.  Human rights are by definition extended under the ECHR to every human being.  Fundamental rights like Article 3 ECHR – “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” are held under the Convention to apply with reservation to every citizen regardless of gender, nationality, race, religion, age, property, political opinion or any other status.&#xa0;Voting rights, on the other hand, are usually qualified.  As discussed in our response to Additional Question 1 (above) the term “universal suffrage” was specifically excluded from the text of the ECHR in recognition of the fact that not every citizen is entitled to vote.  &#xa0;Every single member country of the Council of Europe imposes some form of restrictions on the right to vote, for instance by imposing a minimum voting age or limiting the right to vote to their own nationals.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is entirely appropriate to deprive prisoners of the right to vote for the duration of their sentence.  Indirectly, through their right to choose their elected representatives, voters have the power to make, influence, block and amend laws.  That important power to shape the laws of the land is one that should not be granted to those who, at the time of an election, are serving a custodial sentence for breaking one or more of those laws.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]The European Court of Human Rights is unable to enforce its own judgments or compensation awards against national governments.   Furthermore, the Council of Europe cannot impose fines on the UK Government for non-compliance with European Court of Human Rights judgments.  If Britain maintains the current ban on prisoners voting then the unimplemented judgment in Hirst v UK will simply remain, along with hundreds of others, on the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers’ list for review. This is the same body that, through the Izmir Declaration 2011 and the Brighton Declaration 2012, has called on Strasbourg to show greater respect for national democratic institutions.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]According to the European Court of Human Rights, as it held in the case of Frodl v Austria, it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based solely on the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify from voting prisoners sentenced to more than six months, four years or any other fixed period then it could, based on existing Strasbourg case law, be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restriction and therefore ruled unlawful.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Domestically, retaining the current ban on prisoner voting would respect the clearly stated view of Parliament, as expressed most recently on 10 February 2011 when the House of Commons voted by 234 votes to 22 in favour of the following motion:&#xa0;That this House notes the ruling of the European Court of Human Rightsin Hirst v the United Kingdom in which it held that there had been nosubstantive debate by members of the legislature on the continued justificationfor maintaining a general restriction on the right of prisoners to vote;acknowledges the treaty obligations of the UK; is of the opinion that legislative decisions of this nature should be a matter for democratically-elected lawmakers;and supports the current situation in which no sentenced prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for contempt, default or on remand.&#xa0;If the UK retained its current ban on prisoner voting, and therefore refused to implement the judgments against it in Hirst and Greens and MT, the sanctions at the Council of Europe level would be primarily political.  There might be some mild diplomatic criticism from the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg.  However, expulsion from the Council of Europe is utterly implausible.  The Council of Europe has not expelled Bulgaria for breaches of the right to life (cases of fatal police brutality), Moldova for the torture of prisoners and Russia for atrocities committed by its armed forces in Chechnya.  If the Government refuses to change the law on prisoner voting, the matter will remain on the list of unenforced judgments kept by the Council of Europe.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]As explained in our response to Question 5, the European Court of Human Rights held, in the case of Frodl v Austria, that it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based solely on the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify from voting prisoners sentenced to more than six months or more than four years, this could still be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restriction and therefore ruled unlawful.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Given the shifting goalposts of the European Court of Human Rights, any compromise solution is likely to be temporary.  The court has a political agenda that is likely to press gradually for the enfranchisement of all prisoners.&#xa0;&#xa0;June 20131&#xa0; https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/192314/omsq-q4-oct-dec-2012__2_.pdf Frodl v Austria [2010] ECHR 508               Hirst v the United Kingdom (No 2) [2005] ECHR 681 Article 3 states&#xa0;: ‘The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.’ Para 79.
