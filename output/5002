defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAbout Rabbis for Human Rights defaultFounded in 1988, Rabbis for Human Rights is the only rabbinic voice in Israel that is explicitly dedicated to human rights.  Representing 100 Israeli rabbis and rabbinical students from different streams of Judaism, we 
defaultderive our authority from our Jewish 
defaulttradition and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   Our mission is to inform the Israeli public about human rights violations, and to pressure the State institutions to redress these injustices.  In a time in which a nationalist and isolationist und
defaulterstanding of Jewish tradition is heard frequently and loudly, Rabbis for Human Rights give expression to the traditional Jewish responsibility for the safety and welfare of the stranger, the different and the weak, the convert, the widow and the orphan.
default defaultRHR works primarily in fields where we think our rabbinic voice will be most effective: 
default&#xa0;defaultHuman Rights Work in the Occupied Territoriesdefault&#xa0;defaultOlive Tree Campaigndefault:default RHR 
defaultworks year round with Palestinian farmers from several dozen villages in the Occupied Territor
defaulties, to ensure that they can regularly access their agricultural lands, often denied to them because of their proximity to Israeli settlements.  We negotiate and coordinate with the army to ensure the High Court mandate military protection during the olive
default harvest, and to ensure access to lands when denied.  We also bring hundreds of Israeli and international volunteers to work side by side and in solidarity with Palestinians during the olive harvest, who help provide protection against possible settler int
defaultimidation.  We also track Israeli settler acts of damage of Palestinian trees and property, and monitor the state response.  During Tu B’shvat
default (the Israeli New Year for trees)
default, we purchase and bring hundreds of Israeli and international volunteers together
default with Palestinians to plant some 
default3,000
default olive trees in areas where settlers have cut, uprooted and/or burned trees in acts of vandalism and arson.  
default&#xa0;defaultChallenging Land Confiscation in the Occupied Territories: defaultRHR works to legally prevent or reverse the take
defaultover of Palestinian lands in Area C, and ensure that Palestinian farmers can safely access those lands.  We started working in villages in the South Hebron Hills
default in 2005
default, and in the past year, we have expanded to the villages around Bethlehem as well as to
default a few villages in the Northern West Bank. In the coming year, we will continue to monitor the implementation of previous rulings on land access issues, and currently are working on 20

default open cases relating to land confiscation and criminal charges and comp

defaultRHR’s legal project, field work and advocacy 
defaultwork 
defaultwill focus
defaultes
default on two clearly defined goals:
default&#xa0;default3)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe legal department, currently comprised of four full-time lawye
defaultrs, three field workers and an expert consultant, has grown to become among the most important tools in RHR’s struggle against land takeovers in the Occupied Territories. The last few years have seen 
defaultsuccesses
default in precedent setting cases in which we have ma
defaultnaged
default 
defaultto 
defaultreturn lands to Palestinian owners
default. We are still 
defaultadjudicating several potentially precedent-setting cases dealing with settler land takeovers and discriminatory planning leading to 
defaultthe ongoing threat of 
defaulthome demolitions.  
defaultDespite these successes, 
defaultRHR is 
defaultstill
default deal
defaulting
default with
default the 
defaultdaily 
defaultstruggle
default of the Occupation - creeping annexation, displacement, settler violence, and State-backed restrictions withholding basic living conditions from many Palestinians. RHR's lawyers work to thwart displacement of Pal
defaultestinians by preventing encroachment and expropriation of privately owned Palestinian lands, protecting farmers’ rights to access their lands, supporting the field work of our partner organizations and our own field department, and demanding better enforce
defaultment of existing laws that do protect Palestinians’ rights.
default 
defaultMost of legal work is concentrated in the South Hebron Hills, but we do 
defaultwork 
defaulton specific cases 
defaultthroughout the Occupied Territories
default. 
defaultIt is RHR’s goal to
default continue to
default expand our work
default geographically
default and apply our successes to all of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. 
defaultExpansion of legal cases will continue into the Hebron district and Bethlehem regions, where, in the last two years, we have taken on several cases of land encroachment and takeovers
default 
defaultwith much 
defaultsuccess
default. 
defaultRHR is currently the only organization working in the Bethlehem / Hebron district in representing land owners.

defaultWhile working on the

default open cases, our lawyers continue to s

default as well as s
defaultubmit administrative appeals to the Israeli High Court 
defaultof Justice.
default 
defaultThe legal team has begun 
defaultto focus increased effort
defaults
default on 
defaultnew cases dealing the actions of security personnel funded by settlement communities. In many instances of land access prevention, these security personnel violate both civil law and the ri
defaultghts of the Palestinian landowners by operating as private security guards, threatening farmers and using violence to forcibly remove Palestinians who come to farm their agricultural lands. RHR 
defaultbelieves

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMonitoring progress and evidence in each case is critical to our work in the Israeli courts and in submitting complaints and appeals to the Civil Administration, the army and the police. 
defaultTo this end, t
defaulthe legal department puts great emphasis on tabulation o
defaultf cases of human rights violations, actions taken in each case, and follow up actions required.  Detailed tables are kept by RHR lawyers of the successes (or progress) and impact of each and every case.  Two critical components are used to support this wor
defaultk and assist in monitoring the progress with each case:

defaultOur best tool for the evaluation of the legal work is the success 
defaultin guaranteeing farmers access to their lands, 
defaultreturning lands to their owners and the halting of land encroachment. 
defaultThe number of 
defaultnew 
defaultand ongoing 
defaultcases 
defaultmeasures our effectiveness and success. More and more land owners approach us based on these success
defaultes
default.
default 
defaultOver the last decade, RHR has succeeded in cha
defaultnging the status quo
default. We have 
defaultguaranteed Palestinian farmers safe access to their agricultural lands and water sources by 
defaultbuilding and maintaining grassroots contacts with local Palestinian villagers, 
defaultrefining our coordination efforts with the Israeli Defe
defaultnse forces and relying on the contingent of Israeli and international volunteers who accompany farmers to their lands throughout the year. 
default&#xa0;
default10)
default&#xa0; 
defaultOur 
defaultlandmark High Court victory in 2006
default 
defaultstated that 
defaultthe Israeli security forces are obliged to ensure that farmers are able to access their lands without harassment and intimidation. 
defaultIn reality, Palestinian landowners in Area C are still intimidated, harassed and prevented from accessing their lands. Radica
defaultl settlers use violence and provocation to prevent farmers from being able to reach their lands. 
defaultIt is 
defaultRHR’s presence in the field 
defaultwhich 
defaultensures that the security forces are indeed fulfilling their responsibilities to protect farmers.  
defaultR
defaultadical settlers are
default often discouraged from attacking small groups of farmers and their families
default when we are there to protect them
default. Documenting incidents of harassment and violence and using the media to publicize these events
default puts increasing pressure on the security forces t
defaulto carry out their court mandated job. 
default&#xa0;
default11)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is essential that RHR continues its work of guaranteeing Palestinian farmers access to their property
default. 
defaultLetting lands lie fallow leads to their takeover
default either by settlers from settlements adjacent to these lands o
defaultr by the State
default. Ottoman law, still 
defaultapplicable
default in Area C, states that uninterrupted cultivation of land for a period of ten years, without objections from any party, grants the farmer rights to the land. In absence of such rights, the land reverts to the 
defaultS
defaultt
defaultate. 
defaultIt is critical, therefore, that l
defaultandowners continue 
defaultto 
defaultwork their lands not only to allow them to continue to subsist from their produce, but to ensure its ongoing ownership. 
default&#xa0;

defaultIn addition to the importance of our presence in the field, RHR plant

defaultsaplings 
defaultduring the planting season in the fall/winter on lands in danger of being taken over or where trees have been destroyed 
defaultin “price tag” attacks 
defaultor on lands our legal team is fighting to return to its owners. These endangered lands are a
defaultlmost always located near politically radical settlements or illegal outposts or fall between the Green Line and the Separation Barrier throughout areas of the West Bank. Our legal staff and field staff work hand in hand in enabling 
defaultthese planting activiti
defaultes to go ahead. 
default&#xa0;
default13)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe highlight of our annual activities is the Olive Tree Campaign which takes place 
defaultin the fall each year. RHR OT and field staff and tens of volunteers accompany farmers to their lands to assist in picking olives. 
defaultDuring the Olive Tree C
defaultampaign, w
defaulte coordinate with security forces throughout the West Bank in order to allow the farmers to access their lands. We have seen increased willingness of security forces to coordinate olive harvest days with us
default, but w
defaulte need to be vigilant in ensuring
default that sufficient days are provided for harvesting, planting and plowing. Our presence in the field facilitates constant monitoring and immediate reaction on the part of our legal team, particularly when violence erupts. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0; 
defaultWe put a great deal of effort into
default document
defaulting
default and report
defaulting
default the incidents of vandalism, violence and inaction by local military and police units, sharing this information with the DCO, police national command, army legal advisors office, regional commanders, the media, concerned foreign d
defaultelegations and international organizations in an effort to advocate for change. We demand increased efforts on the part of the responsible Israeli authorities to enforce the right to security of person and property for all civilians in the areas of continu
defaulting Israeli military rule until there is a political solution to the situation, not only during the Palestinian olive harvest season but throughout the year
default.

default&#xa0; 
defaultOur senior managerial staff, legal staff, field team and media team work hand in hand and support each other's work through transfer of information, joint cooperation and monitoring and documenting the impact of our work.

default 
default&#xa0;
default17)
default&#xa0; 
defaultDue to 
defaultthe volatile nature of the context of RHR’s work, there are inherent challenges in ensuring successes are permanent and sustainable. Even where legal precedents are set, often counter legal advocacy overturns successful outcomes
default and the
default implementation of rulings 
defaultneeds to be monitored
default. 
defaultOur work on land issues addresses the most intractable and challenging issue at the source of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thereby, new challenges will always have to be addressed as they appear. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile dealing with issues of land takeovers, demolitions and expulsions RHR’s focus is changing the status quo – challenging the
default root causes of human rights violations
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere is a risk that some forms of legal assistance only combat the symptoms of violat
defaultions rather than their causes. 
defaultIn order to address this challenge, 
defaultRHR’s legal department 
defaultattempts to 
defaultchallenge the underlying system
default 
defaultthrough strategic litigation
default,
default focusing on precedent settin
defaultg cases that if successful, could
default impact the lives of landowners
default,
default if not throughout the OPT, at least in Area C.
