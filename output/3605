defaulte
default has long had severe concerns about the cost and value of the HS2 project and believe the Government – and indeed Opposition parties – should urgently be reviewing its worth because a very weak case for

default is only getting weaker. In recent weeks, we have seen the Treasury Select Committee call for the project to be put on hold, following on from alarm bells being sounded by the 
defaultNational Audit Office
default 
defaultand 
defaultPublic Accounts Committee,

default their outright opposition to the project
default is also growing by the week

defaultOver the last two years, the TaxPayers’ Alliance has published a number of pieces of research questioning the basis on which 
defaultHS2 has got the go-ahead, namely:

defaultWith proponents of the scheme having stopped arguing for it in terms of faster journeys and instead claiming it is needed to address a lack of capacity, we specifically challenge
defaultd
default the argument that HS2 is required to provide extra capacity on West Coast Main Line (WCML), because:

defaultthe
default business case 
defaultfor HS2 
defaultbecause there have been increases in capital costs and a number of additional costs that would have to be incurred in order to live up to ministers’ promises for the new line.
default8. 
defaultAs far as 
defaultthe
default KPMG report
default is concerned
default, we believe it was 
defaultutterly dishonest for the Government to have spent £250,000 of taxpayers' money on a
defaultn entirely new method of assessing the merits of a transport project
default and then 
defaultonly
default to
default apply it to its preferred scheme.  Worse 
defaultstill, the deliberate removal of figures showing 
defaultthe 
defaultareas that would lose out if HS2 goes ahead amounted to cherry-picking
default findings.

defaultOur respo
defaultnse to the publication by the Government of 
defaultThe Strategic Case for HS2
default in October 2013 was that it was another attempt to make the numbers behind HS2 stack up that was yet again found wanting. Those in charge of HS2 
defaultwere finally forced to admit that people
default on trains do not have zero productivity because they can and do work while travelling. Yet a convenient increase in the number of business passengers projected to use the line allowed the report’s authors to limit the reduction in the benefit-cost ratio (
defaultBCR). 
default10. 
defaultWe were also very surprised that the 
defaultDepartment chose to quote the project’s BCR including the value of wider economic impacts, given that this is not standard DfT procedure for assessing the merits of transport projects
default. The Government needs to
default explain why this was done
default. 
default11. T
defaulthe case for HS2 is now flimsier than ever.  No amount of spin or re-hashing of the figures will change the fact that HS2 would be a huge white elephant, costing every family in the UK a fortune and failing to deliver the i
defaultnvestment which the UK transport network really needs.

default. 
defaultIn summation, the TaxPayers’ Alliance believes that the entire project should be abandoned now before any more taxpayers’ money is squandered on it.
