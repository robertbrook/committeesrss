"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPlease find below responses to the enquiry from the Public Administration Select Commi\nttee regarding crime statistics:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe focus on data accuracy and integrity only addresses one part of the issue surrounding how confident the public and policy makers can be that crime statistics can be relied\n on. The unasked question seems to be whether data can be compared between forces with confidence (i.e. is the data reliable). The answer to this is almost certainly not. There is a degree of flexibility in the system currently that even when recording in \naccordance with the guidance set out in the National Crime Recording Standards and within agreed time frames there are significant differences in the resulting data. In addition how each force interprets the NCRS can vary slightly but significantly, for ex\nample the line between anti-social behaviour (a non-crime incident), public disorder (an offence against society) and low level violence (a victim-based crime) is particularly blurred. What is needed to address this is a means of measuring more reliably, a\nnd accounting for, variability in compliance and recording between forces. \n&#xa0;\nHow I will measure success and hold the Chief Constable to account &#xa0;\nMeasure To reduce crime &#xa0;\n% reduction in total crime. as measured by police recorded crime \nTo reduce violence against the person &#xa0;\nFor 2013/14 - a reduction in violence against the person. \nA new alcohol-related violence measure will be developed for implementation in 2014/15 \nTo increase the percentage of crimes which result in a positive outcome &#xa0;\n% increase in positive outcomes as\n measured by the police \nTo increase victims’ satisfaction with the police &#xa0;\n% increase in victim satisfaction as measured by the police \nTo increase public confidence in the police &#xa0;% increase in those responding ‘\ngood’ \nor ‘\nexcellent \n‘as measured by the Crime Survey for England and Wales \n&#xa0;\nTo increase satisfaction with the police response to a non emergency matter &#xa0;Measure in development and to be in place by end of April 2013 \n&#xa0;\nTo increase the percentage of the workforce who state they are well led &#xa0;Measure in development and to be in place by end of April 2013 \n&#xa0;\nTo begin recruitment in order to maintain an establishment of least 3,000 police officers &#xa0;Maintaining an establishment of at least 3,000 police officers. \n&#xa0;\nTo begin recruitment in order to maintain an establishment of at least 800 Specials &#xa0;Reaching an establishment of at least 800 Specials by March 2017 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
