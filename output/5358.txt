[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0; Wildlife and Countryside Link (Link) brings together 42 voluntary organisations concerned with the conservation and protection of wildlife, countryside and the marine environment. Our members practise and advocate environmentally sensitive land management, and encourage respect for and enjoyment of natural landscapes and features, the historic and marine environment and biodiversity. Taken together, our members have the support of over eight million people in the UK and manage over 690,000 hectares of land.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2.&#xa0; Link convened a dedicated Task and Finish Group to work on Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) issues in late 2012, which brings together considerable scientific, policy and practical experience of issues relating to INNS. Our objectives include scrutinising government policy, gathering evidence on the impacts of INNS on the third sector, and raising the profile of the issue with government and the public alike. Our preliminary analysis, developed in early 2013, of the fitness and success of The Invasive Non-native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain (‘GB Strategy’) was presented to the then Minister for Biodiversity, the Rt Hon Richard Benyon MP. We welcome the subsequent commitment from Defra to undertake not a ‘light touch’ review, but one that appears to be thorough and inclusive. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.3.&#xa0; This submission is supported by the following 11 organisations:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.&#xa0; INNS cost the British economy at least £1.7billion every year, and it is estimated that in addition, ‘the total non-market costs incurred, including disturbance of ecosystem services, have been estimated to £96 billion in the UK’. The European Environment Agency (EEA) has estimated that the cost to the EU of a range of INNS was at least €12billion per year. All the evidence points to these costs to society increasing significantly and exponentially, as invasion increases and established INNS become more invasive (or the impacts of their invasiveness manifest themselves). The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment asserted that the global negative impacts of INNS on biodiversity were of a similar magnitude to that of climate change and habitat loss.  &#xa0;2.2.&#xa0; The NGO community is deeply supportive of the clear need for EU-level action, without which, action at individual Member State level will always be significantly undermined. The EU Regulation should:&#xa0;2.2.1. Have a list of species of concern that is informed by the outcomes of risk assessments; an arbitrary limit of 50 species would completely undermine the efficacy of the Regulation. The list must also allow species to be listed on the EU-wide list which are native to parts of the EU, but have significant impacts through being invasive in other parts of the EU.&#xa0;2.2.2. Enhance and complement current and planned action in the UK, and allow the UK to go further than action mandated by the Regulation.&#xa0;2.2.3. Facilitate effective and timely communications and coordination between Member States so that joint action plans can be developed.&#xa0;2.2.4. Facilitate the development of shared risk assessment resources, have a scientific review body to provide scientific rigor to the selection of species and their risk assessments, and an underpinning database.&#xa0;2.2.5. Appropriately embed the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, whilst allowing some discretion in countries already heavily infested.&#xa0;2.2.6. Be adequately resourced. &#xa0;2.3.&#xa0; There has been significant commitment to tackling INNS in the UK, which must be supported by the development of a refreshed strategy that is smarter and more far reaching than before. We recommend that:&#xa0;2.3.1. The new GB strategy is: ambitious; adequately resourced; significantly more strategic; and can facilitate genuine cross government action that is developed and implemented through a close working partnership with stakeholders.&#xa0;2.3.2. Appropriate, effective and timely legislation is deployed at both the UK and EU level, together with an increased use of and confidence in existing tools, such as the ability to ban the sale of known problem species, and a ratification of the Ballast Water Convention. We also need to harmonise the detail of existing UK legislation, for example by creating provision for Species Control Orders in all UK countries, not just in Scotland.&#xa0;2.3.3. Well-devised and implemented communication programs are put in place, and are adequately resourced to deliver clear results. These should be complemented by sector-led voluntary initiatives, which also seek to educate and build capacity within those sectors and are monitored to ensure they deliver results. If they do not, then regulatory means should be deployed.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.&#xa0; Some NGOs manage large areas of the countryside where non-native species have become established and sometimes subsequently become invasive. A complete overview of costs for all members would be difficult to produce, but here are some indications: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0; The Government is to be applauded for its investment in the GB Strategy. The strategy was developed in consultation with many stakeholders, at a time when few other EU Countries had adopted similar programmes. The establishment of a dedicated GB Secretariat to oversee and support delivery of the strategy was also much welcomed. The GB Strategy was visionary for its time, providing much-needed focus and prioritisation.&#xa0;4.2.&#xa0; Much of the planned delivery against this strategy has been effective, but there have been shortfalls. Unfortunately, the shortfalls have occurred around preventative measures, which are the measures most likely to be cost effective, but also often the most difficult to implement. For example, no Pathway Action Plans (identifying the routes of invasion and planning for their control) have been completed, and horizon scanning work (identifying future threats) has been patchy at best; both were given priority in the original strategy.&#xa0;4.3.&#xa0; In addition, although Government consulted in 2007 on how a ban on sale (possible via Section 14ZB of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) on certain problem species could be an effective tool for their control, a ban on sale has yet to be fully implemented and is currently only envisaged for five plant species, the majority of which are already widespread. We believe a number of other species lend themselves to a swift ban on sale, for example Lysichiton americanus (American skunk cabbage). The proposed EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species would likely make provision for bans on sale (a black list) for key species over and above those currently listed for such action in the UK, but it may be many years before such action becomes obligatory in the UK. There is therefore a need to explore further use of this domestic tool in the interim.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Legislative]]]5.1.&#xa0; We need robust and fit-for-purpose domestic legislation which includes the effective and timely use of existing legislation, together with its enforcement, supplemented by a number of changes to address shortfalls. To our knowledge, there have been few, if any, prosecutions of those who intentionally allow species listed under Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to become established in the wild (despite this having evidently been the case on a number of occasions). This sets an unhelpful precedent and provides no deterrent. As mentioned above, an effective response, that fully embodies the precautionary principle, includes a swift ban on sale of those species which evidence demonstrates are having, or could have, a major impact on human health, the economy or natural assets, and for which trade and sale are the major pathways of invasion. We do not feel that the precautionary approach is currently given sufficient weight in consideration of which species should or should not be banned from sale. In addition, the evidence presented to support such a case does not include the full range of actual or predicted costs and benefits to wider society of implementing this measure.&#xa0;5.2.&#xa0; A major barrier to the effective control of problem species lies in the inability of relevant authorities to access land where problem species have become established. Neither can they compel the landowners to notify them of the presence of named species, or take action to address invasions where it is reasonable to do so. This situation was recently rectified within Scottish legislation with the creation of Species Control Orders under the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011. Such land can now be accessed in Scotland, and costs can, if necessary, be recovered from land owners who do not take action. &#xa0;5.3.&#xa0; The Scottish model also includes a new framework that assumes species are not safe for release (but are otherwise safe for sale) unless it can be proven otherwise; this effectively amounts to a ‘white list’ approach. With so many problem species on the horizon, and a relative lack of information about the likely impact of future invaders, the Scottish framework embodies the precautionary approach (although a variety of exemptions do apply). With an ineffective and incomplete Schedule 9 listing mechanism in England and Wales, which does not benefit from regular review and which is ineffectively publicised or used to prosecute, we believe there is merit in exploring whether similar measures in England and Wales in relation to the intentional release of species could be beneficial. &#xa0;

[[[Partnerships]]]5.4.&#xa0; The GB Strategy helped to establish a number of key partnerships, in recognition of the shared problem and joint solutions and resources required to address the impacts of INNS. The NGO community are key lead partners in virtually every Local Action Group (LAG), which coordinate action on the ground. We have also played a supporting role in promoting ‘Be Plant Wise’, in establishing and promoting ’Check Clean Dry’ and in communicating the impacts of INNS to the general public and the press. An effective response, into which partners can invest, requires absolute transparency as to the decision making that underpins action, communications work, and the prioritisation process. This has unfortunately been lacking on a number fronts thus far.&#xa0;5.5.&#xa0; We recommend that the NGO community be brought into high-level decision making with regards to government policy on INNS, ideally through representation on the INNS Programme Board. This would facilitate greater buy-in and investment from the NGO community, which is necessary to successfully tackle INNS in the UK.&#xa0;

[[[Public communications]]]5.6.&#xa0; It is widely acknowledged that to effectively tackle INNS we need the general public to be aware of the problem and ready to act, as well as having effective technical tools available. Many of the species we would seek to identify, contain or tackle will first be observed by members of the public, and the reasons for addressing some species will require thoughtful explanation. There has been good progress, for example in developing ‘Be Plant Wise’ and ‘Check Clean Dry’, although it has proven difficult to establish the success of these projects, which are aimed at particular sectors rather than the general public. &#xa0;5.7.&#xa0; The GB Strategy established a communications group to oversee and deliver on this need. However, although this group has made progress it has been stymied by a government freeze on funds for communications work, and an inability to gain the necessary expertise to devise structured campaigns. Moving forward, we need a well-resourced and fit-for-purpose communications campaign which seeks to meaningfully engage with all relevant sectors, is dynamic and can be monitored to demonstrate impact.&#xa0;

[[[Intra-departmental and intra-governmental communications]]]5.8.&#xa0; An effective response requires buy-in, resourcing and ownership of action in departments other than Defra (as well as between Defra’s agencies). This is in recognition of the breadth of impacts caused by INNS to society, and the need to draw on mechanisms outside Defra’s scope of influence. For example, responsibility for ratification of the Ballast Water convention lies not with Defra but with the Department for Transport.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Prioritising action]]]5.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It has long been recognised that to fully address the presence of problem species (or those with the potential to cause problems) already present in the UK (which currently stands at almost 2000 non-native species), requires resources far beyond those likely to be reasonably available. The actual or likely impact of each species varies, as does knowledge of the ecology of each species and of how it will express its invasiveness in a UK context. An element of prioritisation has been core to the domestic approach thus far, underpinned by the production of high quality risk assessments. However, we do not consider that this has been sufficiently strategic. There has been a lack of clarity over why action for certain species has been prioritised over others, and in particular what outcome is ultimately sought for species already established. The lack of systematic horizon scanning has undermined the ability to prioritise action towards preventing new species from arriving – the most cost effective means to prevent impacts, i.e. before species become established.&#xa0;5.10. A single body to identify, plan and oversee strategic management INNS, and to ensure that the environmental benefit of available resources is maximised, should be identified. This will need to operate at country level – the legislation in Scotland has been updated recently to allow for this.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.&#xa0; The NGO community is deeply supportive of the clear need for EU-level action, to be underpinned by appropriately robust legislation which all Member States must in principle adhere to. The effectiveness of our own GB level strategy is significantly undermined by a lack of corresponding action and investment by other Member States. We have worked, and continue to work, on a number of levels to ensure that this legislation is positioned to support the efforts of the UK through enhanced efforts and coordination in other countries that affect us, and where necessary further drive forward domestic action. The attributes of appropriate and effective EU legislation that can address INNS from our perspective are:&#xa0;6.1.1. One whose resultant action is not arbitrarily limited to a set number of priority species. The list should instead be informed by the outcomes of risk assessments, and regularly updated if need be (quickly) via an emergency listing mechanism. If the list of species of concern was limited to 50 it would completely undermine the efficacy of the Regulation.&#xa0;6.1.2. A Regulation that enhances and complements current and planned action in the UK. For example, by ensuring that other countries where Ruddy Duck is present take the necessary measures to completely eradicate it from both the wild and private collections (to complement the extensive efforts of the UK). The Regulation must also not undermine the efficacy of planned and future bans on sale in the UK, which may go further than measures demanded by the Regulation or be applied to species not included on EU-wide species lists.&#xa0;6.1.3. One which facilitates effective and timely communications and coordination between Member States so that joint action plans can be developed, and the appearance of problem species in neighbouring states is communicated in a timely way to all other Member States so that they may take appropriate action.&#xa0;6.1.4. One which facilitates the development of shared risk assessment resources (overseen by the Commission and pan-EU if need be), through a scientific review body that would provide scientific rigor to the selection of species and their risk assessments, and with an underpinning database detailing where species are found, likely to be found, and where specific measures are in place or need to be in place.&#xa0;6.1.5. One which allows species to be listed on the EU-wide list that are native to parts of the EU, but have significant impacts through being invasive in other parts of the EU. For example, Dikerogammarus villosus (killer shrimp) and other Ponto-Caspian species which originate from eastern European countries have caused, and are projected to cause, problematic outbreaks in the UK and so require measures that will come under the scope of the EU Regulation.&#xa0;6.1.6. Appropriately embeds the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, whilst allowing some discretion in countries already heavily infested.&#xa0;6.1.7. Is adequately resourced. We are concerned that the costs of implementing the Regulation, and the servicing of the associated data needs, is seriously underestimated at this stage, and that this lack of funding may prove short sighted and cost ineffective. &#xa0;6.1.8. One which assures (despite retaining some scope for derogations to take place) that pan-EU action can be secured where this is critical for effective outcomes. All Member States need to adopt the precautionary principle because knowledge of how species evolve, disperse and behave in different climates is far from complete. The UK must also follow suit. For example, Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth, which originates from South America) is not currently present in the wild in the UK, but is already a serious problem in some neighbouring Member States. There is some scope for the species to be invasive in the UK in the future (under climate change scenarios), and for the UK to act as a reservoir for invasion back into neighbouring states - thus undermining their own actions. Should it be a species recommended for pan-EU measures, then the UK must follow suit.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1.&#xa0; The renewed GB Strategy must embed an effective domestic response, as detailed above. It must also by savvy in its outlook towards and embracing of the EU situation, recognising that there is a need to share our knowledge with countries that have yet to prepare a strategy. The success of many of our actions is dependent upon the cultivation of cross-border relationships. If the draft GB Strategy continues to benefit from input during its development phase from a range of stakeholders, including the NGO sector, then it will gain significant endorsement and greater action as a result. Equally important, however, is the need to broker broader ownership and action across other relevant parts of government, underpinned by evidence, with the assumption that commitment and funds must follow.
