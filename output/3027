[normal]Since 1973, Campaign for Better Transport has been helping to create transport policies and programmes that give people better lives and support the environment. Our 
[normal]vision is a country where communities have affordable transport that improves quality of l
[normal]ife and protects the environment. Achieving our vision requires substantial changes to UK transport policy
[normal] which w
[normal]e aim to achieve 
[normal]by 
[normal]providing well-researched, practical solutions that gain support from 
[normal]both 
[normal]decision-makers and the public.
[normal]The Government published 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] in July 2013, following up the spending plans ini
[normal]tially announced in the Spending Round in June and outlined in 
[normal]Investing in Britain's Future
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A) Policies we welcome[bold]These include a renewed emphasis on maintenance, the ability 
[normal]of
[normal] the Highways Agency to fund projects outside the strategic road network, specific policies on cycling and walking, and a range of initiatives to reduce the environmental and landscape impact of new and existing roads. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B) An unwelcome[bold] (and irrational) [bold]re[bold]turn to 'predict and provide'[bold]We are very concerned with several of the assumptions 
[normal]behind the policies in
[normal] 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal]:
[normal]1. The UK's strategic road network
[normal] (SRN)
[normal] is inadequate
[normal]2. Traffic growth and new roads to accommodate it are essential for economic
[normal] growth
[normal]3. Forecasts predict traffic will grow rapidly
[normal]4. A large road-building programme will reduce congestion in the long term
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We will tackle the third assumption in answer to the 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee's third question, below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The first assumption 
[normal]has been
[normal] stated
[normal] repeatedly in recent documents and speeches: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However
[normal], this statistic 
[normal]turns out to be
[normal] based on the replie
[normal]s
[normal] of 
[normal]a sample of 
[normal]company executives
[normal] 
[normal]to a single survey question
[normal] in the World Economic Forum’s
[normal] 
[normal]annual Executive Opinion Survey
[normal].
[normal] In 2012, the sample size for thi
[normal]s survey from the UK was just 93.
[normal]  
[normal]In contrast, t
[normal]he
[normal] much more rigorous and extensive
[normal] Eddington 
[normal]Transport Study of
[normal] 2006 found that the UK was very well connected in transport terms, with good 
[normal]networks linking
[normal] major towns and cities and many alternative rou
[normal]tes provi
[normal]ding a high level of resilience.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] provide
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]no
[normal] evidence for the second assumption above. 
[normal]The whole of Section 1 on 'Roads and the economy' only includes two references to external analyses (the other references are to basic 
[normal]statistics for chart data) and these are both relatively limited surveys of businesses (the WEF and an EEF document based on a survey of manufacturing companies
[normal]). The Government should be challenged on the why it has used such small and narrow range of so
[normal]urces as a key supporting plank for a major new policy and spending programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of policies to support economic growth, the Eddington Study also contradicts the assertion that large new road infrastructure will deliver growth
[normal], saying: "Today, in m
[normal]ature economies like the UK, with well-established networks and where connectivity between economic centres is already in place, the evidence suggests that there is considerably less scope for transport improvements to deliver the periods of rapid growth s
[normal]een historically." 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Eddington 
[normal]also 
[normal]recognis
[normal]ed that congestion is primarily an urban problem and championed smaller, low-cost interventions based on evidence of the benefits of "smarter choices" programmes and the cycling demonstration towns. Since then, 
[normal]the 
[normal]evidence
[normal] base
[normal] 
[normal]for this approach 
[normal]has grown
[normal] rapidly
[normal], with the Local Sustainable Transport Fund supporting nearly 100 packages of projects and initial (as yet unpublished) assessments showing
[normal] very high benefit-cost ratios.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]M
[normal]any UK cities, such as Notting
[normal]ham, Cambridge and London, have shown that economic and population growth can be achieved without corresponding traffic increases
[normal] and, across
[normal] the country, traffic and economic growth have been decoupling since the 1990s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other recent evidence comes from t
[normal]he USA where research into stimulus spending has shown that a 'fix it first' strategy is more effective than 
[normal]big new 
[normal]road-
[normal]building
[normal] projects
[normal] at creating jobs
[normal].
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even on its own terms, the fourth assumption
[normal] 
[normal]– that a return to major road building will r
[normal]educe congestion in the long term – fails to stand up. The new 2013 traffic forecasts and the maps shown in 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] 
[normal]predict
[normal] higher than ever
[normal] traffic
[normal] in the future, with a
[normal] 43 per cent rise in traffic on all roads and a
[normal] 
[normal]46
[normal] per cent increase
[normal] 
[normal]on the S
[normal]RN 
[normal]by 2040. It is clear that no amount of road-building could possibly kee
[normal]p up with this predicted level of demand and that – if the forecasts are believed 
[normal]–
[normal] polic
[normal]ies 
[normal]aimed at 
[normal]reducing
[normal] demand are the only rational response.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no acknowledgement 
[normal]in 
[normal]these
[normal] new policy documents of the principle of induced traffic or that 
[normal]the new 
[normal]policies, ostensibly designed to tackle growing traffic, will in fact be responsible for making the problem worse. These are not controversial sta
[normal]tements to make. T
[normal]hese principl
[normal]es have been 
[normal]firmly 
[normal]established since the first SACTRA report was published in 1994
[normal] and it is much more controversial that the Government appears to have forgotten them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C) Environmental impact[bold]The planned expansion of the SRN would have a huge impact o
[normal]n the environment, with new land required for bypasses and widening projects. Particularly worrying is the proposal for a new 'expressway' standard – effectively a policy for the long-term dualling o
[normal]f most of the network. With 
[normal]Campaign to Protect Rural Eng
[normal]land, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trust and RSPB, we 
[normal]recently warned
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] the potential impact o
[normal]f this on National Parks, 
[normal]AONBs and the World Heritage Site at Stonehenge
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have 
[normal]also warned
[normal] about the 
[normal]impact 
[normal]of two major
[normal] current Highways Agency proposal 
[normal]on
[normal] air pollution
[normal]. Our submission
[normal]s to 
[normal]the A556 Knutsford to Bowden Improvement 
[normal]examination and the 
[normal]A14 route consultation 
[normal]show 
[normal]these projects are likely to raise pollution above EU legal limits.
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] issu
[normal]e 
[normal]ha
[normal]s
[normal] been giv
[normal]en greater urgency by
[normal] the UK Supreme Court rul
[normal]ing
[normal] in May 2013 that the Government 
[normal]is
[normal] failing in its legal duty to protect people from the effects of dangerously high air pollution.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]D) Effects on local roads[bold]While acknowledging that locally managed roads
[normal] make up nin
[normal]ety-eight per cent of the
[normal] network, 
[normal]Action for 
[normal]Roads
[normal] fails to
[normal] 
[normal]recognise
[normal] that a policy 
[normal]which increases
[normal] traffic on the SRN would have a huge knock-on effect on local roads, increasing congestion in towns, cities and rural areas around the SRN. 
[normal]In 
[normal]many cases, the expansion of the SRN close to urban areas would be in direct contradiction with local policies intende
[normal]d to reduce the need to travel 
[normal]and reduce road
[normal] traffic
[normal]. 
[normal]We welcome the new ability of the Highways Agency to invest outside the 
[normal]SRN
[normal]. However, the strategies outlined in 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] and the wo
[normal]rk that has taken place so far on 
[normal]the new 
[normal]Route Based Strategies do not
[normal] demonstrate that the Government i
[normal]s 
[normal]working towards
[normal] be
[normal]tter integration between modes 
[normal]or
[normal] collaboration with other 
[normal]departments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A) Link with rail?[bold]We strongly support closer links between strategic road and rail investment programmes. However, despite the
[normal] switch to longer term funding 
[normal]for 
[normal]the Highways Agency, and the similarity of the funding period covered by Action for Roads and the cur
[normal]rent HLOS period,
[normal] there is no evidence 
[normal]for 
[normal]proposals 
[normal]being
[normal] put together i
[normal]n conjunction with Network Rail or using information from them
[normal]. 
[normal]Our 
[normal]campaigners ha
[normal]ve 
[normal]taken
[normal] part in the 
[normal]recent
[normal] Route Based Strategy workshops (covering 18 routes 
[normal]across the
[normal] SRN). 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal]se 
[normal]seek to establish the 'problems and opportunities' faced by each route 
[normal]but
[normal] the maps provided only
[normal] include 
[normal]roads
[normal] and don't even 
[normal]feature 
[normal]current rail 
[normal]lines
[normal],
[normal] let alone planned improvements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B) Link with buses?[bold]The focus in
[normal] recent budgets 
[normal]has been
[normal] for revenue spending to be cut while capital spending is increased. This means that, except for a small number of capital schemes
[normal], buses have suffered cuts 
[normal]due to lower local authority budgets and a reduction in the Bus Service Operators Grant. 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] acknowledges in bullet points on the benefits of roads that they 
[normal]are "
[normal]vital for those travelling by bus
[normal] or bicycle
[normal]"
[normal] and mentions that some pinch-point
[normal] schemes will improve bus priority at junctions. However, there is no section covering measures to support public transport on the SRN,
[normal] despite the
[normal] potential for express coaches (
[normal]for example
[normal])
[normal], to reduce congestion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C) Link with active travel and smarter c[bold]hoices?[bold]P
[normal]olicies on smarter travel, travel planning and demand management are completely absent from 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] and there is only a brief mention of the 
[normal]LSTF 
[normal](in the section on walking and cycling).  
[normal]Whil
[normal]st
[normal] we welcome 
[normal]the 
[normal]new cycling feasibility stud
[normal]ies
[normal], there is a huge missed opportunity for active travel and s
[normal]marter choices programmes to 
[normal]relieve pressure on the SRN, particularly 
[normal]on
[normal] 
[normal]congested 
[normal]stretches
[normal] around cities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]D[bold]) Link with planning policies[bold]?[bold]A new circular on how the Highways Agency engages 
[normal]with the planning system was published in 2013.
[normal] 
[normal]We
[normal] welcom
[normal]ed 
[normal]some aspects, such as 
[normal]the Highways Agency 
[normal]having
[normal] a
[normal] role in both the plan-making and decision-makin
[normal]g stages of the planning process
[normal]. However, we
[normal] also
[normal] 
[normal]urged that the programme requiring travel plan
[normal]s for developments near the SRN should be reinstated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]E) Cross-departmental objectives[bold]W
[normal]e and others have made the case for greater collaboration between departments
[normal], for example
[normal] with the Department of Health on
[normal] active travel
[normal], 
[normal]DECC
[normal] on climate change emis
[normal]sions, Defra on complying with legal requirements on air pollution or 
[normal]DWP 
[normal]on
[normal] access
[normal] to
[normal] work and training. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]n
[normal] example of 
[normal]a possible
[normal] 
[normal]collaboration 
[normal]is
[normal] the
[normal] Active Travel Fund
[normal] proposed by a 
[normal]range
[normal] of 
[normal]groups in the run up to the Spending Round
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]fun
[normal]d could 
[normal]combine a share of the t
[normal]ransport budget with contributions from public health
[normal] funds
[normal].
[normal]We have 
[normal]challenged
[normal] the reliability of the Government's traffic forecasts for many years, and have been disappointed with recent responses to these challenges. DfT maintains 
[normal]that its forecasts are fit for purpose,
[normal] despite evidence that 
[normal]the
[normal]y
[normal] have 
[normal]overestimated
[normal] deman
[normal]d since the end of the 1980s. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A) Why traffic forecasts matter[bold]The problem with over-estimating traff
[normal]ic growth lies not only in how forecasts
[normal] are used to support policies of 'predict and provide' (in fact they could equally support
[normal] urgent
[normal] 
[normal]policies of traffic reduction) 
[normal]but also in how they 
[normal]underlie
[normal] economic case
[normal]s for
[normal] schemes and
[normal] 
[normal]lend systematic
[normal] support
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]projects
[normal] that add road capacity. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The WebTAG method of 
[normal]assessment
[normal] – in particular the 
[normal]way 
[normal]cost-benefit ratio
[normal]s are calculated
[normal] – rel
[normal]ies 
[normal]he
[normal]avily 
[normal]on 
[normal]forecasts of
[normal] traffic
[normal] growth
[normal]. Time savings 
[normal]often
[normal] 
[normal]constitute
[normal] 
[normal]eighty to ninety per cent
[normal] of the calculated benefits of a scheme (the controversial Bexhill-Hastings Link Road is a typical example at 
[normal]84
[normal]%
[normal]) 
[normal]and 
[normal]the
[normal]se
[normal] time 'savings' are 
[normal]calculated against
[normal] 
[normal]what is predicted to be the case with no 
[normal]scheme in place.
[normal] It is 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]because
[normal] strong long-term traffic growth 
[normal]is
[normal] predicted that 
[normal]time savings
[normal] 
[normal]tend to dominate BCRs
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B) Recent [bold]changes in [bold]traffic trends[bold]Traffic 
[normal]in
[normal] Great Britain has 
[normal]diverged
[normal] from historical trends in 
[normal]the past two decades
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]There 
[normal]has been
[normal] a flattening of growth 
[normal]since 
[normal]the 1990s
[normal];
[normal] a 
[normal]plateau/peak in the mid-2000s followed by 
[normal]a decline
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]then 
[normal]a flattening off of this decline since around 2010.  
[normal]DfT traffic statistics for 2012 show th
[normal]at the
[normal] total
[normal] amount of traffic is now below 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]2003
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The most recent National Travel Survey 
[normal](NTS)
[normal] illustrates how driving patterns are changing on a per-person basis
[normal]. 
[normal]Key results
[normal] include:
[normal],
[normal]These trends all call into question the wisdom 
[normal]of building new roads now. C
[normal]ongestion and traffic are below wha
[normal]t they have been at their peak, with several years of growth needed just to bring them up to levels that have previously been experienced. Far better to take advantage of the 'breathing space' provided by the recent trends 
[normal]to support sustainable transport 
[normal]alternatives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C) Problem with the accuracy of recent forecasts[bold]DfT f
[normal]o
[normal]recasts 
[normal]have 
[normal]over-estimated traffic growth since the 1980s, particularly when 
[normal]it comes to 
[normal]long-term trends. 
[normal]Fig 3.1: Performance of DfT traffic forecasts since 1989[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The chart in Fig
[normal] 3.1 shows a comparison of traffic in England with forecasts from 1989 to 2011.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]DfT
[normal] 
[normal]contends that the accuracy of its forecasts is better than implied by the chart above by including earlier fo
[normal]recasts in its own reports and describing forecasts since the
[normal] early 1970s as "generally under-forecasted"
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Fig 3.2: DfT forecasts vs outturn chart[bold]In Fig 3.2 over-forecasting in recent years 
[normal]is obscured by the longer 
[normal]time
[normal]scale and 
[normal]large point markers, but it can be seen that the closest fit to the long term tre
[normal]nd up to 2005 is the 1973 
[normal]forecast and that 
[normal]the even lower gradient of the post-oil crisis 1975 'under' forecast is about to become the most accurate in the long term. 
[normal]A continuing plateau 
[normal]or decline in line with theories of 'peak car' would see the outtur
[normal]n line meet the 1980 and 1984 'under-forecasts' by around 2020, but none of the DfT's current scenarios produce figures even close to these possibilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]nother crucial
[normal] issue is that 
[normal]– whether accurate or not – 
[normal]these
[normal] 
[normal]forecasts are unsustainable:
[normal] if road
[normal] travel were really to grow as forecasts predict (a 43% increase in road traffic by 2040), climate change targets will be impossible to meet an
[normal]d, however much we expand roads, 
[normal]congestion will get worse.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]D[bold])[bold] Problems[bold] with the underlying National Transport Model[bold] (NTM)[bold]The main problems with the methodology behind forecasts and the underlying NTM are the limited number of 'key drivers' and a number of out-of-date assumptions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Road Transport Forecasts 2013
[normal] outlines the
[normal]se three key drivers and their assumed effects on traffic
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As the NTM is a closed model, it is not possible to interrogate its detailed workings. However we believe that the National Trip End Model (NTEM) does co
[normal]nsider factors such as population density, new developments and demographics in working out local variations in demand for travel by car, but that ultimately these are 'constrained' or adjusted to fit in with the macro picture determined by these three fac
[normal]tors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By using so few factors in estimating macro-level changes in demand, the forecasts ignore
[normal] how open to question future behaviour is and leave aside a range of important nation
[normal]wide changes in 
[normal]technology
[normal], demographics
[normal] and 
[normal]land-use
[normal]. These failings are 
[normal]acknowledged in the chapter 'Uncertainty and modelling' in the forecast documents, but
[normal] they
[normal] are currently not used to alter the model:  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Changes in technology[bold] and connectivity[bold] that affect behaviour[bold] – especially relevant to the steady reduction in trip rat
[normal]es seen since 1997
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Changes in culture[bold] between generations[bold] – younger people are currently assumed as they age to adopt the driving patterns 
[normal]of
[normal] people in today's older age groups. It is much more likely that 
[normal]people
[normal] raised since the 1990s will have different 
[normal]driving habits
[normal] to those growing
[normal] up in the 1970s or 1950s. 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Changes in town planning[bold] – for example the 'town centre first' planning policies that are attributed to a proportion of the reduction in driving seen in the 'On the Move' report (see next section).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Out of date assumptions[bold]The following assumptions 
[normal]are 
[normal]also 
[normal]out of date. 
[normal]There are plans to update these in the near future, but this is not represented in the 2013 forecasts
[normal] upon which
[normal] the policies in
[normal] 
[normal]Action for Roads 
[normal]re
[normal]ly.
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Trip rates[bold] – the 2013 Road Transport Forecasts document admits that trip rate data
[normal] is based on NTS results from 1988-96 and that they are assumed to be constant over time for each type of person (split according to age, car ownership and employment)
[normal] 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Population dis[bold]tribution[bold] – the NTEM uses 
[normal]ONS
[normal] population projections from 2010.
[normal] These are in turn based on 
[normal]data
[normal] from the 2001 census. The next set of detailed data on population, 
[normal]from
[normal] the 2011 Census, is likely to show a higher level of overall population growth but a ve
[normal]ry different distribution, focused mainly on larger cities that have lower cultural and practical levels of car use and be
[normal]tter public transport
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]E[bold]) Policy changes needed[bold]DfT 
[normal]should 
[normal]hold a root and branch review of the processes of appraisal and forecastin
[normal]g. This would have three aspects, including
[normal] – importantly 
[normal]–
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]opening up of the new NTM
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1. Full review of appraisal and the NTM[bold]2. A new simpler, publicly owned NTM[bold], built to match the results of the review and available on an open licence for 
[normal]interested parties to interrogate and experiment with (for exampl
[normal]e by altering the underlying ass
[normal]umptions)
[normal]3. The wider use of scenarios in appraisal[bold], not just in the production of the forecasts. Th
[normal]e range of scenarios
[normal] should include a comparison of the be
[normal]nefits of schemes with the current situation, not just with a range of predicted 'do minimum' futures. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We
[normal] have 
[normal]requested
[normal] the opening up of
[normal] DfT model
[normal]s to match practices in
[normal] the Treasury 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]some 
[normal]economic model
[normal]s
[normal]. However, we have been told that issue
[normal]s of c
[normal]omplexity –
[normal] the merging and linking of 
[normal]many
[normal] different data models –
[normal] and
[normal] the inclusion of 
[normal]proprietary software prevents this with the 
[normal]NTM
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome this question – WebTAG gives priority to maximising even small time savings but surveys show people and businesses most want reliability. 
[normal]We believe that technological innovation can
[normal] help provide this and 
[normal]reliev
[normal]e
[normal] a number of cur
[normal]rent problems on the SRN. These include: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A) Congestion around urban areas[bold]On congested sections of the SRN, current
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]and 
[normal]more 
[normal]advanced
[normal]) 
[normal]ITS 
[normal]aspects of the Managed Motorway (and new 'Smart Roads') schemes 
[normal]can do much to
[normal] manag
[normal]e 
[normal]congestion
[normal], reliability
[normal] 
[normal]and driver information 
[normal]via 
[normal]variable 
[normal]speed limits and improved warning and information signs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B) Safety[bold]Lower or variabl
[normal]e speed limits, enforced by average speed cameras, may also be suitable for improving the safety record of 
[normal]bust parts of the SRB as well as 
[normal]many rural single carriageway A roads, on and off the SRN. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C) [bold]Community severance, social [bold]and environmental impact[bold]s of existing roads[bold]The Highways Agency is working to improve its environmental record, and there are 
[normal]some 
[normal]welcome references to 
[normal]this 
[normal]in 
[normal]Action for R
[normal]o
[normal]a
[normal]ds
[normal]. We also welcome the start of a cycling project pipeline. This is
[normal] currently
[normal], however, a slightly piecemeal process and could be much better integrated with other initiatives 
[normal]including the pinch-
[normal]point programme, maintenance and major projects. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is also enormous scope 
[normal](
[normal]with 
[normal]additional
[normal] funding being provided to the Agency
[normal])
[normal] fo
[normal]r a much more extensive 'retrofitting' programme to tackle
[normal] 
[normal]the environmental and social problems caused by the network in a much more concerted way. 
[normal]However,
[normal] 
[normal]evidence of the first 
[normal]Performance Specification
[normal] for the Highways Agency for 2013-15 is not encoura
[normal]ging.
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]nly two requirements (on noise and air quality) 
[normal]cover
[normal] effect
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]on the environment
[normal] and wider community, with no measures 
[normal]for the

[normal]Problems with private roads
[normal] 
[normal]looked at the issue of attracting private finance into road building and management,
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]considering the 
[normal]range of models then being discussed by the Government. This concluded, for each model:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On toll roads, the Government has also experienced real difficulties. The two potential projects so far moo
[normal]ted to be funded through tolls 
[normal]– the M4 Relief Road in Wales and the A14 in Cambridgeshire – 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]proved deeply controversial.
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Finding private investors fo
[normal]r anything less costly than PFI-
[normal]style schemes will depend on finding or developing a revenue str
[normal]eam from drivers
[normal], 
[normal]but
[normal] all the models described above have also proved very unpopular
[normal] with the public
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Our response to 
[normal]Alan 
[normal]Cook
[normal]'s
[normal] review of the Highways Agency, 
[normal]A fresh start for the strategic road network
[normal],
[normal] welcomed its emphasis on better managing the network rather than major expansion. 
[normal]Howe
[normal]ver, we had serious doubts about taking primary responsibility for the SRN away from the Secretary of State for Transport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another concern was the proposed remit for the DfT as a 'champion of road users'. The response of the
[normal] then
[normal] Secretary of State to th
[normal]is proposal was relatively robust, saying:
[normal]"
[normal]We accept this recommendation though with some qualifications.
[normal] 
[normal]It is clearly important for the Government to represent the interests of road users as, in the absence of a commercial relationship between drivers 
[normal]and the network operator, customers rely on the Government to feed back their concerns and represent their interests. However, in order to reach balanced and well informed decisions, the Government also needs to take full account of all stakeholders in the
[normal] roads, including the wider community that this network serves."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However,
[normal] it appears
[normal] these qualifications have not emerged intact from the
[normal] processes that led to
[normal] 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, we question whether
[normal] all
[normal] the aims for the 
[normal]new roads strategy given in the Secretary of State's response to Cook are 
[normal]in fact
[normal] being delivered.
[normal] 
[normal]These
[normal] aims
[normal] 
[normal]included demand management, but there is no sign of policies for managing demand in 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal].
