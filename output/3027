defaultSince 1973, Campaign for Better Transport has been helping to create transport policies and programmes that give people better lives and support the environment. Our 
defaultvision is a country where communities have affordable transport that improves quality of l
defaultife and protects the environment. Achieving our vision requires substantial changes to UK transport policy
default which w
defaulte aim to achieve 
defaultby 
defaultproviding well-researched, practical solutions that gain support from 
defaultboth 
defaultdecision-makers and the public.
defaultThe Government published 
defaultAction for Roads
default in July 2013, following up the spending plans ini
defaulttially announced in the Spending Round in June and outlined in 
defaultInvesting in Britain's Future
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA) Policies we welcomedefaultThese include a renewed emphasis on maintenance, the ability 
defaultof
default the Highways Agency to fund projects outside the strategic road network, specific policies on cycling and walking, and a range of initiatives to reduce the environmental and landscape impact of new and existing roads. 
default&#xa0;
defaultB) An unwelcomedefault (and irrational) defaultredefaultturn to 'predict and provide'defaultWe are very concerned with several of the assumptions 
defaultbehind the policies in
default 
defaultAction for Roads
default:
default1. The UK's strategic road network
default (SRN)
default is inadequate
default2. Traffic growth and new roads to accommodate it are essential for economic
default growth
default3. Forecasts predict traffic will grow rapidly
default4. A large road-building programme will reduce congestion in the long term
default&#xa0;
defaultWe will tackle the third assumption in answer to the 
defaultC
defaultommittee's third question, below.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first assumption 
defaulthas been
default stated
default repeatedly in recent documents and speeches: 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever
default, this statistic 
defaultturns out to be
default based on the replie
defaults
default of 
defaulta sample of 
defaultcompany executives
default 
defaultto a single survey question
default in the World Economic Forum’s
default 
defaultannual Executive Opinion Survey
default.
default In 2012, the sample size for thi
defaults survey from the UK was just 93.
default  
defaultIn contrast, t
defaulthe
default much more rigorous and extensive
default Eddington 
defaultTransport Study of
default 2006 found that the UK was very well connected in transport terms, with good 
defaultnetworks linking
default major towns and cities and many alternative rou
defaulttes provi
defaultding a high level of resilience.
default&#xa0;
defaultAction for Roads
default provide
defaults
default 
defaultno
default evidence for the second assumption above. 
defaultThe whole of Section 1 on 'Roads and the economy' only includes two references to external analyses (the other references are to basic 
defaultstatistics for chart data) and these are both relatively limited surveys of businesses (the WEF and an EEF document based on a survey of manufacturing companies
default). The Government should be challenged on the why it has used such small and narrow range of so
defaulturces as a key supporting plank for a major new policy and spending programme.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of policies to support economic growth, the Eddington Study also contradicts the assertion that large new road infrastructure will deliver growth
default, saying: "Today, in m
defaultature economies like the UK, with well-established networks and where connectivity between economic centres is already in place, the evidence suggests that there is considerably less scope for transport improvements to deliver the periods of rapid growth s
defaulteen historically." 
default&#xa0;
defaultEddington 
defaultalso 
defaultrecognis
defaulted that congestion is primarily an urban problem and championed smaller, low-cost interventions based on evidence of the benefits of "smarter choices" programmes and the cycling demonstration towns. Since then, 
defaultthe 
defaultevidence
default base
default 
defaultfor this approach 
defaulthas grown
default rapidly
default, with the Local Sustainable Transport Fund supporting nearly 100 packages of projects and initial (as yet unpublished) assessments showing
default very high benefit-cost ratios.
default&#xa0;
defaultM
defaultany UK cities, such as Notting
defaultham, Cambridge and London, have shown that economic and population growth can be achieved without corresponding traffic increases
default and, across
default the country, traffic and economic growth have been decoupling since the 1990s
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther recent evidence comes from t
defaulthe USA where research into stimulus spending has shown that a 'fix it first' strategy is more effective than 
defaultbig new 
defaultroad-
defaultbuilding
default projects
default at creating jobs
default.
default,
default 
default,
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultEven on its own terms, the fourth assumption
default 
default– that a return to major road building will r
defaulteduce congestion in the long term – fails to stand up. The new 2013 traffic forecasts and the maps shown in 
defaultAction for Roads
default 
defaultpredict
default higher than ever
default traffic
default in the future, with a
default 43 per cent rise in traffic on all roads and a
default 
default46
default per cent increase
default 
defaulton the S
defaultRN 
defaultby 2040. It is clear that no amount of road-building could possibly kee
defaultp up with this predicted level of demand and that – if the forecasts are believed 
default–
default polic
defaulties 
defaultaimed at 
defaultreducing
default demand are the only rational response.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no acknowledgement 
defaultin 
defaultthese
default new policy documents of the principle of induced traffic or that 
defaultthe new 
defaultpolicies, ostensibly designed to tackle growing traffic, will in fact be responsible for making the problem worse. These are not controversial sta
defaulttements to make. T
defaulthese principl
defaultes have been 
defaultfirmly 
defaultestablished since the first SACTRA report was published in 1994
default and it is much more controversial that the Government appears to have forgotten them. 
default&#xa0;
defaultC) Environmental impactdefaultThe planned expansion of the SRN would have a huge impact o
defaultn the environment, with new land required for bypasses and widening projects. Particularly worrying is the proposal for a new 'expressway' standard – effectively a policy for the long-term dualling o
defaultf most of the network. With 
defaultCampaign to Protect Rural Eng
defaultland, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trust and RSPB, we 
defaultrecently warned
default 
defaultof
default the potential impact o
defaultf this on National Parks, 
defaultAONBs and the World Heritage Site at Stonehenge
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have 
defaultalso warned
default about the 
defaultimpact 
defaultof two major
default current Highways Agency proposal 
defaulton
default air pollution
default. Our submission

defaultthe A556 Knutsford to Bowden Improvement 
defaultexamination and the 
defaultA14 route consultation

defaultthese projects are likely to raise pollution above EU legal limits.

default been giv
defaulten greater urgency by
default the UK Supreme Court rul
defaulting
default in May 2013 that the Government 
defaultis
default failing in its legal duty to protect people from the effects of dangerously high air pollution.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultD) Effects on local roadsdefaultWhile acknowledging that locally managed roads
default make up nin
defaultety-eight per cent of the
default network, 
defaultAction for 
defaultRoads
default fails to
default 
defaultrecognise
default that a policy 
defaultwhich increases
default traffic on the SRN would have a huge knock-on effect on local roads, increasing congestion in towns, cities and rural areas around the SRN. 
defaultIn 
defaultmany cases, the expansion of the SRN close to urban areas would be in direct contradiction with local policies intende
defaultd to reduce the need to travel 
defaultand reduce road
default traffic
default. 
defaultWe welcome the new ability of the Highways Agency to invest outside the 
defaultSRN
default. However, the strategies outlined in 
defaultAction for Roads
default and the wo
defaultrk that has taken place so far on 
defaultthe new 
defaultRoute Based Strategies do not
default demonstrate that the Government i
defaults 
defaultworking towards
default be
defaulttter integration between modes 
defaultor
default collaboration with other 
defaultdepartments.
default&#xa0;
defaultA) Link with rail?defaultWe strongly support closer links between strategic road and rail investment programmes. However, despite the
default switch to longer term funding 
defaultfor 
defaultthe Highways Agency, and the similarity of the funding period covered by Action for Roads and the cur
defaultrent HLOS period,
default there is no evidence 
defaultfor 
defaultproposals 
defaultbeing
default put together i
defaultn conjunction with Network Rail or using information from them
default. 
defaultOur 
defaultcampaigners ha
defaultve 
defaulttaken
default part in the 
defaultrecent
default Route Based Strategy workshops (covering 18 routes 
defaultacross the
default SRN). 
defaultT
defaulthe
defaultse 
defaultseek to establish the 'problems and opportunities' faced by each route 
defaultbut
default the maps provided only
default include 
defaultroads
default and don't even 
defaultfeature 
defaultcurrent rail 
defaultlines
default,
default let alone planned improvements.
default&#xa0;
defaultB) Link with buses?defaultThe focus in
default recent budgets 
defaulthas been
default for revenue spending to be cut while capital spending is increased. This means that, except for a small number of capital schemes
default, buses have suffered cuts 
defaultdue to lower local authority budgets and a reduction in the Bus Service Operators Grant. 
defaultAction for Roads
default acknowledges in bullet points on the benefits of roads that they 
defaultare "
defaultvital for those travelling by bus
default or bicycle
default"
default and mentions that some pinch-point
default schemes will improve bus priority at junctions. However, there is no section covering measures to support public transport on the SRN,
default despite the
default potential for express coaches (
defaultfor example
default)
default, to reduce congestion.
default&#xa0;
defaultC) Link with active travel and smarter cdefaulthoices?defaultP
defaultolicies on smarter travel, travel planning and demand management are completely absent from 
defaultAction for Roads
default and there is only a brief mention of the 
defaultLSTF 
default(in the section on walking and cycling).  
defaultWhil
defaultst
default we welcome 
defaultthe 
defaultnew cycling feasibility stud
defaulties
default, there is a huge missed opportunity for active travel and s
defaultmarter choices programmes to 
defaultrelieve pressure on the SRN, particularly 
defaulton
default 
defaultcongested 
defaultstretches
default around cities
default.
default&#xa0;defaultDdefault) Link with planning policiesdefault?defaultA new circular on how the Highways Agency engages 
defaultwith the planning system was published in 2013.
default 
defaultWe
default welcom
defaulted 
defaultsome aspects, such as 
defaultthe Highways Agency 
defaulthaving
default a
default role in both the plan-making and decision-makin
defaultg stages of the planning process
default. However, we
default also
default 
defaulturged that the programme requiring travel plan
defaults for developments near the SRN should be reinstated. 
default&#xa0;
defaultE) Cross-departmental objectivesdefaultW
defaulte and others have made the case for greater collaboration between departments
default, for example
default with the Department of Health on
default active travel
default, 
defaultDECC
default on climate change emis
defaultsions, Defra on complying with legal requirements on air pollution or 
defaultDWP 
defaulton
default access
default to
default work and training.

defaultgroups in the run up to the Spending Round
default.
default 
defaultThis 
defaultfun
defaultd could 
defaultcombine a share of the t
defaultransport budget with contributions from public health
default funds
default.
defaultWe have 
defaultchallenged
default the reliability of the Government's traffic forecasts for many years, and have been disappointed with recent responses to these challenges. DfT maintains 
defaultthat its forecasts are fit for purpose,
default despite evidence that 
defaultthe
defaulty
default have 
defaultoverestimated
default deman
defaultd since the end of the 1980s. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA) Why traffic forecasts matterdefaultThe problem with over-estimating traff
defaultic growth lies not only in how forecasts
default are used to support policies of 'predict and provide' (in fact they could equally support
default urgent
default 
defaultpolicies of traffic reduction) 
defaultbut also in how they

defaultB) Recent defaultchanges in defaulttraffic trendsdefaultTraffic 
defaultin
default Great Britain has 
defaultdiverged
default from historical trends in 
defaultthe past two decades
default.
default 
defaultThere

defaultplateau/peak in the mid-2000s followed by

defaultthen 
defaulta flattening off of this decline since around 2010.  
defaultDfT traffic statistics for 2012 show th
defaultat the
default total
default amount of traffic is now below 
defaultthat
default 
defaultof 
default2003
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most recent National Travel Survey 
default(NTS)
default illustrates how driving patterns are changing on a per-person basis
default. 
defaultKey results
default include:
default,
defaultThese trends all call into question the wisdom 
defaultof building new roads now. C
defaultongestion and traffic are below wha
defaultt they have been at their peak, with several years of growth needed just to bring them up to levels that have previously been experienced. Far better to take advantage of the 'breathing space' provided by the recent trends 
defaultto support sustainable transport 
defaultalternatives.
default&#xa0;
defaultC) Problem with the accuracy of recent forecastsdefaultDfT f

defaultit comes to 
defaultlong-term trends. 
defaultFig 3.1: Performance of DfT traffic forecasts since 1989default&#xa0;
defaultThe chart in Fig
default 3.1 shows a comparison of traffic in England with forecasts from 1989 to 2011.
default 
default 
defaultDfT
default 
defaultcontends that the accuracy of its forecasts is better than implied by the chart above by including earlier fo
defaultrecasts in its own reports and describing forecasts since the
default early 1970s as "generally under-forecasted"
default,
default 
defaultFig 3.2: DfT forecasts vs outturn chartdefaultIn Fig 3.2 over-forecasting in recent years 
defaultis obscured by the longer 
defaulttime
defaultscale and 
defaultlarge point markers, but it can be seen that the closest fit to the long term tre
defaultnd up to 2005 is the 1973 
defaultforecast and that 
defaultthe even lower gradient of the post-oil crisis 1975 'under' forecast is about to become the most accurate in the long term. 
defaultA continuing plateau 
defaultor decline in line with theories of 'peak car' would see the outtur
defaultn line meet the 1980 and 1984 'under-forecasts' by around 2020, but none of the DfT's current scenarios produce figures even close to these possibilities.
default&#xa0;
defaultA
defaultnother crucial
default issue is that 
default– whether accurate or not – 
defaultthese
default 
defaultforecasts are unsustainable:
default if road
default travel were really to grow as forecasts predict (a 43% increase in road traffic by 2040), climate change targets will be impossible to meet an
defaultd, however much we expand roads, 
defaultcongestion will get worse.
default&#xa0;
defaultDdefault)default Problemsdefault with the underlying National Transport Modeldefault (NTM)defaultThe main problems with the methodology behind forecasts and the underlying NTM are the limited number of 'key drivers' and a number of out-of-date assumptions.
default&#xa0;
defaultRoad Transport Forecasts 2013
default outlines the
defaultse three key drivers and their assumed effects on traffic
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the NTM is a closed model, it is not possible to interrogate its detailed workings. However we believe that the National Trip End Model (NTEM) does co
defaultnsider factors such as population density, new developments and demographics in working out local variations in demand for travel by car, but that ultimately these are 'constrained' or adjusted to fit in with the macro picture determined by these three fac
defaulttors. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy using so few factors in estimating macro-level changes in demand, the forecasts ignore
default how open to question future behaviour is and leave aside a range of important nation
defaultwide changes in 
defaulttechnology
default, demographics
default and 
defaultland-use
default. These failings are 
defaultacknowledged in the chapter 'Uncertainty and modelling' in the forecast documents, but
default they
default are currently not used to alter the model:  
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChanges in technologydefault and connectivitydefault that affect behaviourdefault – especially relevant to the steady reduction in trip rat
defaultes seen since 1997
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChanges in culturedefault between generationsdefault – younger people are currently assumed as they age to adopt the driving patterns 
defaultof
default people in today's older age groups. It is much more likely that 
defaultpeople
default raised since the 1990s will have different 
defaultdriving habits
default to those growing
default up in the 1970s or 1950s. 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChanges in town planningdefault – for example the 'town centre first' planning policies that are attributed to a proportion of the reduction in driving seen in the 'On the Move' report (see next section).
default&#xa0;
defaultOut of date assumptionsdefaultThe following assumptions 
defaultare 
defaultalso 
defaultout of date. 
defaultThere are plans to update these in the near future, but this is not represented in the 2013 forecasts
default upon which
default the policies in
default 
defaultAction for Roads 
defaultre
defaultly.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTrip ratesdefault – the 2013 Road Transport Forecasts document admits that trip rate data
default is based on NTS results from 1988-96 and that they are assumed to be constant over time for each type of person (split according to age, car ownership and employment)
default 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPopulation disdefaulttributiondefault – the NTEM uses 
defaultONS
default population projections from 2010.
default These are in turn based on 
defaultdata
default from the 2001 census. The next set of detailed data on population, 
defaultfrom
default the 2011 Census, is likely to show a higher level of overall population growth but a ve
defaultry different distribution, focused mainly on larger cities that have lower cultural and practical levels of car use and be
defaulttter public transport
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultEdefault) Policy changes neededdefaultDfT 
defaultshould 
defaulthold a root and branch review of the processes of appraisal and forecastin

default – importantly 
default–

defaultopening up of the new NTM
default:
default&#xa0;default1. Full review of appraisal and the NTMdefault2. A new simpler, publicly owned NTMdefault, built to match the results of the review and available on an open licence for 
defaultinterested parties to interrogate and experiment with (for exampl
defaulte by altering the underlying ass
defaultumptions)
default3. The wider use of scenarios in appraisaldefault, not just in the production of the forecasts. Th
defaulte range of scenarios
default should include a comparison of the be
defaultnefits of schemes with the current situation, not just with a range of predicted 'do minimum' futures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe
default have 
defaultrequested
default the opening up of

default 
default 
defaultconsidering the 
defaultrange of models then being discussed by the Government. This concluded, for each model:
default&#xa0;
defaultOn toll roads, the Government has also experienced real difficulties. The two potential projects so far moo
defaultted to be funded through tolls 
default– the M4 Relief Road in Wales and the A14 in Cambridgeshire –

defaultr anything less costly than PFI-
defaultstyle schemes will depend on finding or developing a revenue str
defaulteam from drivers
default, 
defaultbut
default all the models described above have also proved very unpopular
default with the public
default.
default 
defaultOur response to 
defaultAlan 
defaultCook
default's
default review of the Highways Agency, 
defaultA fresh start for the strategic road network
default,
default welcomed its emphasis on better managing the network rather than major expansion. 
defaultHowe
defaultver, we had serious doubts about taking primary responsibility for the SRN away from the Secretary of State for Transport. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother concern was the proposed remit for the DfT as a 'champion of road users'. The response of the
default then
default Secretary of State to th
defaultis proposal was relatively robust, saying:
default"
defaultWe accept this recommendation though with some qualifications.
default 
defaultIt is clearly important for the Government to represent the interests of road users as, in the absence of a commercial relationship between drivers 
defaultand the network operator, customers rely on the Government to feed back their concerns and represent their interests. However, in order to reach balanced and well informed decisions, the Government also needs to take full account of all stakeholders in the
default roads, including the wider community that this network serves."
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever,
default it appears
default these qualifications have not emerged intact from the
default processes that led to
default 
defaultAction for Roads
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, we question whether
default all
default the aims for the 
defaultnew roads strategy given in the Secretary of State's response to Cook are 
defaultin fact
default being delivered.
default 
defaultThese
default aims
default 
defaultincluded demand management, but there is no sign of policies for managing demand in 
defaultAction for Roads
default.
