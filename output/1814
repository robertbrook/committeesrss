defaultContextdefault&#xa0;default1.1
default              
defaultCLES started undertaking work around public procurement for three core reasons. First, we recognised that central government spent around £240billion a year upon procuring goods and services with local government spending some £72billion. We wanted to understand the impact this spend was bringing for local economies in terms of jobs, spend in deprived areas, and supporting and sustaining local and small business. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecond, we recognised that there was an often uncomfortably bureaucratic approach to public procurement in local authorities and other public sector institutions; with significant evidence of risk adversity and silo working. We wanted to change the cultural mindset of local authority procurement officers and bring procurement to the forefront of local government’s place stewardship and leadership role. In times of austerity, we felt that procurement needed to be a key mechanism in fostering wider public service transformation.

default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThird, we recognised that there was an intrinsic link between the function of procurement and local economic development and growth and that procurement was not being fully maximised to bring economic, social and environmental benefit. We wanted to ensure every pound of investment by public authorities in goods and services reaped maximum benefit for places and communities. This was not just an aim for procurers, but also suppliers in utilising spend both more effectively and efficiently. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur response to these three reasons and indeed frustrations has been a programme of work focused upon demonstrating the benefit of procurement spend and also shifting mindsets and cultures amongst both procurers and suppliers. Our work has involved partners such as the Association for Public Service Excellence and the Federation of Small Businesses and indeed a number of local authorities and other public bodies across the United Kingdom. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur work has focused upon three themes. First, we have looked to provide evidence and intelligence of where procurement spend is going and the impact it has upon local economies. Using the new economics foundation’s Local Multiplier 3 (LM3) methodology as a basis our first piece of 
defaultwork published in 2008 was with Swindon Commercial Services
default and sought to highlight the multiplier effect of the frontline service departments annual £60million budget to the local Swindon economy. 
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecond, we have looked to shift cultures in local government in particular when it comes to the procurement process. This work has focused upon marrying procurement decisions to wider corporate priorities, most notably around economic and social challenges. 
defaultOur work with Manchester City
default has been well-documented; with initial evidence gathering and 
defaultbaselining
default facilitating embedded change in procurement cultures and practice over a four year period (this work is discussed in detail throughout this submission). 
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThird, we have sought to influence the behaviour of both local authority procurers and the supply chain to maximise the economic, social and environmental benefit which public spend brings for communities and places. To do this we have 
defaultdeveloped a framework or diagnostic
default of means by which authorities and suppliers can maximise such benefit. The framework which has been deployed in Cheshire West and Chester, Northumberland and Preston effectively assesses the extent to which authorities are maximising benefit through procurement; and proffers recommendations for improvement. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe above pieces of work in their own right present valuable evidence for the Communities and Local Government Committee call for submission of evidence on Local Government Procurement and indeed the findings cut across a number of the topics outlined. However, for the purposes of this response we focus upon two key questions or areas of focus
default.
default2default              defaultTo what extent is local government organised to deliver value for money, and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
default              
defaultIn answer to the questions, a simple response is that it is dependent upon the culture of the local authority in question, the leadership of its procurement team, and linkages the procurement team makes to other departments and importantly corporate priorities. Where these factors are evident in abundance and embedded in procurement strategy, local authorities are well organised to deliver value for money, and social, economic and environmental objectives. Where these factors are not evident, where there is a risk adverse culture in relation to procurement, and where the primary emphasis of procurement policy is upon cost; then local government are far less organised.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultTo illustrate the point about cultural mindset, the following case study of Manchester City Council highlights how that particular authority has instigated more progressive procurement practice.   Manchester City Council’s work around sustainable and progressive procurement commenced in 2008 with the development of a bespoke procurement model and complimentary Sustainable Procurement Policy.  The premise behind the model was that procurement needed to be treated as a cycle if it was to be more efficient and effective. The Sustainable Procurement Policy had two core and relatively succinct priorities:
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
default              
defaultManchester City Council knew that the corporate and cyclical approach to procurement had already had an effect upon making efficiencies; however they did not know the extent of the impact the Sustainable Procurement Policy was having upon the Manchester economy and the behaviour of suppliers. CLES was therefore commissioned in 2009 to explore the contribution of spend to the local economy. The analysis effectively provided a baseline for where Manchester City Council’s procurement spend was going in 2008/09; and a starting point for further engagement to enable the maximisation of benefit.  The findings of the initial research were positive:
default2.4
default              
default              
defaultDespite the local spend and re-spend figures being positive there was a feeling that improvement could be made in Manchester, particularly in relation to cross-departmental relations around procurement and further maximising spend through more effective influencing by Manchester City Council of the supply chain.  CLES and Manchester City Council have therefore implemented a series of activities designed to maximised the impact of spend. 
defaultAwareness-raising - defaultThis particularly aimed to make suppliers more aware of some of the challenges facing the City and how they could enable benefit through both service delivery and goods provision, and their wider practices.  
defaultCross-departmental procurement working group - defaultThe group, consisting of senior officers from departments such as economic development, procurement, neighbourhood services and adult social care, met on a quarterly basis and sought to identify ways in which procurement spend could tackle issues such as 
defaultworklessness
default, and additionally generate sustained benefit for Manchester.  
defaultSupplier networkdefault - defaultThe network had a dual purpose of addressing any challenges suppliers had with the procurement process; and importantly influencing suppliers to bring about greater impact for the Manchester economy and residents, through their activities related to Manchester City Council’s procurement.  The supplier network has discussed: barriers in the procurement process; tackling 
defaultworklessness
default; apprenticeships; and environmental management.
defaultIdentifying further benefits of procurementdefault - defaultCLES undertook a cost benefit analysis study of the Manchester People into Construction (
defaultMPiC
default) scheme
default, a voluntary arrangement between the Council and suppliers to create three year apprenticeship opportunities for young people at construction partners.  The overarching message from the research was that every £1 invested in the 
defaultMPiC
default scheme generated an additional £4.74 in social, economic and environmental value.     
defaultWider interventionsdefault - defaultAs well as the interventions described above, Manchester City Council have undertaken a number of wider activities designed to enable more small businesses to bid for procurement opportunities in the City.  These activities have included: reducing the need for pre qualification questionnaires (PQQ) on the vast majority of contracts; and the increased promotion of the CHEST
default as the primary means of advertising and promoting tender opportunities.

default              
defaultIn each of financial years 2010/11 and 2011/12, CLES has refreshed the baseline statistics for   Manchester City Council’s spend with its top 300 suppliers.  This has been designed to continuously understand the effectiveness of the Council’s procurement model and Sustainable Procurement Policy; and assess the impact and quality of some of the strategic interventions discussed above.  The key findings of the refresh are as follows:
default3default              default              defaultHow can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies – locally and regionally? If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
default              
defaultA simple answer to the above set of questions is through more effective relationships between procurement officers and economic development teams. In order to meet economic and social objectives, local authorities need to understand the capabilities of their existing supplier base when it comes to delivering upon benefits such as apprenticeships; and also understand their local business base, in terms of who they are, what types of services they can potentially deliver, and what support they require to engage with the process of procurement. In terms of understanding of procurement expenditure and its impact, we feel the picture is improving; but there is work to be done particularly in authorities will little procurement capacity or expertise. 
default3.2
default              
default              
defaultTo illustrate the point around knowledge of procurement expenditure the following provides a case study of CLES’ work with the Federation of Small Businesses over the last two years. The case study is based upon the 
defaultfindings of a survey of 180 local authority Heads of Procurement commissioned by the Federation of Small Businesses
default and undertaken by CLES. In each of April 2012 and April 2013, CLES working alongside the FSB has issued a survey to every Head of Procurement in local government across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This survey has had two purposes. Firstly, to quantify the proportion of authorities actively undertaking spend analysis and subsequently the amount being spent in local economies and with small business. Secondly, to understand and qualify the processes and initiatives which local authorities had in place to support small business in the tendering process.

default4default              defaultConclusiondefault4.1
default              
defaultAs austerity measures continue to impact upon local authorities and places, and as area based initiatives continue to be withdrawn, local authorities need to use the mechanisms that they already have in place to address wider economic, social and environmental challenges. CLES believes that the function of public procurement has significant potential to contribute to both agendas around local economic development and alleviating poverty. Indeed our forthcoming publication with the Joseph 
defaultRowntree
default Foundation (to be published 3
defaultrd
default October 2013) will detail the role of place based mechanisms including procurement in addressing poverty. Local authorities increasingly recognise the importance of public procurement. However, there remains a need for effective policy which encourages authorities to think about both cost efficiency and effectiveness in the procurement process; thus shifting cultures from risk adverse to progressive. 
defaultCLES’ recently published document on public procurement highlights ten ways in which procurement policy can become more progressive
default. We believe these considerations should be at the heart of all local authority practice around procurement.
