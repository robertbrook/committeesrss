[normal]Our response focuses around the following question in the Call for Evidence. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Through this submission, the TTF would like to highlight the inconsistent nature of timber procurement between different public sector agencies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This inconsistency stems from the fact that at central government level all departments and national agencies must apply the National Timber Procurement Policy (NTPP- see 
[normal]http://www.cpet.org.uk/uk-government-timber-procurement-policy
[normal]), 
[normal]whil
[normal]st local government departments are not mandated to adopt the policy (although some do optionally). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The inconsistency causes issues on the ground to our members as suppliers of timber to building contractors who undertake construction work for the government at all levels. Within our membership, approximately 90% of the timber purchased is from certified timber sources (which the NTTP promotes as the preferred option). However, under the rules of certification, if (sub-) contractors do not specify or request certified timber (usually because they perceive they will pay more for it) then the documented chain of custody for such products is often broken (although the timber may be certified). This can cause problems for the government department during project audits for certification. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We particular highlight a useful research report that was published by WWF in 2012 called “Barking up the right Tree” -

[normal]. 
[normal]The report assesses UK local authorities on their success in procuring legal and sustainable/responsible timber and wood products. It complements previous surveys 
[normal]WWF
[normal] undertook in 2007, 2006, 2001 and 1997.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The results for the UK showed that depending on whether the number of local authorities with a sustainable timber product procurement policy in place was calculated as a proportion of the total number of local authorities in the UK or as a proportion of the total number of local authorities in the UK who responded, the figure was either 16% or 57%
