"&#xa0;AFS0082Written evidence submitted by Edward CainesGateway Free School Results and Manor Primary KS2 ClosureManor Primar\ny School is a school in a\n deprived area of Tilbury.  The junior school\n had  previously been in an Ofsted category but the infant school was classed as good. The headteacher of the infant school became the headteacher of the amalgamated primary school but over this time had cancer and was away from school for most of a year f\nollowing surgery\n and chemotherapy\n.  Coming back from this and handing the amalgamation\n of these\n challenging schools she had the further challenge of Gateway specifically targeting her year 5 pupils to move to Gateway in year 6. Parents were told at Gateway\n meetings that if they did not move children to the school they would be unlikely to get a place there. The only other secondary school within walking distance had just failed its Ofsted. Parents who were among the most concerned about their child’s second\nary schooling were most likely to take this action\n and their\n children were often those who were already working at level four or higher. A number of local schools including Manor, Lansdowne, Chadwell St Mary, Woodside, East Tilbury and Little Thurrock were\n affected but Manor and Lansdowne most of all.\nWith no support from its local secondary school and questionable support from the LA Manor Primary was failed by Ofsted this summer. However,\n recently released p\nrimary school league tables show \nthat the Gatewa\ny Free School has scored significantly less than Manor Primary on a number of key measures.   Only 66% of Gateway children gained the expected level 4 in reading, writing a\nnd mathematics compared to 70% \nat Manor and \n72%\n for Thurrock as a whole.\nManor is cu\nrrently being forced to become a sponsored academy as part of the Gateway group with the principal of the Gateway who contributed to its demise now as CEO. It has \nsubsequently been\n decided\n that the Manor KS2 children will be moved on block to the Gateway F\nree School. Manor will continue as an infant school and become primary again in the future but with a reduced size. \nLansdowne\n \nSchool\n is also being reduced by a form of entry. Clearly these actions are being put in place to fill the free school and create t\nhe illusion it was needed. It is not being filled as free schools are intended to be\n,\n by parents who have made a free choice of it as a preferred school.\n \n \nThe Free School results were\n presumably\n poor because t\nhe techniques that \nmade Gateway Sec\nondary so a\npparently successful:\n early and repeated entry to examina\ntions and m\nodules and \nentering children\n for \neasier \nso-\ncalled “equivalent” diplomas are not \navailable in the primary sector. \nIn primary schools c\nhildren\n all \nsit the same test on the same day and it gets sent away to be marked. Except \nof course \nfor the new writing assessment which was the teachers’ \nown \nappraisal of children’s work th\nr\nough the year and which\n,\n surprise, surprise, Gateway did rather better at.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
