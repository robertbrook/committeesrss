"Written evidence submitted by The Prisoners’ Advice Service (JRR 0012)&#xa0;Introduction &#xa0;\nThe Prisoners’ Advice Service (PAS) was launched as an independent charity in 1991. PAS was awarded Legal Aid Lawyer of the year award in the category Legal Aid Firm/Not for Profit organisation in 2011.  We were also awarded the Longford Prize in 2012.\n&#xa0;\nPAS is the only charitable organisation in the UK with a specific remit to provide free legal advice and information to adult prisoners in England and Wales, and provides advice and assistance on the application of the Prison Rules and conditions of impris\nonment. \n&#xa0;\nMost of our work is done through an advice line\n which runs three days a week\n (some 15000 calls were received last year) and by letter. We respond to every letter (some 8000 last year) received from prisoners across the country\n.\n This is again free\n and is not part of any Legal Aid Agency funding.   \n&#xa0;\nPAS does not accept Home Office or Prison Service\n money as this may affect our\n independence. \nWe receive\n most \nof our \nfunding from charitable trusts and foundations.   \n&#xa0;\nPAS does not conduct litigation on behalf of clients to make money. The legal aid element to our work provides costs protection to clients. PAS does not undertake conditional fee arrangements. \nThe Committee’s Call for Evidence&#xa0;\nPAS understands that the C\nommittee seeks evidence from anyone with an interest in the human rights issues raised by the \nGovernment’s proposals to reform judicial review, as set out in its \nConsultation Paper Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform\n and in particular in relation\n to the following:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee also seeks evidence on the combined effect of these proposals and (1) the Government’s\n proposals to reform legal aid, in particular the proposed introduction of a residence test and (2) the provisions in Part 2 of the Immigration Bill reducing rights of appeal against immigration decisions.\n&#xa0;\nWe have addressed the Committee’s request for evi\ndence in turn, as relevant to our expertise in prison law.\n&#xa0;\nStanding and Third Party Interventions&#xa0;At the root of the proposal to change the rules on standing is the Government’s concern that the test for standing in judicial review is too liberal. This i\ns clearly an attempt to use restrictive procedural rules to undermine access to the courts and prevent public interest points from being raised. \nWe have seen little evidence to support the reasoning behind this proposal. \nThe courts have time and time again\n recognised the vital role NGOs, groups with special expertise in areas of government policy and individuals with genuine concern have played in bringing misuse of power to their attention through judicial review. \nIt would seem to us that the Government ha\ns simply not understood the important constitutional role of judicial review. For those in closed institutions, such as our clients, this tool for potential redress is arguably even more important.\n&#xa0;\nPAS is currently challenging the Ministry of Justice in r\nespect of their proposed changes to legal aid in prison law cases. We are challenging the proposed changes together with the Howard League of Penal Reform. We feel best placed as charities involved in this sector to represent prisoners as a whole and to qu\nantify and best describe the devastating effect of the changes on them. PAS has very limited funding and without the benefit of a Protective Costs Order (PCO) we would not be in a position to afford such litigation. The current proposals on the changes to \nstanding and PCOs would directly affect our involvement in such proceedings. \n&#xa0;\nCharities opting to issue judicial review proceedings in matters involving the specific group of people or causes they wish to protect do not do so without first assessing the \nconsequences and risks involved in their legal action. They do so in order to protect the rights of their client group. It is therefore vital to ensure judicial review remains a resource to charities and NGOs to enable them to challenge public authorities \nwhen considered necessary.\n&#xa0;\nFurther, the Government proposes to limit access to judicial review to those who have a ‘direct interest’ in the decision under challenge. However, it is far from clear what constitutes a ‘direct interest’ and it is therefore im\npossible to properly consider and res\npond to the implications of this proposal. It is unclear \nwhether PAS would have a direct interest in the legal challeng\ne mentioned above if the proposal was implemented even though it\n undoubtedly \ndirectly \naffects our cl\nient group.\n&#xa0;\nIf NGOs, charities, campaigning groups \nand other similar organisations \ncan\n no longer \nbring judicial reviews, some government action will be impossible to challenge. This is because there are times when an individual is not able to bring a chal\nlenge. This might be because an unlawful policy exists, but has not affected any individuals yet and so could not be challenged by an individual claimant\n – as is the case with the legal challenge PAS is currently bringing against the legal aid cuts to pris\non law.\n \n&#xa0;\nCosts&#xa0;The current proposals regarding the changes to claiming costs only once permission is granted are very concerning to us. Most cases concerning prison law start off as ‘borderline’ cases. This is because of a number of factors. Not all \nevidence in judicial review proceedings concerning prison law is available at the start of proceedings. Evidence often takes several weeks if not months to be supplied by the authorities concerned. Judicial review time limits are strict and we therefore so\nmetimes need to issue proceedings in cases we can only assess as borderline at that point, in order to protect our client’s interests\n, but also where all other remedies have been exhausted\n. Cases may also be borderline because they involve complex legal is\nsues and/or novel points of law.  Such cases with borderline merit are often the ones that break through the barriers of the law for the benefit of the weakest members of our society.\n&#xa0;\nAn example of such a case that PAS was involved in was the case of \nR (o\nn the application of Noone) (FC) (Appellant) v The Governor of HMP Drake Hall and another (Respondents) (20/06/2010)\n. The case involved complex legal issues concerning sentence calculation and Home Detention Curfew (aka ‘tagging’). Indeed initially legal a\nid was refused and only after a hard fight was it conceded that the case had merit. Our client won at the initially stages of the proceedings in the High Court and was released with immediate effect. The SoS appealed in the Court of Appeal and we lost. Aga\nin, we had to battle our way through to obtain funding to have the matter considered by the Supreme Court. We then succeeded with a unanimous judgment in the Supreme Court. The then Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge concluded at paragraphs 86-7:\n&#xa0;\n “I have stud\nied the judgments of Lord Phillips and Lord Mance. Their judgments tell the lamentable story of how elementary principles of justice have come, in this case, to be buried in the legislative morass. They have achieved a construction of the relevant legislat\nion which produces both justice and common sense. I should have been inclined to reject the Secretary of State’s contention on the grounds of absurdity – absurd because it contravened elementary principles of justice in the sentencing process -  but Lord P\nhillips and Lord Mance have provided more respectable solutions, either or both of which I gratefully adopt.\n&#xa0;\nNevertheless the element of absurdity remains.  It is outrageous that so much intellectual effort, as well as public time and resources, have had \nto be expended in order to discover a route through the legislative morass to what should be, both for the prisoner herself, and for those responsible for her custody, the prison authorities, the simplest and most certain of questions – the prisoner’s rele\nase date.”\n&#xa0;\nThe above judgment would never have been pronounced had the proposed changes to judicial review been in place at the time. \nIt is not feasible that legal representatives could have bore the cost. \nFurther, it is worth noting that our costs \nas wel\nl as Counsel’s were kept to a minimum throughout the case\n. It is farcical of the Government to put forward that huge savings will be made if the proposed changes to judicial review are implemented. In the above case PAS instructed two juniors\n who also repr\nesented the client\n in the proceedings before the Supreme Court. The Secretary of State on the other hand, instructed two QCs on the case. Legal aid would not have been made available for the instruction of two QCs. Systems are already in place to ensure co\nsts are kept to a minimum throughout \njudicial review \nproceedings. The proposed changes would certainly curtail access to justice, but not necessarily cost\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe are also concerned that proposed scope cuts \nof 80% of prison law work \nmean that only those firm\ns or organisations with public law contracts - which are limited to 15 matter starts a year- are able to commence public law proceedings. This is further decimation to a prisoner’s right to access the courts.\n&#xa0;\nProcedural as opposed to substantive defects in decisions&#xa0;\nJudicial review proceedings are distinct in their nature. They are concerned with the \nlawfulness \nof\n decision\ns\n made by public authorit\nies\n. There are more than sufficient measures in place whereby mere technical breaches of procedure will not g\nive rise to proceedings that get very far: for a legally aided client this is more so if the Legal Aid Agency is not persuaded by the merits of the case. The proposal to bring forward the “no difference” argument will have the effect of changing the very n\nature of judicial review and its purpose: it will ask the Court to consider the merits of the case instead. \n&#xa0;\nThe Public Sector Equality Duty &#xa0;\nThe Government suggests that where a court has ruled in favour of a Claimant arguing non-compliance by a public \nauthority with the PSED, it is not uncommon for the body to arrive at the same decision therefore “it is not clear whether this ultimately benefits anyone”.  As a result, consideration of quicker and more cost effective ways of resolving PSED disputes has \nbeen recommended. \n&#xa0;\nWe are of the view that it is highly cynical to measure the PSED solely through the prism of outcomes. It is not enough for justice to be done; justice must be seen to be done. The PSED has a unique role in helping to embed equality in our culture, and not\n just the law. Therefore it should not be \nexclusively \nmeasured in terms of stark outcome\ns\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nOther Evidence Sought by the Committee&#xa0;We are extremely concerned about the effect of the residence test on foreign national prisoners as well as immigration detainees. Approximately 13% of the overall prison population is composed of foreign nationals. These prisoners are often the most vulner\nable being far away from their countries of origin and the support of their families. PAS had a case of a female prisoner who was arrested upon her arrival in the UK from Trinidad for drug importation. She was heavily pregnant at the time and terrified. Ha\nd it not been for our intervention she would have most likely lost her baby to social services. Under the proposed reforms, as a foreign national if she had been refused a place on the prison’s mother and baby unit she would have had no recourse to judicia\nl review and her baby would have been placed into care. \n&#xa0;\nThe above example illustrates how vital judicial review can be to the most vulnerable in our society. The aim of judicial review is to equally protect all citizens from the abuse of power of authori\nties, not merely a handful of them.   \n&#xa0;\nWe hope the Committee will consider our views and evidence provided, to voice the concerns of many as to how access to justice will be severely curtailed if the proposed changes to judicial review are implemented.\n&#xa0;\nP\nlease do not hesitate to contact the \nPrisoners Advice Service \nif you require any further information about the points made in this \ndocument\n. \n&#xa0;\n27 November 2013\n"
