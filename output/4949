[normal]Part 1: Concept[bold]&#xa0;[bold]How ‘devolved’ areas would be de[bold]fined geographically and s[bold]et up[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whether [bold]reform of the existing system (for example, re-banding council tax, revaluing business rates, Community Budgets[bold], Government grants, formulas and taxes[bold] such as stamp duty) would be a precursor to, or run along with, large-scale constitutional change.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]The Mayor
[normal] refer
[normal]s
[normal] the Committee to the 
[normal]LFC’s report
[normal], 
[normal]Raising the Capital, 
[normal]which is available here: 
[normal]http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/business-economy/publications/raising-the-capital
[normal]. All 
[normal]LFC 
[normal]working papers and the evidence it collected are available

[normal] Existing areas of collaboration include local transport schemes, public realm improvements, skills and employment programmes, t
[normal]ri-borough arrangements, open data and smart cities, crime prevention and working through the LEP.
[normal] Still, the Mayor
[normal] consider
[normal]s
[normal] Professor Henry Overman’s research about the incentive effect of the devolved business rate, which formed the basis of CLG’s ret
[normal]ained business rate policy, of particular relevance to the situation in Lon
[normal]don. As its focus was London, the Mayor
[normal] also take
[normal]s
[normal] seriously the conclusion of the research conducted by the University of Toronto for the LFC (see p5 for reference), that ‘
[normal]London w
[normal]ould benefit from greater fiscal autonomy – access to a mix of taxes and the ability to set the tax rates.’
