default1.
default              
defaultConverter academies are being undermined and undervalued. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo encourage sponsorship there needs to be some financial incentive in order to release capacity.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother encouragement would be to make working with other schools part of the accountability framework.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo secure progress of disadvantaged pupils it should be more rigotously looked at by OFSTED.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultLocal Authorities hamper the process of academy conversion and this needs 
defaultaddressing.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DfE needs better internal communication as well as better 
defaultcommunication with OFSTED to inform its decisions.
default&#xa0;
defaultFree Schools should be a response to demographic need and/or local underperformance. In the latter case action also needs to be taken to address that underperformance.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultThe role of the Regional Schools Commissioners needs to be clarified and linked to 
defaultthe OFSTED Regional Directors. Together, sharing information and with effective communication, they should provide the system for identifying schools needing support and sc
defaulthools with capacity to support.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultLocal Authorities should not have a role in school monitoring and improvement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe regional structures of OFSTED and the Schools Commissioners could provide what is required. However, light-touch and leave successful s
defaultchools to be autonomous.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultChains need to be limited in size and geographical spread.
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernance is an issue throughout the system. There needs to be a move from the stakeholder 
defaultmodel to a skills based model.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultIt is appropriate for a primary school to become an academy. However:
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultAlternatives to sponsorship for failing primary schools would be:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultFASNA’s Reportdefault&#xa0;default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe debate about the academisation of our schools is marred by ill-founded judgements with no basis in evidence and often with expectations of academies whi
defaultch have been changed mid-stream.
default&#xa0;default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe early sponsor academies were specifically
default established to
default address under-performance in mainly urban areas with high levels of deprivation. 
defaultWith a hard-edged arrangement with a sponsor, extra funding and a clear brief to raise standards and address social disadvantage, their purpose was well articu
defaultlated. Obvious
defaultly, as they have been in
default 
defaultexistence for up to ten years 
defaultthere is good evidence to assess their impact and i
defaultn poor performing schools large gains in pupil outcomes are possible.
default&#xa0;default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the other hand, converter academies have only come into existe
defaultnce over the last three years. There is not 
defaultyet 
defaultthe 
defaultlongitudinal
default evidence base to make sweeping judgements about the “system”. 
defaultIt is misjudged or even willful
default to compare the impact of 
defaultsponsor and converter academies at this stage.
default&#xa0;default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlso, 
defaultconverter academie
defaults 
defaultwere, initially ‘Outstanding’ Schools and therefore any gains in pupil performance were likely to be incremental and therefore appear less 
defaultsignificant
default. 
defaultThis is a factor to be taken into consideration.
default&#xa0;default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe criteria set for 
defaultconverter academies 
defaultwas that th
defaultey should ‘support’ other schools. 
defaultThe recent expectation that this should translate into ensuring that other schools have their outcomes improved is a sleight of hand. Firstly, it was not made an explicit expectation. Secondly, 
defaultno
default-one has monitored what s
defaultchools are doing in this regard and the impact therefore cannot be known.
default 
defaultThirdly, s
defaultupport being given 
defaultis likely to be discreet so as not to undermine the voluntary recipient.
default&#xa0;default1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence would seem to indicate that leaders of converter academies have been 
defaultsuccessful in maintaining and improving outcomes
default of all pupils 
defaultanddefault of disadvantaged pupils 
defaultin their own schools.
default&#xa0;default1.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order for academies to have a transformational impact beyond their own schools there needs to be an explicit demand made of them to do so. 
defaultThe current sponsorship programme is a means to achieve this
default. One means of securing this is by providing 
defaultthe incentive of extra-funding to 
defaultsecure capacity. 
defaultWithout this, academies will shy away from 
defaultvolunteering to sponsor for fear
default that capacity issues wil
defaultl lead negatively impact on their own performance.
default 
defaultOFSTED need to take into account the impact of working with other schools when reaching a judgement on the supporting school.
default&#xa0;default1.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnother mechanism would be to make working with other schools part of the 
defaultaccountability framework.
default&#xa0;default1.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo secure the progress of 
defaultdisadvantaged pupils OFSTED could beef up 
defaultthe Inspection Framework looking at the measurement of the progress of groups – such as FSM, and the spending of the Pupil Premium.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultToo often the process is hampered by Local Authorities standing in the way.  For example Redcar &amp; Cleveland currently want to charge legal fees for schools converting
default, even if they already buy in to the LA service. They also insist a school must become a cheque-book school for a ‘few months’ before they can become a
defaultn academy. However, they say that
default it takes a year to make the change to become a cheque-book school! Such
default disputes are intended to deter schools from the process.
default&#xa0;default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe DfE
default needs to 
defaulthave better data to identify schools which meet the criteria for being granted academy status, or being compelled
default 
defaultto become an academy by being sponsored, or for being a sponsor. C
defaulturrently it appears that different parts of the DfE, and other arms of the Education Service such as OFSTED, do not 
defaultadequately 
defaultshare information or communicate 
defaulteffectively 
defaultwith each other. 
default&#xa0;default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor Free Schools it is not adequate that there is a demand, there
default must also be a need demonstrated by either by demographics (too few places) or by failure to provide adequate quality in other schools in the locality. 
defaultThe DfE needs to have the data to substantiate the case. If not, it appears purely an ideological decis
defaultion which undermines schools in the area – thus having the unintended consequence of 
defaultreducing morale and performance in those schools.
default 
defaultIf the latter, there also needs to be a plan to address this – by improving quality to acceptable levels and/or reducing 
defaultplaces at poor quality schools. Establishing a Free School and leaving it to the market condemns a generation of pupils caught in change.
default&#xa0;default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere needs to be a route by which 
defaultOFSTED can
default inform the DfE where they identify capacity in high performing schools 
default(perhaps through their HMI Good Practise Guides?). It is clear from the HMCI Annual Report released last week that OFSTED have such performance data – LA by LA – thus the DfE could begin to trawl for capacity by starting with OFSTED data.
default&#xa0;default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur experience 
defaultshows that the DfE academy sponsor unit has no systematic or routine knowledge of where there is capacity in the system. Thus, it is incumbent upon high performing schools to contact them to offer support – it should be the other way round.
default&#xa0;default2.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe DfE, should be 
defaultable 
defaultto identify those schools requiring sponsorship and those who may provide the necessary expertise to be sponsors. This is best done in a local area
default.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis will surely be via the new Regional Schools Com
defaultmissioner
defaults? They should be the layer scrutinising 
defaultschool performance data, 
defaultOFSTED 
defaultreports
default etc 
defaultThey would track
default performance 
defaultand then broker
default suppor
defaultt 
defaultwhere required
default.
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever,
default there MUST be better communication – indeed some communication – between the OFSTED Regional Directors and the new Regional Schools Com
defaultmissioner
defaults
default. Is this a role for HMI?
default&#xa0;default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn short – its easy:
default OFSTED Inspect, pronounce, 
defaultshare data 
defaultand refer for support or identified capacity; Regional Commissioners scrutinize performance data and OFSTED referrals and reports. Together the 
defaultRegional Schools Com
defaultmissioners and OFSTED Regional 
defaultDirectors work together to identify capacity and t
defaulthen broker the support.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal Authorities no longer have the skills, capacity or confidence to provide 
defaultschool monitoring and school improvement.
default&#xa0;default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThey should retain all of the current statutory duties in re
defaultlation to planning places
default, 
defaultHigh Needs, Education Other Than At School, SEN, School 
defaultTransport
default 
defaultetc.
default; but it is the Regional Schools Commissioners who will monitor, intervene and broker support when needed. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen there is 
defaulta robust N
defaultational 
defaultF
defaultunding 
defaultF
defaultormula
default 
defaultthe need for Local Authorities to run a Schools Forum disappears. The LA receive
default 
defaultsome
default ESG to support their limited statutory duties.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe regional structure of OFSTED and Schools Commissioners may provide the structure between schools and the Secretary of 
defaultState. However, it is imperative that this is light-touch and not bureaucratic, working in a transparent and cost-effective way and leaving successful schools to get on with it.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a place for chains but
default there should be a limit on the size and 
defaulttheir 
defaultgeographical spread.
default&#xa0;default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSmall local chains are the best model as the ability 
defaultto work
default across schools, to share a common ethos and to move staff around is enhanced by proximity.
default&#xa0;default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOFSTED MUST inspect chains as well as individual schools. They must look at what being in a chain adds in terms of performance and take action if a chain is underp
defaulterforming or failing to address weaknesses in a member school.
default&#xa0;default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernance is an issue across the system and not just in chains. The move from a stakeholder model to a skills-based form of Governance needs to be hastened. Better training for Governors and 
defaulta more robust selection of the chair needs to be implemented.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is 
defaultentirely
default appropriate for Pri
defaultmary
default schools to become 
defaultan 
defaultacadem

default. 
defaultHowever,
default it 
defaultwould 
defaultalso 
defaultbe appropriate
default for the DfE to 
defaultinsist that primary academies are 
defaultof a certain size (in terms of school roll and budget) or are 
defaultin 
defaulta group
default of schools in o
defaultrder to achieve maximum benefit.
default This could be a group of primary schools or a grouping with a secondary school.
default&#xa0;default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThus it is
default important that 
defaultthe DfE pushes this as the p
defaultreferred model with financial incentives to achieve it. The current incentives need to be retained.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA failing primary school clearly needs intervention and support. This is best done by working with a successful school or schools. Being sponsored is one approach. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere could also be a r

defaultto join an established M

default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere

default This could be an additional requirement.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere could be a closure and an amalgamation with another school – either as one school or in a hard Federation (one Head
