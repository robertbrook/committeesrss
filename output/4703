[normal]AFS0100[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]F[bold]ASNA[bold]FASNA supports the movement towards school autonomy within a rigorous accountability framework[bold]&#xa0;[bold]EXECUTIVE SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]Converter academies are being undermined and undervalued. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To encourage sponsorship there needs to be some financial incentive in order to release capacity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another encouragement would be to make working with other schools part of the accountability framework.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To secure progress of disadvantaged pupils it should be more rigotously looked at by OFSTED.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]Local Authorities hamper the process of academy conversion and this needs 
[normal]addressing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The DfE needs better internal communication as well as better 
[normal]communication with OFSTED to inform its decisions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Free Schools should be a response to demographic need and/or local underperformance. In the latter case action also needs to be taken to address that underperformance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]The role of the Regional Schools Commissioners needs to be clarified and linked to 
[normal]the OFSTED Regional Directors. Together, sharing information and with effective communication, they should provide the system for identifying schools needing support and sc
[normal]hools with capacity to support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]Local Authorities should not have a role in school monitoring and improvement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The regional structures of OFSTED and the Schools Commissioners could provide what is required. However, light-touch and leave successful s
[normal]chools to be autonomous.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]Chains need to be limited in size and geographical spread.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Governance is an issue throughout the system. There needs to be a move from the stakeholder 
[normal]model to a skills based model.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]It is appropriate for a primary school to become an academy. However:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]              
[normal]Alternatives to sponsorship for failing primary schools would be:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]FASNA’s Report[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The debate about the academisation of our schools is marred by ill-founded judgements with no basis in evidence and often with expectations of academies whi
[normal]ch have been changed mid-stream.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The early sponsor academies were specifically
[normal] established to
[normal] address under-performance in mainly urban areas with high levels of deprivation. 
[normal]With a hard-edged arrangement with a sponsor, extra funding and a clear brief to raise standards and address social disadvantage, their purpose was well articu
[normal]lated. Obvious
[normal]ly, as they have been in
[normal] 
[normal]existence for up to ten years 
[normal]there is good evidence to assess their impact and i
[normal]n poor performing schools large gains in pupil outcomes are possible.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]On the other hand, converter academies have only come into existe
[normal]nce over the last three years. There is not 
[normal]yet 
[normal]the 
[normal]longitudinal
[normal] evidence base to make sweeping judgements about the “system”. 
[normal]It is misjudged or even willful
[normal] to compare the impact of 
[normal]sponsor and converter academies at this stage.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Also, 
[normal]converter academie
[normal]s 
[normal]were, initially ‘Outstanding’ Schools and therefore any gains in pupil performance were likely to be incremental and therefore appear less 
[normal]significant
[normal]. 
[normal]This is a factor to be taken into consideration.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The criteria set for 
[normal]converter academies 
[normal]was that th
[normal]ey should ‘support’ other schools. 
[normal]The recent expectation that this should translate into ensuring that other schools have their outcomes improved is a sleight of hand. Firstly, it was not made an explicit expectation. Secondly, 
[normal]no
[normal]-one has monitored what s
[normal]chools are doing in this regard and the impact therefore cannot be known.
[normal] 
[normal]Thirdly, s
[normal]upport being given 
[normal]is likely to be discreet so as not to undermine the voluntary recipient.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Evidence would seem to indicate that leaders of converter academies have been 
[normal]successful in maintaining and improving outcomes
[normal] of all pupils 
[normal]and[bold] of disadvantaged pupils 
[normal]in their own schools.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order for academies to have a transformational impact beyond their own schools there needs to be an explicit demand made of them to do so. 
[normal]The current sponsorship programme is a means to achieve this
[normal]. One means of securing this is by providing 
[normal]the incentive of extra-funding to 
[normal]secure capacity. 
[normal]Without this, academies will shy away from 
[normal]volunteering to sponsor for fear
[normal] that capacity issues wil
[normal]l lead negatively impact on their own performance.
[normal] 
[normal]OFSTED need to take into account the impact of working with other schools when reaching a judgement on the supporting school.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Another mechanism would be to make working with other schools part of the 
[normal]accountability framework.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To secure the progress of 
[normal]disadvantaged pupils OFSTED could beef up 
[normal]the Inspection Framework looking at the measurement of the progress of groups – such as FSM, and the spending of the Pupil Premium.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Too often the process is hampered by Local Authorities standing in the way.  For example Redcar &amp; Cleveland currently want to charge legal fees for schools converting
[normal], even if they already buy in to the LA service. They also insist a school must become a cheque-book school for a ‘few months’ before they can become a
[normal]n academy. However, they say that
[normal] it takes a year to make the change to become a cheque-book school! Such
[normal] disputes are intended to deter schools from the process.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The DfE
[normal] needs to 
[normal]have better data to identify schools which meet the criteria for being granted academy status, or being compelled
[normal] 
[normal]to become an academy by being sponsored, or for being a sponsor. C
[normal]urrently it appears that different parts of the DfE, and other arms of the Education Service such as OFSTED, do not 
[normal]adequately 
[normal]share information or communicate 
[normal]effectively 
[normal]with each other. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For Free Schools it is not adequate that there is a demand, there
[normal] must also be a need demonstrated by either by demographics (too few places) or by failure to provide adequate quality in other schools in the locality. 
[normal]The DfE needs to have the data to substantiate the case. If not, it appears purely an ideological decis
[normal]ion which undermines schools in the area – thus having the unintended consequence of 
[normal]reducing morale and performance in those schools.
[normal] 
[normal]If the latter, there also needs to be a plan to address this – by improving quality to acceptable levels and/or reducing 
[normal]places at poor quality schools. Establishing a Free School and leaving it to the market condemns a generation of pupils caught in change.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There needs to be a route by which 
[normal]OFSTED can
[normal] inform the DfE where they identify capacity in high performing schools 
[normal](perhaps through their HMI Good Practise Guides?). It is clear from the HMCI Annual Report released last week that OFSTED have such performance data – LA by LA – thus the DfE could begin to trawl for capacity by starting with OFSTED data.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our experience 
[normal]shows that the DfE academy sponsor unit has no systematic or routine knowledge of where there is capacity in the system. Thus, it is incumbent upon high performing schools to contact them to offer support – it should be the other way round.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he DfE, should be 
[normal]able 
[normal]to identify those schools requiring sponsorship and those who may provide the necessary expertise to be sponsors. This is best done in a local area
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This will surely be via the new Regional Schools Com
[normal]missioner
[normal]s? They should be the layer scrutinising 
[normal]school performance data, 
[normal]OFSTED 
[normal]reports
[normal] etc 
[normal]They would track
[normal] performance 
[normal]and then broker
[normal] suppor
[normal]t 
[normal]where required
[normal].
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However,
[normal] there MUST be better communication – indeed some communication – between the OFSTED Regional Directors and the new Regional Schools Com
[normal]missioner
[normal]s
[normal]. Is this a role for HMI?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In short – its easy:
[normal] OFSTED Inspect, pronounce, 
[normal]share data 
[normal]and refer for support or identified capacity; Regional Commissioners scrutinize performance data and OFSTED referrals and reports. Together the 
[normal]Regional Schools Com
[normal]missioners and OFSTED Regional 
[normal]Directors work together to identify capacity and t
[normal]hen broker the support.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local Authorities no longer have the skills, capacity or confidence to provide 
[normal]school monitoring and school improvement.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]They should retain all of the current statutory duties in re
[normal]lation to planning places
[normal], 
[normal]High Needs, Education Other Than At School, SEN, School 
[normal]Transport
[normal] 
[normal]etc.
[normal]; but it is the Regional Schools Commissioners who will monitor, intervene and broker support when needed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When there is 
[normal]a robust N
[normal]ational 
[normal]F
[normal]unding 
[normal]F
[normal]ormula
[normal] 
[normal]the need for Local Authorities to run a Schools Forum disappears. The LA receive
[normal] 
[normal]some
[normal] ESG to support their limited statutory duties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The regional structure of OFSTED and Schools Commissioners may provide the structure between schools and the Secretary of 
[normal]State. However, it is imperative that this is light-touch and not bureaucratic, working in a transparent and cost-effective way and leaving successful schools to get on with it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a place for chains but
[normal] there should be a limit on the size and 
[normal]their 
[normal]geographical spread.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Small local chains are the best model as the ability 
[normal]to work
[normal] across schools, to share a common ethos and to move staff around is enhanced by proximity.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]OFSTED MUST inspect chains as well as individual schools. They must look at what being in a chain adds in terms of performance and take action if a chain is underp
[normal]erforming or failing to address weaknesses in a member school.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Governance is an issue across the system and not just in chains. The move from a stakeholder model to a skills-based form of Governance needs to be hastened. Better training for Governors and 
[normal]a more robust selection of the chair needs to be implemented.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is 
[normal]entirely
[normal] appropriate for Pri
[normal]mary
[normal] schools to become 
[normal]an 
[normal]academ
[normal]y
[normal]. 
[normal]However,
[normal] it 
[normal]would 
[normal]also 
[normal]be appropriate
[normal] for the DfE to 
[normal]insist that primary academies are 
[normal]of a certain size (in terms of school roll and budget) or are 
[normal]in 
[normal]a group
[normal] of schools in o
[normal]rder to achieve maximum benefit.
[normal] This could be a group of primary schools or a grouping with a secondary school.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Thus it is
[normal] important that 
[normal]the DfE pushes this as the p
[normal]referred model with financial incentives to achieve it. The current incentives need to be retained.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A failing primary school clearly needs intervention and support. This is best done by working with a successful school or schools. Being sponsored is one approach. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There could also be a r
[normal]equireme
[normal]nt 
[normal]to join an established M
[normal]ulti-Academy Trust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There 
[normal]should be a r
[normal]equirement to work with HMI –
[normal] 
[normal]prob
[normal]ably
[normal] via the Regional 
[normal]Schools Com
[normal]missioner
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] This could be an additional requirement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There could be a closure and an amalgamation with another school – either as one school or in a hard Federation (one Head 
[normal]one Governing Body 
[normal]etc.
[normal]).
