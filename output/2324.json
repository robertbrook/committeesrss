"Written evidence submitted by Professor Steve StrandThis submission address\nes\n directly each of\n the \nfive \nkey questions \ngiven \nin the \nCommittee's \nrequest for written evidence\n.\n1. There is no doubt that White Working Class (WWC) \nstudents\n are the lowest achieving group of young people in \nEngland \nterms of educational achievement at age 16. Figure 1 below plots \nthe age 16 examination results for 2011 \nfor each combination of \nethnic\n group\n and entitlement to a Fre\ne School Meal (FSM)\n. \nFigure 1:              Percentage of pupils achieving 5 or more GCSE or equivalent A*-C grades including English and mathematics by ethnic group and entitlement to FSM: England, 2011Source: Strand (201\n4a\n).\n2. Only 28% of White British students on FSM achieve the threshold \nof 5 or more GCSE\ns\n A*-C including English and maths, \ncompared to 62% of White British pupil not on FSM.\n No other ethnic-FSM co\nmbination has lower attainment than White British students on FSM.\n3. The above 'headlines' figures need to be considered in some depth to tease out exactly what the pattern of results are in relation to social class, ethnicity and gender. Strand (201\n4\na\n) h\nas completed a detailed analysis using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England \n(LSYPE)\n. This \nhas \nthe \nbenefit\n \nthat \nit\n draw\ns\n on data o\nn\n parent\ns\n'\n occupation\ns\n, educational qu\na\nlifications\n, \nwhether the family own their own home\n,\n the deprivation of the neighbourhood in which the family live\n as well as whether the student is entitlement to a FSM\n. These factors are \ncombine\nd\n \nto create a robust continuous measure of the \nfamily \ns\nocio-economic \nstatus (SES\n)\n. \nThey key result\ns are presente\nd in Figure 2 below. \nFigure 2: Age 16 points score by ethnic group, gender and SES based on LSYPE dataset.Boys\nGirls\nNotes\n:  (\n1\n)\n. The outcome (total points score) is a measure of achievement based on all examinations completed by the young person \nat age 16, and is expressed on a scale where 0 is the mean (average) score for all Young People at age 16 and two-third of YP score between -1 and 1.\n    (\n2\n)\n. \nThe SE\nS\n \nmeasure\n also has a mean (average) of zero \na\nnd \nthe effects for low SES \nare estimated \nat \n-1SD and of high SES at +1SD\n. \nSource: \nSee \nStrand (201\n4a) for full details\n.\n4. \nThe results confirm\n that\n:\n5. \nLevels of achievement \nfor boys are generally lower than for girls, \nand \nthis is just as true for\n \nWWC pupils as any other\n group\n, with \nW\nWC boys \nhaving lower achievement (-.50 SD) \nthan WWC girls\n (-.30 SD)\n, as shown in Figure 2. However \nit is important to note that \nWWC girls are the lowest achieving group among girls, so the \npattern of concern over the low achievement of WWC pupils applies a\ns much to girls as it does to boys.\n6. Important evidence here is provided by considering pupils progress age 11 to age 16. F\nigure 3\n uses the LSYPE \ndataset \nto graph \neducational \nachievement at age 11, 14 and 16. We do this for the lowest 20% of pupils in terms of family SES, for the middle group (between 40% and 60%) and for the top 20% in terms of family SES. \n7. What is particu\nlarly notable here is the pronounced decline in educational achievement among White British students from the lowest SES quintile,  in contrast to most ethnic minority groups. \nFigure 6: Mean normal score at age 11, age 14 and age 16 by ethnic group at bottom, middle and upper SES quintilesSES bottom quintileSES middle quintileSES top quintileNotes: Age 16 score is the normalised core points score (CPS) so \nscores at \nall three time points are based on\nly on\n English, mathematics and science \ntests/exams\n.\n Mixed heritage and any other ethnic group are excluded for clarity.  \nSource: Strand (2013).\n8. What accounts for these changes in educational achievement?  It is inevitably difficult to establish causality from observational data, but Strand (2014a) was able to use the LSYPE to evaluate the impact of a wide range of student\n, family and neighbourhood variables not just on achievement at age 16 but on educational progress age 11-16. Many factors were significantly associated with progress, but the four main factors were: \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPupil aspirations to continue in full-time education (F\nTE) post 16 \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParents aspirations for the young person to continue in FTE after 16 \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcademic Self Concept (ASC) (how good students felt they were at school work)\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrequency of completing homework (an indicator of effort or motivation)\n9. It should be noted t\nhat the majority of WC students have positive educational aspirations. For example in LSYPE at age 14 approximately  60% of WWC boys, 72% of Black Caribbean WC boys and 75% of WWC girls aspire to continue in FTE after age 16 (Strand, 2014a). However these \nlevels are substantially lower than the averages of all other groups which were uniformly high across the SES spectrum at 90%-98%. The results are shown in Figure 3. Similar patterns were observed for ASC and homework. There is strong evidence that educati\nonal aspirations differ markedly by SES and ethnicity\n, and are associated with the decline in achievement of WWC students.\n \nFigure 3: Aspirations at age 14 to continue in FTE after age 1610. \nThis does not mean \nthat WWC \nstudents \nare unsupported at home\n. Strand &amp; Winston (2008) in a study of five \ninner city \nBirmingham\n schools show\n \nWWC students report positive general \nsupport for their \neducation among their parents\n \n(\nsuch as help with homework, \nproviding \nrewards\n for doing we\nll at school\n, attending\n parents'\n evenings\n)\n. However at the same time \nWWC students \nwere mo\nre likely than other ethnic groups \nto report low educational aspirations\n at home \n(\ne.g. People from my family don’t go to college after they leave school; Family \nmembers do not think that school is very important for success\n)\n.\n11. \nOverall t\nhese \nresults \nindicate that, d\nespite high socio-economic deprivation\n,\n key resilience factors \nfor WC pupils from most minority ethnic groups \nare high educational aspirations (both \npupils &amp; parents), strong academic self concept and high motivation (homework)\n. Th\nis \nma\ny reflect the '\ni\nmmigrant paradigm\n'\n (Kao &amp; T\nhompson\n, 2003)\n whereby immigrants devote themselves more to education than the native population because they lack financial c\napital and see education as a way out of poverty\n.\n The inverse of this is true for W\nhite British and Black Caribbean WC \nstudents: \nl\now\ner\n educational aspirations\n by parents and students\n, poor ASC and low motivation \nindicates an increased risk of dis\nengaged or\n \ndisaffect\ned\n learners\n. \nIn the era \nof full employment\n there may have been little \npenalty\n \nto disengagement \nwhere jobs were plentiful\n,\n often through family contacts\n,\n without the need for educational qualifications. However there is a high cost to an \n‘oppositi\nonal culture’ \n(Willis, 1977) \nin \nthe \nnew knowledge economy.\n12. It is important not to over-emphasise \nan\n individualistic notion \nof \naspirations and to recognise structural influences from \nneighbourhood\n, family and school. It is not enough for young people to aspire, they also need to be able to navigate the paths to their goals\n (Strand &amp; Winston, 2008)\n. There is an important role for s\nchools\n, particularly in disadvantaged areas,\n in supporting \nstudents and \nparents\n by providing clear information on \nhow a minimum number of GCSEs are required for most college courses, work-based learning settings and 'decent' jobs, greater supervision of ho\nmework by teachers\n \nto minimise the risk that student disengage as a result of falling behind and feeling overwhelmed by coursework, provision of additional study support\n, close monitoring of student truancy etc. \n(e.g. Ross, 2009)\n.\n13. \nHowever it is importa\nnt that addressing low educational attainment \nis not just a question of disengagement age 11-16 or \nan \nissue \njust \nfor secondary schools. \nT\nhe low achievem\nent of White British students on\n FSM \nhas been\n identif\ni\ned as early as age 4, and these students fall furt\nher behind age 4-7 (Strand, 1999), age 7-11 (Strand, \n2010, \n2014b) as well as age 11-16 (Strand, 2014a). In short equity differences in achievement are just as much a concern for primary schooling as for secondary schooling. \n14. \nIt is also important that s\nchools are not seen as the sole agencies \nof\n change.\n \nDifferences between schools, while they undoubtedly play some role, a\nppear\n unlikely to be the major locus of equity gaps in pupils’ educational progress. \nStrand (2010) reports an analysis of pupil progres\ns age 7-11 using national data from 534,000 pupils attending over 14,000 primary schools. \nWhile the SES and the White British-Black Caribbean gaps widen between age 7 and age 11, these gaps do not appear to be significantly greater\n in some schools than in \nothers\n. \nNo schools reliably reversed the usual ‘within school’ pattern of FSM students making less progress than non-FSM students, or Black Caribbean students making less progress than White British students.\n \nThis has two major implications:\ni\n.\n              \n Equity gaps are not the result of a small number of 'failing' schools which, if they can somehow be fixed, will remove\n the overall SES or ethnic achievement \ngaps. \nWhile qualitative research has provided case studies of schools in disadvantaged areas that \n‘succeed \nagainst the odds’ (e.g. \nDCSF Extra Mile project, 2008), such schools are by definition exceptions. As Mortimore and Whitty (1997) observe “whilst some schools can succeed against the odds, the possibility of them all doing so, year in and year out\n, still appears remote given that the long-term patterning of educational inequality has been strikingly consistent throughout the history of public education in most countries” (p9).  Similarly in the US Rothstein (2004) has cogently argued that, exemplar\ny though such schools might be, they do not represent scalable models for Americ\na’s poor and minority children.\n \nii\n.\n              \nNeither is a \nfocus on \ngeneral \n'\nschool improvement\n'\n suffic\ni\nent. While the most effective schools \ndo \nraise the achievement of disadvantaged p\nupil\ns, non-disadvantaged pupils tend to \nbenefit just as much, so that these school do not eliminate the achievement gap. \nThe correlation between a schools' residual (i.e. difference from the expected value) for FSM pupils correlated 0.97 with the school\ns'\n \nresidual for non-FSM pupils. The results are shown in Figure 4. Thus p\nrimary schools that added the most value for White British students, girls or those not on FSM also added the most value for Black Caribbean students, boys or pupils on FSM\n.\n \nIn short the\n relative performance of the disadvantaged remains similar even when the absolute performance of such groups has improved (Mortimore &amp; Whitty, 1997; Strand, 2010, 2014b).\nFigure 4: Correlation of primary schools' Contextual Value Added (CVA) residuals for pupils entitled to FSM and those not entitled to FSMSource: Strand (2010).\n15. These results do not deny the possibility that processes occuring\n within schools and classrooms may contribute to the poor progress of disadvantaged pupils or some ethnic minority groups, but does imply that such processes would need to be operating consistently across all schools. For example recent research suggests t\nhat setting is on the rise within primary schools in England, with a recent nationally representative survey indicating that over one-third of children in Y2 were set in literacy, mathematics or both, and that\n \nlow SES children were disproportionally repres\nented in bottom sets  (Hallam &amp; Ireson, 2013). Setting has been hypothesised to increase within school gaps for disadvantaged and ethnic minority students (\ne.g. \nWiliam &amp; Bartholomew, 200\n4; Oakes, 2005\n). Another possible candidate is the distribution of tea\nchers across classrooms \nwithin\n schools, with research from the US indicating that Black and disadvantaged students were more likely to be matched to novice teachers while more highly qualified teachers were matched to White and more advantaged students (Cl\notfelter, Ladd &amp; Vigor, 2005). They suggest this reflects both pressure from more affluent parents to secure better resources for their children and the greater power of more experienced teachers to lobby for more easy-to-educate students\n.\n16. The key implication of the above is that all schools need to focus on their 'within-school' gaps and that interventions need to be targeted at disadvantaged students. This is the great hope for the Pupil Premium. \nThis delivers greater funding to schools \nwith high prop\nortions of disadvantaged students \nin a transparent manner. \nIt also comes with t\nhe \nexpectation\n that \n \nthe \ngrant will be used to support FSM eligible pupils, should focus on \nclos\ning\n \nthe gap\n in attainment\n between them and their peers,\n and \naccountability measures such as \nthe publication of the FSM gap in\n school performance tables (\n although it is \nimportant that schools are accountable for the \nprogress\n of their students not for 'raw' attainment ou\ntcomes\n)\n. \n \n17. \nS\nince the demise of grammar school system \nin the late 1960's \neducational policy in England \nhas\n, for good reason, \n been wary of differentiat\ning educational provision \nat \ntoo early \nan age \nfor fear of \nexacerbating social \ninequality. \nCertainly\n sorting\n students into separate schools at age 11 or age 14 is to be avoided\n, since the \nevidence suggests this \nsuch differentiation tends to reproduce social\n inequality rather than eliminate it (e.g. Willis, 1977)\n. \nNevertheless the evidence on disengagement of WWC students, particularly age 14-16, \nreviewed in Section 4 above \nsuggests that providing all students with the same curriculum in KS4 fails to meet the\n \ndesire\n of a significant minority for \nlearning that makes a strong connection between the academic and the world of work. It i\ns a matter of some regret that the statutory duty of schools to provide work related learning (WRL) \nat KS4 \nwas removed in Septembe\nr 2012. \nT\nhe raising of the school leaving age to 17 \nin \nSeptemb\ner\n 2012\n, and to age 18 in September 2015, \nmay move a\nttention \nto \n16-19\n years olds\n, but strong programme\ns\n of WRL at KS4 should continue to be a focus for all schools, particularly\n those \nserving \ndisadvantaged communities\n.\nClotfelter, C.

The LSYPE is a longitudinal study of over 15,000 young people first interviewed at age 14 in 2004 and currently being interviewed at age 25. The sample have been matched to the National Pupil Database to provide test and examination results at age 11 (2\n001), age 14 (2004) and age 16 (2006). \n. Considerable attention has been attracted by a study by Kintrea, St. Clair &amp; Houston (2011) suggesting that aspirations are universally high among students from disadvantaged backgrounds. However their study inter\nviewed students from only three schools in high deprivation areas, and does not actually report data on educational aspirations noting only that \"these findings did not vary significantly by any of the social factors we examined\" (Kintrea et al, 2011, p27)\n. As Kintrea et al themselves note \"given this research set out to focus on people living with deprivation, it is not surprising that significant differentials by family economic status was not found. There was not a wide socioeconomic range among our part\nicipants\" (p53). The LSYPE data in contrast are drawn from a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 students across over 600 schools. Social class differences in educational aspirations are quite robust and have been reported in other analyses of \nthe LSYPE (e.g. Ross, 2009), with other representative surveys such as the youth component of the British Household Panel Survey (Croll, 2009). \n"
