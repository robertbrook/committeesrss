"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Citizens Advice (LAI 0064)&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n and \nkey recommendations\nIn 2012/3 the Citizens Advice service in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n advised around 3 million people on 6.6 million problems\n, with \no\nver 30\n \nlocal CAB act as \ncivil legal aid \nsuppliers mainly for housing\n law issues.\nLike many organisations we are having\n to adapt to the impact of the\n recent Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment\n of Offenders Act (LASPO)\n which has nearly halved the provision of civil legal aid services.\n  \nThe cuts to legal aid have has put a great strain on our service as we have \nlost considerable specialist casework capacity in social welfare law and around 150 le\ngal aid contracts as a result of recent scope changes. \nThis has led to\n \nsignificant \nhuman rights concerns\n \nwith many of our clients \nbeing denied\n access \nto \njustice\n because they can’t afford legal representation\n and Citizens Advice \nstruggles\n to provide the support they need\n. The government’s proposal on \nTransforming Legal Aid\n will lead to \nfurther problems \nin terms of Article 6 and other substantive human rights.\nOur key recommendations \nto make sure that the Government’s plans do not \ncontraven\ne\n human rights legislation are:\nRestricting payment for permission work in judicial review cases\nJudicial review is a vital to\nol in ensuring the that people’s basic human rights are protected \nwhen\n, local authorities or g\novernment\n break the law\n or exceed their legal powers\n.  Restricting legal aid for judicial review creates the potential that \njustice \nis denied for some not ab\nle to\n afford \nlegal support\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe are pleased that t\nhe g\novernment has \nsaid that they will consult on their plans for restricting judicial review \nas \nit is vital that they look again at this issue to ensure that this basic \nprotection and mechanism for holding \npublic authorities to account is not\n eroded.\n&#xa0;\nNow that the government has published further details on their plans it is clear that \nthe earlie\nr\n stages of judicial review work\n \nonly \nremain\n within the scope of legal aid \nby way of a discretionary payment schem\ne.\n \nWith a\n \ndiscretionary scheme the government is saying that access to justice is not a human right or a legal requirement but is purely at the \nwill\n \nof \na government body.   \n&#xa0;\nLegal Aid providers will \nstill \nbe expected to shoulder all the risk of taking \ncases whose outcome can often be uncertain.  This could effectively remove access to judicial review for otherwise important and arguable cases.\n&#xa0;\nThere is \nalso \na risk this will change the behaviour of public authorities because they will anticipate relucta\nnce to take judicial review beyond a threat to application stage. This could be seriously \ndetrimental to those in need of services such as housing, social care and education\n and lead to serious human rights abuses\n. \n&#xa0;\nJ\nust because most cases are withdrawn b\nefore a full hearing does not mean they are without merit - a significant number of cases are withdrawn because they settle in favour of the\n claimant before reaching court.\n Often it is the threat of judicial review which prompts public authorities to prov\nide solutions, but not before substantial work has been done. So cases which are likely to settle at an early stage are often some of the strongest cases. It is no exaggeration to say that legal aid for judicial review can be the only thing standing betwee\nn a homeless family and the street.\n&#xa0;\nExamples of the type of cases in which the Judicial Review process is of real benefit to bureaux clients include:- \n&#xa0;\nA client came to their local CAB after their homelessness application had been turned down by their council despite the fact they had \nno where\n to live and was suffering from a  serious lung condition.  Not only did the council turn down the application but\n they also refused to house the client while their decision was reviewed.  The CAB took action to get a \nlegal aid counsel opinion that they would be able to make an application for judicial review.  With the threat of this judicial review the council agree\nd to\n&#xa0;\nprovide accommodation pending review.  With the CAB and Counsel's opinion supporting the client, the\n&#xa0;\nreview\n&#xa0;\nfound in their favour\n&#xa0;\nthat\n&#xa0;\nthey were in need of support to avoid homelessness and there was no need for a court hearing.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf the council\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nhad k\nnown that the CAB could not afford to take it further they\n&#xa0;\nmay have been less likely to bow to pressure.\n&#xa0;\nWithout the threat of a judicial review a\n CAB\n client\n in \nLancashire\n may still have had to suffer without enough incontinent pads for \nher\n needs.\n \nThe\n cli\nent who was bedbound and needed a hoist to get out of bed\n,\n with carers attending four times a day to change her incontinence pads. She had dementia, neuropathy, incontinence and was unable to stand. Under the NHS funded care package, the PCT insisted that \nthey could only provide 3 pads per day - not enough \nfor her\n needs and they could not afford to buy any more \nherself\n. The bureau advised that the care package should meet the cost of however many pads were required and wrote a complaint letter. After furthe\nr advocacy by the bureau including an initial application for judicial review, the NHS incontinence team re-assessed the client and agreed to allow four pads.\n Without legal aid funding for making this initial application it is much less likely they would h\nave been able to put this extra pressure \nto get the support they needed\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt was only a successful judicial review that forced the government to rethink rules on the housing benefit size criteria so that severely disabled children did not have to share a r\noom.\n \nA family with two severely disabled children came to their local CAB because they felt the rules amounted to disability discrimination.  With support from CPAG lawyers the case was taken all the way to the court of appeal and DWP agreed to modify thei\nr rules. \nMeaning a number of families can now afford to give better care for their disabled children.\n&#xa0;\nRestricting the scope of legal aid for prison law\nWhilst\n&#xa0;\nwe agree that it would be reasonable for more trivial issues to be dealt with by the Prison Ombudsman Service rather than through legal aid,\n&#xa0;\nwe are\n&#xa0;\nconcerned that if \nlegal aid is not available for\n&#xa0;\nserious issues involving prison\n&#xa0;\nauthorities and\n&#xa0;\ntrea\ntment of\n&#xa0;\nprisoners\n&#xa0;\nthere is a danger that some \nhuman right abuses would be missed as so many treatment issues\n&#xa0;\ncan potentially \ncause human rights concerns\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe disagree with the proposed restriction, as\n&#xa0;\nprison law concerns\n&#xa0;\nfair hearings for those who have b\neen mistreated by prison authorities; taking cases out of scope\n&#xa0;\nwhich involve\n&#xa0;\n prison authorities'\n&#xa0;\nconduct would in our view be inconsistent with human rights law such as the right to\n&#xa0;\nprivacy and\n&#xa0;\nfamily life, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, a\nnd liberty and security of the person. \n&#xa0;\nWhile the government has said that human rights issues\n&#xa0;\n(\neg\n ECHR Article 5\n&#xa0;\nand 6 determinations)\n&#xa0;\nwill still be covered by legal aid, alongside parole hearings and sentencing reviews, there is a serious danger that it\n will be impossible for someone to show that there has been a human rights issue before they are able to access legal aid.\n&#xa0;\n \n \n&#xa0;\nThere is a great deal of difference between a complaint regarding access to television or prison food quality, with serious maltr\neatment by officers, repeated denial of contact with families, or ongoing prison detention of foreign nationals who have served their sentence but where UKBA/Home Office have failed to determine their future.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Prison Ombudsman\n does not have any jurisdiction over\n&#xa0;\nhuman rights\n&#xa0;\nlaw and issues.\n&#xa0;\n \nWe therefore believe that legal aid should be available for all serious cases to\n&#xa0;\nbe determined by the Legal Aid Agency, with more trivial complaints\n&#xa0;\nbeing dealt with by the Prison Ombudsman\n Service.  This would give legal aid lawyers the chance to identify potential human rights breaches which may\n&#xa0;\notherwise be\n&#xa0;\nmissed\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe current plans would affect vulnerable groups who need protection such as mothers and babies and children in custody and \nremoves important issues such as treatment and prison conditions\n&#xa0;\nfrom scope. \nThose with \nmental health issues and/or learning disabilities and young offenders will find it especially hard to obtain effective redress for other serious matters. \n&#xa0;\nThe prison \nombudsman service does not have the power to enforce resolutions and therefore cannot\n&#xa0;\nalways resolve these problems without recourse to the courts, and the proposal makes no attempt to distinguish between trivial and serious complaints but rather imposes a\n blanket restriction. We believe accountability\n&#xa0;\nfor\n&#xa0;\nmistakes or\n&#xa0;\nmaltreatment\n&#xa0;\nin criminal justice system is of the highest importance but will be sacrificed if the proposal on restricting legal aid in prison law cases goes ahead.\n&#xa0;\nThe projected saving from \nthis measure is\n&#xa0;\ntiny\n in Government spending terms - £4 million according to the consultation paper impact assessment - but the implications for victims of mistreatment in prison are huge\n. \n&#xa0;\nCitizens Advice Bureaux run many prison based advice projects - cu\nrrently covering around 50 prisons, so if the government reduces legal aid funding for advice to prisoners this may well add to the pressure on our staff and volunteers currently delivering advice in prisons.  This in turn would have a damaging impact on t\nhe prison and parole services if we are not able to support as many clients.\n \n&#xa0;\nIntroducing a residence test\nH\numan right\n are not something\n that you have to earn by being in a country for 12 months.  In the same way that as soon as you set foot into our coun\ntry you must abide by our laws\n,\n you should not have to wait 12 months to access to justice if your treatment at the hands of others is \nunlawful\n.\n  This is important as the Human Rights Act protects universal rights.\nWe strongly\n \ndis\nagree\nd\n with the proposal\ns\n \nset out in the original consultation \nfor limiting legal aid to those with a \"strong connecti\non\" with the \nUK\n.  \nDespite modifications to the proposals \nregarding\n asylum seekers we remain concerned that for those recently granted asylum\n whose asylum claim was \nmad\ne less than a year ago they may\n still fail the residence test\n bar\n and be unable to access justice, regardless of the issue for which they are seeking legal advice. This will affect cases where asylum is granted quickly because the case for asylum itself\n is very strong.\n&#xa0;\nSome of the most disadvantaged will therefore be left outside of scope regardless of the severity or nature of their legal problem as a result of this proposal.\nMaking exceptions for children and \ntrafficking victims\n \ndoes not deal with this\n underlying problem with the policy. Many clients visiting \ntheir local CAB\n for help with housing, family, welfare or debt pr\no\nblems \nhave foreign national backgrounds and often it is difficult for the bureau to determine their precise immigration status.\n \nOft\nen they are our most vulnerable clients, for example:-\nA London CAB saw an unemployed Nigerian woman who was living with her partner and two \ndependant\n children.  Although she was a council tenant, her application for indefinite stay was pending and she did\n not have recourse to public funds. She needed advice as the council had initiated possession proceedings for rent arrears of £2,925. \n&#xa0;\nA CAB in the South West of England saw a Thai woman aged 30.  She was married and pregnant, but had experienced domestic violence. She needed advice on  finding accommodation and to update her spousal visa for Indefinite Leave to Remain because of domestic\n violence. For this she needed a specialist lawyer (the nearest specialist being in \nCardiff\n). \n&#xa0;\nA London CAB was particularly concerned about one client who complained about being blackmailed and exploited by his employer. The 36 year old ma\nn \nhad very uncl\near immigration status, has no family, but had been in \nUK\n for 12 years. When he visited the bureau the client had no money for food and had to pay rent of £80 per week. He was receiving £1 per hour for a job and was being blackmailed to work for such littl\ne money or be handed in to the police\n by his employer. \n&#xa0;\nCivil merits test – removing legal aid for borderline cases\nBorderline in the context used by the Legal Aid Agency means around the 50 per cent potential success mark, and cases where borderline challenges are currently permitted include some public law, immigration and family claims. \n&#xa0;\nThis means that around half \nof the people who will no longer be able to afford to have \ntheir case heard would have won\n.  \n&#xa0;\nThey are often cases where the matters arising are fundamental ones, such as cases involving human rights. The points raised in these cases may be of high import\nance and the very nature of a legal case is that the final outcome cannot be determined without deliberation on controversial issues. Test cases on borderline issues are often vital for shaping the law’s development and \nclarifying the difficult questions. \nRemoving this possibility will increase the power of public bodies and may allow undesirable practices to continue without a realistic option to challenge them.\n&#xa0;\nReform of the \nCriminal Legal Aid Market\n and Fees\n&#xa0;\nCriminal legal aid is not our area of expert\nise so we do not intend to comment \nin detail \non these issues;\n however \nmany of our advisors\n regularly report circumstances in which vulnerable individuals are unable to get appropriate legal support\n in magistrates or county court \nproceedings\n.\n \nWhilst we are \n \noften\n able to advise social welfare matters \nwe\n do not have the expertise to advise or represent in \ncomplex \nfamily cases, and certainly not in any criminal law proceedings. For example:-\n              \nA CAB in the South West was visited by a single parent with a disabl\ned son, who had recently \n              \nbeen made redundant and was in the process of claiming Income Support and Carer's \n              \nAllowance. She needed legal representation in the Magistrate's court for a drink driving case. \n              \nShe had strong mitigating circumstances as she was \nthe victim of an assault at the time and \n              \nwas moving away from the house of the attacker, by moving her car 50 yards. She was told by \n              \nseveral solicitors that she was not eligible for legal aid and the cost would be several thousand \n              \npounds, although they \nall thought she had a case to argue. She was desperate for help \n              \n              \nbecause she could not afford to lose her licence with a disabled child. When she visited the \n              \nher local CAB\n, the case was due to come to court in three weeks time\n&#xa0;\nWhilst we welcome that the\n government have abandoned a potentially unworkable procurement model for criminal defence services, we remain concerned that a 17.5% cut will be impossible for suppliers to absorb. Many more firms will exit legal aid or close as a result which will also h\nave a knock on impact on the supply of civil and family legal aid meaning there will be less support for the overworked CAB service. \nReforming Fees in Civil Legal Aid\n&#xa0;\nWe disagree with the proposed further fee reduction in family legal aid cases by 10 per\n cent\n.  Fees have already been \ncut by 10 per cent under the LASPO reform package\n and the full implications of \nthis may not have yet been felt\n. \nCitizens Advice \nBureaux rely heavily on being able to refer clients to local firms of solicitors fo\nr advice and r\nepresentation in f\namily matters, and we are concerned\n that \n this proposal which will weaken the supplier base and may lead \nto some firms withdrawing from f\namily legal aid altogether\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe are also concerned that providers have \nrecently \nsigned new f\namily con\ntracts, which started on 1 April 2013\n based on current fee levels.  Beyond any immediate unfairness of this, we are concerned that in future providers will have reduced con\nfidence in the tender process,\n damaging the supplier base for legal aid in general.\n&#xa0;\nExpert fees&#xa0;\nWe would be concerned that\n the effect of a 20 per cent across the board cut risks experts being less attracted to appearing in cases funded by legal aid.\n \nOften cases rely heavily on the availability of expert evidence.  If legal aid providers are unable to find experts willing to undertake the work at significantly reduced fees, clients will suffer. \n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n              \n5\n&#xa0;\n \nPublic Law Project Research \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/documents/UnpackingJ\nRStatistics.pdf\n"
