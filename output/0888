defaultA4e
default is the largest independent sector provider of education and training in the public prison estate,
default currently
default delivering the Offender Learning and Skills Service (OLASS) 
defaultto over 
default15,000
default 
defaultprisoners within 
default25
default prisons across the UK. 
defaultIn addition, 
defaultas a Work Programme prime provider in five contract package areas, 
defaultwe offer day one Work Programme support for all offenders claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance on their release from prison
default.
default 
defaultAltogether, s

default in partnership with 
defaultfive 
defaultProbation Trusts
default in the region
default, The Prince’s Trust, BME groups, specialist housing providers and social enterprises to support 3,285 offenders who 
defaultwere

defaultExecutive Summarydefault&#xa0;defaultWith A4e’s insight
default and front-line experience, in our submission we make the following recommendations:

defaultTo what extent is the Government’s approach to cutting crime cross-departmental?default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government’sdefault proposeddefault defaultprobation defaultreforms defaultcoudefaultld lead to long term benefits fordefault the servicedefault.default 
defaultA4e 
defaultsupports the government’s direction of travel i
defaultn reforming
default probation
default and incorporating a 
defaultpayment-by-results (
defaultPbR
default)
default element into rehabilitation support
default 
defaultfor
default 
defaultoffenders.
default 
defaultIn particular, we welcome the extension of 
defaultpost-release
default 
defaultsupport to offenders sentenced to less than 12 months; this group poses 
defaultthe highest risk of reoffending
default and stands to benefit the most from the reforms
default. 
defaultWe believe that this system offers an opportunity to involve a diverse supply of specialist providers in the rehabilitation process. That said, we believe that there is a long way to go to create the kind of support framework that will get to the heart of the deep-set 
defaultchallenges
default offenders face. This section proposes a model we believe would have a strong positive impact, as well as some practical recommendations to move towards this end point.
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdefaultn the short term the proposed changes to probation could lead to a more fragmented system.default 
defaultWhilst in the long term leveraging the expertise of private and voluntary providers could lead to innovation and improved services, in the short term services may become more fragmented. 
defaultCurrently there is a single provider of probation services for all offenders: the probation trusts. Under the proposed reforms the National Probation Service will continue to serve offenders who pose a high or very high risk of serious harm, with offenders who pose a low or medium risk of serious harm served 
defaultby new rehabilitation providers. Fragmentation will occur when an offender is re-categorised such that responsibility for them moves between providers. 
defaultIn addition, t
defaulthe private and voluntary sector providers that 
defaultwill
default 
defaultdeliver
default these contracts 
defaultmay not
default have
default all
default the pre-existing relationships
default nor the shared responsibility for public protection
default with relevant parties such as Local Authorities or the police
default force
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis
default, too, 
defaultcould lead to a less joined-up s
defaultervice in the short term.
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe support offenders receive should reflect the nature of their problems: overlapping and mutually reinforcing. defaultIt is well proven that the problems facing the majority of offenders are overlapping and mutually reinforcing, however the support they currently receive is disjointed.
default Solving one problem alone may make
default little difference – the remaining problems 
defaultmay
default simply cause it to return. The underlying issues that 
defaultcan 
defaultlead to reoffending cut across a number of government departments, yet the
default 
defaultMoJ
default 
defaultalone must
default deal with them. Offenders often
default face mental health problems – the funding for which primarily resides with the
default Department of Health (
defaultDoH
default)
default;
default they 
defaultmay 
defaultface debt problems –
default with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)
default holding most of the budget to tackle
default such issues
default, and
default they 
defaultmay experience
default 
defaultunemployment
default – a
default Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
default issue. The MoJ should
default 
defaultbe held
default accountable for reducing
default reoffending outcomes, but the support used to treat these problems should be co-commissioned
default along with the government departments and agencies that hold complementary funding
default.
default For this reason we welcome the MoJ
default’s plans
default to
default collaboratively work with 
defaultthe DoH to develop and test an end-to-end approach to tackling addiction 
defaultfrom custody into the community
default.
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrent support is disjointeddefault, inefficientdefault,default anddefault results in a lack of accountabilitydefault. defaultThere 
defaultare tens of thousands of small
default, local, and largely voluntary sector organisations working to support offenders. Almost without exception these organisations deliver on an input/output basis
default 
defaultwithout any one single organisation accountable for drawing together support across multiple funding streams
default to support offenders.
default Overall, t
defaulthis 
defaultis an inefficient arrangement and results in
default a lack of accountability for
default the support provided
default. Since each supporting organisation is only responsible for small parts of an offender’s recovery, 
defaultthere is little overall
default accountability for offenders’ long term outcomes. 
defaultT
defaulthe support offered to offenders must be delivered in the right order
default and with the appropriate level of intensity.
default There is little 
defaultto be gained from
default helping an offender create a CV and prepare them for interviews if they still 
defaulthave unmanaged drug
default or 
defaultmental health issues. Therefore
default the government’s focus on outcomes is a helpful frame to 
defaultorganise support
default through.
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEach offender should have a single case manager who has the capacity to defaulthave full visibility of all the issues defaultan offenderdefault facedefaultsdefault, withdefault the mandate to organise support around those issues.default defaultWe therefore welcome this
default proposal outlined in the government’s recently proposed reforms. 
defaultTo overcome their problems, offenders need personalised support from someone who understands the nature of their problems, and can see how they fit together. In this way, 
defaulteach off
defaultender should be assigned a single case manager who 
defaulthas the capacity to 
defaulthave full visibility of
default all the issues they face
default, 
defaultand who is fully accountable for their long term 
defaultsocial 
defaultoutcomes.
default This system of personalised support would have many benefits
default: 
defaultthe system 
defaultwould be 
defaultless complex for offenders and ensure that the interventions they need are received in the 
defaultrequired
default order.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA single agent should be accountable for the entirety of an offender’s journey. defaultW
defaulte have long supported a system
default composed of
default a single lead rehabilitation provider
default (or consortium)
default that
default would not only deliver the orders of the court, but
default would be held accountable for the long term outcomes of offenders across a defined geo
defaultgraphical contract package area. 
defaultWe support the majority of their payment coming in the form of a service fee for administering the requirements of the court with the rest 
defaultof their payment
default dependent on reducing the reoffending rate
default 
defaultof offenders
default.
default 
defaultThis provider would be backed with a clear mandate at both a local and national level and have access to a pooled budget spanning the MoJ, DWP, BIS and DoH (see figure 3.
default6
default). This pooling designs-in the requirement for cooperation between multiple departments by ensuring that the risks and rewards associated with tackling
default reoffending are shared by all
default.
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe lead provider shdefaultould be encouraged to develop diverse supply chains to deliver support. defaultThe lead provider could be a single organisation, or more likely a c
defaultonsortium of organisations. It sh
defaultould be given freedom to reduce reoffending through whatever means it deems appropriate, and it would be expected
default to
default engage with a diverse supply chain, forming partnerships to achieve the required outcomes. 
defaultFor this reason we welcome the implementation of Market Stewardship Principles mentioned in the MoJ’s recent proposals for Transforming Rehabilitation.
default These principles will enable a diverse supply chain to develop by formalising the rights and responsibilities of the lead provider and the organisations
default with which
default they subcontract.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe suppodefaultrt the gdefaultovernment’s reforms to improvedefault through-the-gatedefault support. defaultWe welcome plans in the Offender Rehabilitation Bill to designate 70 establishments as “resettlement prisons” where offenders would be held before their release in their local area. This network of prisons will lay the groundwork for through-the-gate support by allowing mentors to work with the offender both pre-release and post-release. 
defaultWithout resettlement prisons t
defaulthere 
defaultwould
default 
defaultbe
default a
default real barrier
default to creating the smoothly operating through-the-gate support se
defaultrvice outlined above. I
defaultt is common for prisoners to be released to a region outside
default what would be
default the prison’s contract package area
default under new probation proposals
default. In 
defaultprisons in the East of England
default where A4e delivers OLASS,
default up to
default 70%
default 
defaultof offenders are re
defaultleased to a different area. 
defaultThe proposed changes would
default removed any
default problem of continu
defaultity, as 
defaultthe same
default provider
default 
defaultwould
default be
default responsible for the offe
defaultnder’s journey whilst in prison
default 
defaultand

defaultin the community

defaultIn developing our services around ex-offenders, we aredefault working to join up employment support and rehabilitation provision. defaultAll 
defaultex-
defaultoffenders have access to Work Programme support from day one if they claim Jobseekers Allowance on leaving pr
defaultison, h
defaultowever
default currently too few are aware of this.
default In South Yorkshire A4e is 
defaultworking to improve through-the-
defaultgate collaboration between prison
defaults
default and Work Programme prime contractors to help offenders move into work. By educating prisoners from HMP Doncaster about the Work Programme, we can ensure that ex-offenders receive the employment support they are entitled to. To promote this awareness, A4e
default has linked up with Serco
default to facilitate a training a
defaultnd information session for Jobc
defaultentre Plus Employment and Benefits Advisors who are based in all English and Welsh prisons. The aim of this 
defaultis
default to help 
defaultincrease knowledge around
default the benefits of referral to the Work Programme and ultimately to enable them to confidently encourage uptake for their customers. The agencies involved in South Yorkshire now meet quarterly at a working group called 
defaultReducing Re-offending Through Partnership
default along with key stakeholders in the area such as
default the charity Catch22.

defaultHowdefault cost-effective anddefault sustainable are the Government’s strategies for punishment and reform and their proposals for transforming rehabilitation?default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government’s proposed reforms to probation are a step in the right direction. defaultA4e believes that the model the government has proposed for t
defaultransforming rehabilitation has the potential
default to be more
default cost effective and s
defaultustainable than the model we have now.
default 
defaultJoining up support from a diverse supply chain and paying for interventions that result in positive outcomes
default have the potential to ensure that
default 
defaultrehabilitation
default is
default better targeted
default and 
defaultmore 
defaulteffective.
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTdefaulthe focus of reforms shoulddefault be on deliveringdefault highdefault quality rehabilitation rather than on short term cost-cutting. defaultW
defaulte welcome
default the opportunity to offer offenders more targeted and diverse rehabilitation services through opening up provision to private and voluntary sector organisations
default who are
default paid for the reoffending outcomes they a
defaultchieve. We feel that this is a
default key 
defaultdevelopment
default in the proposed changes and believe that the focus during commissioning should be on prospective providers’ ability to deliver
default this
default high
default quality rehabilitation, rather than merely
default their ability to
default cut costs in delivering the orders of the court.
default This is not a point about prioritising social outcomes over financial outcomes; the biggest potential savings lie in reducing reoffending rates in the long term, not cutting the cost of delivering probation services in the short term.
default A4e is a key proponent of investing in the short term to save in the long term, and we feel that this principle 
defaultshould absolutely apply to the transformation of rehabilitation.
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA sustainable approach defaultmust have strong cross-party and cross-departmental support. defaultAny
default model is implemented
default must have strong cross-party and cross-departmental support over this and
default the
default next spending review period. 
defaultThe improved contractual stability resulting from this would reduce the financial risk providers face, fostering a
default more
default stable environment for providers to invest in the scheme.
default In particular, this investment is crucial to 
defaultoffenders
default with the greatest barriers to rehabilitation
default, who will require
default the most substantial long term investment
default.
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWider use of pdefaulteer mentoring shouldefaultd be encouraged inside prisonsdefault and in the community. defaultWe welcome the emphasis on using reformed offenders to act as mentors to offend
defaulters whilst in prison and on their release
default.
default We believe that mentoring can add value by providing a less formal source of advice and support.
default Peer mentoring not only benefits the mentee, it has the potential to benefit the mentor by allowi
defaultng them time to self-reflect,
default develop communication and leadership skills.
default A4e is a strong proponent of peer mentoring
default; in the past five years we have awarded over 160 mentoring qualifications.
default In HMP Wayland, where we deliver OLASS, 
default17 learners have achieved a Certificate in Learn
defaulting Support since August 2012. W
defaulte
default currently have a mentor in every classroom
default and workshop, supporting over 200 learners.
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInsights from Desistance defaultTheorydefault defaultshould be more widely used. defaultTo create a su
defaultstainable rehabilitation system
default the government must not only attempt to support offenders
default but
default help offenders 
defaultto help themselves. Desistance
default 
defaultTheory 
defaultoffers an option for achieving this by better engaging offenders. Using behaviour change interventions alongside traditional rehabilitation measures could prove successful in stopping offending among those who have proved res
defaultistant to
default 
defaulttraditional 
defaultapproach
defaultes
default. 
defaultFor instance, Desistance Theory suggests that m
defaultaintaining 
defaultcontact with one’s partner or family 
defaultwhilst in prison reduces the chance of reoffending
default significantly
default.
default In addition, schemes such as the award-winning
default “Storybook D
defaultads”, 
defaultwhich A4e has
default supported
default,
default should be encouraged. This scheme
default allows imprisoned fathers to record a story on an audio book and send it to their children, 
defaultwhich helps 
defaultmaintain the link between parents and their children.

defaultLongdefault term rdefaulteform efforts shoulddefault direct resources todefaultwardsdefault preventdefaultatdefaultive action.default 
defaultIn the long term,

defaultive rather than crisis
default activity, as
default there are huge cost savings to be made by
default 
defaultdiminishing
default the
default 
defaultcycle of offending which impacts 
defaultthe
default next generation.
default 65% of offenders’ sons become offenders compared to 22% whose parents are not offenders
default and research by the Prison Reform Trust has shown that the children of prisoners have approximately three times the risk of mental health problems and anti-social/delinquent behaviour compared to other children.
default At-risk families should
default be identified and targeted for 
defaultearly 
defaultinterventions, as these families can experience emotional, health, financial and housing difficulties when one parent is impri
defaultsoned. Critically, families should
default be more involved throughout the process.
