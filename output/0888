[normal]Introduction[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This formal response is submitted on behalf of A4e in response to the Justice Select Committee’s inquiry into 
[normal]crime reduction policies: a coordinated approach
[normal]. A4e is able to provide further clarification on any aspects of the response.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A4e is 
[normal]a leading public service provider that designs, manages and delivers public services in partnership with governments, public and private sector organisations and the voluntary and community sector
[normal]. 
[normal]This submission draws on our key areas of expertise through answering relevant, selected questions posed by the Committee in the call for evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A4e
[normal] is the largest independent sector provider of education and training in the public prison estate,
[normal] currently
[normal] delivering the Offender Learning and Skills Service (OLASS) 
[normal]to over 
[normal]15,000
[normal] 
[normal]prisoners within 
[normal]25
[normal] prisons across the UK. 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]as a Work Programme prime provider in five contract package areas, 
[normal]we offer day one Work Programme support for all offenders claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance on their release from prison
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Altogether, s
[normal]ince 2005 we have delivered 
[normal]2.5 million
[normal] hours of learning and vocational training to offenders and 
[normal]ex-offenders, working with over 100,000
[normal] customers
[normal] with a conviction.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This submission also draws on our experience f
[normal]rom 2010 to 2011 
[normal]when 
[normal]A4e 
[normal]was 
[normal]the prime provider of Way4Ward, a region-wide NOMS/ESF initiative in supporting offenders in the South West. We work
[normal]ed
[normal] in partnership with 
[normal]five 
[normal]Probation Trusts
[normal] in the region
[normal], The Prince’s Trust, BME groups, specialist housing providers and social enterprises to support 3,285 offenders who 
[normal]were 
[normal]leaving prison or serving a community sentence. In the North East, we delive
[normal]red
[normal] First Step
[normal]s to Employability working with 
[normal]Durham Tees Valley Probation Trust to provide employability-focused qualifications to offenders carrying out their Unpaid Work 
[normal]O
[normal]rders in their local communities. The 
[normal]NOCN-
[normal]accredited Steps programme 
[normal]was 
[normal]also delivered through local community based referral sources. 
[normal]From
[normal] April 2009, First Steps engaged with over 1,600 individuals
[normal],
[normal] assisting 700
[normal] of those individuals to
[normal] ac
[normal]hieve a City and Guilds or NOCN-
[normal]accredited qualification, helping 92
[normal] to
[normal] move into employment and a further 60
[normal] to
[normal] access an education or training option.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]With A4e’s insight
[normal] and front-line experience, in our submission we make the following recommendations:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To what extent is the Government’s approach to cutting crime cross-departmental?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The government’s[bold] proposed[bold] [bold]probation [bold]reforms [bold]cou[bold]ld lead to long term benefits for[bold] the service[bold].[bold] 
[normal]A4e 
[normal]supports the government’s direction of travel i
[normal]n reforming
[normal] probation
[normal] and incorporating a 
[normal]payment-by-results (
[normal]PbR
[normal])
[normal] element into rehabilitation support
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]offenders.
[normal] 
[normal]In particular, we welcome the extension of 
[normal]post-release
[normal] 
[normal]support to offenders sentenced to less than 12 months; this group poses 
[normal]the highest risk of reoffending
[normal] and stands to benefit the most from the reforms
[normal]. 
[normal]We believe that this system offers an opportunity to involve a diverse supply of specialist providers in the rehabilitation process. That said, we believe that there is a long way to go to create the kind of support framework that will get to the heart of the deep-set 
[normal]challenges
[normal] offenders face. This section proposes a model we believe would have a strong positive impact, as well as some practical recommendations to move towards this end point.
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I[bold]n the short term the proposed changes to probation could lead to a more fragmented system.[bold] 
[normal]Whilst in the long term leveraging the expertise of private and voluntary providers could lead to innovation and improved services, in the short term services may become more fragmented. 
[normal]Currently there is a single provider of probation services for all offenders: the probation trusts. Under the proposed reforms the National Probation Service will continue to serve offenders who pose a high or very high risk of serious harm, with offenders who pose a low or medium risk of serious harm served 
[normal]by new rehabilitation providers. Fragmentation will occur when an offender is re-categorised such that responsibility for them moves between providers. 
[normal]In addition, t
[normal]he private and voluntary sector providers that 
[normal]will
[normal] 
[normal]deliver
[normal] these contracts 
[normal]may not
[normal] have
[normal] all
[normal] the pre-existing relationships
[normal] nor the shared responsibility for public protection
[normal] with relevant parties such as Local Authorities or the police
[normal] force
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his
[normal], too, 
[normal]could lead to a less joined-up s
[normal]ervice in the short term.
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The support offenders receive should reflect the nature of their problems: overlapping and mutually reinforcing. [bold]It is well proven that the problems facing the majority of offenders are overlapping and mutually reinforcing, however the support they currently receive is disjointed.
[normal] Solving one problem alone may make
[normal] little difference – the remaining problems 
[normal]may
[normal] simply cause it to return. The underlying issues that 
[normal]can 
[normal]lead to reoffending cut across a number of government departments, yet the
[normal] 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] 
[normal]alone must
[normal] deal with them. Offenders often
[normal] face mental health problems – the funding for which primarily resides with the
[normal] Department of Health (
[normal]DoH
[normal])
[normal];
[normal] they 
[normal]may 
[normal]face debt problems –
[normal] with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)
[normal] holding most of the budget to tackle
[normal] such issues
[normal], and
[normal] they 
[normal]may experience
[normal] 
[normal]unemployment
[normal] – a
[normal] Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
[normal] issue. The MoJ should
[normal] 
[normal]be held
[normal] accountable for reducing
[normal] reoffending outcomes, but the support used to treat these problems should be co-commissioned
[normal] along with the government departments and agencies that hold complementary funding
[normal].
[normal] For this reason we welcome the MoJ
[normal]’s plans
[normal] to
[normal] collaboratively work with 
[normal]the DoH to develop and test an end-to-end approach to tackling addiction 
[normal]from custody into the community
[normal].
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Current support is disjointed[bold], inefficient[bold],[bold] and[bold] results in a lack of accountability[bold]. [bold]There 
[normal]are tens of thousands of small
[normal], local, and largely voluntary sector organisations working to support offenders. Almost without exception these organisations deliver on an input/output basis
[normal] 
[normal]without any one single organisation accountable for drawing together support across multiple funding streams
[normal] to support offenders.
[normal] Overall, t
[normal]his 
[normal]is an inefficient arrangement and results in
[normal] a lack of accountability for
[normal] the support provided
[normal]. Since each supporting organisation is only responsible for small parts of an offender’s recovery, 
[normal]there is little overall
[normal] accountability for offenders’ long term outcomes. 
[normal]T
[normal]he support offered to offenders must be delivered in the right order
[normal] and with the appropriate level of intensity.
[normal] There is little 
[normal]to be gained from
[normal] helping an offender create a CV and prepare them for interviews if they still 
[normal]have unmanaged drug
[normal] or 
[normal]mental health issues. Therefore
[normal] the government’s focus on outcomes is a helpful frame to 
[normal]organise support
[normal] through.
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Each offender should have a single case manager who has the capacity to [bold]have full visibility of all the issues [bold]an offender[bold] face[bold]s[bold], with[bold] the mandate to organise support around those issues.[bold] [bold]We therefore welcome this
[normal] proposal outlined in the government’s recently proposed reforms. 
[normal]To overcome their problems, offenders need personalised support from someone who understands the nature of their problems, and can see how they fit together. In this way, 
[normal]each off
[normal]ender should be assigned a single case manager who 
[normal]has the capacity to 
[normal]have full visibility of
[normal] all the issues they face
[normal], 
[normal]and who is fully accountable for their long term 
[normal]social 
[normal]outcomes.
[normal] This system of personalised support would have many benefits
[normal]: 
[normal]the system 
[normal]would be 
[normal]less complex for offenders and ensure that the interventions they need are received in the 
[normal]required
[normal] order.

[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A single agent should be accountable for the entirety of an offender’s journey. [bold]W
[normal]e have long supported a system
[normal] composed of
[normal] a single lead rehabilitation provider
[normal] (or consortium)
[normal] that
[normal] would not only deliver the orders of the court, but
[normal] would be held accountable for the long term outcomes of offenders across a defined geo
[normal]graphical contract package area. 
[normal]We support the majority of their payment coming in the form of a service fee for administering the requirements of the court with the rest 
[normal]of their payment
[normal] dependent on reducing the reoffending rate
[normal] 
[normal]of offenders
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This provider would be backed with a clear mandate at both a local and national level and have access to a pooled budget spanning the MoJ, DWP, BIS and DoH (see figure 3.
[normal]6
[normal]). This pooling designs-in the requirement for cooperation between multiple departments by ensuring that the risks and rewards associated with tackling
[normal] reoffending are shared by all
[normal].
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The lead provider sh[bold]ould be encouraged to develop diverse supply chains to deliver support. [bold]The lead provider could be a single organisation, or more likely a c
[normal]onsortium of organisations. It sh
[normal]ould be given freedom to reduce reoffending through whatever means it deems appropriate, and it would be expected
[normal] to
[normal] engage with a diverse supply chain, forming partnerships to achieve the required outcomes. 
[normal]For this reason we welcome the implementation of Market Stewardship Principles mentioned in the MoJ’s recent proposals for Transforming Rehabilitation.
[normal] These principles will enable a diverse supply chain to develop by formalising the rights and responsibilities of the lead provider and the organisations
[normal] with which
[normal] they subcontract.
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We suppo[bold]rt the g[bold]overnment’s reforms to improve[bold] through-the-gate[bold] support. [bold]We welcome plans in the Offender Rehabilitation Bill to designate 70 establishments as “resettlement prisons” where offenders would be held before their release in their local area. This network of prisons will lay the groundwork for through-the-gate support by allowing mentors to work with the offender both pre-release and post-release. 
[normal]Without resettlement prisons t
[normal]here 
[normal]would
[normal] 
[normal]be
[normal] a
[normal] real barrier
[normal] to creating the smoothly operating through-the-gate support se
[normal]rvice outlined above. I
[normal]t is common for prisoners to be released to a region outside
[normal] what would be
[normal] the prison’s contract package area
[normal] under new probation proposals
[normal]. In 
[normal]prisons in the East of England
[normal] where A4e delivers OLASS,
[normal] up to
[normal] 70%
[normal] 
[normal]of offenders are re
[normal]leased to a different area. 
[normal]The proposed changes would
[normal] removed any
[normal] problem of continu
[normal]ity, as 
[normal]the same
[normal] provider
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] be
[normal] responsible for the offe
[normal]nder’s journey whilst in prison
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]in the community
[normal].
[normal]3.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In developing our services around ex-offenders, we are[bold] working to join up employment support and rehabilitation provision. [bold]All 
[normal]ex-
[normal]offenders have access to Work Programme support from day one if they claim Jobseekers Allowance on leaving pr
[normal]ison, h
[normal]owever
[normal] currently too few are aware of this.
[normal] In South Yorkshire A4e is 
[normal]working to improve through-the-
[normal]gate collaboration between prison
[normal]s
[normal] and Work Programme prime contractors to help offenders move into work. By educating prisoners from HMP Doncaster about the Work Programme, we can ensure that ex-offenders receive the employment support they are entitled to. To promote this awareness, A4e
[normal] has linked up with Serco
[normal] to facilitate a training a
[normal]nd information session for Jobc
[normal]entre Plus Employment and Benefits Advisors who are based in all English and Welsh prisons. The aim of this 
[normal]is
[normal] to help 
[normal]increase knowledge around
[normal] the benefits of referral to the Work Programme and ultimately to enable them to confidently encourage uptake for their customers. The agencies involved in South Yorkshire now meet quarterly at a working group called 
[normal]Reducing Re-offending Through Partnership
[normal] along with key stakeholders in the area such as
[normal] the charity Catch22.

[normal]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How[bold] cost-effective and[bold] sustainable are the Government’s strategies for punishment and reform and their proposals for transforming rehabilitation?[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The government’s proposed reforms to probation are a step in the right direction. [bold]A4e believes that the model the government has proposed for t
[normal]ransforming rehabilitation has the potential
[normal] to be more
[normal] cost effective and s
[normal]ustainable than the model we have now.
[normal] 
[normal]Joining up support from a diverse supply chain and paying for interventions that result in positive outcomes
[normal] have the potential to ensure that
[normal] 
[normal]rehabilitation
[normal] is
[normal] better targeted
[normal] and 
[normal]more 
[normal]effective.
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T[bold]he focus of reforms should[bold] be on delivering[bold] high[bold] quality rehabilitation rather than on short term cost-cutting. [bold]W
[normal]e welcome
[normal] the opportunity to offer offenders more targeted and diverse rehabilitation services through opening up provision to private and voluntary sector organisations
[normal] who are
[normal] paid for the reoffending outcomes they a
[normal]chieve. We feel that this is a
[normal] key 
[normal]development
[normal] in the proposed changes and believe that the focus during commissioning should be on prospective providers’ ability to deliver
[normal] this
[normal] high
[normal] quality rehabilitation, rather than merely
[normal] their ability to
[normal] cut costs in delivering the orders of the court.
[normal] This is not a point about prioritising social outcomes over financial outcomes; the biggest potential savings lie in reducing reoffending rates in the long term, not cutting the cost of delivering probation services in the short term.
[normal] A4e is a key proponent of investing in the short term to save in the long term, and we feel that this principle 
[normal]should absolutely apply to the transformation of rehabilitation.
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A sustainable approach [bold]must have strong cross-party and cross-departmental support. [bold]Any
[normal] model is implemented
[normal] must have strong cross-party and cross-departmental support over this and
[normal] the
[normal] next spending review period. 
[normal]The improved contractual stability resulting from this would reduce the financial risk providers face, fostering a
[normal] more
[normal] stable environment for providers to invest in the scheme.
[normal] In particular, this investment is crucial to 
[normal]offenders
[normal] with the greatest barriers to rehabilitation
[normal], who will require
[normal] the most substantial long term investment
[normal].
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Wider use of p[bold]eer mentoring shoul[bold]d be encouraged inside prisons[bold] and in the community. [bold]We welcome the emphasis on using reformed offenders to act as mentors to offend
[normal]ers whilst in prison and on their release
[normal].
[normal] We believe that mentoring can add value by providing a less formal source of advice and support.
[normal] Peer mentoring not only benefits the mentee, it has the potential to benefit the mentor by allowi
[normal]ng them time to self-reflect,
[normal] develop communication and leadership skills.
[normal] A4e is a strong proponent of peer mentoring
[normal]; in the past five years we have awarded over 160 mentoring qualifications.
[normal] In HMP Wayland, where we deliver OLASS, 
[normal]17 learners have achieved a Certificate in Learn
[normal]ing Support since August 2012. W
[normal]e
[normal] currently have a mentor in every classroom
[normal] and workshop, supporting over 200 learners.
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Insights from Desistance [bold]Theory[bold] [bold]should be more widely used. [bold]To create a su
[normal]stainable rehabilitation system
[normal] the government must not only attempt to support offenders
[normal] but
[normal] help offenders 
[normal]to help themselves. Desistance
[normal] 
[normal]Theory 
[normal]offers an option for achieving this by better engaging offenders. Using behaviour change interventions alongside traditional rehabilitation measures could prove successful in stopping offending among those who have proved res
[normal]istant to
[normal] 
[normal]traditional 
[normal]approach
[normal]es
[normal]. 
[normal]For instance, Desistance Theory suggests that m
[normal]aintaining 
[normal]contact with one’s partner or family 
[normal]whilst in prison reduces the chance of reoffending
[normal] significantly
[normal].
[normal] In addition, schemes such as the award-winning
[normal] “Storybook D
[normal]ads”, 
[normal]which A4e has
[normal] supported
[normal],
[normal] should be encouraged. This scheme
[normal] allows imprisoned fathers to record a story on an audio book and send it to their children, 
[normal]which helps 
[normal]maintain the link between parents and their children.
[normal] 
[normal]4.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Long[bold] term r[bold]eform efforts should[bold] direct resources to[bold]wards[bold] prevent[bold]at[bold]ive action.[bold] 
[normal]In the long term, 
[normal]reforms
[normal] would benefit from a greater focus on prevent
[normal]at
[normal]ive rather than crisis
[normal] activity, as
[normal] there are huge cost savings to be made by
[normal] 
[normal]diminishing
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]cycle of offending which impacts 
[normal]the
[normal] next generation.
[normal] 65% of offenders’ sons become offenders compared to 22% whose parents are not offenders
[normal] and research by the Prison Reform Trust has shown that the children of prisoners have approximately three times the risk of mental health problems and anti-social/delinquent behaviour compared to other children.
[normal] At-risk families should
[normal] be identified and targeted for 
[normal]early 
[normal]interventions, as these families can experience emotional, health, financial and housing difficulties when one parent is impri
[normal]soned. Critically, families should
[normal] be more involved throughout the process.
