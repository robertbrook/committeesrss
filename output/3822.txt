[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]CIHT aims to encourage more people to cycle safely and more regularly for their everyday travel, as part of a wider promotion of sustainable transport and development.&#xa0;CIHT members are involved in road safety and traffic management, and the scale of recent cyclist deaths and injury in London, as with all casualties and deaths across users of the highway network, has been both shocking and gives cause for concern.&#xa0; These incidents appear to raise common problems of conflict at busy intersections and of inherent hazards between certain vehicle types, especially between cyclists and buses or heavy goods vehicles.&#xa0;Cycling has substantial health benefits for physical and mental wellbeing, as well as having a much lower environmental impact than motor transport, and CIHT continues to urge all highway authorities to maintain these benefits while delivering infrastructure and other actions to reduce cyclist injury. Although there has been a decline in the level of risk to cycling over the longer term, there have been more recent increases in the rate of killed and serious injuries, which is at odds with other transport modes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]In part due to these concerns, although there has been an increase in levels of both cycle use and investment in cycling, take up across the UK remains variable and considerably lower than is achieved in many other western European nations.

[[[?]]]&#xa0;

[[[1.1]]]              The first point to make is that ‘safety’ is always relative – there is no absolutely safe mode of transport.  Cycling in the UK, expressed in terms of casualties per mile cycled, is safer than other countries such as the US, but less safe than countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark.  The aim must be to make cycling in the UK as safe as in the best countries.  However, it should be recognised that the risk of a cycling fatality in the UK, per mile travelled, is about half what it was 20 years ago. Many people believe cycling to be more hazardous than walking, yet deaths per mile travelled by cyclist have been lower that for pedestrians for every year since 1994.  &#xa0;

[[[1.2]]]              Unfortunately the risk per mile of being killed or seriously injured in when cycling has increased more recently, and this is worrying, particularly since the risks for other modes of travel have continued to decline.  The reasons for this are not fully clear, but many of the fatalities that have occurred have involved cyclists and HGVs, particularly when the HGV is turning left at a junction. &#xa0;

[[[1.3]]]              The health benefits of cycling also need to be taken into account – people die from illnesses brought on by inactivity as well as through road traffic accidents.  Cycling has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancers, which together kill over a hundred times the number of people who die on the roads.&#xa0;

[[[1.4]]]              Urban areas are complex and present a characteristic combination of hazards that result in, per mile cycled, a higher number of collisions involving a cyclist than in rural areas.  Cyclists are more likely to encounter congestion and compete with motorists, particularly at junctions where most collisions take place.  Due to the higher traffic speeds involved though, collisions in rural areas tend to be more severe – when they do occur the cyclist has a greater chance of being killed or seriously injured. &#xa0;

[[[s]]]

[[[afety?]]]&#xa0;

[[[2.1]]]              Successive Governments have demonstrated a commitment to promoting cycling by dedicated funding, issuing policy notes and publishing guidance.  Unfortunately the outcome has been mixed, with some provision being disjointed or of limited use to more confident cyclists.  However the recent increases in the levels of cycling in some places, particularly in London and the centres of the larger cities, as well as the ‘Cycling Demonstration Towns’, indicates that promoting cycling is succeeding.  Success in terms of safety must now follow and will come from joint working between central and local government, the Institutions and cycling organisations, identifying the challenges and developing and implementing better solutions.&#xa0;

[[[2.2]]]              In order to make this happen, senior political and executive commitment at both national and local level must be achieved to support a package of measures to increase both cycle use and cycle safety.&#xa0;

[[[2.3]]]              CIHT believes that a return to the setting and delivery of casualty reduction targets has a key part to play in this.  There is solid evidence that they are successful in reducing road deaths and injury, and the CIHT believes the abandonment of targets in the current Road Safety Framework should be reconsidered.&#xa0;

[[[2.4]]]              Local authorities and police forces have always had a key role in the implementation and achievement of casualty reduction in Great Britain over the last two decades. We endorse the view that decisions about local roads are best taken at the local level. Our concern, however, is that an emphasis on decentralisation with no commitment from central government to monitor progress may lead to inconsistency around the country with some authorities continuing to focus on road safety and others concentrating on different local priorities, disbanding the professional safety teams that were part of many authorities. &#xa0;

[[[2.5]]]              As the DfT itself has admitted in the Strategic Framework, performance in casualty reduction around the country is varied. Decentralisation is likely to exacerbate that position. It is vital to monitor independently performance across local authorities and the different administrations and to share good practice across the profession. The Strategic Framework fails to do this.&#xa0;

[[[2.6]]]              Road Safety Audit is an acknowledged technique that reduces risks of individual schemes and also allows highway authorities and their designers to learn from past experiences.  Government should work with stakeholders to promote the development of a mechanism for increasing the knowledge of road safety practitioners on cycling matters, which will then be shared with highway designers.  &#xa0;

[[[Is it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?]]]&#xa0;

[[[3.1]]]              We know that many people who wish to take up cycling are deterred by the fact that on most roads in the UK they will have to share space with traffic.&#xa0; Achieving some separation from motor vehicles is therefore important if we are to match the levels that are seen in other countries.&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]]              It is certainly feasible for new roads to be designed and developed to incorporate segregation, and there is a need for highway standards (such as the Highways Agency’s Design Manual) to be updated with this in mind.&#xa0; It will be more difficult on much of the existing highway network, but there are many sections of road where there is space that can be reallocated to cycling.&#xa0; This could be done by a slight reduction in the width of traffic lanes, removing areas of hatching and so on.&#xa0; Only in exceptional circumstances should space be taken from pedestrians, but sometimes there are very wide footpaths that are only lightly used. &#xa0;

[[[3.3]]]              New techniques such as ‘light segregation’ (dividing off cycle lanes with bollards, planters or ‘armadillos’) offer promising ways of giving cyclists a good degree of actual and perceived safety at relatively low cost and need to be rolled out much more widely. &#xa0;

[[[3.4]]]              Where segregation is not possible then cycling must be made more safe and pleasant through reducing traffic speeds and flows.&#xa0; CIHT welcomes the recent guidance by Government which makes it easier for local authorities to introduce 20mph limits and zones, and wishes to see them introduced more widely in urban areas.&#xa0;

[[[3.5]]]              At junctions, where most collisions occur, a choice needs to be made between segregating and integrating cyclists.  There are fewer conflict points when cyclists are integrated with traffic, but this will only be attractive to cyclists (particularly novice ones) at lightly trafficked locations. At busy and complex junctions segregation will often be needed, but it must be done carefully so that cyclists do not lose out in terms of priority or delay, or they will simply remain on the road.  &#xa0;

[[[3.6]]]              Drivers must also clearly recognise when cyclists are returned to the traffic flow that they are to be treated as any other vehicle, and given the space and respect they need.  There is a role for Government here in educating drivers how to engage with cyclists, as has been done in other countries such as Ireland. &#xa0;

[[[ safety]]]&#xa0;

[[[4.1]]]              The Welsh Government has recently enacted the Active Travel Act, which will require all Welsh authorities to develop a strategy for developing safe and attractive cycling and walking routes, with a 15 year horizon.  The Act also requires authorities to plan for walking and cycling when designing and improving highways, a significant step.  This has the potential to bring cycling into the mainstream and CIHT would welcome its introduction in other parts of the UK.&#xa0;

[[[4.2]]]              Central Government needs to take more of a lead in the trialling, development and rolling out of innovative (to the UK) solutions which improve the convenience and safety of routes used by cyclists.  Many techniques that are used in other countries – such as low level cycle-specific signals, combined cycle and pedestrian zebras and two-stage turns at junctions – are impossible or difficult to achieve within current UK legislation and practice.  &#xa0;

[[[4.3]]]              Government is working with Transport for London on the trialling of some new ideas at TRL, but CIHT calls on the DfT to go further and faster, taking a much more proactive role, and developing a culture of continuous improvement.  &#xa0;

[[[4.4]]]              Achieving better outcomes should be based around a proven evidence base and sound principles of likely net benefit.  Road safety professionals have skills central to these issues and the development of better policies in highway design and management. Promoting the collation of an evidence base for road safety professionals to reference will help them in this role. In all areas, road safety skills must be integrated to maximise the benefits for cyclists and other road users without an adverse safety impact.  Properly managed, many schemes can deliver reductions in cost, environmental and casualty levels.&#xa0;

[[[4.5]]]              Because of the historic low levels of investment and political support, there is a real skills gap amongst highway professionals.  There should be support for the development of skilled and motivated delivery teams centrally or regionally, able to engage with colleagues within local authorities and external organisations. Government should also work with the Institutions and other stakeholders to develop and roll out training for highway professionals so that they are better informed on how to design for cycling.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Road casualties Great Britain 2011
