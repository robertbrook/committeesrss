defaultWe note that the evidence so far put before the Committee focuses extensively on the efficiency of subsidies and that the scope of the Committee’s examination will include:
default(iv) whether the Government has any plans or targets to reduce or eliminate ‘harmful’ subsidies;
default(v) progress in reducing such harmful subsidies, and how current energy policies and DECC’s ‘Energy Pathways’ for the mix of energy sources will influence the magnitude of any subsidies.
defaultWe focus our evidence on the aspect of harmful subsidies.

defaultWaste incineration plants recover energy in the form of heat, a small proportion of which is converted to electricity. Most of the remaining heat is available for purposes such as community heating schemes but in almost every instance in the UK is dissipated into the atmosphere due to the absence of customers for it often in circumstances where the facilities are poorly located relative to potential heat users.
defaultAs a result the energy efficiency of these plants as measured by energy in the form of 
defaultEnergy passed to the National Grid ÷ Energy recovered from waste 
defaultis extremely low, frequently of the order of 20% or less. Please see Appendix A3, A4 and A5.
defaultThis low efficiency level compares poorly with that achieved by fossil based generation sources and arises inevitably (and in line with the laws of thermodynamics) as the result of the relatively low level technology employed. A consequence is that in terms of CO2 / KWh (the emissions factor), these plants (with an expected 25 year life span) will actually, in future years, achieve a performance inferior to that set by DECC as the marginal emissions factor and some are already in this situation. In other words, they are, or will be, operating in opposition to the Governments carbon reduction strategies. 
defaultUKWIN believes that the technology involved is not such as to be worthy of subsidy, nor will it become so and that the biogenic element of the electricity produced (
defaultie
default that deemed to derive from the renewable proportion within the waste) should not qualify for Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs).
defaultIn fact, and as an outcome of the Government’s 
default 
defaultconsultation on proposals for the levels of banded support under the 
defaultRenewables
default Obligation for the period 2013-17 and the 
defaultRenewables
default Obligation Order 2012,  the Government decided that:
default“In the light of the consultation responses, and additional evidence provided on costs and deployment potential, the Government has decided to introduce a single band for new ACT generating capacity. Support under the ACT band will be 2 ROCs/
defaultMWh
default for new accreditations and additional capacity added in 2013/14 and 2014/15, reducing to 1.9 ROCs/
defaultMWh
default for new accreditations and additional capacity added in 2015/16 and 1.8 ROCs/
defaultMWh
default for new accreditations and additional capacity added in 2016/17”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUKWIN argues that this decision was perverse and created a 
defaultharmful subsidydefault, harmful because:
default&#xa0;
defaultUKWIN has focussed this evidence on what we believe to be a particularly perverse decision relevant to ROCs on behalf of Government but we are equally opposed to the subsidy of waste incineration via the Renewable Heat Incentive, Feed in Tariffs, rate relief or Contract for Difference.

defaultA modern incinerator producing only electricity from the steam may therefore achieve a maximum electrical generating efficiency of 27%, with a typical efficiency range being from 14% to 24%. 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultAdvanced Thermal Treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (DEFRA February 2013)
default endorses the above statement.
defaultTable 1: Incineration Technologies
defaultAn Incinerator producing exclusively heat can have a thermal generating efficiency of around 80 – 90%. 
defaultThis heat may be used to raise steam for electrical generation at a
defaultpproximately 
default17-30% gross efficiency. Net electrical efficiencies (taking account of the parasitic load of the plant) are often cited up to ~27% for Incinerators recovering electricity only, although some facilities have reported exceeding this. The choice of a steam turbine generator set to produce electricity (alone) will limit the upper efficiency based on acceptable boiler temperatures. 
defaultIn contrast, the efficiency of an Incinerator for power generation is lower than a large coal or gas fired 
defaultpower station. Typically, a coal fired power station will have an 
defaultefficiency of 33%-38% and a combined cycle 
defaultgas turbine (CCGT) power station can 
defaulthave an electrical efficiency in excess of 50%.
defaultDEFRA’s statement is consistent with the information supplied in planning supporting statements by applicants for planning consent for waste incinerators. For example an incinerator with a planned annual  throughput of 140,000 tonnes of waste, currently the subject of the planning processes (and described as Advanced Conversion Technology) will, of the potentially recoverable energy in the waste feedstock, and based on the applicants performance data, actually deliver only some 18.3% as electricity to the National Grid.

defaultOf this some 59,000 tonnes derives from fossil elements in the waste and can be compared to the c.77,000
