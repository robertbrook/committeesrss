default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence from the socialist Educational Associationdefault&#xa0;default1default              defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;default1.1
default              
defaultIn this submission we argue that there is no evidence that sponsored academies have proved more effective than maintained schools in raising standards. 
defaultAnecdotes about individual schools do not constitute evidence. 
defaultWe further argue that there is evidence to suggest that sponsored academies have not contributed to closing attainment gaps 
defaultbut
default that by 
defaultmaking possible (as own admission authority schools)
default 
defaultmore
default socio-economic selection they are
default likely to make this situation worse.
default We agree with the recent statement by 
defaultAndreas Schleicherdefault that 
default“defaultThe UK demonstrates that increasing school choice and competition does not improve standards”default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultWe maintain that the p
defaultrocess of academy conversion and the es
defaulttablishment of free schools has
default been characterised by a serious democratic deficit, by a substantial waste of public money and by entirely unproductive levels of conflict within local communities.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultWe consider tha
defaultt 
defaultthe Secretary of State’s approach to intervention is wholly inadequate and demonstrates a failure to understand how the process of school improvement actually works. We consider that there is much more to be learned from the success of collaborative prog
defaultrammes such as 
defaultthe 
defaultLondon and City Challenge
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThe Committee’s terms of reference assume the continuation and the further expansion of the academy programme. SEA argues that this is not a sustainable position and 
defaultthat a new settlement is required whic

default.1
default              
defaultThere is now 
defaultample
default evidence 
defaultwhich shows
default that there is no significant difference between the performance of sponsored academies and similar maintained schools –
default 
defaultboth in absolute terms and in 
defaulttheir 
defaultrate of improvement.
default Attempts to argue otherwise, including those by the DfE, are consistently flawed because they do not compare sponsored academies with similar schools. The work of Henry Stewart
default 
default demonstrate
defaults
default this very clearly.
default It has also been demonstrated that improveme

defaultonly t

default.2 
default              
defaultRecent research by 
defaultStephen Machin and Olmo Silva
default 
defaulthas demonstrated
default that academies have not contributed to “closing the gap”, arguing that 
default“
defaultS
defaultchools that converted to academies between 2002 and 2007 improved their overall GCSEs results by further raising the attainments of students in the top half of the ability distributi
defaulton, and in particular pupils in the top 20%. Conversely, we find little evidence that academies helped pupils in the bottom 10% and 20% of the ability distribution. Finally, we find little evidence that late converters (2008 and 2009) had any beneficial ef
defaultfects on pupils of any 
defaultability.”
default3
default.3
default              
defaultIn SEA’s view, one important reason for the failure of the school system to close the gap between the lowest achievers and the rest has been the level of socio-economic segregation that persists in the English school sy
defaultstem. 
defaultThere has never been a genuinely level playing field for schools in England. Subtle (or not so subtle) variations 
defaultin governance, admissions policies
default, specialism
defaults
default, religious affiliation etc. have helped to create a local pecking order of schools.  The
default advent of academies and free schools has made this situation worse. Too many schools manipulate their admissions to gain a more favoured intake to the advantage of “sharp-elbowed” parents who know how to work the system. The scale of this problem has just
default been confirmed by the research of Stephen Gorand at Durham University
default who concluded that:
default“any differentiated type of school - including faith-based, foundation, and fee-paying - tends to be linked to higher local levels of segregation. On the other hand, maintained, non-selective, 'bog-standard' schools are strongly and unambiguously linked to
default both lower segregation and a further decline in segregation of all types over time. If you want less segregation, do not have 
defaultdifferent types of school”
default.
default3
default.4
default              
defaultWe know that a key issue for English schools is the tail of underachievement
default.
default In 2012 OECD 
defaultidenti
defaultfied a number of system level issues that contribute to this kind of underachievement. Of particular relevance here are the recommendations to “a
defaultvoid early tracking (i.e selection, setting and streaming) and defer student selection to upper secondary” 
defaultand 
defaultto 
default“manage school choice to avoid segregation and increased inequities”. 
defaultAlthough in theory there is equal access to schools for all, in practice we are seeing more selection and social segregation in the English school system. In OECD’s view this will lea
defaultd to lower levels of achievement in the system as a whole.

defaultEstablishing Academy and Free Schoolsdefault&#xa0;default4
default.1
default              
defaultSEA argues that the
default process of establishing academies
default and free 
defaultschools has
default been 
defaultcharacterised by a very serious democratic deficit
default, 
defaultby a substantial 
defaultwaste of public money
default and by entirely unproductive levels of conflict within local communities
default. 
default4default.2default              defaultThe Democratic DeficitdefaultOpportunities for local communities to have any meaningful say in how schools are planned and run have been substantially and unacce
defaultptably reduced. Decisions on opening, closing and changing the nature of schools are now taken largely by central government
default.
default It is sometimes forgotten that education is of concern to the whole of society and is not just a matter for those directly involve

defaultThe process is often secretive and is open to the charge of cronyism. It seems to be geared primarily to meeting political targets – i

defaulte
default.
default the number of academy conversions and the number of free schools regardless of quality. It is very clear that some 
defaultpromoters/ sponsors of schools have been inadequate and driven by inappropriate ideological or commercial considerations.
defaultThe proposals of particular interest groups (often a minority group) are 
defaultoften 
defaultaccepted regardless of their effect on others – as long
default as they are politically acceptable
default. defaultThe presumption is that market forces will decide which schools succeed and which do not. 
defaultHowever it is not possible to run an education system as a market defaultwithout having a damaging impact on some schools and pupils. Th
defaultis is why school systems need to be planned through a democratic process in which all views can be heard.
defaultThere is also a growing democratic deficit within schools. In many academy chains, schools are subject to the central management of the chain in ways
default that would be entirely unacceptable in local authority schools. They are not always 
defaultpermitted
default to have their own governing body and consequently the role of 
defaultparents
default 
defaultand
default local communities
default in governance is significantly diminished. This downgrading of the place of parent governors can be found in other academies and free schools.
default4default.3default              defaultWastedefaultThe most obvious example of wasting resources is the opening of free schools where there is already a
default surplus of places. At a time when there is a growing shortage of primary places in parts of the country, this is inexcusable.
defaultThe Public Accounts Committee has clearly documented the waste of public money by the Academies programme amounting to about £1 billion. A significant part of this was in effect bribes to schools to convert. It also arose from the creation of duplicate man
defaultagement systems – for example much of the funding work of the EFA could be done by local authorities at little extra cost. There have 
defaultalso
default been notorious examples of inappropriate extravagance by some academy chains and indeed by some individual schools wh
defaultere there is no longer any real oversight in place.
default&#xa0;
default4default.4default              defaultConflictdefaultArguments over school status have distracted schools, parents and teachers in many areas from their core business. Relationships have been damaged and time and energy has been wasted in unpr
defaultoductive arguments, leading in some cases to industrial action. At times it can feel that such conflict is welcomed by government because it enables it to denigrate those who disagree – the “enemies of progress” argument. The deliberate provoking of confli
defaultct across the country seems however an 
defaultin
defaultappropriate way for a government to carry on.
default&#xa0;
default5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIntervention by the Secretary of Statedefault5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe secretary of state is now directly responsible for the performance of about three thousand academies and free schools across 
defaultthe country. This includes responsibility for not just their academic performance but their financial probity, a range of issues relating to individual pupils and families and their adherence to a wide range of regulations. 
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll this is widely accepted as 
defaultunsustainable in both practical terms and in terms of the unacceptable centralisation of power in a single person’s hands. It means that there is no way for the voice of parents and local communities to be heard – as can be seen in the way opposition to fo
defaultrced academisation and to particular sponsors has been consistently ignored
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is now the situation that many schools are effectively accountable to no one but themselves. They are formally accountable to the Secretary of State but it is clear that the DfE
default does not have the capacity to identify issues at an early stage – this takes local knowledge drawn not just from data but from regular contact with local communities and agencies. Nor is it in a position to provide what David Wolfe 
defaultQC 
defaultdescribes as “
defaulta more
default subtle and supportive regime of external intervention to encourage school improvement.
default” 
defaultOfsted and the DfE can only offer intervention of a very crude and high level kind
default as has been demonstrated by the recent issue of warning notices to failing academie
defaults. These show no capacity to engage with schools at any detailed level nor any desire to understand their issues in detail. DfE intervention seems to be confined 
defaultto a threat to enforce a change of governance and/ or sponsor. 
default 
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe recent proposals by the S
defaultecretary of State to establish 8 regional 
defaultcommissioners
default to be responsible for monitoring academies and free schools will be in no way adequate. With an average of 400 schools each (a figure that is presumably expected to rise
default they
default will be no more effective than the DfE is now. 
defaultIt seems 
defaultremarkable, at this time of
default financial stringency, to establish a whole parallel bureaucracy working only with some schools.
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the ground, t
defaulthe provision of support for school improvement has been ser
defaultiously undermined in recent years. Partly this has been a result of cuts in funding. But it has also been based on a belief that schools can and should manage their own improvement, if necessary in collaboration with other schools. 
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no doubt that 
defaultteachers can and do learn a lot from one another. But it is not realistic to expect schools to keep up with both 
defaultall 
defaultcurrent research and debate and with best practice across the country. There is therefore a need for people and institutions that are in a 
defaultposition to take a broad view based on research and experience of a wide range of schools. This could traditionally be found in local authority services and in higher education. Both of these are now under sustained attack.
default5.7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also clear that school to 
defaultschool initiatives are patchy. The RSA Academies Commission found that many outstanding schools are not making the contribution to school improvement that is expected of them. 
defaultThe distribution of teaching schools is also patchy with no certainty that a sc
defaulthool in need of support 
defaultcan
default access it.

defaultThe Middle Tierdefault6
default.1
default              
defaultWe would argue that 
defaultmanaging 
defaultthe establishment and monitoring of 
defaultall schools
default requires a democratically accountable local tier of governance. This needs to be responsible not for running schools b
defaultut for the key functions of planning, commissioning and monitoring. None of these are now being done effectively by central government. Privatising these functions to unaccountable chains and sponsors
default has been shown to be 
defaultinimical to the concept of public 
defaultservice
default and open to abuse
default. The purpose of this
default middle tier should be to take functions away from Whitehall and exercise them at a local level
default and
default not
default to reduce
default levels of school autonomy that have been in place now for many years.
default6
default.2
default 
default              
defaultThe key purpose of a 
defaultdemocratically accountable middle tier is to provide broad educational leadership across an area. It should champion the interests of children and families and should ensure that the vested interests of schools do not obstruct the delivery of an educationa
defaultl entitlement for all children and young people.

default.3
default              
defaultAcademy chains cannot themselves 
defaultbe
default a middle tier authority. They cover only a minority of schools, range from just a couple of schools to well over 50, have no geographical un
defaultity and are wholly unaccountable to either parents or voters.
default We would argue that 
defaultall schools should bedefault independent legal entitiesdefault (defaultwhich is not the case for sponsored academiesdefault)default and 
defaultthat 
defaultall 
defaultschools should be free to identify external support from any app
defaultropriate source
default. A
defaultn academy chain could
default 
defaultthen
default be one of these options. But we doubt that chains working with only a very small number of schools actually have much to offer.
default7default              defaultAlternatives to Sponsored Academy Statusdefault7
default.1
default              
defaultA
defaults at 
defaultpresent 44% of secondary and 
default46% of primary sponsored academies are either inadequate or require improvement, it is difficult to maintain the view that sponsored academy status is a uniquely effective route to improvement. There have clearly been successful sponsored academies but to 
defaultargue purely by anecdote is not enough.
default7
default.2
default              
defaultSEA would argue that the most effective path to school improvement is through the support of 
defaultsuccessful
default local schools that are facing similar challenges. We would also argue that the engagement of an experienced 
defaultadviser with both the time and the ability to work with the school in depth can make an important contribution. This is the message of the London and City Challenges which had a huge effect on standards in important parts of the country. 
defaultIt was also the me
defaultssage of the Select Committee’s recent report on school partnerships.
default We suggest that there is much in that report which is relevant to this inquiry as well.
default7
default.3.
default              
defaultThere are also examples of tighter school partnerships and federations which have been effect
defaultive in raising standards. W
defaulte are not opposed to external partners making a contribution to school improvement
default either with individual schools or with partnerships. 
default 
defaultBut we do not think that schools and their local communities are best served by being requir
defaulted to adopt the status of sponsored academy, with the loss of
default democracy
default and autonomy that this involves.
default8default              defaultFragmentation default8
default.1
default              
defaultWe would also ask the select committee to consider how the English school system is being fragmented in a number of damaging ways.
default 
defaultA significant proportion 
defaultof schools are now governed by funding agreements with the secretary of state. The exact arrangements vary and are “
defaultbased on the particular circumstances and political climate at the time and the reasons for the school’s creation”
default. 
defaultThe consequence is that anyone seeking to raise an issue with a school (e.g.  admission appeals, SEN places, exclusions etc.) needs to identify exactly what provisions apply to the school in question. It has become more difficult for parents and childre
defaultn to get issues addressed local
defaultly. They may have to go to the S
defaultecretary of 
defaultS
defaulttate for a decision.
default8
default.2
default              
defaultIn addition local collaborative arrangements between schools are breaking down in many    areas
default. In practice this means that arrangements for the placemen
defaultt and support for disadvantaged and at risk pupils are no longer working properly. It also means that local planning designed to secure a broad 14 to 19 offer across an area is being undermined.
