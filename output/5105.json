[They] need to renounce this occupation mentality. These [prisoners] are heroes, \nfedayyeen\n (self-sacrificing fighters), and fighters … We appreciate the people of the revolution \nand are proud of them.\"\n[Official \nPA TV Live,\n&#xa0;\nNov. 4, 2013]\n&#xa0;\nJust a month after the PA minister made these remarks the EU sent \nmore \nmoney to the PA to pay salaries – including those of terrorists:\n\"Yesterday [Dec. 15, 2013] the European Union donated approximately 11 million euros to pay \nthe November salaries and pensions of approximately 71,000 Palestinian government employees and pensioners in the [West] Bank and the Gaza Strip.\"\n[WAFA, official PA news agency, and \nAl-Hayat Al-Jadida\n, Dec. 6, 2013]\nFrom the EU press release: \n\"For many y\nears, the EU has been the biggest donor and most reliable partner to the Palestinian Authority. Today's contribution to salaries and pensions is further evidence of our unimpeded support for the Palestinian people which will continue in 2014.\" \n[http://eea\ns.europa.eu/delegations/westbank/documents/news/2013/20131205_november_salaries_en.pdf]\n&#xa0;\nThe Western donor countries’ choice to ignore the \nfact that the PA \nis spending over \n$\n100 \nmillion \ndollars \na year in \npayments to terrorists \nfrom the money \nthey donate \nto\n \nthe PA \nfor development \nenables \nthe PA to continue its policy of rewarding terrorists and murderers without having to worry about the source of income to cover these expenses.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Conclusions:The PA makes four payments to terrorist prisoners and released prisoners, which reached in 2013 to over $100 million dollars. &#xa0;Countries which donate money to the PA’s general budget or to the salaries budget are directly making payments to terrorists.&#xa0;Countries which earmark their donations for specific projects are freeing up money elsewhere with which the PA pays terrorist salaries.&#xa0;(\nSee more details\n \nwith additional \nsources in \n4 reports on PA terrorist salaries\n.\n)\n&#xa0;\nAdditional RemarksPMW’s reason for submitting evidence:PMW believes that peace education is a critical component for achieving peace. By providing salaries and other financial rewards to terrorists, the PA is educating its people to glorify violence and terror against Israeli civilians and to see murderers as \nrole models. Financially rewarding murderers of civilians constitutes an overwhelming impediment to peace. \n&#xa0;\nPMW’s recommendations to the UK GovernmentThe UK and other international donors have the power to influence the PA to put an end to the glorification and payment of financial rewards to terrorists. Donor countries have the power to bring about this change, were they to \nlink\n their funding upon the \nelimination of terror glorification \nby the PA, \nits rewarding terrorists and turning them into role models for youth. \n&#xa0;\nA more \nconservative approach to eliminate terror glorification \nwould deduct from \nthe PA’s \nfunding, the amount that \nthe \nPA was spending on\n payments to terrorist\ns, until they stopped terrorists salaries and terror glorification.\n&#xa0;\nBrief description of PMW:PMW fills a unique role internationally by monitoring, translating, and preparing in-depth reports about Palestinian society, leadership an\nd activities, and bringing the findings directly to decision makers around the world. PMW’s goal is to research PA society and expose fundamental impediments to peace actively generated by the PA, so that those impediments can be eliminated. PMW monitors o\nfficial PA daily newspapers, official PA TV, PA schoolbooks, sports and cultural activities, PA leaders’ statements and activities, children’s songs and dance, formal and informal education, children’s TV programs and music videos. By doing so PMW is able \nto report key indicators of PA intentions and ideology, and uncover impediments to peace which are found in many PA government-controlled structures. \n&#xa0;\nPhone: 972-2-625-4140 • \npmw\n@palwatch.org • www.palwatch.org • Jerusalem, Israel\n"
