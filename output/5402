[normal]Written evidence submitted by Dame Anne Begg MP,[bold]Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee (FTF 10)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Thank you for your letter of 16 December seeking views on the impact on the work of select committees of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In my view, the key benefit for select committees is the ability to plan our programme 
[normal]of work 
[normal]with greater certainty. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Under the previous arrangements, by this stage of a 
[normal]P
[normal]arliament there would have been considerable uncertainty about whether there would be 
[normal]sufficient 
[normal]time to conclude and report on an inquiry which had just been started
[normal],
[normal] before a dissolution was announced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a result of the new system,
[normal] when my Committee met to consider its programme 
[normal]earlier this month
[normal], we c
[normal]ould
[normal] be sure that 
[normal]the
[normal] new inquiries we 
[normal]agreed to undertake 
[normal] 
[normal]would be able to
[normal] run their planned course and 
[normal]w
[normal]ould
[normal] 
[normal]not have to be rushed to a conclusion. 
[normal]This meant that we could plan inquiries up to the end of this year. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The certainty of a full five
[normal]-
[normal]year 
[normal]P
[normal]arliament also allows select committees 
[normal]the time 
[normal]to cover the span of their remit more effectively
[normal] within a parliamentary term
[normal]. This is particularly important for a committee like mine which has seen major reform 
[normal]since 2010 
[normal]across all
[normal] of
[normal] the policy areas it covers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this 
[normal]input 
[normal]is helpful to your 
[normal]C
[normal]ommitteeâ€™s inquiry.
