"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dame Anne Begg MP,Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee (FTF 10)&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 16 December seeking views on the impact on the work of select committees of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011.\n&#xa0;\nIn my view, the key benefit for select committees is the ability to plan our programme \nof work \nwith greater certainty. \n&#xa0;\nUnder the previous arrangements, by this stage of a \nP\narliament there would have been considerable uncertainty about whether there would be \nsufficient \ntime to conclude and report on an inquiry which had just been started\n,\n before a dissolution was announced.\n&#xa0;\nAs a result of the new system,\n when my Committee met to consider its programme \nearlier this month\n, we c\nould\n be sure that \nthe\n new inquiries we \nagreed to undertake \n \nwould be able to\n run their planned course and \nw\nould\n \nnot have to be rushed to a conclusion. \nThis meant that we could plan inquiries up to the end of this year. \n&#xa0;\nThe certainty of a full five\n-\nyear \nP\narliament also allows select committees \nthe time \nto cover the span of their remit more effectively\n within a parliamentary term\n. This is particularly important for a committee like mine which has seen major reform \nsince 2010 \nacross all\n of\n the policy areas it covers. \n&#xa0;\nI hope this \ninput \nis helpful to your \nC\nommitteeâ€™s inquiry. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n21 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
