[normal]Background[bold]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lincolnshire precautionary salts 3008 km out of 8960km.  34%
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Has a
[normal] defined network of footways that are treated – when resources are available.
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cycle tracks are not 
[normal]routinely 
[normal]treated
[normal] except as part of our severe weather response.
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite significant reduction in overall highways budgets the winter service has been protec
[normal]ted 
[normal]as well as
[normal] increased to take account of inflationary pressures
[normal].  
[normal]The 
[normal]w
[normal]inter s
[normal]ervice
[normal] is
[normal] financed for 85 turnouts and 2 snow days which this winter 
[normal]results in
[normal] a budget of
[normal] £
[normal]4.65
[normal]m
[normal] with a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]Adverse Weather 
[normal]Reserve Fund
[normal] of £1m
[normal].
[normal]  For
[normal] the 
[normal]winter
[normal] of 2012/2013 the budget 
[normal]was 
[normal]set 
[normal]at
[normal] £
[normal]4.57m with a final outturn of
[normal] £6.53m
[normal] which has been fully funded by the county council out of 
[normal]financial 
[normal]reserves.

[normal]Resilience[bold]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lincolnshire, like most authorities, is prepared for and copes with severe winter weather as d
[normal]emonstrated during the winter of 2012/2013.  However an extreme winter event on the scale of 1963
[normal],
[normal] with its prolonged low temperatures and heavy snowfall
[normal],
[normal] would 
[normal]cause massive disruption especially to food distribution 
[normal]especially 
[normal]due
[normal] to "just in time" stock
[normal] distribution.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lincolnsh
[normal]ire continues to be heavily inv
[normal]olved in nationally implementing the 
[normal]Quarmby
[normal] Review by its chairmanship of the 
[normal]National Winter Service Research Group (
[normal]NWSRG
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Following recommendations contained within the 
[normal]Quarmby
[normal] Review the 
[normal]NWSRG ha
[normal]s become a sub group of the 
[normal]UK Roads Board (
[normal]UKR
[normal]B)
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through its chairmanship of the NWSRG Lincolnshire has instigate
[normal]d
[normal] a fundamental review of
[normal] national
[normal] highway winter
[normal] maintenance practices which
[normal] has resulted in 
[normal]the 
[normal]implementation of 
[normal]a 
[normal]completely new national 
[normal]code.  Appendix H, the Winter Code, of Well Maintained Highways was issued on the 
[normal]18th
[normal] 
[normal]September 2013
[normal] as announced by
[normal] Norman Baker the 
[normal]Parliamentary 
[normal]Under
[normal] Secretary of State for Transport
[normal].

[normal]Lincolnshire review
[normal]s
[normal] its winter maintenance plan annually and take
[normal]s
[normal] into ac
[normal]count 
[normal]changes to 
[normal]national good practice and continues to 
[normal]explore
[normal] alternative
[normal] de-icing products and processes.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What lessons have been learned since the winter of 2009-[bold]2010?[bold]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A major learning point has been a realisation by the public and industry 
[normal]al
[normal]ike 
[normal]that l
[normal]ocal 
[normal]highway 
[normal]authorities cannot do everything on their own in time
[normal]s
[normal] of severe winter weather and 
[normal]that 
[normal]they need community help.  
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lincolnshire has engaged with all tiers of local government from District Authorities, Parish Councils and Community Groups.  
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All these groups have been encouraged to engage with Lincolnshire County Council on mutual aid and self-help arrangements
[normal], althou
[normal]gh there has only been a 25% take up by Parish Councils to this process
[normal].
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Public engagement has been encouraged especially on snow clearance of carriageways and footways following clarity on the legal situation contained within the 
[normal]Quarmby
[normal] Review.
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Mutual ai
[normal]d arrangements are also in place with all the main hospitals in the county including accident and emergency centres.
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Public expectations would 
[normal]also 
[normal]appear to 
[normal]be becoming more realistic during severe 
[normal]winter 
[normal]weather events.
[normal]  This 
[normal]has been helped by
[normal] a more re
[normal]alistic and pro-active response from both local and national radio and TV.
[normal] 
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Like many authorities Lincolnshire has engaged with 
[normal]the 
[normal]travelling public by the use of 
[normal]Gritter
[normal] 
[normal]Twitter 
[normal]as the main way of disseminating overnight operations and issues.
[normal]4)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How well [bold]prepared[bold]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lincolnshire through its external 
[normal]partners has
[normal] 
[normal]placed
[normal] 
[normal]29 new replacement 
[normal]gritters
[normal] into the fleet over the last two years. 
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lincolnshire has increased its salt stock holdings at the start of winter season from 23,000 tonnes to 35,000 tonnes.
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This e
[normal]quates to 87
[normal] runs
[normal] at 20gms dry (400 tonnes) which is the maximum treatment for snow or 175 runs at 15gms pre-wet (200 tonnes) the average for precautionary salting.
[normal] 
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It also aims to keep a minimum stock holding of 10,000 tonnes at any one time during the w
[normal]inter.
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]25% of the county 
[normal]is 
[normal]now 
[normal]precautionary
[normal] salted utilising Agricultural Bi Products (ABP's) in the pre-wetting process – a UK first.
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many changes have taken place over the last few years but further changes are required but unfortunately these are 
[normal]outwith
[normal] the powers of local authorities to implement such as :
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Derogation of certain rules and regulations so that winter gritting can take place more effectively.  This would include the relaxation of 
[normal]drivers
[normal] hours regulations by making winter gritting an
[normal]d emergency activity.
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Derogation of 28 tonne vehicles for winter activities which would increase the number of haulage and construction vehicles that coul
[normal]d be utilised in severe weather
[normal] with slot in spreaders.
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Continue with the practice of allowing dedicat
[normal]ed winter maintenance vehicles to use rebated fuel (Red Diesel) for winter operations.
