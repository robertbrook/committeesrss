"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Mencap (GMC0006)&#xa0;About MencapWe support the 1.5 million people with a learning disability in the UK and their families and carers. We fight to change laws and improve services and access to education, employment and leisure facilities, supporting thousands of people with a learning disability to live their lives the way they want. See \nwww.mencap.org.uk \nfor more information. \n&#xa0;\nWe are also one of the largest providers of services, information and advice for people with a learning disability across England, Northern Ireland and \nWales.\n&#xa0;\nAbout learning disabilityA learning disability is caused by the way the brain develops before, during or shortly after birth. It is always lifelong and affects someone's intellectual and social development. It used to be called mental handicap but this term is outdated and offensive. Learning disability is not a mental illness. The term learning difficulty is often incorrectly used interchangeably with learning disability.\n&#xa0;\n              \nExecutive summary&#xa0;\nMencap believes that the GMC’s fitness to practice procedure needs reform if it is to protect patients with a learning disability, particularly as so few cases are heard on the performance of doctors in this area. To date, only one individual doctor has been sanctioned as a result of the care they have delivered to someone with a learning disability, despite several other cases having been referred to the GMC by Mencap. \n&#xa0;\nMencap’s\n ‘\nDeath by Indifference\n’ report, and the subsequent \n’74 deaths and counting’\n, highlighted the tragic and avoidable deaths of people with a learning disability and alleged that the NHS was institutionally discriminating against people with a learning disability, because it did not equally value their lives.  Despite increased awareness of the issues, the implementation of the recommendations made by ‘Healthcare for all’ and ‘Six Lives’ people with a learning disability are still dying prematurely and avoidably in the NHS.\n&#xa0;\nIt is \nMencap’s\n belief that this is in part due to the fact that some doctors continue to make discriminatory assumptions about their quality of life, do not deliver reasonably adjusted healthcare as required by the Equality Act, and do not act in line with the Mental Capacity Act.\n&#xa0;\nIn submitting this evidence, we have considered how poor practice of this kind can be addressed.\n&#xa0;\nMencap also wishes to praise and support the work that the GMC has done to promote the needs and rights of patients with a learning disability via the excellent website resource and the publication of easy-read materials for patients. This is an invaluable resource for the many hundreds of thousands of people with a learning disability who \nwould otherwise be unable to access that information. We hope that the GMC continues to update and publish these materials in the future. \n&#xa0;Detailed comments:&#xa0;Mencap’s experience of the GMC Fitness to Practice processTo date Mencap are aware of a small number of cases, including two from our original report, \nDeath By Indifference\n, two from our subsequent report, \n74 Deaths and Counting\n, and a small number of other cases that have been referred to the GMC. To date only one individual doctor has been sanctioned as a result of the care they have delivered to a person with a learning disability.  \n&#xa0;\nMencap believes this is because the fitness to practice procedure may not be conversant with the particular issues arising for people with learning disabilities. It also may not be sufficiently robust about the need for doctors to act in line with relevant disability legislation, including the Equality Act and the Mental Capacity Act.  Finally there is not enough joined up, proactive work between the GMC and other regulators, including the CQC and the ombudsman in response to the failures that they have identified which include poor practice by doctors.\n&#xa0;\nKirsty Jayne Pearce died on 29\nth\n August 2003, aged 17. Despite the coroner’s verdict and the findings of the healthcare ombudsman, the GMC refused to convene a fitness to practice panel.\n&#xa0;\nDuring the inquest into her death, the coroner highlighted a “failure to recognise the seriousness of [\nKirsty’s\n] condition which led to a delay in transferring her to an appropriate ICU or HDU unit… an absence of monitoring vital medical information”, and that the “nursing and medical notes were scant”. The coroner concluded by stating that “the delay in getting the sort of treatment that was required from the outset contributed to her death”. \n&#xa0;\nIn 2006, the Health Service Ombudsman investigated and then supported the complaint \nKirsty’s\n father, Chas. The Ombudsman stated: \n&#xa0;\n“The clinical advice I have received is very clear. There were significant failings in the care provided to Kirsty… Monitoring of her condition was inadequate; there was a failure to recognise the seriousness of her condition; and there were delays in seeking and obtaining reviews by senior doctors”.  \n&#xa0;\nIn 2008, the GMC decided to refer the allegations about the Registrar in question to a fitness to practice panel. However, before the case was due to be heard, \nKirsty’s\n father received a letter informing them that the hearing had been cancelled, including: \n&#xa0;\n“Although the Registrars conduct fell short of what was expected of him and could be characterised as negligent Dr \nOades\n is not prepared to characterise that negligence as sufficiently grave to justify a charge of misconduct”\n&#xa0;\nKirsty’s\n father appealed to the GMC and was informed that he case may be re-opened should new evidence come to light. With \nMencap’s\n help, in 2011, \nKirsty’s\n father asked the GMC to re-open their case. The GMC responded by stating that “The GMC \nis unable to re-open \nKirsty’s\n case because legislation as laid down in Parliament does not allow for it”. \n&#xa0;\nAn in-depth account, written by \nKirsty’s\n father, is included at the end of this submission. \n&#xa0;\nMencap is extremely concerned by the handling of this situation by the GMC. Despite clear evidence of failings, supported by both the coroner and the Health Service Ombudsman, the GMC refused to allow a fitness to practice hearing to take place.  The results of cases such as this and others that Mencap has brought to the GMC give rise to a number of concerns: \n&#xa0;\nThe GMC Fitness to Practice team appears to not have a full understanding of the specific risks to patients with a learning disability. The fitness to practice procedure may lack learning disability expertise when cases are examined. Mencap believes that those who conduct investigations on behalf of the GMC may not understand the full range of health inequalities that people with a learning disability experience.  As a result they may not be alert to these when conducting an investigation.\n&#xa0;\nMencap believes that investigators should receive basic grounding in issues such as:\n&#xa0;\nWithout this understanding, those running fitness to practice may not be sufficiently informed to make the right decisions in cases involving people with a learning disability\n&#xa0;\nPeople with a learning disability are still dyingPeople with a learning disability are still dying prematurely and are 58 times more likely to die before their 50\nth\n birthday than the rest of the population.  Yet despite high profile deaths and education projects from charities and professional bodies, many doctors are still not delivering quality, safe healthcare (based on a respect for the individual) to this group. \n&#xa0;Discriminatory attitudes are being compounded by a lack of understanding as to how doctors should adjust and tailor the care they deliver, to meet the specific health needs of people with a learning disability and uphold the law.\n&#xa0;\nIn June 2010, Mencap surveyed over 1,000 doctors and nurses.  This revealed that almost half of doctors (46%) believed that people with a learning disability received a poorer standard of healthcare than the rest of the population, while nearly four out of ten doctors (39%) said that this group were discriminated against in the NHS.  \n&#xa0;\nTina died of pneumonia in January 2009. This was after her parents sought help from her GP, Dr I, several times. \n&#xa0;\nDr I wrote a prescription for Tina prior to carrying out any patient assessment and, therefore, failed to adequately assess Tina. Dr I also failed to keep accurate medical records relating to Tina’s case. When asked, Dr I refused to refer her for physiotherapy. When Tina’s condition began deteriorating, Dr I refused to visit and assess her. \n&#xa0;\nOn November 2012, after the case was re-opened by the GMC, some three and a half years after Tina died, the case examiners concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support any of the allegations and no realistic prospect of establishing that Dr I’s fitness to practice is impaired to a degree justifying action against his registration. Nor was a warning warranted. The case was closed with advice.  \n&#xa0;\nMencap welcomed that the GMC  were prepared to review and reopen this case. However, the final decision is extremely disappointing. Had the case been examined at the time of the incident, Mencap wonders whether more supporting evidence could have been gathered. \n&#xa0;\nMost recently the ‘Confidential Inquiry into the premature Deaths of people with learning disabilities’ reported that 37% of the deaths in the location of the study may have been avoided had they received the right health care. Contributory factors included the failure and delay of diagnosis and delays in commencing appropriate treatment, the inappropriate use of DNAR orders and the failure to make reasonable adjustments. The findings indicate that every year 1200 children and adults with a learning disability die in circumstances that could have been avoided\n&#xa0;\nThe GMC Getting fitness to practice process has a crucial part to play in improving the care and treatment of people with a learning disability across the NHS.\n&#xa0;\nWhen Anne was admitted into hospital, a DNR form was completed by Dr S on the grounds of co-morbidities and futility, but was not communicated for her family. A decision not to return Anne to the ICU, on the basis that it was not in her best interest, was also made before discussing this with her family and without holding a best interest meeting. \n&#xa0;\nAnne died of pneumonia shortly after. \n&#xa0;\nDr S and the medical staff failed to advise Anne’s family that, as they did not agree with the DNR or the decision not to treat Anne in the ICU, they could escalate the decision to the court of protection. \n&#xa0;\nWith the help of Mencap, the case was brought to the GMC. In December 2012, almost thirty months after Anne died, the case examiners concluded: \n&#xa0;\n“\nThis is a serious failing to follow law and guidance that has been in place for several years… However it seems exceedingly unlikely that the failing changed the outcome of this case… The failing is not so serious as to meet the realistic prospect test and a warning would be disproportionate”. \n&#xa0;\nThe fact that the GMC case examiners agreed that this was a serious breach of the law, but failed to take any action, leaves Mencap concerned and confused as to the purpose of fitness to practice hearings.\n&#xa0;\nThe GMC do not appear to be investigating Doctors who deliver poor care to people with a learning disability effectively.Mencap’s\n report identified that for people with a learning disability, their families and carers the NHS complaints process was slow, bureaucratic, defensive and failed to learn from mistakes. The families that Mencap have  supported  through the fitness to practice system have experienced similar issues. They conclude that the process is heavily weighed against them and they have little confidence in the outcome. Sadly this has been \nborn\n out by the failure of all but one of these cases to date to sanction a doctor in any way.\n&#xa0;\nHowever it is clear to Mencap that the GMC does recognise its important role in developing practice from a training perspective. The policy team at the GMC embarked on a programme of work designed to educate doctors around reasonable adjustments for patients with a learning disability and Mencap are very grateful for all this team’s work. \n&#xa0;\nUnfortunately, the GMC’s Fitness to Practice work does not seem to be tackling the protection of patients with a learning disability from poorly performing doctors with equivalent insight. It is our firm belief that unless individual health professional are held to account for their actions, poor practice will persist. For families, this compounds the tragic loss of a loved one and is a powerful symbol of the perceived overriding value placed on professional expertise over the rights of patients with a learning disability and their families. \n&#xa0;\nA recent example of this is Patient D, who died of kidney failure on 4\nth\n November 2011. Dr B did not listen to any of the concerns reported to him and did not carry out appropriate investigations or refer patient D, the consequence of which was an emergency admission. \n&#xa0;\nAfter completing the case, the expert advisor criticised the doctor for not taking a history of vomiting, not examining patient D, not investigating the further possibility of a fluctuating pattern of raised blood pressure, not considering the use of ABPM and not considering that such a pattern could have a serious underlying cause. \n&#xa0;\n“\nWhile Dr B’s standard of care fell below, but not seriously below, that expected… the case examiners do not believe the realistic prospect testis met on an evidential basis”\n&#xa0;\nUnacceptable delays in deciding whether to proceed with a hearingAfter a bereavement (or serious incident) families want answers and an understanding as to why their loved one died.  They want to understand how it happened and if anyone was negligent.  Bereaved families want poorly performing healthcare professionals to be held responsible for their actions and to learn from past mistakes.\n&#xa0;\nOne of the original cases highlighted by Mencap was that of Martin Ryan, a 43-year old, with severe learning disabilities, who suffered a stroke in November 2005.  Martin was admitted to Kingston Hospital, but staff said they found it difficult to communicate with Martin and his family and assess his condition.\n&#xa0;\nIt took two weeks post admission before a decision was made to insert a feeding tube but before surgery could be undertaken, Martin developed pneumonia and died in December 2005, having gone 26 days without receiving nutrition. The ombudsman conducted a detailed investigation and found service failure in regard to all the issues of complaint. This was published as part of the Six Lives report in 2009. In her report, the ombudsman criticised the consultant responsible for Martin’s care.\n&#xa0;\nIn May 2010, Mrs Ryan wrote to complain to the GMC about the care offered to Martin by the consultant.  It took a further year for the GMC to come back and say that this would be not investigated further.\n Mencap believes such a long delay is unacceptable and that any fitness to practice procedure that leaves families waiting this long for answers must be reformed, if patient safety is to be assured.\n&#xa0;Confusing rationale in deciding whether to proceed with casesIn Martin’s case, the individual consultant did not follow established protocol for stroke victims and those with difficulty swallowing. The ombudsman concluded that he was treated less favourably for reasons related to the fact that he had a learning disability. In effect, he was discriminated against. However, the GMC correspondence to Mrs Ryan outlining the decision not to investigate stated that:\n&#xa0;\n“whilst the standard of supervision of care provided by the doctor could have been better, it was severely compromised by systemic failures within the ward and the Trust due to a failure to adopt recommended guidelines”\n&#xa0;\nThis decision again, left Mencap very unclear regarding the rationale for fitness to practice decisions.\n&#xa0;\nA further example is the GMC’s comparative test (about establishing whether the practice was considered to be reasonable in comparison to what other doctors would reasonably have done in similar circumstances). Mencap believes that this offers little protection for the patient with a learning disability.  \nMencap’s\n own polling has shown that many doctors do not know how to reasonably adjust their own clinical practice when dealing with people with a learning disability.  In essence if many doctors do not understand how to reasonably adjust the care they offer to patients with a learning disability, they should not be used as exemplars for judging whether other doctors’ fitness to practice is impaired.\n&#xa0;\nIndividual vs corporate responsibilityMuch of \nMencap’s\n Death by Indifference campaign has centred on supporting families through the NHS complaints process, in an effort to understand why a loved one has died.  The complaints usually include the poor performance of an individual doctor.  \n&#xa0;\nWhen a Trust responds to a complaint the responsibility for poor practice is often ascribed to a unit, rather than to individuals.  Such responses are often accompanied \nby an action plan promising future changes to the way in which care is delivered.  Despite this families very rarely feel that units or individuals learn through this or put in place meaningful changes that would stop a similar death occurring again.\n&#xa0;\nA recent case involved a 60 year old man, admitted to hospital with a blocked bowel.   A few years previously the man had hip surgery and suffered a cardiac arrest during the operation.  \n&#xa0;\nWhen admitted for the bowel complaint, a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Notice was put on the patient’s notes, apparently with the justification that \nhad surgery been necessary for the bowel, the patient \nmay not have survived.  The DNR decision was taken before the need for surgery had even been proven and without discussions with relatives.  Mencap staff who queried this were told this was a Ward standard policy.\n&#xa0;\nWhile this case has not come before the GMC, and is subject to the local complaints process, it illustrates the extent to which it can be easy to not hold individual Doctors to account through spreading blame for poor practice across a team/unit. Where systemic failures have been identified, this does not excuse the failures of individual professionals and it our belief that they should be held to account for their actions.\n&#xa0;What Mencap wants to see&#xa0;Mencap sees fitness to practice as inextricably linked with efforts to improve revalidation and training.  Mencap has previously welcomed the GMC’s work in training and believes that it can help doctors deliver better, more tailored care to patients with a learning disability.  Mencap wants Doctors to value the lives of people with a learning disability, but if they fail to do this, they must be held accountable if their performance is lacking.  Without changes to fitness to practice this will not be possible.\n&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the GMC to agree to look at a sample of cases held by Mencap  and examine the issues that the fitness to practice team need to be alert \nto when examining future cases.  It is interesting to compare the GMC with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and their respective fitness to practice work.  Mencap has been very pleased that Nursing and Midwifery Council recently agreed to review some of the cases held by Mencap to see if there are actions that the NMC can take in relation to these. Mencap would welcome a similar initiative from the GMC.\nb)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMencap would like the GMC to commit to review the cases of the deaths of people with learning disabilities that they have investigated so far. We would not ask them to reopen cases but to identify the key themes and issue specific advice/guidelines to case examiners and investigators.\nc)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMencap do not agree with the starting position for GMC fitness to practice, namely that it is about current and future fitness to practice.   Mencap believe that given the historical nature of the cases Mencap knows about, and the limited nature of investigations of these by the GMC, an initiative looking at historical cases (as mentioned above) could bring real benefits to the NHS.\nd)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMencap do not want any diminution in the public nature of the hearings.  Many families known to Mencap already believe the fitness to practice system is already about protecting the interests of doctors, rather than the safety of the \npublic.  Mencap believes that any move away from public hearings would only reinforce this view.\ne)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the GMC to use all its channels to state the importance of doctors following the law.  Unless the GMC emphasises that quality medical practice also means adhering to the strictures of the Equality Act, Mental Capacity Act etc (through training, education, revalidation and fitness to practice) then doctors will not adjust their practice and patients with a learning disability will continue to die\nf)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the GMC to emphasise that doctors have a duty to speak out.  It is too easy for poorly performing doctors to hide behind the practice of their team or unit.  If the GMC were to encourage whistle-blowing, in the interests of patient safety, this could more quickly uncover poor practice by doctors and improve overall patient safety.\ng)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the GMC to emphasise that doctors have an explicit duty to tackle discrimination. This should be part of their professional registration, particularly where it impacts on patient safety – a point we will make as part of the ongoing Good Medical Practice Consultation.\nh)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is critical to train those involved in fitness to practice around specific health conditions and how they affect people with a learning disability.  As well as understanding the legal basis for making reasonable adjustments, health issues such diagnostic overshadowing, or how crucial it is to intervene early, when a diagnosis is in doubt also need to be emphasised.  Mencap would be happy to support the GMC on what such training should cover.\ni)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of building public confidence in fitness to practice, data must be collected and released by impairment type.  Mencap would like the GMC to record and release data on how many fitness to practice cases it handles involving this people with a learning disability, in order to ensure that progress can be measured going forward.\nj)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the GMC to work more closely with other regulators.  This would allow patterns of behaviour to be identified from an individual’s poor practice to systemic failings in a unit and for regulatory and registering bodies to take joined up action to protect patient safety\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
