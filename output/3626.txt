&#xa0;Written evidence from A Cordiner (HSR 018)

[[[&#xa0;]]]I ordinarily act in capacity as HS2 delegate for Hyde Heath Village Society, I have not been able to meet with the Society Committee at short notice to seek their approval to this submission and this is therefore a personal submission. I would hope that the Transport Committee understands that at present the Village Society is inundated with Government Consultation response work and we do not have the appropriate amount of time or resources to respond adequately. As a general comment, HS2 and the government are overloading and placing great strain on our Villages personnel as a consequence of their methods of operation. &#xa0;My questions relate to the strategic case for HS2 which our society intend to question in the Final Environmental Statement and if necessary with a petition during the petitioning process. Some or all of my submission will be included in the formal HHVS submission to these committees at a later date. &#xa0;I should also record; I have raised many of these matters with HS2 Ltd, the Secretary of State, the Scrutiny Committee investigation into HS2 and have had little or no response. Given the seriousness of the matters raised I would hope you will take this further in liaising with other Parliamentary Committees before reaching conclusions on this :-&#xa0;Questions â€“ &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
