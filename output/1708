defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDeclaration of interests
default&#xa0;
defaultI am a Consultant Clinical Scientist in Microbiology at North Bristol
default NHS Trust.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy career path is: BSC in Microbiology from University of Bristol 1977, PhD in Medical Microbiology University of London 1981, Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists (by examination) in 1987, Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists in 199
default7.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy role as a Consultant Clinical Scientist is very similar to that of my medically trained colleagues in providing
default clinical advic
defaulte on the diagnosis, treatment and management of patients in Primary and Secondary
default care and 
defaultliaison bet
defaultween the Microbiology 
defaultlaboratory and clinicians.  There was no training programme at the time of my training so I have
default recently 
defaultbeen closely involved with the Royal College of Pathologists and with colleagues have developed a Higher Specialist Training curriculum and programme 
defaultto enable more scientists to achieve this especially as medically trained microbiologists training and roles become more clinically ‘hands-on’.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe that the Clinical Scientist role is an excellent career path for women in Microbiology and it is very 
defaultimportant that training posts 
defaultare financially supported by the Department of Health.
default&#xa0;
defaultI think the skills a
defaultcquired by wo
defaultmen in this training such as high level expert knowledge of clinical microbiology, clinical liaison with all grades of staff and also incl
defaultuding patients and carers, and health service management would transfer very well to other employment sectors so retention of highly trained and skilled women in academic or health service careers is paramount. To do this I believe more support is needed a
defaultt all levels by employers and at Government level to provide continuing management training and allowing continuing career-long knowledge and skills acquisition in non training senior and Consultant level roles
default 
defaultto ensure 
defaultwomen
default can compete with men for the 
defaulthighest level roles. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt may be there is currently a lack of knowledge in Science graduates and PhD students of the reality of a career in the health service and it would be helpful for Government to encourage and provide support for links with 
defaultthe Health
default Service and 
defaultUniversities to  
defaultprovide internships or run-through training to encourage retention of women graduates or PhD students in STEM careers.
