Written evidence from PHSO Pressure Group [PHSO052][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The first item the Pressure Group wishes to address is the continual reference to the idea that people who complain about the Ombudsman service consist largely of those who have not had an investigation and are thereby aggrieved by this single fact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Let us assure you that this is not the case.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Approximately 50% of our Pressure Group have received some form of investigation from the Ombudsman, yet they are still dissatisfied. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If individuals are dissatisfied 
[normal]following an investigation[bold], then the 
[normal]‘quality’[bold] of those investigations is suspect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The main reason for our dissatisfaction is the systematic manipulation and denial of the facts by PHSO in order to find no case to answer or minimize the case against the public body concerned and their total lack of accountability when their poor decision making is criticised.[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]In 2010 – 2011
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] PHSO found in favour of 1.45% of complainants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In 2011 – 2012 PHSO found in favour of 1.4% of complaints, therefore it is unsurprising that 64% of the public expressed the view that making a complaint would not make a difference. They were right. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is little point using resources to encourage more people to make a complaint when the Ombudsman service is clearly unable to deliver justice and remedy to the vast majority of those who already do. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would like to share some information with the Committee to supplement the answers given by Dame Julie Mellor and provide a more complete picture.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We would appreciate some feedback from the Committee on the points we raise.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Unfortunately, even with the reduced threshold the three point criteria for investigation described by Dame Julie Mellor is likely to fail at point 2, finding ‘evidence of maladministration or service failure.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is because PHSO 
[normal]systematically deny or manipulate the evidence[bold] to find that public bodies have acted ‘reasonably’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Dame Julie Mellor stated that these criteria were based in law, yet when a complainant sent evidence in support of her case provided by a specialist barrister confirming that three legal breaches had occurred the Ombudsman dismissed this evidence as mere ‘subjective opinion’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is difficult to believe that the assessors are able to investigate 8x more cases with no additional resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Many of these cases are extremely complex.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is our strong suspicion that ‘assessments’ are now termed ‘investigations’ in order to meet this target with very little change in the process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is just not good enough. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]‘For most people coming to us, our decision is the last opportunity to get things put right. We have built into our processes several checks and balances to ensure that our decisions are fair and robust. We give serious consideration to any complaints raised by our customers about our decisions and we seek to use the learning from these to improve our performance. In 2011-12 we found that 0.4% of our total decisions needed to be looked at again or required further explanation.’[bold]&#xa0;[bold] (p9 from Resource Account 2011 – 2012 )[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A member of our group telephoned PHSO to confirm the use of ‘external’ reviewers and the response he received indicates the limited value of these ‘independent’ assessors to the general public. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This morning I have called and spoken to PHSO Complaints reception point to try to establish / clarify / confirm the procedure for handling complaints
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]about[bold]&#xa0;[bold]PHSO, and the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]measure of independence asserted to the PASC by JM[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]on Monday 16th (watchable on-line).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We all know that the Ombudsman is not actually accountable by law due to the discretionary powers embedded in the 1967 act. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Only one case has ever been won against the Ombudsman, the remarkable 
[normal]Balchin
[normal] family who fought for over 20 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In relation to her being accountable for her services to Parliament it is difficult to ascertain exactly what ‘Parliament’ is.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The Ombudsman is not accountable to Ministers, MPs, Select Committees or Civil Servants, so in what respect does the Ombudsman account for her services and to whom?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Regardless of Dame Julie Mellor’s assertions, the Pressure Group firmly believe that as a public servant the Ombudsman is accountable to members of the public, who at the end of the day, pay the bill.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold] We will not be satisfied until our genuine concerns have been addressed and resolved.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]19[bold]th[bold] December 2013[bold]&#xa0;
