Written evidence from PHSO Pressure Group [PHSO052]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe first item the Pressure Group wishes to address is the continual reference to the idea that people who complain about the Ombudsman service consist largely of those who have not had an investigation and are thereby aggrieved by this single fact.
default&#xa0;
default Let us assure you that this is not the case.
default&#xa0;
default Approximately 50% of our Pressure Group have received some form of investigation from the Ombudsman, yet they are still dissatisfied. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIf individuals are dissatisfied 
defaultfollowing an investigationdefault, then the 
default‘quality’default of those investigations is suspect.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe main reason for our dissatisfaction is the systematic manipulation and denial of the facts by PHSO in order to find no case to answer or minimize the case against the public body concerned and their total lack of accountability when their poor decision making is criticised.default&#xa0;default default&#xa0;defaultIn 2010 – 2011
default&#xa0;
default PHSO found in favour of 1.45% of complainants.
default&#xa0;
default In 2011 – 2012 PHSO found in favour of 1.4% of complaints, therefore it is unsurprising that 64% of the public expressed the view that making a complaint would not make a difference. They were right. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is little point using resources to encourage more people to make a complaint when the Ombudsman service is clearly unable to deliver justice and remedy to the vast majority of those who already do. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would like to share some information with the Committee to supplement the answers given by Dame Julie Mellor and provide a more complete picture.
default&#xa0;
default We would appreciate some feedback from the Committee on the points we raise.

defaultUnfortunately, even with the reduced threshold the three point criteria for investigation described by Dame Julie Mellor is likely to fail at point 2, finding ‘evidence of maladministration or service failure.’
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default This is because PHSO 
defaultsystematically deny or manipulate the evidencedefault to find that public bodies have acted ‘reasonably’.
default&#xa0;
default Dame Julie Mellor stated that these criteria were based in law, yet when a complainant sent evidence in support of her case provided by a specialist barrister confirming that three legal breaches had occurred the Ombudsman dismissed this evidence as mere ‘subjective opinion’.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is difficult to believe that the assessors are able to investigate 8x more cases with no additional resources.
default&#xa0;
default Many of these cases are extremely complex.
default&#xa0;
default It is our strong suspicion that ‘assessments’ are now termed ‘investigations’ in order to meet this target with very little change in the process.
default&#xa0;
default This is just not good enough. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default‘For most people coming to us, our decision is the last opportunity to get things put right. We have built into our processes several checks and balances to ensure that our decisions are fair and robust. We give serious consideration to any complaints raised by our customers about our decisions and we seek to use the learning from these to improve our performance. In 2011-12 we found that 0.4% of our total decisions needed to be looked at again or required further explanation.’default&#xa0;default (p9 from Resource Account 2011 – 2012 )default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultA member of our group telephoned PHSO to confirm the use of ‘external’ reviewers and the response he received indicates the limited value of these ‘independent’ assessors to the general public.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe all know that the Ombudsman is not actually accountable by law due to the discretionary powers embedded in the 1967 act. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOnly one case has ever been won against the Ombudsman, the remarkable 
defaultBalchin
default family who fought for over 20 years.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default In relation to her being accountable for her services to Parliament it is difficult to ascertain exactly what ‘Parliament’ is.
default&#xa0;
default The Ombudsman is not accountable to Ministers, MPs, Select Committees or Civil Servants, so in what respect does the Ombudsman account for her services and to whom?
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultRegardless of Dame Julie Mellor’s assertions, the Pressure Group firmly believe that as a public servant the Ombudsman is accountable to members of the public, who at the end of the day, pay the bill.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default We will not be satisfied until our genuine concerns have been addressed and resolved.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default19defaultthdefault December 2013default&#xa0;
