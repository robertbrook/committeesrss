[[[Executive Summary]]]

[[[ and recommendations]]]&#xa0;

[[[International Service]]]  International Service is a development organisation that has been changing lives for the better for more than 60 years by empowering some of the world’s poorest and most marginalised people.Our international programmes are in West Africa, Latin America and the occupied Palestinian territory where social and economic inclusion for all people is central to our work.International Service’s development workers support local project partners with specialist skills and knowledge so that they and their organisations grow in effectiveness and impact.Our work is also about influencing the development and delivery of human rights policies in the countries where we operate on behalf of vulnerable and excluded groups of people.International Service is currently part of the consortium of agencies delivering the International Citizenship Service (ICS) funded through DFID.Our inclusion programme has a focus on disability and we also work with disability projects as part of our work within the ICS programme. Further information on International Service and our work can be found at www.internationalservice.org.uk 

[[[Reasons for submission]]]We are submitting evidence to this enquiry as we firmly believe that disability is still marginalised in international development. The omission of disability in the Millennium Development Goals led to disability being left out of many development programmes.  A targeted approach is needed to redress the existing imbalance and the influence and action of DFID is vital in taking forward this agenda. 

[[[Identified issues and proposed responses]]]Over 15% of the world’s population have a disability. Disability is closely linked to poverty, and in developing countries this group is known to be one of the most marginalised and vulnerable in society.It is commonly accepted that disabled people have lower employment rates and lower educational attainment (WHO) – and in developing countries access to employment and education is significantly reduced or non -existent.  There is also a financial loss for governments through lost productivity, and lost taxes through non or low employment of disabled people, alongside high health and social care costs. So inclusion makes sense economically and in terms of reducing poverty – a central aim of DFID policy.Disability has been further marginalised through its omission from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and as a result is frequently side-lined within mainstream development work. DFID has a clear role to play in influencing the formation of whatever replaces the MDGs in 2015 and ensuring that disability is firmly placed within the new framework.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD) should underpin any disability development work – specifically the implementation of articles 4, 9, 24, 27 and 29 – awareness raising, accessibility, education, work and employment, and participation in political and public life. The CRDP provides a clear international framework which 158 out of 193 UN member states have signed up to. Therefore, the CRPD provides a strong and commonly accepted platform on which to build future development work and measure achievement and impact.The UK has in the past been a leader in disability development and in promoting inclusion and the social model of disability. We still have much to share with other countries and specifically with NGOs and communities in developing countries through empowerment, capacity building and advocacy. The development of a separate disability strategy by DFID would reinforce their commitment to the issue following the recent announcement that all new DFID-funded schools will be made accessible to disabled children. A focused strategy would demonstrate that DFID give equal importance to disability as they do to other development areas and recognise the need to address some of the unique challenges across the disability sector in international development. Disability should still remain part of DFIDs sector programmes, for example in education, health, livelihoods etc.,  but a stand-alone disability strategy and programme of focused development work would raise the profile and importance of this work and make a greater, more sustainable impact. Active engagement of disabled people – including children and young adults is vital in developing any strategy and in any development work overseas including in the planning, management and monitoring of DFID programmes. This could be facilitated by development organisations already working with disabled peoples’ organisations both in the UK and in developing countries.Data and statistics on disability are weak, and often inaccurate or incomplete in most developing countries, making it difficult to benchmark activity against need. Any influence or contribution DFID could make to strengthen this area would be valuable in enabling accurate identification and meeting of need.

[[[Conclusion]]]Investment in disability within international development remains marginalised. It is important that DFID sets a strong example in promoting the need to address disability not just as part of its sector programmes but in its own right. A strategic framework developed with the full engagement of disabled people, and working alongside international development agencies with a disability focus would be the first step to achieving this. Investment in supporting research, data collection, capacity building and advocacy would underpin the development of services and opportunities for disabled people in developing countries, empowering and equipping them to make a valid, economically and socially productive, contribution to society.December 2013&#xa0;
