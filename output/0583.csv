defaultUKspace is the trade association of the UK space industry, with a mission to promote the best commercial, political and public environment for the UK space industry. UKspace is sponsored jointly by ADS and Intellect encapsulating both the upstream and downstream nature of the space sector.

defaultThe UK has a 
defaultdynamic 
defaultspace industry that has been 
defaultinfluenced 
defaultby successive UK Gover
defaultnments. Britain’s investment in E

defaultThe

default of the UK Space Agency 
default(UKSA) 
defaulthas helped to drive a more ambitious
default,
default growth
default-oriented
default space policy, yet more needs to be done to strengthen the

defaultgency and focus its resources and skills to 
defaultmaximise economic opportunities
default, including exploiting EU budgets
default.
default&#xa0;
default0.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndustry welcomes the arrival of the EU into space policy and, in particular, into operational 
defaultinfrastructure
default. 
defaultEU space spend, 
defaultat
default around €2bn per year, 
defaultrepresents
default one of the biggest overseas market opportunities for UK industry, and should be prioritised and resourced by both UKSA and the Catapult accordingly
default.
default&#xa0;
default0.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMuch progress has been made in recent years to maximise UK value from (and influence in) ESA, through strategic investment in ESA operational programmes and in developing the ESA Harwell facility.  However, 
defaultcontinued and growing 
defaultsuccess in Europe requires a 
defaultsignificantly
default larger 
defaultUK 
defaultnational space programme, as 
defaultin 
defaultFrance and Germany.  Industry welcomes the refinancing of the National Space Technology Programme in November 2012, but calls for a step change in funding, supported by a visionary and ambitious National Space Policy, and more aggregated procurement across Whitehall, in Earth Observation and secure satellite communications
default services
default.
default&#xa0;
default0.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndustry urges the EU to avoid imposing modifications on the successful ESA model which has delivered the high level of technical competence and outstanding reputation Europe has built up since 1964. Industry believes that there are and should remain distinct roles for the EU and ESA.
default&#xa0;
default0.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA is 
defaultmember
defaultship driven
default,
default 
defaultand not Treaty driven. As such, there exist ample opportunities for 
defaultthe UK Government
default,
default 
defaultas a leading ESA member state, to 
defaultshape 
defaultits
default 
defaulta
defaultgenda
default.  In particular, 
defaultindustry welcomes the development of ESA’s Harwell facility and its remit
default focussed on the
default growth prospects of interest to UK industry. 
defaultHowever
default,
default the UK 
defaultc
defaultould play a more assertive role in ESA itself, for example in pushing for UK 
defaultD
defaultirectors
default at ESA
default, an issue acknowledged by the Science minister in a recent parliamentary debate.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK’s thriving space sector contributes £9.1 billion a year to the UK economy and directly employs 28,900
default,
default with an average annual growth rate of almost 7.5%
default over the last decade
default. This 
defaultstrength
default has been shaped over time by support from successive UK Governments and 
defaultin particular through 
defaultthe
default UK
default’s 
defaultinvolvement in ESA
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA has played a crucial role in building a competitive and innovative space industry in Europe. ESA’s procurement principles ensure that investment by Member States helps to shape ESA programmes and they ensure that this investment is channelled back proportionately into national priority areas. 
defaultJ
defaultuste
default retour
default has provided a reliable 
default–
default and
default 
defaultaccountable 
default–
default mechanism
default 
defaultfor guaranteeing return on investment by ESA member states.
default UKspace wants to see these principles retained. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the UK has won a greater share of EU space research grants and infrastructure and service contracts thus far than it has invested by virtue of its membership of the EU, suggesting that the UK fares well out of both ESA’s and the EU’s procurement processes
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the 2012 ESA Ministerial Council, the UK Government announced investment of £1.2bn into some of Europe’s most significant space projects through the UK Space Agency, a 25% increase in UK investment in ESA. Through leverage effects this should enable £1 billion of private investment into the UK space sector; and help the industry achieve the ambitious goals of growing to a £40 billion industry by 2030 and generating an extra 100,000 jobs.
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA has changed considerably over the last decade
default.
default ESA has developed world-class skills and competences that must be retained and utilised.
default 
defaultIt has
default broadened its horizons from a s
defaultcientific R&amp;D organisation into one that also ha
defaults a strong focus on supporting i
defaultndustr
defaultial R&amp;D
default. 
defaultFor example,
default through its ARTES 
defaultt
defaultelecommunications 
defaultp
defaultrogrammes
default,
default it is helping 
defaulti
defaultndu
defaults
defaulttry 
defaultdevelop/retain
default world-leading expertise and service offerings to the large, and growing commercial market
default. It has also 
defaultbegun to create 
defaultthe 
defaults
defaultpace 
defaulti
defaultnfrastructure for 
defaultn
defaultavigation and 
defaulte
defaultarth 
defaulto
defaultbservation that will allow 
defaulti
defaultndustry to exploit these growing downstream services markets.
default&#xa0;
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultESA and specifically 
defaultthe 
defaultE
defaulturopean Space Operations Centre in Germany (E
defaultSOC
default),
default has helped the UK d
defaultevelop European leadership in satellite ground segment and o
defaultperations at a low cost to the UK 
default(
defaultas 
defaultthe 
defaultreturn is partially allocated to Germany
default)
default.
default 
defaultThe flexibility of the Optional Programmes has allowed the UK to develop leading technologies in the more commercial Space sectors.
default&#xa0;
default1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA has a long history of managing complex high
default 
defaulttechnology
default-
defaultri
defaultsk programmes. In most cases these have been successful and delivered on time and 
defaultto 
defaultbudget. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe Galileo procurement processes of both the European Commission and ESA proved susceptible to 
defaultp
defaultolitical 
defaultintervention, leading to cost overruns and delays, underlining the 
defaultneed for
default strong UK political engagement in 
defaultboth
default organisations
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the arrival of the EU into space policy. Space is increasingly vital for delivering public policy at local, regional, national and supra-national levels, and has a key role in reaching Lisbon Treaty objectives of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy by creating high-skilled jobs, commercial opportunities, boosting innovation and improving citizens’ well-being and security. For example, Copernicus (formerly GMES) is a vital tool for the EU in environmental protection.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKspace
default recognises the five areas of concern raised by the Commission and 
defaultin particular acknowledges 
defaultthe need for closer cooperation in order to avoid duplication and to maximise public benefits. 
defaultWe believe that
default ESA and the EU can work well together, with distinct and complementary roles, with ESA as the design
default and implementation
default authority and the Commission as the policy maker helping to 
defaultdefine public user requirements and 
defaultstimulat
defaulting
default 
defaultand funding the operation and 
defaultexploitation of space infrastructure
default for the benefit of
default European econom
defaulties
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe EU interest in space is recent and rapidly evolving. The EU
default and the UK 
defaultpublic sector 
defaultface the same challenge
default, 
defaultto 
defaultbecome a smart customer and 
defaultinformed 
defaultuser of satellite-enabled services, in areas from precision agriculture to cleaner air, from smarter, safer transport systems to satellite broadband.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven ESA
default’
defaults success, industry shares the UK Government
default’s concern about any 
defaultoverly hasty move to bring ESA under the wing of the EU, and supports the Government
default’
defaults cautious approach to moving the two institutions closer together.
default 
defaultTo align the need for coordination with the importance of maintaining distinct roles, t
defaulthe 
defaultCommission’s proposal
default for ESA to set up a specific ESA directorate in charge of implementing EU programmes, under EU rules, should be evaluated.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultIndustry 
defaultstrongly support
defaults
default an EU role as space p
defaultolicy lead and sponsor for downstream services dedicated to socio-economic applications.
default Industry would like to see this EU role, promoting space exploitation, 
defaultbetter
default reflected 
defaultand co-ordinated 
defaultin Horizon 2020.
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultCommission
default pointed to
default 
defaulta ‘democratic deficit’ in ESA’s accountability. Industry believes ESA offers good 
defaultaccountability
default to 
defaultESA 
defaultmember states, including the ability to target investment against national interests
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe level of influence that the UK has in ESA is already strong. 
defaultUK scrutiny could be enhanced further by an annual 
defaultP
defaultarliamentary debate on space policy
default, as the Committee recommended in its 1999/2000 inquiry
default, and as the shadow science minister 
defaultadvocated 
defaultin a recent debate
default.
default The UK 
defaultshould be more assertive in its efforts to secure UK nationals in senior positions in ESA, especially among its Directors
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall UK advocacy in EU space areas remains under-resourced and under-structured, partly reflecting the fast evolving nature of the EU’s space landscape.  Industry is currently reviewing its own representation, as a major strand of the 
defaulton-going
default Space Innovation and Growth Strategy, and we encourage UKSA to review and strengthen its own resourcing in
default relation 
defaultto EU space matters
default, including, for instance, 
defaultpromotion of
default more UK nationals in the EU’s growing space policy community
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR&amp;D is 
defaultan important enabler 
defaultof economic growth
default and underpins the competitiveness of the space industry
default.  
defaultThe innovation component of the EU’s next seven-year budget is
default an opportunity to 
defaultbuild
default a platform for growth 
defaultand competitiveness
default. Asia, for example, currently reinvests 3.5% of total GDP in R&amp;
defaultD
default, whilst Europe commits just 2%. Placing Horizo
defaultn 2020
default at the centre of Europe's 
defaulteconomic plans 
defaultwould send a very clear message that the EU and its 
defaultM
defaultember 
defaultS
defaulttates are committed to fostering innovation and 
defaulteconomic 
defaultgrowth
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe long-term nature of R&amp;D cycles in the space sector means that stable funding is especially important for businesses. EU funding should focus on the very early stages of technology development in order to mitigate the risks for companies, universities and individuals investing in experimental technology and in 
defaultoperationalising
default new satellite-enabled service capabilities.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe space sector uses a NASA-based Technology Readiness Level scheme to mark the progress of on
default-
defaultgoing research and development. These range from “Basic Technology Research‟ (TRL1) through to demonstrated, ready-for-market systems (TRL9). As a general principle, research and innovation funding should target projects between TRL1 
defaultand
default TRL6, 
defaultwhich for the space sector should extend up to and include in-orbit demonstration
default and service demonstration for downstream applications
default. This is where public assistanc
defaulte is most valuable to industry.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commission has promised a “strengthened steering, monitoring 
defaultand evaluation” of Horizon 2020, with 
defaultprogress tracked through a set of indicators every two years. 
defaultWe recognise
default the need to ensure coherent implementation across the programme, especially of SME participation and international co-operation, but some of the particular reporting required can necessitate substantial expenditure 
defaulton 
defaultauditors. 
defaultWhilst recognising that expenditure of public money must be properly scrutinised, some of this expenditure could be reduced through simplification of the reimbursement mechanisms and 
defaultput to better use in the resear
defaultch programmes being undertaken.
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA specific weakness of the EC’s FP7 research programme has been lack of funding for satellite communications and satellite navigation applications.
default&#xa0;
default DG ENT
defaultR
default’s space research programme largely ignores telecommunications, despite the contribution of satellite communications to growth and public policy, 
defaulte.g.
default in the EU Digital Agenda targets for 2020 for deployment of high-speed broadband to all European citizens. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFunding for developing satellite navigation applications has also been lacking in recent years, despite the progress made on the launch of the 
defaultGalileo
default satellites
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is essential that these 
defaultomissions 
defaultare 
defaultcorrected
default in Horizon 2020
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKspace strongly welcomed the formation of the UK Space Agency and commends the Coalition Government for upholding and advancing the space policy it inherited.
default 
defaultThe UK now has an executive space agency with 
defaultits own
default space budget
default, rather than the pooled budget of its predecessor
default. In addition, we welcome:
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKSA has been significantly under-resourced, affecting its relationships with industry, and degrading the perceived transparency of its decision-making.  Examples are in dealing with EC communications and in producing the promised National Space Policy.   
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite the UK’s policy leadership in promoting a growth agenda in space, the UK is now almost unique amongst spacefaring nations in lacking a resident, full-time economic or analytical capacity, a capacity which could sit within the agency or the Catapult. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndustry believes that there are a number of improvements that could be made by UKSA
default. Many of these recommendations are emerging through the current 
defaultwork on 
defaultthe Space Innovation and Growth Strategy, due for publication in the second half of this year. Emerging issues include the need for UKSA to
default:
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe failure of the UK to achieve any director in ESA, compared with three each for France, Italy and Germany, is a failure of ambition and influence by UKSA.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKSA must work closely with industry to ensure that together they are delivering on growth. The current work on the IGS is vital to reach the target 10% share of the global market by 2030.   Growth is driven by the downstream services market so we must target key sectors for growth and work with the other Catapults to fully exploit these markets. UKSA can help unlock barriers to market access and help take science and technology into the marketplace.
default&#xa0;
default4.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEffective ESA 
defaultand EC 
defaultengagement requires complementary national funding to create the conditions in which industry can win greater share
defaults
default of ESA ‘noble work’
default and EU funding
default. This approach is well recognised and practised by our 
defaultinter
defaultnational competitors. Industry therefore welcomes the establishment of the National Space Technology Programme (a key recommendation of the first Space IGS in 2010) and its refinancing in the Autumn Statement of 2012. However, industry considers a stronger NSTP an essential test of UKSA’s commitment to help maximise UK economic return from EU and ESA space spend
default. This is also key to
default risk reduction of new commercial initiatives which can then attract City funding.
default  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has 
defaultdeveloped world leadership in both space science and in commercial export markets, part
defaultly from 
defaulttargeted investment in ESA programmes with proven 
defaultscientific and 
defaulteconomic 
defaultpotential, notably ARTES.  However, 
defaulta better balance between national and ESA investment is essential if the UK is to fully exploit its ESA (and EU) investments.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultESA is a vital wealth creation mechanism for the UK space-enabled economy, providing an excellent means for UK
default-
defaultbased operators to leverage off leading edge UK technologies
default,
default 
defaultenabling 
defaultUK exports of high value 
defaultsatellite systems and services
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJuste
default retour
default allows for targeted investment by 
defaultM
defaultember 
defaultS
defaulttates. 
defaultThis was r
defaulteflected at the 2012 ESA Ministerial, with the UK 
defaultdeciding to 
defaulttarget investment into key optional programmes
default based on the
default economic or science benefits.  Industry welcomes the growth focus of the policy agenda which has shaped the successful ESA Ministerial outcome. Industry pointed to prospects for a 6:1 return on targeted investment at C-M
defaultIN
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInvestment at the ESA Ministerial has triggered the announcement by ESA that it will bolster its UK presence by transferring its Telecoms and Integrated Applications Directorate to Harwell. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIndustry strongly welcomes the moves to strengthen the UK voice in ESA. The satellite communications business is Britain's biggest commercial space success story, supporting over 70% of the industry’s manufacturing workforce. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ESA decision reinforces Britain’s credentials as the best place in Europe to do the business of space.
default&#xa0;
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEarly decisions on investment in ESA programmes helps create a more strategic and long-term UK agenda in ESA; it helps industry plan ahead, develop technology roadmaps and identify export opportunities. It is vital that the UK invest strongly in the early phases of major programmes, in order to get sufficient control to deliver UK technology priorities and maximise growth opportunities.
default&#xa0;
default5.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default UKspace has demonstrated that there are strong
default commercial spinoff benefits from 
defaultearth observation, 
defaultspace science
default 
defaultand robotic exploration 
defaultin terms of
default&#xa0;
defaulttechnologies
default,
default and also in terms of software and services to the global Space market.
default&#xa0;
default5.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has demonstrated that it achieves a better return on investment than other ESA Member States. This is primarily through its highly developed capacity to take ESA developed technology to the commercial market. It is also strongly influenced by the UK selection of ESA optional programmes that are better aligned to the global marketplace. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment understanding of 
defaultthe resilience of the UK’s space-based infrastructure 
defaultis hampered by the absence of a 
defaultclear definition of who owns it, what risks have been considered or the efficacy of mitigation measures.
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere 
defaultshould be a
default clear UK owner or overseer of resilience plans for the satellites and ground-based supporting infrastructures that provide critical UK 
defaultcapabilities
default and
default 
defaulta
default comprehensive analysis of space systems critical to the UK
default. This should 
defaultinclude 
defaultan analysis of
default the level of resilience of space-related capabilities or of mitigation measures in the event of disruption.
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCPNI has decided that 
defaults
defaultpace is not part of their scope primarily because of the lack of a Lead Government Department
default for space security
default.
default&#xa0;
default The EC require
defaults
default the UK to treat the UK Security Monitoring Centre for the Galileo programme as critical national infrastructure.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no resilience apparent in the provision of satellite communications to Government Departments such as the Foreign Office or the Department for International Development and no analysis of whether these links should be resilient and if so, to what degree.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.5.

defaultThe threats from natural events in space are well understood
default and ESA has an on-going programme to provide monitoring and
