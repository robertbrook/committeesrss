defaultThe speed at which the call for evidence by DEFRA is being processed does not make for good government and has meant existing priorities have had to be shelved; meetings have had to be hurriedly arranged at what is already a busy time of year for many in business. This is not the first time important issues have been consulted on by this department with a foreshortened consultation period.

default Where charges have been applied to carrier bags elsewhere in the UK 
defaulteg
default Wales and in the Republic of Ireland there is little evidence to support the view that a net environmental benefit has occurred. For although it is accepted that consumption of the so called single use bag has fallen (the only headline ever seen published by those imposing or proposing charges) what is overlooked and rarely factored in is the increase in product consumption of the reusable bags, there relative environmental impact which may far worse if not reused the requisite number of times see Environment Agency Report SCO304148 and in addition if the single use bag was reused as a bin liner etc the relative environmental impact of these products which now need purchasing to displace the use that the single use bag was previously put to. See 
defaultpara
default 4.2 below.
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposal to only apply the charge to bags made of plastic is anticompetitive and has no grounds and would fall foul of the same anti-competition, restraint of trade  laws and ….laws. A ban would also fall foul of the same laws. See 
defaultpara

default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposed exemptions namely paper and biodegradable plastics are unlikely to produce any net environmental benefit and could in fact increase the environmental impact.

default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultIn terms of the proposed legislation PAFA has members who supply 
defaultall types of carrier bags made out of all types of material not just plastic.
default&#xa0;
default3.0 Tdefaulthe true impact of defaultsingle use plastic carriers and the results of the voluntarydefault initiatives default&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultAt present carrier bags form a very small part of household waste at around 0.02%pct (WRAP/DEFRA)
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultThe impact of carrier bags in terms of litter is overstated as carrier bags form a very small part of litter and it was disappointing to hear politicians within DEFRA giving support to the notion that plastic bags play a major part in litter in our country.
default&#xa0;
defaultFact 1. 
defaultKeep Britain Tidy (
defaultKBT
default)
default in the
defaultir
default latest report on litter found on our streets
default, concluded
default that the number of supermarket carriers had fallen each year for the last four.
default&#xa0;
defaultFact 2. Of the items that KBT found during their survey carrier bags were rated
default a lowly
default no 21 out of 26.
default&#xa0;
defaultFact 3. The incidence of carrier bags at 3% of all sites observed compares to 82% for the first item on the KBT list for litter types present and 65 % for the second item on the list.
default&#xa0;
defaultFact 4 . Of litter on the beach and in the seas 80% 
defaultof it originates from the land (
defaultsource KBT) so it follows that trends on litter found on the beach will follow those seen on land and therefore the incidence of supermarket carriers found will have decreased within the mix of plastics found so  although the number of plastic pieces found actually registered a small increase in 2013 the number originating from carrier bags must have fallen.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultThe carbon footprint of a HDPE single 
defaultuse carrier bag is less than 0.0
default1% of the average person’s overall carbon footprint. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultIn addition the current bag in popular use i.e. the vest carrier made of HDPE has very low resource impacts compared to alternatives see Environment Agency report SCO304148.
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultThat impact was further reduced as a result of the voluntary code operated by retailers, the industry and WRAP which lead to a reduction of virgin polymer in use by 50
default% and the number in use by 36%(
defaultsource WRAP) Other benefits of the voluntary code was an increase in recycled content and a dramatic increase in 
defaultthe number of 
defaultrecycling points front of store. Following the initial achievements of the voluntary code the logistics chain together with green groups were ready to move on to focus on more worrying and significant environmental issues. However a small but vocal minority were not and it is disappointing to yet again see government policy shaped by who shouts the loudest in the media rather than concentrate on issues of significance.
default&#xa0;
default4.0default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSingle use carrier bagsdefault and results and experience of applying charges and other measures to reduce use.default&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultThe term single use is misleading as the majority of carrier bags get reused either for shopping or for secondary purposes including finally as bin liners.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough it is true that only a small proportion get recycled this is attributable to
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat a large proportion of carrier bags end up being finally reused as bin liners (according to recent studies conducted in Wales and Scotland this proportion is as high as 50%)
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA lack of recycling provision by councils
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA lack of promotion of front of store recycling points
defaultThe Interventions in terms of taxes and levies In Ireland, Wales and proposed in England is disproportionate to the impact of the product and its footprint. The UK government would be far better if they were seriously concerned about resource and environmental impact to concentrate on items that pose much bigger problems on our streets and that use far more resource. If a similar approach to applying taxes/levees to all products were based on their carbon impact it is unlikely that we could afford to travel or heat or light our homes.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 T
defaulthe result of the imposition of taxes and minimum charges on carrier bags in Ireland and Wales is only ever reported on in terms of the products that these are applied to. For example the increase in sales of bin liners, the true impact of the introduction of heavier more resource intensive 
defaultreusable 
defaultbags that don’t get reused the number of times necessary to result in less overall impact is glossed over. When taxes were imposed in Southern Ireland they had no overall impact due to the increase in use of less resource efficient alternatives th
defaultat were not subject to a tax when combined with
default the increase in consum
defaultption of bags to replace those uses that
default had once been fulfilled by the secondary uses of so called single use 
defaultplastic carrier 
defaultbags.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.1 
defaultFor these reasons no overall environmental benefit is believed to arise from policies that mandate charging unless it is associated with a policy that 
defaultensures that bags with the low
default environmental impact are used
default to replace those displaced. See Environment agency report SC0304148.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.2 Any assessment of impacts must therefore include impacts associated with secondary uses that are displaced e.g. at present vest carriers (or single use plastic carrier bags) are reused in the majority of cases and at end of their life some 50% are disposed of as bin liners/refuse sacks. If  
defaultbags for life are not reused for shopping (which recent studies have indicated maybe as high as 50%) but are instead reused as bin liners then this has to be taken into account and compared with current impacts of single use plastic bag use. In addition the increase in sales of bin liners and other secondary uses of so called single use plastic carriers that are displaced e.g. bags for pet faeces etc. needs to be taken into account as well. We therefore recommend that the findings of the behavioural and research findings carried out in Wales and Scotland be factored in the environmental impact study as well as the true impacts once displaced uses are factored in as above. Failing to do this will lead to misleading claims about the effectiveness of the proposed measures and will again be open to challenge.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.3 In addition steps need to be undertaken to ensure that consumers buy and retailers promote only those bags that will achieve a guaranteed lower environmental impact. For example if the result were that bags in use were made of a material that had a higher overall impact when likely reuse was factored then again the policy will fail as happened in Ireland and government will leave itself open to criticism for not learning from the lessons and implementing policies that do not result in higher 
defaultenvironemtnal
default impacts than existed before.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.4 
defaultIn addition extreme care has to be exercised when advocating reuse as bags made from certain materials can become havens for harmful bacteria. See study by Wright and 
defaultKlick
default following the San Francisco ban on plastic bags.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.5 Also
default if bags for life are not reused the requisite number of times they can have a worse environmental impact than the HDPE vest carrier that is currently in popular use, See Environment Agency Life Cycle Assessment of supermarket Carriers Report SC030148.
default&#xa0;default4.3 The legality of applying the charge only to plastic single use bags and experience elsewheredefault&#xa0;default4.3.1 By singling out plastic, in this policy proposal, the UK government is seeking to undermine the free market in England by setting a minimum price at which the product is to be supplied, whilst setting no minimum price for products not made of plastic.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.2 This will clearly put the supply of plastic carrier bags at a competitive 
defaultdisadvantage.compared
default with carrier bags made of different materials even though the plastic carrier bag may have the lowest environmental impact.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.3 In addition under EU directive 94/62/EC which relates to reducing impacts of packaging and packaging waste there is no provision for measures to be taken relating to the consumption of a single material.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.4 In addition a ban or a proposal to restrict the placing on the market of a bag made of plastic would also seem to fall foul of Article 18 of Directive 94/62/EC which relates to the freedom to place on the market packaging which satisfies the provisions of the packaging and packaging waste directive.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.5 For this reason by proposing measures that only relate to plastic and not all materials used to manufacturer single use bags it would seem that the proposal would fall foul of the EU directive, would represent a restraint of trade, would interfere with the principal of free trade and is unfair.
default&#xa0;
default4,4 The legality of exempting biodegradable plastic bags and paper from a minimum charge.default&#xa0;defaultThe arguments above in paragraph 4.3 apply.
default default&#xa0;default4.5 defaultBiodegradabilitydefault definition, impact on recycling and experience elsewheredefault default&#xa0;
default4.5.1 
defaultFirstly a lot of confusion exists in this area not helped by claims made by 
defaulta small number of 
defaultmanufacturers of material associated with promoting their own particular materials. Some claims 
defaultmay 
defaulthave been misleading and or 
defaultmiscommunicated
default and PAFA would strongly advocate that any material claims should be tested against standards where these exist e.g. EN 13432 in the case of composting and 
defaultthat any other claims outside these standards  
defaultbe independently verified and peer reviewed by industry agreed pa
defaultrties/ consultants/academic bodies or 
defaulttest houses.
default&#xa0;

default4.5.3. How materials
default breakdow
defaultn can be accelerated by design and or 
defaultby the action of additives than will accelerate the breakdown down of plastic materials at a predetermined rate 
defaultand or 
defaultin a given environment.
default Sometimes the products in use are also referred to as Biodegradable and 
defaultOxi
default-
defaultdegradable to separate out those that will break down by virtue of the action of microorganisms and those where the breakdown of the material is triggered by the action of additives.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.5.4. 
defaultHowever there is no material that will instantaneously breakdown when littered in the sea, on land, in rivers, when buried or composted. The time taken to breakdown will be influenced by the environment the materi
defaultals find themselves in the type of product 
defaulteg
default compostable or 
defaultoxidegradable
default and can be typically between 6 months and 2 years.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.5 
defaultVarious studies on the impacts arising from the use of degradable materials have been undertaken including the DEFRA report on the 
defaultOxo-Degradables
default 2010 report EV0422. This report highlighted the risks to recycling, composting streams and the time it took for the materials to breakdown.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.6  
defaultAlso the Environment Agency Report 2011
default&#xa0;
default4.5.7 
defaultIn addition in Canada similar conclusions were reached relating to the risks associated with the use of Biodegradable plastics.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.8 
defaultBiodegradable when used to describe the additions of additives and or the design of materials to break down under specified conditions 
defaultie
default 
defaultoxidegradable
default and biodegradable 
defaultalso pose a risk to the quality of recycled plastic. This problem manifests itself usually by deterioration in material properties and or the inclusion of weak spots in the material containing the recycled content that result in higher scrap rates for 
defaultreprocessor
default or the film extruder/ converter or both or worse still failures in use. Few studies have been carried out in this area but one of the recent pieces of work carried out by EUPC/F of which PAFA is a member showed the following preliminary findings 
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultThis work may need to be peer reviewed next to put it beyond reasonable doubt but the findings as 
defaultwere carried out by a respected academic body
default. During the time this legislation is being formed the work should be fully peer reviewed or published and any modifications in the findings can be reflected as and if they arise.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.9 
defaultFor this reason any work to exempt biodegradable bags and to encourage their use is highly likely to pose a risk to plastic film and bag recycling in the UK and or recyclers overseas using UK recovered material as feedstock
default unless clear and effective segregation can be achieved.
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 
defaultIn addition a combination of lower recycling volumes front of store combined with the likely need to exclude degradable materials of any sort is highly likely to render the front of store collection of films and bags uneconomic and the tremendous progress made to make more recycling points available 
defaultfor film and bags to consumers 
defaultwill be lost completely.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.1 In Germany where biodegradable carrier bags 
defaultwhere
default placed on the market these were subsequently withdrawn after a challenge by a environmental conservation NGO DUH. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6.2 Whilst in the UK in 2010 two major retailers stopped using 
defaultoxi
default- degradable bags after concerns about benefits. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6.2 
defaultThis combined with the very negative messaging associated with a reduction in recycling provision at the very time that politicians and the industry are trying to increase the recycling of plastic will be very damaging.
default&#xa0;
default4.7 PAFA position on impact on jobsdefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere will be an adverse impact on jobs. Those businesses that are involved in carrier bag distribution in the UK have signalled that they expect job losses to result. Also further job losses could arise in the recycling industry.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo if this policy was to result in job losses for no net environmental benefit that would be irresponsible. For this reason a full environmental impact as outlined above must be carried out. In addition policy must be careful not to undermine the work done by retailers to reduce impacts, increase the provision of recycling and increase recycled content.
default&#xa0;
defaultPAFA wish to be reassured that due to the risk to jobs posed by this policy initiative that government will approach policy formulation to examine the full impacts and will ensure that consumers are not allowed to switch to bags that would have a worse environmental impact.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally it seems extraordinary that a policy proposal by DEFRA be put forward at the very time that WRAP and the London Waste and recycling Board have recently funded a new business to process and recycle over 20,000 tonnes per annum of post-consumer film and bags which it now seems to be putting jeopardy.
