[normal]Background to my re[bold]search on human prion diseases [bold]that is relevant to the questions [bold]that[bold] I have been invited to [bold]respond[bold] to for this Evidence Session[bold]. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am Professor of Clinical Neuropathology in the University of Edinburgh and Honorary Consultant Neuropathologist in NHS Lothian Hospitals Division. I have worked in the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]National CJD 
[normal]Surveillance Unit (now renamed as 
[normal]t
[normal]he National CJD Research &amp; Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU)) since it was established by the Department of Health in 1990 in the University of Edinburgh. The key aim
[normal]s
[normal] of NCJDRSU 
[normal]are
[normal] to 
[normal]monitor the characteristics of all forms of CJD, to identify trends in incidence rates, to study risk factors for the development of disease and to contribute to improving the quality of care for those with CJD
[normal] (
[normal]www.cjd.ed.ac.uk
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 1996, my colleagues and I identified a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) that 
[normal]is known as variant CJD (vCJD)
[normal] (28
[normal])
[normal], and in collaboration with other researchers we demonstrated that the infectious agent or prion causing vCJD (but not 
[normal]sporadic CJD (sCJD), the commonest form of CJD
[normal]) closely resembled the prion causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
[normal] in its biochemical profile on Western blot assay 
[normal](5) 
[normal]and on experimental transmission in a strain typing assay
[normal] (3)
[normal]. On the basis of this finding, vCJD is often referred to as “the human form of BSE”. Since then, my colleagues and I have monitored the incidence of vCJD in the UK and studied in detail the clinical and neuropathological features of the disease
[normal] (11,16)
[normal]. We also undertook 
[normal]epidemiological studies and 
[normal]a case control study (funded by DH)
[normal] (27
[normal])
[normal] to identify risk factors for vCJD, and produced a set of 
[normal]diagnostic criteria that was accepted by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
[normal] (30
[normal])
[normal]; NCJDRSU is now both a national and international referral centre for cases of suspected vCJD. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NCJDRSU 
[normal]website (
[normal]www.cjd.ed.ac.uk
[normal]) 
[normal]gives updated information on all forms of CJD in the UK and has figures for all the vCJD cases in the UK
[normal] (current total 177 cases)
[normal], including data on the incidence and death rates from this disease
[normal], both of which show a decline in recent years
[normal]. 
[normal]Most cases of vCJD occur in young adults with a median age at death of 28 years; the age at death has not changed greatly 
[normal]over time
[normal]. Only 5 cases of vCJD have been identified in patients aged 60 years and over. 
[normal]All definite cases of vCJD (that have been confirmed pathologically) belong to a genetic subgroup of the population defined by a 
[normal]naturally occurring
[normal] polymorphism at codon 129 in the open reading frame of the prion protein gene 
[normal](
[normal]PRNP
[normal]) 
[normal]on chromosome 22. Either methionine (M) or valine (V) can be encoded, resulting in 3 possible genotypes: MM, MV and VV
[normal] (Table 1)
[normal]. All definite vCJD cases possess the MM genotype. There is evidence that the MV and VV genotypes 
[normal]are 
[normal]be susceptible to vCJD infection 
[normal](2,8,17,
[normal]22
[normal]) 
[normal]and  as this polymorphism is known to influence the incubation period of other acquired human prion diseases, e.g. kuru
[normal] (6
[normal],
[normal]19
[normal])
[normal], it is possible that vCJD cases may yet emerge in these genotypes in the future.

[normal]E
[normal]vidence for asymptomatic vCJD infection in these genotypes
[normal] (8,17,
[normal]22
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We studied the tissue distribution 
[normal]in the body 
[normal]of the abnormal prion protein in vCJD, and found that in addition to accumulating in the central nervous sy
[normal]s
[normal]tem (CNS), it was widely distributed in lymphoid tissues throughout the body, including the spleen, lymph nodes, tonsil
[normal]s
[normal] and 
[normal]Peyer’s patches in the gut
[normal] (10)
[normal]. In collaboration with colleagues we 
[normal]later
[normal] 
[normal]confirmed 
[normal]prion
[normal] infectivity in these tissues, with lower levels present in lymphoid tissues than in the CNS
[normal] (4)
[normal]. In anoth
[normal]er collaborative study we 
[normal]demonstrated evidence that blood (packed red blood cells) transfused from individuals who subsequently died from vCJD was infectious
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]had 
[normal]transmitted vCJD infection on four occasions
[normal] (12,
[normal]22
[normal])
[normal]. Since then much research has been carried out to develop a blood test for vCJD,
[normal] 
[normal]and although one test has shown promise in patients with the signs and symptoms of vCJD
[normal] (7)
[normal], it is not yet known if 
[normal]preclinical vCJD 
[normal]infections can be detected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In collaboration with colleagues, we identified 
[normal]appendix
[normal] tissue s
[normal]amples
[normal] that had been removed from some individuals who subsequently developed and died from vCJD, and found that the abnormal prion protein coul
[normal]d accumulate in lymphoid follicles in the appendix
[normal] before the onset of symptoms of vCJD
[normal] (13,14)
[normal]. This finding l
[normal]ead to the hypothesis that the prevalence
[normal] of vCJD infection in the UK could be estim
[normal]ated by studying lymphoid follicle
[normal]s (
[normal] in 
[normal]tonsil
[normal] and 
[normal]appendix 
[normal]samples
[normal] removed from individuals in the UK population 
[normal]with
[normal] no signs or symptoms of vCJD
[normal])
[normal] to detect the presence of the disease-associated prion protein, which accumulates in these tissues in vCJD, but not in other forms of CJD
[normal]. 
[normal]I have been involved in 2 major 
[normal]studies on the tissue-based prevalence of vCJD in the UK
[normal] (8,15) 
[normal]the most recent of which estimates that around 1 in 2,000 individual
[normal]s
[normal] in the UK may be infected with the prion that causes vCJD
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Response[bold]s[bold] to questions[bold] posed:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. [bold]What do you consider to be the likely prevalence of subclinical vCJD infection in the UK population? What evidence is there to support this view?[bold]It is difficult to measure the precise prevalence of 
[normal]subclinical
[normal] vCJD infection in the UK population, since there is no validated screening test (e.g. a blood test) of high specificity and sensitivity for asymptomatic vCJD infection. The only estimates of  subclinical vCJD prevalence have been derived from tissue-based studies, where 
[normal]formalin-fixed 
[normal]paraffin-embedded blocks of appendix and/or tonsil specimens from NHS Histopathology Department archives have been screened in large numbers to demonstrate the presence of disease-associated prion protein by immunohistochemistry
[normal] (8,15)
[normal]. These tissues contain lymphoid follicles with follicular dendritic cells, which appear to support prion replication in vCJD. Immunohistochemistry has identified the accumulation
[normal] of disease-assoc
[normal]i
[normal]at
[normal]ed prion 
[normal]protein 
[normal]in a small number of appendi
[normal]x
[normal] samples removed before the onset of neurological illness in individual
[normal]s who later died
[normal] from vCJD. Th
[normal]is method
[normal] 
[normal]has not 
[normal]detected disease-associated prion protein 
[normal]in these tissues in 
[normal]patients with 
[normal]s
[normal]CJD.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Two major
[normal] studies using 
[normal]a tissue-based
[normal] approach have been reported in UK, 
[normal]both
[normal] of which were given research ethics approval requiring the use of anonymised samples from patient
[normal]s of known birth cohorts
[normal] (8,
[normal]15)
[normal]. In 200
[normal]4, my colleagues and I reported a study 
[normal]funded by DH 
[normal]of over 12,500 tonsil and appendix samples: 11,109 were appendix samples, 3 of which were positive and were obtained from patients aged 20-29 years of age when operated on in 1996-99
[normal] (15)
[normal]. 
[normal] Experimental transmission was attempted on material from one of the positive samples, which was unsuccessful
[normal] (2
[normal]6
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 analysis was performed on 
[normal]DNA extracted from 
[normal]the other 2 positive 
[normal]samples, showing both cases to be VV
[normal] (17)
[normal]. 
[normal]The estimated prevalence of vCJD infection from this study was higher than the number of vCJD cases would have indicated: around 1 in 4000 of the UK population
[normal], with wide confidence intervals
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further research was 
[normal]required to confirm this finding, and DH funded a larger 
[normal]immunohistochemical study to detect disease-associated prion protein in UK appendix samples, including data on 
[normal]birth cohort
[normal], gender and 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 genotype for each individual in the study. This was recently reported in the British Medical Journal
[normal] (8)
[normal]; 
[normal]16/32441 
[normal]cases were positive, of which 6 were 
[normal]in the 1941-60 birth cohort and 10 in the 1961-85 birth cohort. 
[normal]10 cases were males and 6 females; 
[normal]8 cases were MM at 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129, 4 were MV and 4 VV.
[normal] 
[normal]These findings give an estimated prevalence of vCJD infection in the UK population of 1 in 2000, with wide confidence intervals. The results of the 2004 and the 2013 studies are 
[normal]consistent with each other
[normal], particularly in view of the wide confidence intervals in both studies.
[normal] The estimates from the more recent study are, however, more precise.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On the basis of these findings, 
[normal]I consider it 
[normal]no
[normal]t
[normal] unreasonable to conclude that the prevalence of subclinical vCJD infection in the UK 
[normal]may be
[normal] around 1
[normal] in
[normal] 2,000 of the population
[normal] and that all genetic subgroups are susceptible
[normal]. However, 
[normal]some
[normal] caveats have to be
[normal] 
[normal]taken into account:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]i[bold]. 
[normal]The positive results 
[normal]reported 
[normal]might be 
[normal]false positives, either due to 
[normal]non-specific 
[normal]staining,
[normal] or 
[normal]positivity due to 
[normal]other human prion diseases e.g. sCJD
[normal]. The question of non-specific staining is being addressed in an on
[normal]-
[normal]going DH-funded study of appendixes removed from the 1970s and earlier – before BSE is thought to have entered the human food chain. Immunohistochemistry has not detected accumulation of disease-associated prion protein in sections of appendixes, tonsils and spleens from individuals who have died from sCJD, although one report exists of very low levels of disease-associated prion protein detected in unfixed samples of the spleen in a subgroup of sCJD patients by Western blot assay, a method considered to have a greater sensitivity
[normal] (9)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii[bold]. The positive results
[normal] reported, if true positives, might give an underestimate
[normal] of the prevalence of vCJD infection in the UK population, since immunohistochemistry is 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]not as sensitive as other assays, e.g. Western blot, for the detection of disease-associated prion protein in tissues. However, Western blot assays require unfixed tissues, and all the samples in UK Histopathology Department archives are formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. How might this subclinical infection rate translate to future cases of vCJD? What are the key uncertainties in the relationship between clinical and subclinical vCJD?[bold]I am uncertain as to how this estimated subclinical infection rate might translate to future cases of vCJD. All confirmed cases of vCJD so far belong to the
[normal] PRNP
[normal] codon 129 MM genetic subgroup. 
[normal]A possible case of vCJD has been reported in the UK in a MV patient (18)
[normal], but this case did not undergo autopsy and did not fulfil the criteria for a probable case of vCJD.
[normal] 
[normal]It is reasonable to assume that at least some of the MM cases identified in the recent appendix survey by Gill et al (
[normal]8
[normal]) might go on to develop vCJD, but the same conclusion cannot be reached for the MV and VV groups. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have published evidence to suggest that a MV individual became infected with vCJD as the result of a transfusion with packed red blood cells from a donor who later went on to die from vCJD
[normal] (22
[normal])
[normal]. The recipient
[normal] died from an unrelated cause 5 years after the transfusi
[normal]on, but did not develop vCJD prior to death
[normal]. Examination of brain and spinal cord samples from the post-mortem examination showed no evidence of vCJD prion infection, but the disease-associated prion was detected in the spleen and lymph nodes by immunohistochemistry and also in the spleen by Western blot assay.
[normal] 
[normal]The presence of vCJD infectivity in the spleen was subsequently confirmed by experimental transmission
[normal] (1)
[normal]. This informative case demonstrates several key points:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]. vCJD prions (transmitted in this case by blood transfusion) can infect individuals of the 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 MV genotype
[normal].
[normal]2[bold]. vCJD infection can result in a subclinical infection for at least 5 years, during which 
[normal]time 
[normal]the lymphoid tissues in the body 
[normal]are likely to be
[normal] 
[normal]infectious
[normal].
[normal]3[bold].
[normal] Individuals with subclinical vCJD may therefore be capable of spreading vCJD infectivity to other by blood transfusion or though surgical instruments used on lymphoid tissues, 
[normal]e.g.
[normal] tonsil, spleen, appendix.
[normal]4[bold].
[normal] Positive immunohistochemistry for disease-associated prion protein in lymphoid tissues can be a true marker of prion infectivity
[normal].
[normal]5[bold]. vCJD infection in an 
[normal]individual of the 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 MV genotype retains its biochemical profile on Western blot assay.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Studies of kuru, an extinct disease identified in the 1950s in Papua New Guinea, showed that the disease was spread by from person to person due to dietary practices in certain remote tribes, and became an important cause of death, particularly in women and children. The incubation period for Kuru was influenced by the 
[normal]PRNP 
[normal]codon 129 genotype, with the shortest incubation periods in the MM genotype and longer periods in the other genotypes particularly in the MV genotype, where incubation periods of over 40 years were identified
[normal] (6,
[normal]19)
[normal]. The effect 
[normal]of the 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 genotype o
[normal]n incubation periods may depend on the stain of the infectious prion, as in 
[normal]iatrogenic CJD occurring as a consequence of treatment with 
[normal]human growth hormone in 
[normal]the USA, 
[normal]France and the UK. 
[normal]The first of these cases in the UK was reported in 1985
[normal] (24
[normal],
[normal]25
[normal])
[normal], since when there have been over 60 cases (5 in 2012 and 1 so far in 2013), with incubation periods of over 30 years in some individuals. These
[normal] observations suggest that differences in 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 genotype
[normal]s
[normal] may result in very prolonged incubation periods
[normal] for vCJD
[normal], during which the infected individuals may represent a source of secondary infection to others in the population. Infected individuals may die of other causes before they develop signs and symptoms of prion infection. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The key uncertainties in the relationship between clinical and subclinical vCJD are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]. The influence of the 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 genotype on the emergence of clinical disease – will clinical vCJD only occur in the MM genotype
[normal], while other genotypes may become 
[normal]infected, but never develop disease
[normal]?
[normal]2
[normal]. The effect of the 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 genotype on 
[normal]disease 
[normal]incubation periods, which can extend to several decades.
[normal] There have been very few cases of clinical vCJD in t
[normal]he elderly
[normal] and it is unclear if the diagnosis in this age group is
[normal] complicated by the occurrence of commoner neurodegenerative diseases in this age group, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. Further work to determine more precisely the 
[normal]prevalence of clinical vCJD in this population group would help understand more about disease incubation periods and the effects of 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 genotype, 
[normal]particularly in view of the recent finding of apparent subclinical vCJD in 6 cases in the 1941-60 birth cohort in the appendix study by Gill et al (8).
[normal] 
[normal]3
[normal]. C
[normal]linical vCJD in 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 VV and MV 
[normal]genotypes might differ in its clinicopathological features from 
[normal]vCJD 
[normal]in the MM genotype, although the biochemical profile of the vCJD prion may be preserved, as in the spleen of the 
[normal]vCJD
[normal] infection in the 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 MV individual described above
[normal] (1,
[normal]22
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]4
[normal]. It is therefore conceivable that subclinical vCJD infection in 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 VV and MV genotypes could be transmitted to individuals of the
[normal] PRNP
[normal] codon 129 MM genotype, resulting in clinical vCJD.
[normal] We do not know the identity of those individuals identified as being positive for disease-associated prion protein in the appendix studies
[normal] (8,15)
[normal], but it is conceivable that some of this group may have donated blood or undergone surgery.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3. What are the likely routes of infection for vCJD? How have the potential modes of transmission changed over time?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]There is strong evidence to indicate that vCJD results from human infection with the BSE agent
[normal] (3,5)
[normal]. The most likely route of this infection is dietary exposure through the consumption of BSE-infected meat products. Other potential sources of primary BSE infection have been considered, e.g. occupational (farmers, veterinarians, abattoir workers) and medicines or vaccines prepared using bovine components, but no evidence exists to support these possibilities
[normal] (27
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is also evidence that secondary vCJD transmission can occur from person to person by the transfusion of non-leucodepleted red blood cells
[normal] (12,
[normal]2
[normal]2
[normal])
[normal], and by the administration of large volumes of UK-derived plasma products
[normal] (
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal])
[normal]. Other possible sources of secondary vCJD transmission include t
[normal]he reuse of surgical instruments 
[normal]previously used in surgery on the CNS and lymphoid tissues in a patient with subclinical vCJD
[normal], when the instruments might harbour enough infectivity to cause transmission
[normal]. 
[normal]Prions bind to metal surfaces, and inactivation of prion infectivity is difficult to achieve
[normal] (29
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]There is no epidemiolo
[normal]gical evidence to indicate that 
[normal]transmission of vCJD
[normal] 
[normal]by surgery (including dental surgery) 
[normal]has occurred to date
[normal] (27)
[normal], although the identificati
[normal]on of such instances
[normal] 
[normal]is likely to be difficult. 
[normal]No evidence of 
[normal]vertical (
[normal]maternal
[normal])
[normal] transmission of vCJD has occurred so far in children born to mothers who had clinical vCJD during pregnancy
[normal] (20)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The potential modes of transmission of vCJD have changed over time, particularly since 1996, when reinforced measures were introduced to control the entry of BSE-infected meat into the human food chain in the UK. The incidence of BSE has declined significantly since 1996, although occasional cases have been identified in cattle born after the reinforced animal food ban, for reasons that are still unclear
[normal] (21)
[normal]. For these reasons, the dietary risk of primary infection with BSE is now very much lower in the UK
[normal] than previously
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Secondary transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion
[normal],
[normal] organ/tissue transplantation,
[normal] the use of UK-derived plasma products
[normal] or contaminated surgical instruments remains a possible risk, 
[normal]and thousands of individuals in the UK have been identified and notified as being “at increased risk” of vCJD due to potential exposures by these routes, of which the largest single group is adult patients with haemophilia. These individuals are though
[normal]t
[normal] to be at a sufficiently increased risk of vCJD that they in turn might transmit the infection to another person. Such individuals have to undergo “public health precautions” (see below) when accessing healthcare
[normal] (
[normal]www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/

[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4. What procedures are currently in place to monitor, control and prevent further spread of vCJD across the UK population? What more could be done to reduce the risk posed by vCJD?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]NCJ
[normal]DRSU is funded by DH to monitor 
[normal]all forms of human prion diseas
[normal]e across the UK, including vCJD:

[normal]3[bold]. Close interactions with Public Health specialists across the UK to help identify and manage any potential incidents associated with surgical and occupational vCJD exposures. 
[normal]4[bold]. Wide collaboration in enhanced surveillance 
[normal](including tissue-based surveillance) 
[normal]for evidence of clinical or subclinical infection 
[normal]in groups of patients designated as 
[normal]being 
[normal]at “increased risk” of vCJD.
[normal]5[bold]. Research in developing diagnostic tests and refining diagnostic criteria
[normal] for vCJD.

[normal]vCJD cases that have occurred in 11 other countries.
[normal]7[bold]. Research into the properties of the vCJD agent, including its transmission characteristics in collaboration with other researchers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An effective 
[normal]UK 
[normal]surveillance system is absolutely critical to monitor the incidence and features of all forms of 
[normal]human prion diseases, including vCJD. NCJDRSU identified vCJD at an early stage in the emergence of this new disease, and the current surveillance methodology will allow the early identification of any change in the prevalence of clinical vCJD. The combined clinical, pathological and epidemiological approach used by NCJDRSU will 
[normal]aid
[normal] the early identification of any new forms of human prion disease, e.g. vCJD in 
[normal]PRNP
[normal] codon 129 VV and MV genotypes. The close links established between
[normal] NCJDRSU and 
[normal]Public Health/
[normal]Health Protection Agencies and Blood Transfusion
[normal]/Transplant
[normal] Authorities in the UK 
[normal]allows 
[normal]the 
[normal]early identification, monitoring and management of any incidents with the potential for transmission of vCJD in a healthcare setting. 
[normal]NCJDRSU has submitted a project outline to DH to address the questions over the prevalence of clinical vCJD in the elderly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A number of 
[normal]population 
[normal]measures have been introduced in the UK to control and

[normal]oss the UK population; these have been
[normal] based on risk assessment and risk management advice from a range of bodies including 
[normal]the World Health Organisation, 
[normal]DH, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs, the Advisory Committee for Dangerous Pathogens 
[normal](ACDP) and the ACDP Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy 
[normal]Subgroup, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
[normal] (NICE)
[normal],

[normal]Measures currently in place to reduce the risk of vCJD transmission via blood
[normal] (
[normal]www.gov.uk/government/news/measures-currently-in-place-in-the-uk-to-reduce-the-potential-risk-of-vCJD-transmission-via-blood
[normal])
[normal] (April 2013)
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1997[bold]: Blood components, plasma products or tissues from any individual who later develops clinical vCJD are withdrawn/recalled to prevent their use.
[normal]1998[bold]. Recombinant clotting factors for the treatment of haemophilia provided to patients under the 
[normal]age of 16, and since 2005 this wa
[normal]s extended to all patients for whom it is suitable.
[normal]1999[bold]: Leucodepletion used in all blood for transfusion
[normal].
[normal]1999[bold]: Plasma for the manufacture of fractionated plasma products is obtained from non-UK sources.
[normal]2004[bold]: Individuals who received a transfusion of blood components since January 1980 are excluded from donating blood
[normal].
[normal]2004[bold]: Exclusion criteria for blood donation were extended to previously transfused platelet donors and donors who are unsure if they have ever received a blood transfusion.
[normal]2004-5[bold]: Fresh frozen plasma for treating babies and children born on or after 1
[normal]st
[normal] January 1996 is obtained from the USA.
[normal]2005[bold]: Individuals who donated blood to recipients who later developed clinical vCJD and excluded from blood donation and the donation of tissues and organs for transplantation.
[normal]In addition, efforts have been successful in promoting the appropriate use of blood in the NHS, especially in reducing the use of blood in surgery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]. 
[normal]The NICE guideline “Patient safety and reduction of risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) via interventional procedures
[normal]” was published in 2006, particularly addressing the risks of neurosurgical transmission of all forms of CJD.
[normal]3[bold]. Decontamination standards in UK
[normal] hospitals and dental practices have been reviewed and guidelines established to ensure uniform high standards of the cleaning and decontamination of surgical instruments and endoscopes. DH has commissioned a 
[normal]b
[normal]ody of research into 
[normal]novel approaches to decontamination of prions.
[normal]4[bold]. 
[normal]Definite, probable or possible case of human prion disease, including vCJD and those identified as being at “increased risk” of vCJD are excluded from 
[normal]blood, 
[normal]organ and tissue donation.
[normal]5[bold]. The ACDP g
[normal]uidance 
[normal]to “Minimise transmission risk of 
[normal]CJD and vCJD in healthcare settings
[normal]” was first published in 2003 and subsequently updated (available at 
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-from-the-acdp-tse-risk-management-subgroup-formerly-tse-working-group
[normal]). Further guidance is available to local public health/health protection teams
[normal] 
[normal]on the “
[normal]Public health actions to be taken following a report of a new case of CJD or a person at increased risk of CJD. Colindale (London)
