defaultBackground to my redefaultsearch on human prion diseases defaultthat is relevant to the questions defaultthatdefault I have been invited to defaultresponddefault to for this Evidence Sessiondefault. default&#xa0;
defaultI am Professor of Clinical Neuropathology in the University of Edinburgh and Honorary Consultant Neuropathologist in NHS Lothian Hospitals Division. I have worked in the 
defaultUK 
defaultNational CJD 
defaultSurveillance Unit (now renamed as 
defaultt
defaulthe National CJD Research &amp; Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU)) since it was established by the Department of Health in 1990 in the University of Edinburgh. The key aim
defaults
default of NCJDRSU 
defaultare
default to 
defaultmonitor the characteristics of all forms of CJD, to identify trends in incidence rates, to study risk factors for the development of disease and to contribute to improving the quality of care for those with CJD
default (
defaultwww.cjd.ed.ac.uk
default)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 1996, my colleagues and I identified a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) that 
defaultis known as variant CJD (vCJD)
default (28
default)
default, and in collaboration with other researchers we demonstrated that the infectious agent or prion causing vCJD (but not 
defaultsporadic CJD (sCJD), the commonest form of CJD
default) closely resembled the prion causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
default in its biochemical profile on Western blot assay 
default(5) 
defaultand on experimental transmission in a strain typing assay
default (3)
default. On the basis of this finding, vCJD is often referred to as “the human form of BSE”. Since then, my colleagues and I have monitored the incidence of vCJD in the UK and studied in detail the clinical and neuropathological features of the disease
default (11,16)
default. We also undertook 
defaultepidemiological studies and 
defaulta case control study (funded by DH)
default (27
default)
default to identify risk factors for vCJD, and produced a set of 
defaultdiagnostic criteria that was accepted by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
default (30
default)
default; NCJDRSU is now both a national and international referral centre for cases of suspected vCJD. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NCJDRSU 
defaultwebsite (
defaultwww.cjd.ed.ac.uk
default) 
defaultgives updated information on all forms of CJD in the UK and has figures for all the vCJD cases in the UK
default (current total 177 cases)
default, including data on the incidence and death rates from this disease
default, both of which show a decline in recent years
default. 
defaultMost cases of vCJD occur in young adults with a median age at death of 28 years; the age at death has not changed greatly 
defaultover time
default. Only 5 cases of vCJD have been identified in patients aged 60 years and over. 
defaultAll definite cases of vCJD (that have been confirmed pathologically) belong to a genetic subgroup of the population defined by a 
defaultnaturally occurring
default polymorphism at codon 129 in the open reading frame of the prion protein gene 
default(
defaultPRNP
default) 
defaulton chromosome 22. Either methionine (M) or valine (V) can be encoded, resulting in 3 possible genotypes: MM, MV and VV
default (Table 1)
default. All definite vCJD cases possess the MM genotype. There is evidence that the MV and VV genotypes 
defaultare 
defaultbe susceptible to vCJD infection 
default(2,8,17,
default22
default) 
defaultand  as this polymorphism is known to influence the incubation period of other acquired human prion diseases, e.g. kuru
default (6
default,
default19
default)
default, it is possible that vCJD cases may yet emerge in these genotypes in the future.

default (8,17,
default22
default)
default&#xa0;
defaultWe studied the tissue distribution 
defaultin the body 
defaultof the abnormal prion protein in vCJD, and found that in addition to accumulating in the central nervous sy
defaults
defaulttem (CNS), it was widely distributed in lymphoid tissues throughout the body, including the spleen, lymph nodes, tonsil
defaults
default and 
defaultPeyer’s patches in the gut
default (10)
default. In collaboration with colleagues we 
defaultlater
default 
defaultconfirmed 
defaultprion
default infectivity in these tissues, with lower levels present in lymphoid tissues than in the CNS
default (4)
default. In anoth
defaulter collaborative study we 
defaultdemonstrated evidence that blood (packed red blood cells) transfused from individuals who subsequently died from vCJD was infectious
default, 
defaultand 
defaulthad 
defaulttransmitted vCJD infection on four occasions
default (12,
default22
default)
default. Since then much research has been carried out to develop a blood test for vCJD,
default 
defaultand although one test has shown promise in patients with the signs and symptoms of vCJD
default (7)
default, it is not yet known if 
defaultpreclinical vCJD 
defaultinfections can be detected. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn collaboration with colleagues, we identified 
defaultappendix
default tissue s
defaultamples
default that had been removed from some individuals who subsequently developed and died from vCJD, and found that the abnormal prion protein coul
defaultd accumulate in lymphoid follicles in the appendix
default before the onset of symptoms of vCJD
default (13,14)
default. This finding l
defaultead to the hypothesis that the prevalence
default of vCJD infection in the UK could be estim
defaultated by studying lymphoid follicle

defaultwith
default no signs or symptoms of vCJD
default)
default to detect the presence of the disease-associated prion protein, which accumulates in these tissues in vCJD, but not in other forms of CJD
default. 
defaultI have been involved in 2 major 
defaultstudies on the tissue-based prevalence of vCJD in the UK
default (8,15) 
defaultthe most recent of which estimates that around 1 in 2,000 individual
defaults
default in the UK may be infected with the prion that causes vCJD
default.

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultResponsedefaultsdefault to questionsdefault posed:default&#xa0;default1. defaultWhat do you consider to be the likely prevalence of subclinical vCJD infection in the UK population? What evidence is there to support this view?defaultIt is difficult to measure the precise prevalence of 
defaultsubclinical
default vCJD infection in the UK population, since there is no validated screening test (e.g. a blood test) of high specificity and sensitivity for asymptomatic vCJD infection. The only estimates of  subclinical vCJD prevalence have been derived from tissue-based studies, where 
defaultformalin-fixed 
defaultparaffin-embedded blocks of appendix and/or tonsil specimens from NHS Histopathology Department archives have been screened in large numbers to demonstrate the presence of disease-associated prion protein by immunohistochemistry
default (8,15)
default. These tissues contain lymphoid follicles with follicular dendritic cells, which appear to support prion replication in vCJD. Immunohistochemistry has identified the accumulation
default of disease-assoc

default 
defaulthas not 
defaultdetected disease-associated prion protein 
defaultin these tissues in 
defaultpatients with 
defaults
defaultCJD.
default&#xa0;
defaultTwo major
default studies using 
defaulta tissue-based
default approach have been reported in UK, 
defaultboth
default of which were given research ethics approval requiring the use of anonymised samples from patient
defaults of known birth cohorts
default (8,
default15)
default. In 200
default4, my colleagues and I reported a study 
defaultfunded by DH 
defaultof over 12,500 tonsil and appendix samples: 11,109 were appendix samples, 3 of which were positive and were obtained from patients aged 20-29 years of age when operated on in 1996-99
default (15)
default. 
default Experimental transmission was attempted on material from one of the positive samples, which was unsuccessful
default (2
default6
default)
default. 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 analysis was performed on 
defaultDNA extracted from 
defaultthe other 2 positive 
defaultsamples, showing both cases to be VV
default (17)
default. 
defaultThe estimated prevalence of vCJD infection from this study was higher than the number of vCJD cases would have indicated: around 1 in 4000 of the UK population
default, with wide confidence intervals
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther research was 
defaultrequired to confirm this finding, and DH funded a larger 
defaultimmunohistochemical study to detect disease-associated prion protein in UK appendix samples, including data on 
defaultbirth cohort
default, gender and 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 genotype for each individual in the study. This was recently reported in the British Medical Journal
default (8)
default; 
default16/32441 
defaultcases were positive, of which 6 were 
defaultin the 1941-60 birth cohort and 10 in the 1961-85 birth cohort. 
default10 cases were males and 6 females; 
default8 cases were MM at 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129, 4 were MV and 4 VV.
default 
defaultThese findings give an estimated prevalence of vCJD infection in the UK population of 1 in 2000, with wide confidence intervals. The results of the 2004 and the 2013 studies are 
defaultconsistent with each other
default, particularly in view of the wide confidence intervals in both studies.
default The estimates from the more recent study are, however, more precise.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the basis of these findings, 
defaultI consider it 
defaultno
defaultt
default unreasonable to conclude that the prevalence of subclinical vCJD infection in the UK 
defaultmay be
default around 1
default in
default 2,000 of the population
default and that all genetic subgroups are susceptible
default. However, 
defaultsome
default caveats have to be
default 
defaulttaken into account:
default&#xa0;
defaultidefault. 
defaultThe positive results 
defaultreported 
defaultmight be 
defaultfalse positives, either due to 
defaultnon-specific 
defaultstaining,
default or 
defaultpositivity due to 
defaultother human prion diseases e.g. sCJD
default. The question of non-specific staining is being addressed in an on
default-
defaultgoing DH-funded study of appendixes removed from the 1970s and earlier – before BSE is thought to have entered the human food chain. Immunohistochemistry has not detected accumulation of disease-associated prion protein in sections of appendixes, tonsils and spleens from individuals who have died from sCJD, although one report exists of very low levels of disease-associated prion protein detected in unfixed samples of the spleen in a subgroup of sCJD patients by Western blot assay, a method considered to have a greater sensitivity
default (9)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultiidefault. The positive results
default reported, if true positives, might give an underestimate
default of the prevalence of vCJD infection in the UK population, since immunohistochemistry is 
defaultperhaps 
defaultnot as sensitive as other assays, e.g. Western blot, for the detection of disease-associated prion protein in tissues. However, Western blot assays require unfixed tissues, and all the samples in UK Histopathology Department archives are formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.
default&#xa0;
default2. How might this subclinical infection rate translate to future cases of vCJD? What are the key uncertainties in the relationship between clinical and subclinical vCJD?defaultI am uncertain as to how this estimated subclinical infection rate might translate to future cases of vCJD. All confirmed cases of vCJD so far belong to the
default PRNP
default codon 129 MM genetic subgroup. 
defaultA possible case of vCJD has been reported in the UK in a MV patient (18)
default, but this case did not undergo autopsy and did not fulfil the criteria for a probable case of vCJD.
default 
defaultIt is reasonable to assume that at least some of the MM cases identified in the recent appendix survey by Gill et al (
default8
default) might go on to develop vCJD, but the same conclusion cannot be reached for the MV and VV groups. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have published evidence to suggest that a MV individual became infected with vCJD as the result of a transfusion with packed red blood cells from a donor who later went on to die from vCJD
default (22
default)
default. The recipient
default died from an unrelated cause 5 years after the transfusi
defaulton, but did not develop vCJD prior to death
default. Examination of brain and spinal cord samples from the post-mortem examination showed no evidence of vCJD prion infection, but the disease-associated prion was detected in the spleen and lymph nodes by immunohistochemistry and also in the spleen by Western blot assay.
default 
defaultThe presence of vCJD infectivity in the spleen was subsequently confirmed by experimental transmission
default (1)
default. This informative case demonstrates several key points:
default&#xa0;
default1default. vCJD prions (transmitted in this case by blood transfusion) can infect individuals of the 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 MV genotype
default.
default2default. vCJD infection can result in a subclinical infection for at least 5 years, during which 
defaulttime 
defaultthe lymphoid tissues in the body 
defaultare likely to be
default 
defaultinfectious
default.
default3default.
default Individuals with subclinical vCJD may therefore be capable of spreading vCJD infectivity to other by blood transfusion or though surgical instruments used on lymphoid tissues, 
defaulte.g.
default tonsil, spleen, appendix.
default4default.
default Positive immunohistochemistry for disease-associated prion protein in lymphoid tissues can be a true marker of prion infectivity
default.
default5default. vCJD infection in an 
defaultindividual of the 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 MV genotype retains its biochemical profile on Western blot assay.
default&#xa0;
defaultStudies of kuru, an extinct disease identified in the 1950s in Papua New Guinea, showed that the disease was spread by from person to person due to dietary practices in certain remote tribes, and became an important cause of death, particularly in women and children. The incubation period for Kuru was influenced by the 
defaultPRNP 
defaultcodon 129 genotype, with the shortest incubation periods in the MM genotype and longer periods in the other genotypes particularly in the MV genotype, where incubation periods of over 40 years were identified
default (6,
default19)
default. The effect 
defaultof the 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 genotype o
defaultn incubation periods may depend on the stain of the infectious prion, as in 
defaultiatrogenic CJD occurring as a consequence of treatment with 
defaulthuman growth hormone in 
defaultthe USA, 
defaultFrance and the UK. 
defaultThe first of these cases in the UK was reported in 1985
default (24
default,
default25
default)
default, since when there have been over 60 cases (5 in 2012 and 1 so far in 2013), with incubation periods of over 30 years in some individuals. These
default observations suggest that differences in 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 genotype
defaults
default may result in very prolonged incubation periods
default for vCJD
default, during which the infected individuals may represent a source of secondary infection to others in the population. Infected individuals may die of other causes before they develop signs and symptoms of prion infection. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe key uncertainties in the relationship between clinical and subclinical vCJD are:
default&#xa0;
default1
default. The influence of the 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 genotype on the emergence of clinical disease – will clinical vCJD only occur in the MM genotype
default, while other genotypes may become 
defaultinfected, but never develop disease
default?
default2
default. The effect of the 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 genotype on 
defaultdisease 
defaultincubation periods, which can extend to several decades.
default There have been very few cases of clinical vCJD in t
defaulthe elderly
default and it is unclear if the diagnosis in this age group is
default complicated by the occurrence of commoner neurodegenerative diseases in this age group, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. Further work to determine more precisely the 
defaultprevalence of clinical vCJD in this population group would help understand more about disease incubation periods and the effects of 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 genotype, 
defaultparticularly in view of the recent finding of apparent subclinical vCJD in 6 cases in the 1941-60 birth cohort in the appendix study by Gill et al (8).
default 
default3
default. C
defaultlinical vCJD in 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 VV and MV 
defaultgenotypes might differ in its clinicopathological features from 
defaultvCJD 
defaultin the MM genotype, although the biochemical profile of the vCJD prion may be preserved, as in the spleen of the 
defaultvCJD
default infection in the 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 MV individual described above
default (1,
default22
default)
default.
default4
default. It is therefore conceivable that subclinical vCJD infection in 
defaultPRNP
default codon 129 VV and MV genotypes could be transmitted to individuals of the
default PRNP
default codon 129 MM genotype, resulting in clinical vCJD.
default We do not know the identity of those individuals identified as being positive for disease-associated prion protein in the appendix studies
default (8,15)
default, but it is conceivable that some of this group may have donated blood or undergone surgery.
default&#xa0;default3. What are the likely routes of infection for vCJD? How have the potential modes of transmission changed over time?default&#xa0;defaultThere is strong evidence to indicate that vCJD results from human infection with the BSE agent
default (3,5)
default. The most likely route of this infection is dietary exposure through the consumption of BSE-infected meat products. Other potential sources of primary BSE infection have been considered, e.g. occupational (farmers, veterinarians, abattoir workers) and medicines or vaccines prepared using bovine components, but no evidence exists to support these possibilities
default (27
default)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also evidence that secondary vCJD transmission can occur from person to person by the transfusion of non-leucodepleted red blood cells
default (12,
default2
default2
default)
default, and by the administration of large volumes of UK-derived plasma products
default (
default2
default3
default)
default. Other possible sources of secondary vCJD transmission include t
defaulthe reuse of surgical instruments 
defaultpreviously used in surgery on the CNS and lymphoid tissues in a patient with subclinical vCJD
default, when the instruments might harbour enough infectivity to cause transmission
default. 
defaultPrions bind to metal surfaces, and inactivation of prion infectivity is difficult to achieve
default (29
default)
default. 
defaultThere is no epidemiolo
defaultgical evidence to indicate that 
defaulttransmission of vCJD
default 
defaultby surgery (including dental surgery) 
defaulthas occurred to date
default (27)
default, although the identificati
defaulton of such instances
default 
defaultis likely to be difficult. 
defaultNo evidence of 
defaultvertical (
defaultmaternal
default)
default transmission of vCJD has occurred so far in children born to mothers who had clinical vCJD during pregnancy
default (20)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe potential modes of transmission of vCJD have changed over time, particularly since 1996, when reinforced measures were introduced to control the entry of BSE-infected meat into the human food chain in the UK. The incidence of BSE has declined significantly since 1996, although occasional cases have been identified in cattle born after the reinforced animal food ban, for reasons that are still unclear
default (21)
default. For these reasons, the dietary risk of primary infection with BSE is now very much lower in the UK
default than previously
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondary transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion
default,
default organ/tissue transplantation,
default the use of UK-derived plasma products
default or contaminated surgical instruments remains a possible risk, 
defaultand thousands of individuals in the UK have been identified and notified as being “at increased risk” of vCJD due to potential exposures by these routes, of which the largest single group is adult patients with haemophilia. These individuals are though
defaultt
default to be at a sufficiently increased risk of vCJD that they in turn might transmit the infection to another person. Such individuals have to undergo “public health precautions” (see below) when accessing healthcare
default (
defaultwww.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/
defaultCreutzfeldtJakobdisease
default)
default.
default&#xa0;default4. What procedures are currently in place to monitor, control and prevent further spread of vCJD across the UK population? What more could be done to reduce the risk posed by vCJD?default&#xa0;
defaultNCJ
defaultDRSU is funded by DH to monitor 
defaultall forms of human prion diseas
defaulte across the UK, including vCJD:

default&#xa0;
defaultAn effective 
defaultUK 
defaultsurveillance system is absolutely critical to monitor the incidence and features of all forms of 
defaulthuman prion diseases, including vCJD. NCJDRSU identified vCJD at an early stage in the emergence of this new disease, and the current surveillance methodology will allow the early identification of any change in the prevalence of clinical vCJD. The combined clinical, pathological and epidemiological approach used by NCJDRSU will 
defaultaid

defaultPRNP

default NCJDRSU and 
defaultPublic Health/
defaultHealth Protection Agencies and Blood Transfusion
default/Transplant
default Authorities in the UK 
defaultallows 
defaultthe 
defaultearly identification, monitoring and management of any incidents with the potential for transmission of vCJD in a healthcare setting. 
defaultNCJDRSU has submitted a project outline to DH to address the questions over the prevalence of clinical vCJD in the elderly.
default&#xa0;
defaultA number of 
defaultpopulation 
defaultmeasures have been introduced in the UK to control and 
defaultprevent the further spread of vCJD acr
defaultoss the UK population; these have been
default based on risk assessment and risk management advice from a range of bodies including
