[normal]Written evidence from Mark Goddard (CYS0140)
[normal]I am a 44 year old male who has been cycling since the age of 16, and driving since the age of 17.  I am both a keen cyclist and driver, and
[normal] I have commuted to work by bicycle for over five years. 
[normal] I currently commute along the same route 
[normal]sometimes
[normal] by car and 
[normal]sometimes by 
[normal]bicycle 5 days a week – typically three times by car and twice by bicycle.  This gives me 
[normal]both perspectives in the cyclist 
[normal]versus driver
[normal] debate.
[normal]  I am keen to get as many people as possible on their bikes because of the huge health and environmental benefits this brings, and because the more people who cycle, the greater driver awareness of us become
[normal]s and the safer it will be
[normal].
[normal]  Perhaps most importantly, cycling offers the most obvious, dramatic and immediate solution to the problem of congestion in urban areas.

[normal]EXECUTIVE SUMMARY [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In my opinion:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please note I am referring above to 
[normal]deliberate
[normal] acts, not mistakes/failure to look/see.

[normal]It is particularly important for the Government to link criminality and bad driving.  This could be achieved by some pointed comparisons.  Imagine two burglars lamenting their bad lu
[normal]ck at being caught, interspersed with footage of the victims trying to deal with the trauma.  Then replay the same scene but with two drivers complaining about being fined for speeding interspersed with footage of parents visiting their son, a road acciden
[normal]t victim, in hospital.  The first conversation is morally offensive, the second not only acceptable but repeated up and down the country every day.

[normal]If a significant proportion of cyclists are record
[normal]ing their rides, not only will this assist prosecution of aggressive drivers but it will have a deterrent effect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To enhance the deterrent effect, the Government could promote the provision of dummy cycle cams (available for sale at a low price) for any c
[normal]yclist who does not want the weight of a real camera on their helmet
[normal] but wants to deter aggressiveness
[normal].
