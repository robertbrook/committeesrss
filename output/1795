[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Headway Cambridgeshire provides specialist social rehabilitation services and support to people with a brain injury and other neurological conditions and their families, across the county and in Peterborough.  
[normal]We 
[normal]work closely with health, social care, the independent sector and other agencies to ensure services are as seamless as possible.   We provide this help right through the support pathway:

[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Overall, we currently support 109 hub-based client placements each week and last year we had 1,500 contacts with our community clients.   Our turnover for 2013-14 is forecast as £617,000.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The population of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough combined is 831,000 (2011 census).  Cambridgeshire is a large county and extremely rural in parts (the Fens in particular), and there are many isolated communities.  It should be noted that because of their head injury and the consequent impairments, our clients are particularly vulnerable and lacking in confidence and sometimes the skills to engage with their local communities. This makes our client group particularly isolated, as well as the geographic areas in which they live.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We set up a number of client focus groups to discuss transport issues and what follows includes this feedback as well as the experience of the organisation. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]The common themes from client discussion were:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SUMMARY
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RESPONSE
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome Cambridge County Council’s current consultation on their transport strategy and we will respond to that in due course.  What we would like to see, is more thought about how major transport infrastructure is implemented.  For instance the Cambridgeshire Guided 
[normal]Busway
[normal] introduced in 2011 and the longest guided bus route in the world, costing £181 million, has its problems for those physically less able.  One of our clients travels from Cambridge to his friend in St Ives.  He can get on the guided bus in Cambridge, but there is a big step down from the bus at the station in St Ives which is very difficult to manage.  Other clients found this disappointing and surprising considering how new the route is and how much it cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In Cambridgeshire there are very isolated villages, and although 
[normal]Teversham
[normal] is not far from Cambridge, one client who lives in the village said “Our village bus has stopped running.  If my husband didn’t have a car, I’d be house-bound and without the money for a taxi, I wouldn’t be able to access Headway rehabilitation services.  I can’t imagine my life without Headway.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our clients are heavily reliant on public transport wherever they live.  One or two are able to  cycle and very few, because of the nature of their injury, are able to drive. However, if you are not able to work and live off a mixture of benefits, affordable public transport is a key issue.  If it is available, it has to be suitable, as one client said, “I can’t get on a bus if the two wheelchair allocated spaces are already taken.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We think one of the main challenges is the lack of consistency in the provision of disabled access, for instance one client told us, “The bus arrived in Melbourne to take me to my hospital appointment at 
[normal]Addenbrooke’s
[normal] hospital.  It was a replacement bus, the usual one had a puncture, and didn’t have a wheelchair ramp.  I couldn’t get on the bus.  I missed my appointment.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Another said, “I choose to use trains and not buses because I am visually impaired and don’t know which bus is coming when it approaches.  If there were a system telling me at the bus stop the destination of the next bus, then I’d know to put out my hand.  Also, once on the bus, I don’t know where to get off.  Whereas on the train the 
[normal]next station is announced.  I am lucky to have a local train service.  Were I dependent on buses, I’d be stuck at home.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This was a common factor for all those visually impaired. Buses proved difficult to use; they may be able to see the bus coming, but they couldn’t see the destination on the front nor read a timetable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is good provision but it is patchy and if you live in villages there are often no buses, or very few each day.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Other feedback talked about the unreliability of public transport; it was expensive and there was no choice!  One of our clients even complained about the bad swearing by the bus drivers, in “many different languages”.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Community transport is often heavily relied upon and volunteer drivers were praised, although one of our clients felt that the cost was still too expensive (the cost of petrol only).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, our services heavily rely on volunteer drivers, co-ordinated by the County Council for the majority of our hub-based clients.  It could be improved if it was more ‘joined up’ in two very obvious ways: 1) by one car collecting clients from the same area in one trip rather than have two separate cars collecting two different clients and 2) if there was more sharing amongst non-urgent patient transport (NHS) and social care, or even other agencies who transport clients to and from their homes to support services.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To some extent it is inevitable that if you are geographically isolated, you cannot expect the same level of transport service you would receive living in the centre of Cambridge where transport services are good.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, Personal Independence Payments (PIP) that includes daily living and mobility elements, do not reflect where you live so assuming you had the same impairment you would receive the same payment whether you lived in the centre of Cambridge or in the Fens.  So if you lived in Cambridge you could access a disabled-friendly bus for £3 a return journey if around the City, but in the Fens you would be lucky to access any bus and it would cost a lot more than £3 for a return journey to 
[normal]Wisbech
[normal] for instance.  A client is expected to pay for taxis with their PIP but this is not realistic even assuming the taxi was disabled-friendly, because of the cost.  The current system is inequitable and Headway Cambridgeshire would like to see increased daily living and mobility payments for those living in isolated communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The biggest challenge has to be the pressure on the County Council’s budget.  We have seen a significant decline in referrals by the County Council for clients 
[normal]accessing our services because of the cost of transport, which can cost more than the daily cost of access to our services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2011 Cambridgeshire County Council (Adult Social Services) reduced our fees by 3% and they have not increased since. Open discussion with the commissioners has revealed that it is the cost of transport that is driving the cut in access to our services (a fall in income of  £45,000) since 2011. Their policy is that they will no longer support any transport costs to access our services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a response, we have introduced an additional service based in the client’s own home, and whilst the County will not be paying the transport costs directly, we have had to incorporate the cost of staff travel into the fee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, one of the very important elements in our social rehabilitation model, is peer support and a reduction in social isolation.  We offer strategies to support clients improve their confidence and cognitive competence,  and ability to moderate sometimes challenging behaviour that can isolate them from their communities, so hub-based services for many clients (not all) is essential to ensure clients live well and get the most out of life.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.4 
[normal]              
[normal]We think existing transport services can be made more affordable by a more joined up approach and working with non urgent medical transport and other agencies transporting clients or patients around the county.  But this needs a shared will to do this and a preparedness to be more radical rather than ‘tinkering around the edges’ of a very fundamental problem in a very rural county.
