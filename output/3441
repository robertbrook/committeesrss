[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1. Introduction[bold]Ovarian Cancer Action strives to stop women in the UK dying from ovarian cancer.  We fund world-class scientific research to improve accurate and earlier detection of ovarian cancer, more effective treatments to combat the disease and improved quality of life after diagnosis.
[normal]Ovarian Cancer Action campaigns to ensure women and healthcare providers know risk factors, symptoms and treatment options to enable informed and rapid action.  Fundamentally we demand that every woman should have the best treatment available. 
[normal]2. Public Health England and ovarian cancer: responsibilities[bold]Public Health England (PHE) is tasked with the mission to protect and improve the nation’s health and to address inequalities.  PHE can play a pivotal role in enabling the public to be better informed about the symptoms and diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and the role of genetic testing in early detection and prevention.  Only through systemic changes will improvements be made in the way ovarian cancer is researched, diagnosed, treated and potentially prevented.
[normal]We have addressed four of the key responsibilities of Public Health England and submit our proposals for action:
[normal]2A. Supporting the public so they can protect and improve their own health.[bold]Diagnosis
[normal]Prevention
[normal]2B. Researching, collecting and analysing data to improve our understanding of health and come up with answers to public health problems.[bold]2C. Reporting on improvements in the public’s health so everyone can understand the challenge and the next steps.[bold]Public Health England has a role in publicising both improvements and deteriorations in the public’s health.  The Office for National Statistics recently published cancer survival statistics which, although pointing to minor improvements in five year survival rates for ovarian cancer, acknowledged that survival in England at one and five years was generally lower than in other comparably wealthy countries.  
[normal]Information such as this must be recognised and action taken to change outcomes.
[normal]2D. Helping local authorities and the NHS to develop the public health system and its specialist workforce.  [bold]Treatment
[normal]3. Public Health England and ovarian cancer: priorities[bold]Amongst PHE’s priorities for 2014 is promoting the development of place-based public health systems.  Ovarian Cancer Action recommends that women are treated by expert clinical staff in major specialist centres.  Information about the outcomes of treatment at these centres must be made freely available.
[normal]4. Further information[bold]Ovarian Cancer Action would be glad to answer any questions the Health Select Committee has.  We can contribute a specific report on the benefits of rapid genetic testing for families affected by BRCA1/2 gene mutations and the implications for treating and preventing ovarian cancer.
