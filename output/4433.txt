[[[ Fraud Claims]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013 &#xa0; The agreement allows for two rates of payment: Rate B is the standard rate; and Rate A is a discounted rate that factors in early payment (within 90 days). It is estimated by Medical Reporting Organisations (MROs) that around 75% of all medical reports prepared in Road Traffic Accident cases valued at up to £15,000 are obtained via MROs who are signatories to the Agreement.
