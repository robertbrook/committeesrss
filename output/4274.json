"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Colin Farrant&#xa0;\nI\n understand that the Environmental Audit Committee is looking into plastic carrier bags and the pending ‘tax’.\n&#xa0;\nApart from the inevitable decimation of the industry that make and supply these carrier bags, my concerns are twofold.\n1.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat will be exempt and why\n.\n2.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow can all plastic products be made in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way.\nMy understanding is that a ‘biodegradable bag’ will be exempt from the tax. Up until now, the Government and Defra have consistently said that all post-consumer packaging should be reduced, reused or recycled.\nReduced – almost all packaging has been lightweighted or reduced to its limit. Most reductions have been led as a money saving exercise not an environmentally friendly exercise.\nReused. The plastic carrier bag is the most efficient, effective, cost efficient and environmentally friendly product. It is widely reused in most households in many guises as well as being reused by shoppers instead of taking further new ones.\nPaper, recycled materials, bags for life, etc. all have a greater impact on the environment. The anti-carrier bag lobby should be the anti littering lobby, as littering of carrier bags is the problem not the bags themselves.\nRecycle. There are so few easily accessible and economically viable recycling systems for post-consumer flexible packaging that recycling levels of flexible plastics is negligible. The carrier bag is one of the few flexible plastics that is most often reused that to tax it out of existence seems foolhardy.\nAnyway, the decision has been made and my understanding is that your Committee is looking at the details of the implementation and what will be allowed and what exempt.\nInevitably, many interested parties are lobbying to protect their industry. One of the loudest is that of the recycling industry who says they do not want anything other than pure 100% oil based plastics to enter the recycling stream. And they have a point, but the quantities are currently so small of non\n&#xa0;\n 100% oil based resin as make no material difference. The current problems of the consumer identifying different types of 100% plastics let alone those with oxo-degradable additives or being made from some sort of plant source, far out way this concern and the issues of the quality of the recycled material. Furthermore the price of recycled material is rapidly increasing, and in some cases already higher than virgin material that the manufacturers of plastics will revert to type (as above) and make their products from the cheapest products leaving mountains of recycled plastic unused. The carbon footprint of recycling is also very questionable.\nThe reality is that retailers and plastic producers have very little interest in providing a more environmentally friendly plastic because the cost is more and have differing benefits and failings. I have approached all the major retailers and almost without exception they are happy to hide behind ‘this packaging is recyclable’ – and therefore they have undertaken their \nresponsibilities - even though they are totally aware that the vast majority of it will end up in landfill.\nThe packaging producers are frightened to take new ideas and innovations to the retailers for fear of unwarranted challenges to the technology, so continue to offer the unstainable use of oil based resin based products and do nothing to sway public opinion that plastic products are not the evil that some like to make them out to be.\nWhatever is included in plastic that reduces the levels of litter; reduces the level oil based resins used; and reduces the uneducated perception of plastic products should be welcomed and encouraged by the Government. Products containing oxo-degradable additives have certain drawbacks but are surely better than not being used, if used in the right circumstances. Plant based bio plastics also have drawbacks but again, if used in the correct circumstances, should be encouraged.\nI sell a completely different product that replaces the amount of oil based resin by up to 40%, is from a truly sustainable source that would otherwise be waste and most importantly does not add cost to the end product unlike most other products in this market place. I do not want to make a sales pitch, I just want your Committee to urge the outcome of your investigations to embrace all technology and innovations into reducing the use of oil for plastic production, reducing the effect of littering and forcibly encouraging the retailers to move off the fence of ‘it is recyclable’ to ‘we are actively trying to do something about it’.\n10 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
