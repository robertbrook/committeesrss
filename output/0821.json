"Written evidence from the British Pain Society and the RCGP Clinical Champion for Chronic Pain (LTC 71)We\n wish to draw the attention of the Health Select Committee to the fact that chronic pain has very limited visibility and \nprioritisation\n in the Long Term Conditions agenda. This is despite pain being \nrecogni\ns\ned\n in parliament as a Long Term Condition on the 1\nst\n February 2012 (www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ cm201212/\ncmhansrd\n/cm120201/ text/120201w0002.htm).\nTwo recent high level reports,\n \nboth published in December 2012, The National Pain Audit and the Health Survey England, were acknowledged and reported by Sir Bruce Keogh in one of his recent bulletins \nhttp://mdbulletin.dh.gov.uk/2013/01/23/chronic-pain-audit/\nThe Health Survey for England revealed more than 14 million sufferers of chronic pain. The study found that pain is more common among some groups than others, incurs significant costs and has serious mental health and wellbeing implications.\nThe National Pain Audit showed the quality of life that chronic pain patients endure (average quality of life score (\nEuroQol\n) 0.4) is extremely low and also the inequity in the wide variation of\n availability and types of pain services that are available across England. On a positive note the audit showed the benefit of patients attending chronic pain services.\nWe\n would contend that chronic pain is one of , if the not the commonest Long Term Condition,\n \nbut as yet there is no suggestion that it should be part of routine care planning for patients who are having the rest of their multiple co-morbidities frequently assessed.\nWe \nwould ask the Health Select Committee to review this issue. \nThe British Pain Society or the RCGP\n Clinical Champion for Chronic Pain\n would be happy to appear before the Committee to give further evidence regarding this enormous problem\n.\nMay 2013\n"
