[[[Written Evidence]]]

[[[ from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]]

[[[Introduction]]]This written evidence contains contributions from the following Government Departments: BIS, DfID, DH, DECC, DfT and HMT.1.&#xa0; Food security is a broad theme which encapsulates challenges to Governments and society over a wide range of topics.  It links to global agricultural production and markets, competitiveness, population growth, poverty, environmental impacts and technological developments. Activities across Government and internationally are trying to address these challenges. They are challenges that cannot be addressed by the UK alone, but rather by the UK as part of an international community. 2.&#xa0; The 2011 Government Office for Science’s Foresight Report, ‘The Future of Food and Farming’ explored the increasing pressures on the global food system between now and 2050, and asked how a future global population of 9 billion people can all be fed healthily and sustainably. It stated that on the demand side, global population size will increase from nearly seven billion today to eight billion by 2030, and probably to over nine billion by 2050; many people are likely to be wealthier, creating demand for a more varied, high-quality diet requiring additional resources to produce. On the production side, competition for land, water and energy will intensify. Recent FAO projections state that globally, demand for food is expected to increase by around 38% by 2030 and by 60% by 2050.3.&#xa0; The Foresight report identified factors increasing pressure on finite land and marine resources - which include climate change, demographic shifts, changing patterns of work, and habitation - that will create major challenges and intensify the demands we make on our land and seas. 4.&#xa0; The Foresight report identified five key challenges to the future, which the Government has used to inform and shape actions to address food security:i.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Balancing future demand and supply sustainablyii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensuring adequate stability in food pricesiii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Achieving global access to food and ending hungeriv.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Managing the contribution of the food system to the mitigation of climate changev.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services while feeding the world.5.&#xa0; The report remains a significant part of the Government evidence and analysis base with regards to global and UK food security.

[[[UK food security – key messages ]]]6.&#xa0; 

[[[The UK currently enjoys a high degree of food security]]] in terms of access, availability, resilience and variety of food supply.  This is built on both a strong food production base in the UK and access to a wide variety of markets through the EU and an open, rules-based world trading system. UK food security is supported by consumer prosperity and income, which is addressed through the Government’s focus on growth.7.&#xa0; The evidence for this is in the 

[[[UK Food Security Assessment]]], published in 2010, which analysed the different factors impacting on UK food supply.  It represents

[[[ ]]]the most current and complete analysis of the risks and challenges to UK food supply and places the UK’s food security within a global context.   Further details and a summary can be found in Annex A. In 2012 officials reassessed the report and concluded that it still represents a robust analysis of food security in the UK.8.&#xa0; While there are a number of working definitions of food security, the common elements of these definitions are the availability, access, affordability, safety and resilience of food. The 2010 UK Food Security Assessment analysed the UK’s food security position across six themes relating to these elements – global availability, global resource sustainability, UK availability of access, UK food chain resilience, household food security, and safety and confidence.9.&#xa0; Each theme consists of a headline indicator, which captures a major or representative element of the theme, and several supporting indicators which explore related aspects of the theme. In 2012, an internal analysis of these indicators concluded that the 2010 Assessment remained valid in the medium term but would be updated at 6-8 year intervals if warranted. This reflects the fact that many of the indicators in the assessment are relatively slow-moving or reflect structural issues which do not tend to see significant changes over a short period of time.  However, some indicators have changed slightly since the assessment, for example, global resource sustainability. But even taking these changes into account and given the wide range of factors that frame UK food security, the overall assessment remains very positive.10.&#xa0; Overall, the Assessment concluded that the UK is well placed to deal with future challenges, though the Government continues to monitor the long-term trends that affect our ability to continue to enjoy affordable, safe, nutritious and sustainable food. One clear message is that the UK’s food security depends on being able to source from a variety of stable countries, including domestic production: this diversity of supply enhances security by spreading risks, widening options and keeping prices competitive. Open markets and trade remain the best ways to enable the UK to stay resilient and food secure.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Framework]]]11.&#xa0; The six themes of the UK Food Security Assessment - global availability, global resource sustainability, UK availability of access, UK food chain resilience, household food security, and safety and confidence - reflect a number of underlying factors which are critical for thinking about the UK’s food security:These factors point to the importance of:i.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Measures which ensure that markets operate effectively to transmit price signals from rising demand, particularly measures to liberalise trade in food and agricultural products;ii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The importance of research and development aimed at raising agricultural productivity.

The key things that we are doing to ensure continued food security in the UK are:Before addressing the eight issues on which the Committee has invited evidence, it may be helpful to set out the Government’s overall approach to the food sector.

[[[The Government’s approach to ]]]

[[[the ]]]

[[[food]]]

[[[ sector]]]The Government champions a thriving, competitive British food and farming sector, driving sustainable growth in the wider rural economy in support of rural communities. The food chain has a key role to play in restoring growth to the economy – food and drink is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, and the food chain as a whole accounts for 7.4% of national GVA, and 3 million jobs. Moreover, it is a sector that has continued to grow throughout the recent economic downturn.The Government is supporting the food sector to continue to grow through a range of policies:In the 

[[[short term ]]]the Government is providing support to help the sector grow by, for example:In the 

[[[longer term ]]]the Government is providing strategic support to ensure the long term resilience of the sector to provide the basis for sustainable growth into the future, including ensuring a healthy diet for the UK population, through a range of measures to build resilience and remove barriers to the sector’s success. These include, for example:Building resilience in a global contextThe policies highlighted above focus on what the Government can do within the UK to help the agri-food sectors be the best they can be to contribute to growth and take advantage of expanding world markets, but the UK cannot be seen in isolation. World markets in agricultural commodities and food products are key for the UK food sector, and the UK needs to be prepared to meet a range of global challenges in order to build the long term resilience of the sector. The short and long-term challenges are interrelated: the food chain needs to be competitive and productive in order to continue to be able to deliver high quality, safe and sustainable food, while addressing the future challenges of global food security, climate change and natural resource sustainability, including the environmental impacts of increased demand for food arising from global income and population growth.

[[[How best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently]]]

[[[Key points]]]

[[[:]]]

[[[Detail]]]

[[[:]]]

[[[Trade policy – overall UK approach]]]13.&#xa0;  Overseas trade and inward investment are vital for the UK’s prosperity. The Government aims to help UK businesses succeed internationally and encourage overseas companies to work with the UK. The UK Government is working actively through the EU and internationally to reduce barriers to trade and improve market access multilaterally through the World Trade Organisation as well as through bilateral free trade agreements.  It is also working with industry to open up priority export markets with third countries, and supports companies to understand and make the most of export opportunities. 

[[[EU food security]]]

[[[The impact of]]]

[[[ the]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[CAP and EU trade policy]]]

[[[ on global food security]]]14.&#xa0; The UK view is that the CAP, combined with EU trade policy, has a negative impact on global food security, by: EU applied agricultural tariffs are much higher than on industrial goods:&#xa0;&#xa0;     EU applied import tariffs on selected commodities, 2012&#xa0;beeflambbuttercheesesugarchickenTotal Ad-Valorem Equivalent (AVE) Tariff88%62%71%42%70%26%&#xa0;15.&#xa0; An&#xa0;AVE&#xa0;is a tariff presented as a percentage of the value of goods cleared through customs. Given that the price, and hence, value of agricultural commodities on international markets is volatile, AVE tariff figures related to agriculture can be quite variable between years. Nevertheless, it is clear that the EU still applies markedly high tariffs on imported livestock, dairy and sugar products which act to significantly increase the price of those commodities in Europe. Accordingly, these tariffs not only raise the price of food to consumers but also harm the competitiveness of the European food manufacturing industry who have to pay more for their inputs. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Biofuels]]]16.&#xa0; &#xa0;In the context of rising demand, and against the backdrop of future climate change, biofuel policies have been cited as potentially increasing risks to food security.  The Government believes that the primary goal of agriculture must be food production and that the production of biomass for bioenergy must not undermine food security in the UK or internationally. &#xa0;17.&#xa0; To the extent that biofuels and biomass policies result in an increase in aggregate demand for agricultural feedstocks and/or agricultural land, they will result in higher agricultural product prices over the medium term than would have otherwise been the case. Recent analysis by Defra’s modelling team suggests biofuels support at the EU level could have a medium-term price impact on feedstocks used for biofuels production. Average EU wheat and oilseed prices are projected to be 5% and 17% higher than without EU biofuel policy with knock on impacts downstream in the vegetable oil market. This is broadly consistent with modelling by others. &#xa0;18.&#xa0; There is a distinct question about the extent to which biofuel policies have contributed to recent international agricultural price spikes. A thorough cross-Whitehall analysis of the agricultural price spikes of 2007/8 concluded that biofuels had a relatively small contribution in 2008, particularly as far as wheat was concerned. However, that report also raised a question about the impact of biofuel support policies on the volatility of international prices. &#xa0;19.&#xa0; In the Government’s 2012 Bioenergy strategy, we explored mechanisms for mitigating agricultural price spikes through introducing flexibility into biofuels mandates or other measures. This work revealed the significant potential associated with a mechanism that allows market forces to direct grain between biofuels, animal feed and food markets during a temporary supply shortage and price spike. The report did not examine specifically the implications of this idea for bioenergy markets and stopped short of examining a particular mechanism. We are considering further work to appraise the merits of more specific proposals. &#xa0;20.&#xa0; The Government continues to negotiate within Europe to ensure that food production remains at the core of the EU’s consideration of biofuel policy and to promote the development of ‘advanced biofuels’ derived from wastes and residues, which could significantly reduce the direct competition for food feedstocks. In addition the UK has supported the work of the UN and the World Bank to develop the Responsible Agricultural Investment principles (RAI) and the Voluntary Guidelines on land use which will help to set voluntary international standards for investment in agricultural production including biofuels. &#xa0;

[[[Productivity]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]21.&#xa0; The CAP, trade barriers and biofuels policy all matter because of their direct impacts on food prices.  They also matter because of their impact (along with, for example, R&amp;D) on agricultural productivity.  Recent Defra modelling demonstrates the potential benefits of agricultural productivity.  Assuming that efficiency and productivity improvements in the EU express themselves as yield improvements, and that annual yield improvements were to be double their current (relatively low) level, the impact on EU agricultural prices relative to a 2020 baseline would be significant: 18% lower for wheat, 31% lower for coarse grains (maize and barley), 16% lower for beef and veal, 9% lower for both poultry and pork, 21% lower for milk and butter, and 19% lower for cheese. In all of the commodities referred to, both the EU production figures and net trade position would also be higher/better than the 2020 baseline projections. The estimated impact on 2020 prices (as well as production and the trade balance) is even more significant for grains and meat, if instead one assumes that the EU12 close the current productivity gap with the EU15 by 2020.&#xa0;22.&#xa0; Whilst it may be difficult to model precisely the productivity impact of any given policy reform, it is clear that modest improvements in productivity result in tangible improvements in consumer prices. Agricultural productivity matters for a whole range of reasons, including food security.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Common Fisheries Policy]]]

[[[ (CFP)]]]23.&#xa0; Fishing at sustainable levels, and removing the waste of discarding, will allow us to maximise the yield we can take from our seas in the long term, providing a more stable supply of fish to EU consumers.  Growing populations, growing demand for protein, and growing awareness of the problems facing the marine environment should provide real opportunities to market and profit from stocks that are managed well.24.&#xa0; EU Member States reached agreement to a historic deal to reform the CFP in June this year.  Despite a difficult and protracted negotiation, the UK stood firm on its key priorities, securing a robust ban on the discarding of fish with binding timelines, a process for regionalised decision-making, and legally binding commitments to fish sustainably. 25.&#xa0; These reforms are expected to become law from January 2014, and will benefit fishermen, the food supply chain, and the marine environment.  The reforms agreed provide a crucial opportunity to overcome the failings of the past and put the CFP on a sustainable footing, safeguarding the supply of fish to UK and EU markets for future generations. 26.&#xa0; Improvements to the CFP’s external dimension will also ensure we apply the same principles of sustainability outside EU waters as within.  Europe is the world’s biggest fisheries market and can play a vital role in the global governance of fish stocks and delivering a sustainable future. 

[[[Resource efficiency in the food and drink supply chain]]]27.&#xa0; As part of its wider work to make sure the UK has a secure, environmentally sustainable, affordable supply of food, the UK government is encouraging the UK food and drink industry to use resources more sustainably. Lead trade associations and major businesses have developed sustainability strategies, e.g. the British Retail Consortium’s ‘A Better Retailing Climate’, and the Food and Drink Federation’s ‘Five-fold Environmental Ambition’.28.&#xa0; However, the situation is patchy and further action is needed to improve resource efficiency. Rather than turning immediately to regulation to drive change, the Government aims to encourage collaborative voluntary action. The Product Sustainability Forum (PSF) action on groceries, the Soft Drinks Roadmap, and the UK Statement on Sustainable Palm Oil are recent examples.

[[[Food waste]]]29.&#xa0;  The UK is committed to playing its part in global efforts to reduce food waste, including post-harvest losses, which in turn will reduce the environmental impacts of the food supply chain, and save valuable resources such as water, land and energy used to produce food which ultimately is not eaten. In addition, it will deliver a more efficient supply chain where supply and production of food will be closer to the requirement of consumers. &#xa0;30.&#xa0; The UK is seen as a leader in the EU on food waste prevention. We have worked very successfully with industry to reduce supply chain food and packaging waste by 7.4% over the last 3 years, while household food waste is down by even more - 15% since 2007. This has been achieved through initiatives such as the Courtauld Commitment voluntary agreement with the retail and manufacturing sector (the latest phase of which has prevented a total of 1.7 million tonnes of food and packaging waste, saving around £3.1bn), the Hospitality and Food Service Agreement, and by supporting WRAP’s Love Food Hate Waste campaign, which helps consumers make informed choices on reducing food waste and save money.&#xa0;

[[[roduction activity]]]31.&#xa0; The EU Commission’s 2011 Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe outlines a competitiveness and growth plan for 2050 that is based on a sustainable use of natural resources. The Roadmap identifies the food and drink sector as key priority area in view of its environmental impacts and has a milestone to reduce the food chain’s resource inputs by 20% by 2020. It also states that the Commission will assess how best to limit waste throughout the food supply chain, and consider ways to lower the environmental impact of food production and consumption patterns via a Communication on Sustainable Food, which went out for consultation in October 2013 and is due to be published in Spring 2014. 32.&#xa0; Government has been working closely with the Commission and other Member States regarding the communication on sustainable food. Defra met members of the food and drink sector before responding to the Commission’s consultation in October. Defra also convened a meeting between interested parties and the Commission to ensure that the Commission is aware of the many sustainability and resource-efficiency initiatives undertaken by the UK food industry in recent years. During 2013, Government also brought together a wide range of stakeholders to discuss the role of diet and consumption in the sustainability of the food system, and the roles of different sectors (consumers, media, private sector, government) in addressing consumption patterns.  

[[[The relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing it]]]

[[[Key points:]]]

[[[Detail:]]]33.&#xa0; The UK food chain is competitive relative to many other European countries. According to Eurostat, food prices in Germany are 2% more expensive than the UK. In France, they are 5% more expensive, and in Ireland 13% - UK consumers are benefiting from our competitive market. 34.&#xa0; However, in a competitive market there is less slack when underlying prices do rise. So when there are changes in the fundamental drivers of food price inflation (commodity prices, exchange rate, oil prices), consumer prices will adjust to those underlying changes. Whilst our food prices have risen faster than our neighbours, the average price of food remains lower.35.&#xa0;  Past Competition Commission Inquiries found that, in many important respects, competition in the UK groceries industry is effective and delivers good outcomes for consumers. However, the Competition Commission did identify some issues to do with retailers’ relationships with the rest of the supply chain and retailer concentration in certain local markets. 

[[[The Groceries Code Adjudicator]]]

[[[ (GCA)]]]36.&#xa0; The aim of the GCA is to promote a stronger and more efficient groceries market, bringing better value to consumers through increasing trust between suppliers and retailers by changing their behaviour to follow the Groceries Supply Code of Practice. 37.&#xa0; The GCA will help to ensure a fairer relationship between big retailers and their suppliers by supporting innovation and investment and preventing supermarkets passing on excessive risk and cost to suppliers. This will provide greater stability throughout the supply chain and help consumers, who will benefit from a more robust groceries market. It will not prevent retailers from securing the best deals and passing on benefits to consumers. Prices are a commercial matter, agreed by private negotiation within the parameters of competition law.

In England, the importance of improving the measurement and valuation of ecosystem services will underpin the work of the Natural Capital Committee who will be advising Government on the state of English natural capital.39.&#xa0; The 2011 Natural Environment White Paper recognised that a healthy natural environment is the foundation of sustained economic growth, prospering communities and personal wellbeing. It sets out how the value of nature can be mainstreamed across our society by facilitating local action; strengthening the connections between people and nature; creating a green economy and showing leadership in the EU and internationally.

[[[The implications of volatility in th]]]

[[[e global food supply and demand for UK food security]]]

[[[Key points:]]]

[[[Detail:]]]

[[[Agricultural]]]

[[[ commodity markets]]]40.&#xa0; Price volatility is an inherent characteristic of global agricultural commodity markets and has long characterised them. This is due to the dependence of production on weather patterns, the relative insensitivity of demand to food price changes, and production lags.  41.&#xa0; Some degree of price volatility is therefore normal but volatility tends to be highest in ‘thin’ international markets where a small proportion of global production is traded (e.g., the global rice market) or when there are adverse policy responses to market developments such as export bans. However historic attempts to manage price levels and/or reduce price volatility have been unsuccessful.42.&#xa0; Despite the agricultural price spikes experienced in 2007/8 and more recently, there is little evidence to suggest that price volatility has increased over time. Indeed, analysis for the Foresight report concluded that agricultural price volatility over the two most recent decades has generally been lower than in the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, it should be noted that spikes seen in the early 1970s were far larger in real terms (i.e. accounting for inflation) than recent spikes. 43.&#xa0; However there is a risk that price volatility (and the frequency of price spikes) could increase in the future, mainly due to more volatile energy prices and extreme weather events associated with climate change. Conversely, increased trade between countries, deeper international markets for agricultural goods and the avoidance of adverse policy responses should act to reduce future price volatility.44.&#xa0; It is important to bear in mind that the volatility (and level) of commodity prices is of more importance to consumers in developing countries than in developed countries. This is firstly because poorer individuals spend a much greater proportion of their income on food, and secondly because in developed countries the price of food to consumers is often only weakly connected to the cost of basic commodities, with other inputs like energy, labour and packaging being more important. For example, the price of wheat accounts for only 11% of the cost of a loaf of bread in the UK. 45.&#xa0; Although commodity prices are only weakly related to the level of some prices, modelling demonstrates that alongside exchange rates and oil prices, they are the largest drivers of inflation in retail food prices. 46.&#xa0; Whilst global commodity markets have significant impacts on retail food price inflation, there is a lag between commodity price rises and their impact on retail food price inflation if for example, there may be contracts in place which prevent the full price increase being immediately passed on. Given that: contracts may be of differing lengths; price changes of different commodities are not perfectly correlated; and that there are other, non-commodity price factors driving food price inflation, then any volatility on commodities markets will be significantly moderated before their transmission to consumer prices.   

[[[Speculation]]]47.&#xa0; The Government recognises that there is a range of views in respect of the role that may have been played by commodity speculation in recent food price spikes. On balance, reliable evidence suggests scepticism that speculation in agricultural futures markets has played a significant causal role in agricultural price volatility. However, the Government continues to monitor relevant research with interest. 48.&#xa0; It is also important to note that trading in commodity markets plays an important role in providing liquidity in these markets and that liquidity is essential to the effective functioning of these markets. Against the backdrop of climate change, and the possibility that international agricultural prices may become more volatile over time, the role of agricultural futures and options markets and the liquidity they rely on, become more important.

[[[Volatility and developing countries]]]49.&#xa0; The UK Government recognises the damaging impact of high food prices and food price volatility on poor consumers in developing countries. High price volatility reduces the benefits of higher prices for net producers. For food producing households, price volatility makes the returns to increased production more uncertain and so acts as a disincentive to further investment. DfID and Defra are planning research to better understand the extent to which commodity price changes impact on consumers, producers and poverty in the developing world.50.&#xa0; The UK Government believes that free trade and effective and efficient markets provide a greater level of food security than large-scale, public food stocks designed to manage price volatility at national or international level. Experience to date suggests such stocks are expensive to run, with implications for fiscal positions, and are likely to crowd out private sector stocking initiatives and would therefore not necessarily stabilise prices. DfID supports, in principle, proposals for regional emergency humanitarian food stocks in high risk regions such as the Sahel, to improve the speed and effectiveness of the response to humanitarian disasters. Carefully targeted social safety nets are also important to help poor consumers in developing countries cope with price inflation.51.&#xa0; The UK Government is working internationally, particularly with other members of the G20, to liberalise trade and make commodity markets function more efficiently. The Government is promoting greater sharing of information on existing stocks, and discouraging disruptive actions such as export bans, which limit supplies and drive up prices.

[[[AMIS]]]52.&#xa0; The Agriculture Market Information System (AMIS) is a G20 initiative which seeks to improve agricultural market transparency, information sharing and facilitate policy coordination between major producing, exporting and importing countries. A central task is its work to develop indicators to monitor market and policy drivers that impact on global food prices and global food price volatility. The AMIS Rapid Response Forum promotes early discussion between countries concerning abnormal market conditions and allows for the development of shared strategies. AMIS will not necessarily prevent price increases or some level of volatility but can help improve understanding of markets and enhance policy coordination in times of crisis. 53.&#xa0; AMIS has made valuable progress since it was initially set up two years ago.  The UK is an active participant in all aspects of AMIS’ work and encourages the contribution of timely and high quality data around key indicators, such as stock levels, from all members through the Global Food Information Group.

[[[Post-2015 Development Framework]]]

[[[ ]]]54.&#xa0; The UK Government is pushing for an ambitious and compelling set of new global development goals to take effect when the Millennium Development Goals conclude in 2015.  These are an opportunity to bring people and planet together to eradicate poverty and achieve shared prosperity, including through improved food security and nutrition, sustainable natural resource management (including water and energy), and good governance and effective institutions.  

[[[The potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security]]]

[[[Key points]]]

[[[:]]]

[[[Detail:]]]55.&#xa0; The Government’s Agri-Tech Strategy published jointly by BIS, Defra and DfID in July 2013, aims to re-position the UK as a world leader in the global challenge of the sustainable intensification of agriculture, producing more with less input and impact. Government is investing £160m in translational research led and co-funded by industry to strengthen links between science and technology to drive innovation and its uptake into farming to improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness, and productivity in agriculture; increase access and uptake of knowledge transfer; and promote better access to international markets and export opportunities. 56.&#xa0; We are also working with the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) to drive innovation to support a more competitive, resilient and sustainable agri-food sector via the £90m Sustainable Agriculture and Food Innovation Platform; £4.5M investment in a new Sustainable Intensification Platform to help translate knowledge into practice to help farmers; and the £70m Agri-tech Strategy’s catalyst innovation competitions with industry led by TSB (with a £10m contribution from DfID for projects in developing countries.)57.&#xa0; More widely, Government is building links to strengthen multi-disciplinary research to address food security through EU initiatives such as the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change, and the European Research Area Networks in developing a common research agenda across Europe; and working closely with the European Commission and other Member States in developing research work programmes under the EU’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The UK is also collaborating internationally with DfID and the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture on food security via the Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network (SAIN) and in the Global Research Alliance to find ways to reduce agricultural GHG emissions.

[[[GM and emerging technologies]]]

[[[Genomics]]]58.&#xa0; Genomics utilises the recent acceleration in gene sequencing technology that has been researched and pioneered in the UK. It allows marker genes to be identified that correspond to the desirable traits observed in naturally occurring varieties of crops. By applying genomics (in a way that was not possible a decade ago) crop varieties can be selectively developed by means of an acceleration of the natural selection process.

[[[Genetic Modification]]]59.&#xa0; From the scientific and other evidence it is clear that the responsible use of GM crops could play an important role alongside other options to help ensure food security.  This conclusion has been supported by a number of important reviews in recent years which have highlighted how science and technology, including GM, will be crucial to making agriculture more efficient and sustainable.  60.&#xa0; GM technology is already contributing to UK food security via the extensive use of imported GM livestock feed, soya in particular. The livestock sector could not operate at the same level without the use of imported supplies at prevailing prices. The majority of global soya production is now GM and this is cheaper than conventional soya.         61.&#xa0; A major barrier to the development and use of GM crops in Europe is the operation of the relevant EU controls. The process for authorising GM cultivation is dysfunctional because there is no political consensus on this issue, and only one GM crop has secured EU approval since 1998. The uncertainty around the approval process has deterred GM-related investment and innovation, denying EU farmers and consumers the benefits that would be expected to flow from this. A recent European Court of Justice ruling has prompted the European Commission to call for a vote by EU Ministers on a GM insect-resistant maize variety. This will be the first such vote since 2007 and may end the current moratorium on authorisations for GM cultivation.  62.&#xa0; The negative EU situation is damaging for the future of agriculture both in Europe and in developing countries which may be influenced by it. As the disparity between the EU and other parts of the world on GM uptake continues to grow, this in itself poses a potential threat to our food security. It creates the possibility for traces of non-EU approved GM material to be found in imported commodities like soya.  This undermines the ability to maintain orderly and cost-effective supply chains on which the UK relies.  63.&#xa0; Outside Europe, GM production is already significant whilst in the EU only one GM crop is being grown on a limited scale (an insect-resistant maize of no UK interest). The main existing GM crops offer easier weed and pest control but a range of other GM traits have been commercialised or are in the development pipeline. This includes drought-tolerance, disease-resistance, nitrogen-use efficiency, and improved nutritional characteristics.64.&#xa0; As a specific example of how GM cultivation could help the UK, blight-resistant potatoes have been developed which could significantly improve production of this important crop.  It could mean a marked reduction in the use of fungicides and an increase in production as losses to the disease are curtailed.  The company BASF had applied for EU approval of a GM blight-resistant potato but later withdrew the application because of the difficult EU situation. The full potential contribution of GM production to the UK will clearly depend on the range of new crop traits that might be developed and adopted over time.    65.&#xa0; The Government will continue to argue for the EU to operate a more sensible GM regime. The UK supports pragmatic and proportionate controls which enable fair market access for GM products that pass a robust safety evaluation. Domestically we are open to, and want to encourage, GM crop research. In recent years there have been several publicly-funded research projects in England which have involved GM field trials (work on GM nematode-resistant potatoes by Leeds University, on GM blight-resistant potatoes by the Sainsbury Laboratory, and on GM aphid-repellent wheat by Rothamsted Research). The UK has a world-class plant science base and should therefore be in a strong position to contribute to advances that will improve food security both at home and in developing countries, including through realising the potential of GM plant breeding.

[[[Risks to disruption of the food chain]]]&#xa0;68.&#xa0; The National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review recognised the risk from natural disasters as one of the top tier risks facing the UK, and made the continued provision of essential services in such circumstances as one of the Government’s highest resilience priorities. 69.&#xa0; In support of this review, the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Programme within Cabinet Office developed a systematic, co-ordinated, cross-sector campaign to reduce the disruption caused by natural hazards/disasters to the UK’s critical infrastructure and the essential services they deliver. 70.&#xa0; A key output from this programme is the development of Sector Resilience Plans, produced annually by Lead Government Departments working with their infrastructure owners and regulators.  The Plans are part of an ongoing assessment to increase Government’s understanding of the level of resilience of the UK’s critical infrastructure to natural hazards.  71.&#xa0; Defra works with the food industry to promote an understanding in the relevant government departments of its dependencies. Defra set up and chairs the Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group, a forum at which other government departments, industry, and the relevant trade associations can share information and jointly consider resilience issues. This Group meets 3 to 4 times a year and on a regular basis as required.72.&#xa0; The UK Food Security Assessment highlighted that further planning was required to ensure the UK was able to maintain supplies in the event of disruption to ports, as the majority of the UK’s food imports arrive that way. Defra identified the food products vulnerable to port disruption; and it is working with the Department for Transport (DfT) to identify the major ports used for the import of these food types and identify substitute facilities in the event of disruption. The information gathered from these exercises will allow Defra and DfT to work with industry to agree a national plan to manage key food supplies. 73.&#xa0; Defra has also commissioned research that seeks to address building the resilience of the food supply chain in the event of a potential major east coast flooding event, and in response to other extreme and volatile weather events. The Government Chief Scientist’s Food Research Partnership has also reviewed the evidence underpinning resilience of the food supply including risks from cyber terrorism, extreme weather and regulatory obstacles. 

[[[Risks to food safety ]]]&#xa0;74.&#xa0; Food safety law specifies requirements including the absence of pathogenic micro-organisms and safety for consumption, and the Food Safety Act 1990 provides the framework for all food legislation in the UK. 75.&#xa0; Government has a responsibility to ensure that food law is upheld and consumers are protected, but the primary obligation to ensure that food supplied is safe to eat is placed on food businesses. Food businesses must tell the FSA where they have reason to believe that a foodstuff that they have imported, produced, manufactured or distributed does not meet food safety requirements, and must use their own approach to exercise due diligence over the food they sell to ensure they are meeting safety and authenticity requirements.  Businesses agree specific specifications with suppliers and suppliers are subject to inspection by such businesses as well as local authorities. Many large food businesses also conduct their own testing of food samples.76.&#xa0; The central competent authority in the UK for monitoring and controlling the application of food law is the Food Standards Agency (FSA).  However, the majority of surveillance and enforcement activity to protect the consumer is undertaken locally by local and port health authorities. Local authority staff routinely inspect premises on a risk basis as well as collecting samples which are tested for food safety or compositional and labelling compliance.  In 2010-11 89% of food businesses checked were broadly compliant with food safety law.77.&#xa0; Regulation (EC) 178/2002 lays down the EU principles and requirements of food law.  It applies to all stages of production, processing and distribution of food and feed.  Around one fifth of all spending to check for compliance with food law is at the stage of slaughterhouses, cutting plants and primary producers. This reflects EU prescription, the relatively high safety risk of food handling at these stages, and the need to track raw meat to the farms and suppliers for both animal and human health purposes.78.&#xa0; The FSA recognises however the need to rebalance assurance activity so that it more accurately reflects the risk associated with today’s food products and longer supply chains. The FSA has been taking a lead in influencing at an EU level for changes to official controls so that they are more risk based and proportionate.

[[[Risks to plant health]]]79.&#xa0; Plant health is now one of Defra’s top 4 priorities with increased resources for operational activity and research. Defra has developed a prioritised risk register, working with the relevant industry sectors and work has also started on plant health contingency planning. 80.&#xa0; The current body of EU legislation covering the agri-food chain including plant health consists of almost 70 pieces of legislation, and the European Commission has adopted a proposed package of measures aiming to cut this down to 5. The UK is committed to pursuing a new regime with faster decision making in response to plant health risks, better risk targeting of such threats and improved enforcement of the rules. 81.&#xa0; While Defra has created the UK Plant Health Risk Register, potential instability in global food supply from shock events is also recognised in the UK Food Security Assessment as a dependency.82.&#xa0; In the area of food security with developing countries, Defra is working with UK-CDS in the design of the Natural Hazards Risk Register to deliver early warning for overseas support. In its final form it should also provide early warning of potential crop pest events that may affect UK food supply and security.

[[[Risks to animal health]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]83.&#xa0; One of Defra’s priorities is to minimise risks and increase preparedness for animal disease outbreaks, driving growth and competitiveness through improving standards of animal health and welfare.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Animal disease outbreaks and contingency plans]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]84.&#xa0; Published contingency plans set out how an outbreak of exotic notifiable disease of animals will be dealt with. The impact of disease control policies on food supply markets is considered as an integral part of the response through liaison with the food supply chain.&#xa0;

[[[Food fraud and labelling ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]85.&#xa0; The horsemeat incident at the start of 2013 highlighted the potential impact of a food fraud on the resilience of the food supply chain.  The incident saw the mass recall of a number of products across the EU and had a serious impact on consumer confidence in the food that they were buying or being served.  86.&#xa0; An independent review of Britain’s food system was launched in June 2013 and will report by Spring 2014. The review will focus on consumer confidence in the authenticity of food and will identify any weaknesses in food supply networks which could have implications for food safety and public health. It will look at the causes that enabled horsemeat fraud, the roles and responsibilities of businesses to consumers and how to support consumer confidence.  Findings will be used to form recommendations to Government on how the UK can increase the resilience of its food systems to fraud.87.&#xa0; The Government is clear that food fraud is completely unacceptable. Consumers must have confidence in the food they buy and have every right to expect that food is correctly described. Transparency is key to confidence.88.&#xa0; The Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure that British farmers and food manufacturers have access to export markets.  This includes making sure British food is recognised for its rigorous standards and traceability, and that our producers do not get a bad reputation due to the Europe-wide horsemeat incidents. We are working hard to help the British food and farming sectors make the most of their excellent products and high standards.89.&#xa0; Food businesses have however a legal responsibility to assure traceability.  This means that a food business supplying food products from other food businesses is responsible to its customers for ensuring that everything it sells is safe and is as described.  Such businesses therefore must by EU food law assure themselves of the nature, quality and description of what they are supplying.  90.&#xa0; On labelling, the food industry is ultimately responsible for making sure that labelling on food is accurate and consumers are not misled. The UK has supported more and better country of origin information that is targeted at meeting the needs of consumer. 

[[[Whether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security strategies and planning]]]

[[[Climate change and]]]

[[[ projected]]]

[[[ impacts on volatility ]]]91.&#xa0; Defra recently commissioned a review of the literature on global food security modelling with a focus on climatic factors. Of models that explicitly consider scenarios around climate change, it is projected that climate change will generally tend to reduce yields at the global level – although there are stark differences in impacts across regions – and raise crop prices. However, there are still key evidence gaps around the impacts of CO2 levels and precipitation patterns on crop yields which mean such results should be treated with caution. The IPCC suggest that extreme weather events could have a more significant impact on food security than gradual climate changes, though such extreme weather events are typically left out of formal modelling exercises because their location, severity and nature are not known. 92.&#xa0; It is acknowledged that in light of climate change, international trade will become more important in managing volatility and mitigating global price rises from harvest disruption and extreme weather events.

[[[UK Climate Change Risk Assessment ]]]93.&#xa0; In January last year Defra published the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), as required by the Climate Change Act 2008, which brought together the best available evidence using a consistent framework to identify the risks and opportunities related to climate change. 94.&#xa0; The CCRA assessed climate risks for the UK using the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) for three time periods – 30-year periods centred on the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s and three emission scenarios. The CCRA classified risks and opportunities into three broad impact classes, ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ and also identified those risks that are highly uncertain and difficult to quantify. The method focused attention on risks where decisions need to be made in the near future (i.e. in the next 5 years).95.&#xa0; The CCRA identifies a number of impacts on domestic agriculture. These impacts include increasing water demand coupled with decreasing availability, drier soils, reduced soil quality and soil erosion, increased flood risk to high quality agricultural land and the impacts of heat on livestock productivity and welfare. The changing climate may allow new pests, diseases and other invasive species to enter the country, or allow existing examples to spread further or become more of a risk. An increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and severe storms could result in unexpected reductions in productivity.96.&#xa0; There is also the potential for positive impacts of climate change, including increases in yield and productivity of existing crops and grassland as well as the opportunity to introduce new crops. However these opportunities will only come to pass if other factors which affect growth, such as water availability, are not limiting.97.&#xa0; The second CCRA is currently being scoped and will be published by January 2017. Defra is working closely with other Government Departments and interested parties to ensure that we identify the most important areas for the assessment to focus on.

[[[The role of science]]]98.&#xa0; The Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases, launched in December 2009 at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen is an international collaboration between over 30 countries including the UK which brings together research, extension of technologies and practices that will help deliver ways to grow more food, more climate resistant food systems without increasing GHG emissions.99.&#xa0; The Met Office Hadley Centre is coordinating yearly initialised decadal predictions to build better medium-term forecasting. This work uses multiple climate models and is carried out in collaboration with international partners. It will provide government and the wider society, including farmers, with better information to drive the process of climate adaptation.

[[[The obstacles facing food producers, i]]]

[[[ncluding small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new markets]]]

[[[Key points:]]]

[[[Detail:]]]

[[[Food exports]]]100.&#xa0; Sustained growth in the food and drink industry is a priority for Defra. The UK has a long, proud and strong heritage of producing high quality, safe and excellent tasting food. The sector is important to the UK, contributing £96 billion annually. There is a wide range of food and drink that is known throughout the world. In 2012 UK exports amounted to £18.2bn - nearly 50% higher than a decade ago. Scotch Whisky exports are nearly £4.3bn and we export over £2bn of meat.101.&#xa0; The increasing global population, rising middle class and incomes are leading to demand for western products and so represents opportunities for UK producers. There is huge potential to export more to established and also high growth markets in Brazil, Russia, India and China, where these currently represent only 3% of our total export market.

[[[Barriers to exporting]]]102.&#xa0; There are existing studies that highlight barriers, or obstacles, to export, including: 103.&#xa0; A Defra funded 2012 report by University of Plymouth, ‘Obstacles to export growth for small and medium sized Agrifood companies’, found that obstacles to exporting experienced by agrifood SMEs were broadly similar to those identified in other sectors, with the most significant barriers being finding management time, identifying who to make contact with, dealing with legal or tax regulations or standards overseas and protecting IP. 104.&#xa0; Similarly, amongst agrifood businesses that did not export, the most significant perceived barriers were finding the necessary management time to devote to doing business in an overseas country, followed by the costs associated with doing business overseas.

[[[The Food and Drink Exports Action Plan]]]105.&#xa0; Government and industry are therefore working together to promote UK industry and access markets.  The Exports Action Plan first launched in 2012 outlined this joint work. The Plan was refreshed in the autumn of 2013 to reflect Government commitment to increase exports by delivering half a billion pounds of value to the UK economy through assisting up to 1,000 food and drink companies with their international growth, and contributing to wider aims to increase exports by at least £1bn by October 2015. The full list of commitments can be found in the Action Plan. This includes brigading industry and Government to create a single strong UK brand identity to increase the visibility of UK food and drink at the world's major food events and exhibitions, and work to lift trade barriers, promote trade and maintain access to markets already opened.106.&#xa0; UK businesses have faced a number of barriers to access global markets due to restrictions imposed by importing countries. For example, exports for ruminant meat are restricted due to BSE and TSE concerns in some countries. We are working closely with the industry and the British Embassy in those countries to remove these barriers and have plans in place to mitigate the impact on exports of an animal disease outbreak. Where export health certificates are required, we work with the industry to identify priority markets and negotiate the wording acceptable to the importing country. We are also improving the system of processing export health certification applications. 

[[[Role of innovation ]]]

[[[remov]]]

[[[ing]]]

[[[ obstacles]]]107.&#xa0; The Government recognises the need to remove key obstacles to scientific development in the UK and its uptake into practice by farmers to support access to markets, and is working towards boosting investment in innovation.&#xa0;108.&#xa0; In the agriculture sector, we understand that the small average size of farm businesses can limit ability to invest in and adopt innovations owing to the costs associated with acquiring reliable information on new technologies and processes, and the practical difficulties of protecting intellectual property, brands and trademarks, whilst also recognising that being small can also bring advantages to implementing change.&#xa0;109.&#xa0; We are taking steps to simplify funding and intellectual property arrangements and ensure business participation and practical translation of research through a number of channels, e.g. through the Agri-Tech Strategy.&#xa0;110.&#xa0; The Technology Strategy Board’s (TSB) Sustainable Agriculture and Food Innovation Platform also provides a key route to support innovation through funding of industry-led collaborative research and development with the academic research base. This is funded jointly with Defra, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Scottish Government, providing government investment of up to £90m over five years.  &#xa0;111.&#xa0; Additional targeted instruments include the Crop Improvement Research Club, a five-year, £7m partnership between BBSRC, the Scottish Government and an industry consortium aimed at supporting research leading to sustainable improvements in crop productivity and crop quality. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Ways of increasing self-sufficiency]]]

[[[ in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage]]]

[[[Key points:]]]

[[[Detail:]]]

[[[Self-sufficiency and the production to supply ratio]]]112.&#xa0; Self-sufficiency is used to convey different meanings by different commentators. It is often used as shorthand for the production to supply ratio.113.&#xa0; The production to supply ratio also takes into account net trade. Given that we export significant amounts of indigenous food, the proportion of food that is consumed domestically from domestic production is lower than the production to supply ratio. For 2012, the UK’s production of indigenous type food, that is, food stuffs that the UK can produce domestically, was 76% of total supply. These figures have fallen in recent decades from their peaks in the 1980’s. However, the production to supply ratio in this period was inflated by the effect of the CAP, which resulted in Europe-wide surpluses and unnecessarily high prices for consumers. Taking a longer view of history, the current production to supply ratio is similar to that of the second half of the 19th century. Indeed it is higher than that of the first half of the 20th century, at some points very significantly so, even until into the 1960’s. 114.&#xa0; Comparative advantage is an economic concept which states that a country will specialise in, and therefore export, production of a good in which it has a relative cost advantage. In practical terms, comparative advantage is revealed by a country’s pattern of trade. For products in which the UK has a comparative advantage, the UK will therefore already have production in excess of consumption: in other words, the UK will be a net exporter of that product. The production to supply ratio figures illustrate that the UK does not have a revealed comparative advantage across food production in general. 115.&#xa0; However, there may be sectors where the UK could increase the production to supply ratio, through cost-effectively increasing overall production. It would be up to producers whether any increase would be supplied to the domestic or export market. The Government is exploring areas where there may be barriers to UK producers from fully exploiting their comparative advantage and accessing the domestic market, as well as breaking down barriers to UK food and drink exports accessing foreign markets. The key to UK producers exploiting market opportunities at home and abroad is competitiveness – improvements in productivity will allow producers to compete with international producers of equivalent goods, though market access barriers imposed by importing can make it difficult for exporters to fully exploit their comparative advantage. 116.&#xa0; It is up to the food supply chain to innovate and invest in order to improve their productivity and take advantage of export opportunities, but Government’s role is to ensure that the policy and regulatory environment assists industry as much as possible in doing so. Improvements in productivity which lead to the UK increasing its production will benefit the food chain and the UK economy more generally. 117.&#xa0; Defra continues to work closely with industry to identify policy and regulatory issues which may impact on the competitiveness of the sector.  The Secretary of State met representatives from across the industry and the devolved administrations in July 2013 to discuss how to increase the competitiveness of the sector.  Issues being explored following that discussion include the importance of taking forward EU negotiations on labelling to make it easier for consumers to identify where their food comes from, exploring sector-specific issues, examining how we can overcome any barriers to domestic producers competing effectively for public sector contracts, and ways of supporting growth in the food and drink sector at local level.

[[[Increasing market share for products in which the UK has a comparative advantage]]]118.&#xa0; The Government’s goal is to support and develop British farming, to encourage sustainable food production, and a sector which is more productive and competitive. Our role within that is to help create the right conditions and remove obstacles so that farming businesses can operate successfully, increase their productivity, and respond to market signals and demand.119.&#xa0; We take a range of steps to help support the industry in this respect: as stated, we have been seeking to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to reduce the industry’s dependency on direct subsidies over time. We are currently consulting on the implementation of the new CAP, including how we might use the future Rural Development Programme for this purpose. Support for innovation and technology are key factors in improving the industry’s productivity, as set out in the Agri-Tech Strategy and explored in this paper.120.&#xa0; During 2011-2012 we worked in partnership with the food and farming industry and environmental organisations to examine how we might increase food production whilst improving the environment. This triggered a range of new activities, such as the creation of a ‘Sustainable Intensification Research Platform’ and a ‘Future of Farming Review’. This review was undertaken by a core group of key individuals from across the farming sector who examined issues such as routes of entry into employment in agriculture, barriers to starting these careers and how new entrants can be better supported. The Review reported in July 2013 and the group are working jointly with Government and wider industry to take forward the recommendations. 121.&#xa0; Going forward, we need to attract the brightest and best entrepreneurs to the farming profession and to the food sector more generally. Government works with the industry-led skills agenda, supporting development of the highly skilled workforce the sector will need for the future. 122.&#xa0; Since 2011, we have worked with the National Skills Academy for Food and Drink to support the Skills Action Plan for the Food Supply Chain, which aimed to tackle skills shortages in the food supply chain.  Earlier in 2013, the National Skills Academy announced that their target for creation of 50 000 apprenticeships across the food supply chain had been exceeded.  More recently, the food and drink sector has signed up as part of the first group of Apprenticeship Trailblazers developing new apprenticeship standards and assessment approaches.  2013 has also seen the launch of the innovative MEng in Food Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University and the associated National Centre of Excellence for Food Engineering, and further innovative work to encourage young people into the sector by the Food and Drink Federation and the IGD.123.&#xa0; The UK’s comparative advantage does not only relate to the nature of our geography and environment, but also to the areas where we have developed a strong skills capability and reputation. Our industry has high standards of animal health and welfare and traceability, and we have highly innovative food manufacturing and retailing sectors. The Government will continue to look for ways to promote these, and to champion the industry within domestic and international markets.

[[[ex A – Summary of the UK Food Security Assessment 2010]]]The 2010 UK Food Security Assessment represents the most current and complete analysis of the risks and challenges to UK food supply. A summary of each theme, and its assessment in 2010, follows:Headline indicator: Global food output per capitaGlobal production of food relative to population is a fundamental indicator of global food security. Global supply underpins UK availability and prices.Supply will need to meet growing global demand and deal with emerging climate challenges. Well-functioning markets are needed to spread these risks and send the right production and investment signals.Current status: Green. Assessment: Food supply has outgrown population, but there are challenges ahead, including equitable distribution. The ability of international and regional markets to bring supply and demand into line is a real strength, but it does not necessarily guarantee that everyone is fed or that natural resources are sustainably used. For the medium term, the uncertain effects on the supply side of climate change and the challenges facing developing countries to increase production suggest an amber rating.Headline indicator: Global land use changeClimate change is likely to create new stresses on natural resources. Food must be produced in a way that is environmentally sustainable or we will set up problems for the longer term.Current status: Amber. Assessment: It is unclear how much forest loss is attributable to food production and that there has been small rise in farmland use since 1990s. As the trend in the reduction of forest areas is likely to continue, a red rating is given for the medium term. Headline indicator: Diversity of UK supplySourcing nutritious food from a range of stable countries including domestically enhances security by spreading risks, widening options and keeping prices competitive.  Gateways into the UK are a key element of the UK’s food infrastructure.Current status: Green.Assessment: The UK‟s openness to trade has brought a very impressive diversity to UK food supply. This openness ensures that UK food supply is very resilient to supply interruptions from specific countries and also from within the UK while noting a critical dependency on our sea ports. A green rating is given for the medium term. &#xa0;Headline indicator: Energy dependency of UK food chainUK food supply depends upon sophisticated and complex chains and infrastructure, and is particularly dependent upon energy supplies in their various forms. Industry needs to manage a range of risks and disruptions to supply chain. Diversity is a key element of resilience, and also scale.Current status: AmberAssessment: The domestic food chain is a heavy user of energy but intensity is falling. The surge in energy prices in 2007-8, and their continued uncertainty, can be expected to increase the incentives to reduce energy intensity along with pressures for lower carbon production and distribution. It is expected that these favourable trends to continue into the future. A green rating is given for the medium term.Headline indicator: Low income households' share of spending on foodEveryone should have the opportunity to access and afford a healthy diet. The aim of the headline indicator is to monitor the impact of price rises on the affordability of food, where affordability is measured by share of spending on food.Current status: Amber.Assessment: Households’ share of spending on food increased in 2008-9 because of inflation, but has remained relatively stable in the last few years and is expected to fall again once incomes recover. A green rating is given for the medium term: resumption of economic growth is expected, together with declining or stable real food prices, to result in a declining share of spending on food.Headline indicator: Cases of food borne pathogensPublic confidence in the UK food system rests primarily on food safety. Assurance schemes seek to build this confidence. Consumer perceptions also matter.Current status: Amber. Assessment: Campylobacter and salmonella cases have been down since 2000, but listeria up. Reducing food-borne illness is a top priority for the Food Standards Agency, so future improvements are expected, with a green rating given for the medium term.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Annex B: ]]]

[[[Russia case study]]]This industry could not access a valuable Russian market in beef and ruminant meat because of a thirty-year long ban imposed due to BSE. Defra worked with British Embassy in Moscow and the Russian authorities to remove this ban. This required sustained pressure at official and political level over the last 30 years, accommodating inspection visits of UK plants and completing relevant paperwork required by the Russian authorities including lengthy questionnaires. This enabled trade to commence in ruminant meat after the ban was lifted in December 2012. Further technical negotiations at Secretary of State and Chief  Veterinary Officer level in September this year extended the deal to offal, a priority for industry. Industry sources estimate that beef and lamb exports to Russia over the next three years could be worth up to £100 million, making it a very lucrative market for UK industry. Negotiations are now being progressed for export of live sheep. &#xa0;Page
