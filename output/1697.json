"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Royal Astronomical Society (WSC048)Declaration of interests\nThis is the official response from the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) to the Committee inquiry into Women in STEM careers. The RAS is active in work in diversity and equalities, so has an interest in the subject of the inquiry. \nWith the exception of our \nsupport for the Daphne Jackson\n Trust\n, w\ne have however no direct \nfinancial \nrelationship with the bodies referred to in this response.\nSummary\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhen women leave aca\ndemia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf the Government wishes to see faster progress in bringing and retaining wome\nn in STEM careers, it could mandate Research Councils UK to stipulate that only university departments that have obtained the status of Athena SWAN Silver or its equivalent will be eligible for research grant funding. This is \nalready the case for NHS Natio\nnal Institute for Health Research and would push universities to embed practices that advance the careers of men and women on an equal basis.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.daphnejackson.org/\n \nhttp://www.sheisanastronomer.org/\n \nhttp://tinyurl.com/RAS-demography\n \nhtt\np://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5632\n and \nprivate communication\n, Christiane Helling\n Diversity in University Physics: Statistical Digest 2010Â  \nhttp://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2010/page_438\n57.html\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-people-to-find-and-stay-in-work/supporting-page\ns/introducing-a-tax-free-childcare-scheme\n \nhttp://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/oct/24/physicists-show-bias-against-female-job-applicants\n \nhttps://www.iop.org/policy/statistics/education/page_43188.html\n \nand\n private communication, Sean McWhinnie, Oxford Research and Policy\n \nhttp://www.sheisanastronomer.org/index.php/press/98-ewass-launch-of-she-is-an-astrono\nmer\n \nhttp://www.ras.org.uk/images/stories/Publications/Big_science_for_the_big_society.pdf\n \nhttp://www.ras.org.uk/images/stories/Publications/beyondthestars.pdf\n \nhttp://www.iop.org/policy/diversity/initiatives/\nJuno\n/\n \nhttp://www.athenaswan.org.uk/\n \nhttp://www.crus.ch/information-programme/programme-cus-p-4-equal-opportunity-gender-studies/modul-3-dual-career-couples-dcc.html?L=2\n \nhttp://gender.stanford.edu/dual-career-research-re\nport\n \nhttp://www.athenaswan.org.uk/content/history-and-principles\n"
