[normal]Written e[bold]vidence[bold] from[bold] Hampshire County Council[bold] [bold](LTD0028)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Please find below the response of Hampshire County Council to the
[normal] request for interested parties to provide
[normal] written e
[normal]vidence
[normal] to the Committee
[normal].
[normal] Each of the series of
[normal] questions posed
[normal] by the Committee are answered in turn below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1a: [bold]What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]As a general principle, the devolving of decision-making about transport expenditure from central Government down to a more local scale is strongly supported. However, in the view of Hampshire County Council, the aim should be to devolve these powers to th
[normal]e Local Transport Authority (LTA) level. The rationale for doing so is that LTAs such as Hampshire County Council are closest to the communities they serve, are democratically accountable and are better able to understand and articulate local priorities fo
[normal]r transport improvements, taking into account the full range of transport objectives and issues. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1b: [bold]What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]The key advantage is that decision-making on prioritising and allocating fu
[normal]nding towards Major Transport Schemes from 2015/2016 onwards and Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) capital will now be made at a more local level when compared to the previous centralised system of bids being assessed and approved/managed by the Depa
[normal]rtment for Transport (DfT). Placing the decision-making powers at a more local level will allow local priorities to shape and influence which schemes are funded from the Local Growth Fund (LGF).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]However, whilst democratically elected representatives a
[normal]re represented on Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) Boards, the LEPs are less democratically accountable for their decisions than LTAs or event the proposed Local Transport Boards, which combine LEP and Local Transport Authority Members within a specific 
[normal]transport-focussed body.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1c: [bold]Are there better models?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]An approach of devolution of greater decision-making responsibilities to LTBs on major schemes funding and LSTF capital funding and ensuring that 100% of Integrated Transport Block (ITB) funding 
[normal]remained under 
[normal]the full control LTAs would have been preferable to giving decision-making powers straight to LEPs. The County Council fully recognises the importance of investment in transport infrastructure as a means of supporting economic growth, regene
[normal]ration and unlocking stalled development scheme, but there are also important transport issues like road safety which require investment and action that lie beyond economic growth and unlocking of development site considerations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2[bold]a[bold]: [bold]Do local bodies (inc[bold]luding local authorities, LEPs, PTEs, ITAs and Local Transport Boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The majority of LTAs, PTEs and ITAs have the necessary technical expertise in development and delivery
[normal] of major transport infrastructure schemes. In some cases, and for some smaller LTAs, it may be that they lack some of the capacity and know-how required. If this is the case, then the LTA has the option to employ transport consultants to undertake some of
[normal] these activities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Given that LEPs (and their LTB arms) have a focus on economic growth, and tend to work closely in partnership with LTAs on transport infrastructure issues, they should not need to employ their own technical experts with experience o
[normal]f prioritising and assessing schemes. This is more likely to be the situation when LEP boundaries differ to LTA boundaries. Where they do not have the capacity to do so in-house, LEPs/LTBs have the option of seconding specialist staff in from LTAs to carry
[normal] out these tasks (provided it is undertaken in a fair transparent manner) or to commission external transport consultants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2b: [bold]What would the optimum delivery body look like?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]The optimum delivery body is either PTEs/ ITAs within metropolitan areas o
[normal]r LTAs elsewhere. These organisations are most likely to have a strong track record in delivery of transport infrastructure schemes and projects, have sound financial and programme management functions able to monitor and manage progress with delivery and 
[normal]are publically accountable through elected councillors. LTAs also possess the necessary legal powers to deliver works on the public highway (e.g. Permitted Development Rights). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3: [bold]What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross L[bold]TA boundaries or have wider regional impact?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]At present most LEPs or LTAs recognise that there are occasions when it is in their best interests to collaborate with neighbours to prioritise and 
[normal]deliver major schemes that either cross boundaries or have
[normal] wider regional impacts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]In Hampshire, there are a number of examples of major schemes that cross LTA or LEP boundaries, or where the benefits unlocked by a major scheme located in one LEP area would be shared with other LEPs. A good example is Transp
[normal]ort for South Hampshire and the Isle of Wight (TfSH&amp;IoW). Please 
[normal]see paragraphs 4.2 – 4.3
[normal] for more details on this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]LEPs and LTAs are becoming adept at forming clusters or groupings to address issues of common interest. Applying this to transport 
[normal]schemes, the nature of collaboration and the grouping may vary depending on the project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4: [bold]How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The effectiveness of such relationships
[normal] is likely to vary. In the Hampshire area, groupings of LTAs and LEPs have long recognised the benefits of collaborating and working in partnership to develop solutions to transport problems that transcend LTA boundaries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire County Council, Portsmouth City Council and Southampton City Council since 2008 have collaborated together through the Transport for South Hampshire partnership. In May 2012, Isle of Wight Council joined this partnership, which was subsequently r
[normal]enamed Transport for South Hampshire and the Isle of Wight (TfSH&amp;IoW). This approach has helped the LTA partners to effectively address strategic transport challenges that cross boundaries and help support economic growth through taking a joined-up approac
[normal]h to strategic infrastructure planning and development. The TfSH&amp;IoW authorities have been able to develop a shared transport modelling capability. This evidence base has proved invaluable in supporting funding bids for transport improvements, including to
[normal] the Homes and Communities Agency for investment in the award winning Eclipse Bus Rapid Transit corridor between Gosport and Fareham. Other successes include “large” LSTF project funding and Better Bus Area Funding (BBAF). An important strength of this typ
[normal]e of partnership has been close working and regular engagement with the DfT, the Highways Agency and Network Rail via regular Strategy Working Group meetings. These three bodies also attend TfSH Joint Committee meetings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]By collaborating in partnersh
[normal]ip where it is in their mutual interests to do so, LTAs have been able to secure perhaps a greater share of transport investment and funding than may have been the case had they worked in isolation. TfSH has recently been renamed Solent Transport, and now 
[normal]provides support to the Solent LEP on strategic transport priorities and advice on key issues. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]This model of liaising with the DfT, the Highways Agency (HA) and Network Rail through partnership meetings has been applied to the Enterprise M3 LEP area,
[normal] covering part of Hampshire and part of Surrey. There are opportunities for frequent engagement with all three via Transport Action Group meetings. These sessions provide very effective mechanisms for information sharing, and partnership working between th
[normal]e LEP, LTAs and the DfT, HA and Network Rail. This regular dialogue is helping to enable the development and delivery of transport infrastructure projects in a more strategic, coherent and joined-up way. The DfT, HA and Network Rail recognise the value of 
[normal]attending these regular meetings, and the benefits of co-operating at the sub-regional level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]The Transport Committee could offer this arrangement as a model that other LTAs may wish to adopt to strengthen relationships and levels of engagement with 
[normal]the DfT, HA and Network Rail.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q5:[bold]              [bold]Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of LTAs? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]The current arrangements for LTAs to seek funding for major 
[normal]local transport schemes are complex, time consuming and have no guarantee that bids will be successful. Under future arrangements, provision of allocations to each LEP via the Local Growth Fund (LGF), LTAs will have more certainty and be more confident tha
[normal]t they will be able to secure funding to deliver major transport schemes, provided that their business cases meet LEP requirements. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]The level of evidence required for inclusion within the five business cases is not necessarily proportionate to the va
[normal]lue of the scheme. Recent changes to WebTAG guidance have partially remedied this, with less detail required within business cases for schemes between £2m and £5m in value. This more proportionate approach is welcomed. Decisions by the DfT on scheme bids (
[normal]firstly entering the development pool, then reaching programme entry stage, then reaching full approval stage) took a long period of time. In addition requirements for local match funding are not always easy to achieve. In the current climate, LTAs are und
[normal]er considerable funding pressures, and major schemes require considerable up-front investment in feasibility, scheme development and business case preparation. LTAs were only able to claim for detailed design costs once the major scheme achieves programme 
[normal]entry stage. If 
[normal]a scheme does not achieve programme entry, then costs incurred are potentially abortive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]The current funding arrangements where all major schemes funding is held by the DfT is no better or worse from the LTA perspective than the 
[normal]previous system was whereby regional major schemes allocations were prioritised by Regional Transport Boards – as business cases were still submitted to the DfT for approval to gain funding. A key issue with both arrangements is that the the amount of fund
[normal]ing available only enables the delivery of some of the strategic transport infrastructure priorities of LTAs across England. If more funding were to be made available, this would mean that delivery of major transport schemes that help support economic grow
[normal]th and jobs could be accelerated, bringing the benefits to the economy sooner.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6:[bold]              [bold]What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships (who may in turn be advised by Local Transport Bodies) and the introduction of the Local[bold] Growth Fund have?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]The Government has chosen to devolve funding and decision-making powers from the national level to LEPs for major schemes and LSTF capita grant as part of the LGF. This is a positive step. However, as part of the creation of this fu
[normal]nd, 50% of the Integrated Transport Block (ITB) funding stream that is currently awarded via formula directly to LTAs will instead form part of the LGF awarded to LEPs. The changes to ITB do not represent devolution and will reduce levels of funding awarde
[normal]d to LTAs. As a result, only the changes to major schemes funding and LSTF capital funding will see devolution of decision-making from the DfT to a lower level. The certainty offered by the ITB funding being 100% allocated via a formula method to LTAs has 
[normal]been lost.  The 50% re-allocated to LEPs will be a mix of formula and competitive bidding between LEPs. This will make it more difficult for LTAs in the forward planning of transport capital programmes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]A serious disadvantage to allocating ITB capital
[normal] funding to LEPs instead of LTAs is that this is likely to reduce the amount of available funding to LTAs to deliver schemes that contribute towards the locally important objectives of improving road safety, reducing carbon emissions or improving travel ch
[normal]oice. LEPs are expected to prioritise the allocation of LGF resources towards those transport infrastructure schemes that contribute strongly towards unlocking economic growth and improving competitiveness. For example, road safety improvements offer very 
[normal]limited benefits in terms of contributing towards economic growth, and as a result, it would be hard to justify to the LEPs why such schemes should be funded from the LGF if economic criteria are the dominant consideration underpinning how LGF funds are al
[normal]located to schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]Awarding significant sums of capital funding to the LEP to then allocate to transport schemes via the LGF could result in the majority of funding being concentrated in the vicinity of areas of planned development, leaving very litt
[normal]le funding available to address transport priorities in other areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7:[bold]              [bold]How can LTAs attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative fun[bold]ding streams?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire County Council has a strong track record of securing development-related contributions
[normal] from the private sector
[normal] to deliver transport improvements associated with mitigating the impact of new development on the transport network. The introduction of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is expected to lead to a reduction in funding available to the County Council 
[normal]for this purpose. New Homes Bonus contributions held by Local Planning Authorities are a potential source of match funding to deliver transport infrastructure schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]In the current challenging economic climate, it can be difficult to secure sufficie
[normal]nt private sector investment in transport infrastructure or to provide up-front payments to deliver infrastructure in advance of building out development sites. Initiatives such as the Growing Places Fund awarded to LEPs allowed the creation of a pump-prim
[normal]ing fund, to deliver transport infrastructure that unlocks development sites, which the developer repays over time, which can then be re-invested in further transport infrastructure schemes, the cost of which is also repaid over time. If scaled up, this so
[normal]rt of pump-priming mechanism has the potential to remove barriers to delivery of a number of strategic development sites. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]              
[normal]Current local highway networks in Hampshire are seen as a vital asset on which businesses and markets depend for the movement of
[normal] goods, services and labour. Hampshire County Council through its Local Transport Plan since 2010 has prioritised and increased the level of investment in highway maintenance, and has delivered long-term plans such as Operation Resilience, to improve highw
[normal]ay condition. Removal of control over 50% of ITB capital grant and transfer of control of these resources to the LEP has the potential to undermine the progress made on highway maintenance, as the choice was made to invest a proportion of ITB in highway ma
[normal]intenance programmes instead if on delivery of new infrastructure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4
[normal]              
[normal]There could be a continued role for further rounds of funding streams awarded via a competitive bidding process - such as Local Pinch Point Fund and Better Bus Area Fund. This would fa
[normal]vour and reward those 
[normal]LTAs who have a strong track record of delivery of capacity improvements within short timescales and within budget.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q8:[bold]              [bold]How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision-making on transport expenditure?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]LTAs have c
[normal]lear and robust systems in place for decision-making governance and assurance on major transport schemes. Lines of accountability are transparent and well-understood.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]LEPs generally appoint one LTA to act as the accountable body, who receives, holds a
[normal]nd manages all funding awarded to the LEP on behalf of the LEP. In order to receive Major Schemes funding as part of the LGF, the DfT expected each LTB to set up and adhere to an assurance framework, covering how they would ensure accountability and scruti
[normal]ny of how taxpayers money has been used.  The change in process with the LTB funding, now forming part of the LGF, has led to a lack of clarity as to the level of assurance that will be required under the revised arrangements.  However, provided an appropr
[normal]iate assurance framework is checked by the Government or DfT and approved prior to award of LGF funding, and that systems and suitable mechanisms are in place for audit and scrutiny, then this should help to ensure that public money is used appropriately.
