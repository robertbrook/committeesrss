Written evidence submitted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (JRR 0032)default&#xa0;defaultIntroduction defaultThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (
default‘
defaultthe Commission
default’
default) welcomes the opportunity of responding to the Joint Committee on Human Rights 
default(JCHR) inquiry into the implications for access to justice of the Government
default’
defaults proposed judicial review reforms.  Because of o
defaultur statutory remit under the Equality Act 2006 and our status as a National Human Rights Institution, t
defaulthe focus of this inquiry is
default highly relevant to our work.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultMinistry of Justice (MoJ), describes judicial review as 
default‘
defaulta critical check on the power of the state, providing an effective mechanism for challenging the decisions, acts or omissions of public bodies to ensure that they a
defaultre lawful
default’
default.
default   
defaultJudicial review is the principal means of testing the compatibility of administrative decisions with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  In relation to civil rights and obligations, where an internal complaints proc
defaultedure does not qualify as an 
default‘
defaultindependent and impartial tribunal
default’
default 
defaultunder Article 6(1) of the ECHR, judicial review may provide the independent scrutiny that is required by the Convention. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission has submitted a detailed response to the MoJ consult
defaultation on the proposed judicial review reforms; this response forms the basis of our submission to the JCHR inquiry.  In summary, the Commission
default’
defaults assessment of the MoJ
default’
defaults proposals is that they would have a substantial adverse impact on the ability of indiv
defaultiduals and organisations to hold the state to account, including in relation to potentia
defaultl human rights breaches.  They 
defaultwould also potentially restrict access to justice for certain cases that involve rights under the Equality Act 2010, including the public
default sector equality duty (PSED) under section 149 of that Act.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission
default’
defaults assessment, the MoJ has not provided adequate evidence in support of its proposals. The number of judicial review applications (excluding immigration and asylum) has remaine
defaultd almost 
defaultstable since 2007.
default   Our own experience of judicial review litigation suggests that the proposals, if implemented, will deliver limited costs savings but will run the risk of causing delays in the court process and create extra costs which outwei
defaultgh the perceived benefits.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that the MoJ does not collect comprehensive information on the protected characteristics of court users generally, or specifically those involved in judicial review proceedings.  As the consultation paper acknowledges,
default this limits the Government
default’
defaults understanding of the potential equality impacts of its proposals, including those for legal aid.  To gain better understanding of the equality impact of any judicial review reforms, we recommend that steps are taken undertake 
defaultproportionate monitoring of court users by reference to relevant protected characteristics, including by drawing on existing data sources. In the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, it is particularly important to monitor the equalities impact of any proposals for reso
defaultlving disputes involving the PSED.  
defaultEvidence of differential experiences of the civil justice system is available from the Commission
default’
defaults Measurement Framework (MF).
default  The MF is designed to monitor a set of indicators and measures across 11 
default‘
defaultdomains
default’
default, including legal security. Within this domain, Indicator 4 relates to equal protection and support for individuals with justiciable civil justice problems. Evidence within this indicator indicates differences in the advice-seeking behaviour of people who 
defaultshare protected characteristics when faced by civil law problems. For example, people aged 18 to 24 and those aged 75 and over; people who are Asian, Black, mixed race or Chinese; and Buddhists and Hindus are less likely than other groups to obtain advice 
defaultwhen faced with a civil justice problem.
default 
defaultThe test for standing defaultThe MoJ proposes introducing a more restricted test for 
default‘
defaultstanding
default’
default, which would limit the individuals and organisations that could bring claims for judicial review.  For the reasons outlined 
defaultbelow, the Commission does not consider that any change to the test is required.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Impact Assessment published alongside the MoJ consultation paper has not monetised the impacts of this proposal, merely stating that the Government is 
default‘
defaultconcerned
default’
default 
defaultthat over time the courts have given an increasingly generous interpretation of the current 
default‘
defaultsufficient interest
default’
default 
defaulttest for standing.    
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission regularly monitors judicial review claims involving equality and/or human rights issues and has extens
defaultive experience of intervening in such claims. We are not aware of claims being allowed to proceed where the claimant has had little or no interest in the matter or where judicial review is being used as a mere campaigning tool, beyond what is reasonably th
defaulte concern of an interested party.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our assessment, the current standing test is fit for purpose, and a narrower test may have a negative impact on pre-hearing costs and on court time. The existing rules have been set out clearly by the courts
default and these
default rules already exclude judicial reviews by people with little or no interest in the claim.   
default&#xa0;
defaultAs recently acknowledged by the Right Hon Lady Justice Hale,
default public law is concerned with public wrongs, rather than individual rights. A broad test for standin
defaultg allows alleged abuses of executive power to be challenged when those affected by a policy or decision cannot bring a case themselves 
default–
default 
defaultfor logistical or financial reasons, because they are not aware of the issue, or because they lack access to lawyers.  
defaultThe Commission's analysis suggests that many public interest challenges could not otherwise be brought by a claimant with a direct personal interest in the matter. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, there is sometimes no victim who could, in practice, bring a claim.  This is 
defaultillustrated by the judicial review in which Medical Justice, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), successfully challenged a policy that certain individuals would get little or no notice of their removal directions (the specific arrangements made for thei
defaultr removal from the United Kingdom). No individual could have brought 
defaultthat claim because by the time they became aware that the policy applied to them they would be in the process of being deported.
default  
defaultIt may also sometimes be appropriate for a judicial rev
defaultiew application to be made before new legislation takes effect.  In these circumstances, an organisation is more likely to bring the claim, because the legislation has not yet had a direct impact on any individuals.  One example is the judicial review brou
defaultght by Age UK
default challenging the national default retirement age of 65 that was about to be introduced by the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. 
defaultThese examples illustrate the important role of NGOs in relation to issues where there is no appropriat
defaulte individual who can bring the claim, although the volume of cases that they bring is acknowledged by the MoJ to be relatively small.
default  NGOs are often well placed to represent the interests of an affected group, can support their claim with specialist evid
defaultence, and their presence lends an institutional overview to the issue.  Considering a claim on a question of policy or legal principle brought by an NGO is a more efficient use of court time than dealing with a group claim brought by many different individ
defaultuals.  In these circumstances, it is also more appropriate for the court not to be limited to considering the facts of individual cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultSimilarly, the court has been willing to accept the standing of professional representative groups, when the interest
defaults of their members are affected rather than the interests of the group itself.
default  In a few cases, the court has shown itself willing to recognise the standing of a concerned individual bringing a public interest challenge.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder Section 30 Equality Act 2
default006, the Commission has standing to apply for judicial review in relation to its statutory functions. We have 
defaultmade reference to this power in pre-action correspondence where litigation was ultimately avoided.  In a small number of cases, and only after ext
defaultensive engagement with the public body concerned, we have used Section 30 to issue proceedings where we considered that it was in the public interest for us to act to avoid the risk of a breach of equality or human rights law that could not be addressed by
default other means.  One example is the case of R (Equality and Human Rights Commission) v Secretary of State for Justice,
default  where the Commission argued successfully that the National Offender Management Service had failed to comply with the Race Equality Duty o
defaultr the Disability Equality Duty in concluding a service level agreement with the UK Border Agency for the removal of foreign national prisoners.  
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch indicates that a high proportion of judicial review claims settle in favour
default of the claimant, suggesting that the majority of cases have substantial merit.
default Our own experience as an intervener in judicial review cases confirms that settlements favourable to the claimant are often reached before the final hearing.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commiss
defaultion
default’
defaults assessment, none of the alternative tests for standing suggested by the MoJ in its consultation paper would be appropriate.  The standing test for challenges to EU measures in the European Court of Justice is too narrow, and would not sit well with t
defaulthe UK traditions of open access to justice. The narrow 
default‘
defaultvictim
default’
default 
defaulttest under the HRA has proved to be a barrier to a number of public interest challenges, and this problem would only be compounded if the test were introduced for ordinary public law claims.  
defaultWhile the tests for statutory planning challenges (
default‘
defaulta person aggrieved
default’
default) and for civil legal aid are both preferable to either the EU or HRA test, our assessment is that the current, well-established test is more appropriate than either of these. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe MoJ
default has not considered the possibility that introducing a narrower test for standing could lead to an increase in pre-hearing costs to resolve disputes.  Requiring judicial interpretation of a new standing test may 
defaultcause additional court time and resources to
default be spent on satellite litigation.  Another factor that has not been considered is the possibility that preventing NGOs and representative bodies from bringing individual claims could lead to an increase in group claims 
default–
default 
defaultthat is, where individual claimant
defaults raising similar issues apply to the court for a Group Litigation Order.  This would undoubtedly lead to more costly and resource intensive litigation for both claimants and defendants and an increase in the burden on the courts.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the MoJ recognises,
default standing cannot be restricted in environmental law cases because of the requirements of the Aarhus Convention.
default  In the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, there is no principled distinction between environmental challenges and challenges involving equality and human 
defaultrights issues. There is also a risk that changing the standing test for non-environmental cases would create satellite litigation to establish whether a particular issue is 
default‘
defaultenvironmental
default’
default 
defaultor not. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThird party interventions defaultThe role of an intervener is t
defaulto assist the court with relevant evidence or information, submissions of law, expertise or a perspective which has not already been provided by the parties (and so would not otherwise be available to the Court). An intervener does not become a party to the
default proceedings and do
defaultes
default not necessarily align with either party or have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. There is no right of intervention and the Court determines whether leave to intervene is given, usually only where it considers the interv
defaultention will be necessary or helpful.
default default In the Commission's own experience of making interventions, the process by which a prospective intervener applies for leave to intervene
default defaultprovides a level of scrutiny which ensures clarity about the nature and value of
default an intervention. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe application process also assists in quantifying the likely costs arising from a proposed intervention. The parties have an opportunity to give their views to the court with regard to the merits of the application to intervene, the form/means of the int
defaultervention (oral or written) and the 
defaulttiming of it, together with the costs implications. Interveners are not invariably granted leave to make oral submissions to the court. Where the court does grant permission to make an oral submission, this is often limi
defaultted to no more than an hour 
default–
default 
defaultor in some cases to 20 minutes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe additional material provided by interveners can play an important role in judicial review proceedings, owing to their adversarial nature. The parties may not have the time, resources or ex
defaultpertise to provide all the information relevant to determining the issues, especially where questions of public importance arise and the impact of the judgment extends beyond the facts of the case.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe value of interventions was considered by the Right 
defaultHon Baroness Hale, Deputy President of the Supreme Court, in a recent speech.
default Her view was that the court often welcomes help on difficult issues and that permission is given to interveners because the court wants to have a broader perspective of the issu
defaultes before it because, in an adversarial system, the parties cannot be relied on in this regard.  She suggested that it can be particularly helpful when an intervener makes submissions in relation to international jurisprudence and instruments.  In her view
default, there was often value in allowing oral submissions, as this gives an intervener the chance to react to the court and answer specific questions which the court may wish to raise. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStatistics about the number and nature of interveners are not currently co
defaultllated by HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) but a report by the NGO Justice
default found that there were 89 interveners in the House of Lords between 2005 and 2009. Of these, 44 were public bodies (including government departments), 34 were NGOs and 11 wer
defaulte private organisations. Taking account of the high proportion of interveners that are public bodies, it is clear that intervening in proceedings is a legal tool which they value, often as a means of supporting their own interpretation of law or policy.  
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2007, the Commission has intervened in 27 cases in the administrative court, of which 22 have been concluded and four have only recently been heard or are awaiting hearing.  Our assessment is 
defaultthat in 14 of those 22 cases, the Commission
default’
defaults interventi
defaulton has had a substantial influence on the proceedings. This includes instances where the court has reflected and/or adopted the Commission's submissions in its judgment 
default–
default 
defaultirrespective of whether or not there was a successful outcome for the claimant. It al
defaultso includes cases where, in the Commission
default’
defaults assessment, 
defaultour
default intervention has encouraged settlement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn some cases, the Commission has been asked to intervene by the court. One example is the case of A Local Authority v A (a child) &amp; Anor,
default where the Commission
default’
defaults submissions on the positive obligations under Article 5 ECHR were accepted by the court. In 
defaultR (South West Care Homes &amp; Others) v Devon County Council
default,
default the Commission intervened to clarify the relevance of the PSED for authorities w
defaulthen they are developing proposals.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission
default’
defaults submissions contributed to the final ruling, with the court emphasising the need for authorities to give due regard to the potential impact on vulnerable people of possible care home closures or reduced s
defaultupport.
default default&#xa0;defaultBased on our analysis of the role of interveners outlined above, and our own experience of making interventions, the Commission supports the proposal for a presumption that interveners bear their own costs 
default–
default 
defaultbut not the costs incurred by the clai
defaultmant or defendant when pursuing issues raised by the intervener.  It is our own practice, when applying to intervene, to state that we will be responsible for our own costs.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, there may be cases where an intervener takes a more central role in pr
defaultoceedings. For example, in R (E) v Governing Body of Jewish Free School &amp; others,
default costs were awarded against one of the interveners, the United Synagogue, which had taken a principal role in opposing the claim. In circumstances such as these, the court ha
defaults discretion to consider making an award of costs against an intervener, using the approach set out in Rule 46(3) and Practice Direction 6.9 of 
defaultthe Rules of the Supreme Court.
default  There may also be situations where, under the court rules, a party could pursu
defaulte a wasted costs order.
default&#xa0;
defaultLegal aid for judicial review applicationsdefaultThe Commission
default defaultsubmitted evidence
default to the JCHR
default’
defaults inquiry into the implications for access to justice of the Government
default’
defaults proposed legal aid reforms, including the amended proposals to legal
default aid for judicial review set out in the present consultation paper.
default 
default  For ease of reference, an extract from this submission is set out below:
default“
defaultAt present, legal aid is available 
default–
default 
defaultsubject to a means and merits test 
default–
default 
defaultto fund applications for permission in judicial review cases. The MoJ is proposing that legal aid would not cover the costs of the application except, retrospectively, where permission is granted by the court. This means that much of the pre-permission wo
defaultrk in judicial review cases would be at the provider
default’
defaults risk. Although Legal Help would be available for legal research and pre-action correspondence, it does not cover the important preparation work that follows the pre-action stage.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultResponses to the MoJ
default consultation [Transforming Legal Aid], including the Commission
default’
defaults own response, argued that this proposal not only targeted weak judicial review cases, but would also unfairly affect cases with merit where the case concludes before the court considers the
default application for permission, and no order as to costs is made.  The MoJ had also failed to consider the genuine uncertainty faced by practitioners when assessing the merits of a judicial review 
default–
default 
defaultparticularly as they do not have possession of all relevant 
defaultdocuments and because judges have inconsistent approaches to permission applications.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe MoJ has now revised its proposals in response to these concerns. It proposes to allow the Legal Aid Agency discretion to pay providers in certain cases that conclu
defaultde before a permission decision by the court, where costs have not been agreed as part of 
defaulta settlement. The discretion would be exercised according to certain criteria, including the reason for the provider not obtaining a costs agreement, the extent to wh
defaultich the clients obtained the remedy or redress they were seeking in the proceedings, and the likelihood that the court would have granted permission had the application been considered.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultWhile the revised legal aid proposal meets some of the points that the Commission raised in its response to the April 2013 consultation, our analysis is that it will not address all of them.  The claimant will still have to run a series of financial risks 
defaultbecause of uncertainty about whether or not the case will be given permission by the court, whether it will become academic or be conceded before permission is granted, whether or not the defendant will agree to pay costs as part of a settlement agreement,
default whether the court will order 
default‘
defaultinter partes
default’
default 
defaultcosts following a costs hearing, or whether the Legal Aid Agency will use its discretion to pay costs at legal aid rates.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe proposed list of factors that the Legal Aid Agency would take into account in consi
defaultdering the exercise of discretion will offer little certainty to claimant solicitors. Given the unpredictability of the outcome of applications for permission when considered by the court, one may assume that the Legal Aid Agency
default’
defaults assessment of the likeli
defaulthood that the application would have been granted will be equally uncertain. As pointed out in the Commission's earlier consultation response [to Transforming Legal Aid], the new funding regime will make it almost impossible to accommodate 
default‘
defaultrolled up
default’
default 
defaulthear
defaultings 
default–
default 
defaultwhere the question of permission is adjourned to be decided at the same time as the substantive claim.  Claimants
default’
default 
defaultlawyers will want to avoid the risk of preparing the whole case without knowing whether permission will be granted.  While rolled up h
defaultearings can offer a cost efficient use of the court
default’
defaults time, judges will be mindful of the increased financial risks for claimants and may be unwilling to list legally aided cases in this way.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultIn the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, the revised proposal for legal a
defaultid in applications for permission in judicial review may well deter important applications in cases that would have succeeded.  This 
defaultcould have a negative impact on access to justice, raising concerns about compliance with Article 6 ECHR and access to just
defaultice for victims of breaches of other Articles of the ECHR. It may also have an impact on individuals
default’
default 
defaultability to bring judicial reviews based wholly or partly on alleged breaches of the PSED. 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe Commission's analysis suggests that it is important to mo
defaultnitor the cumulative impact of the current and proposed reforms to identify and mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects on an individual
default’
defaults right of access to the courts to challenge the exercise of Government power.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultIt should be noted that, fol
defaultlowing the December 2012 consultation on judicial review, the Government has now removed the right to an oral renewal of an application where it is assessed by a judge, on the papers, as being 
default‘
defaulttotally without merit
default’
default. The Commission's analysis supports the
default suggestion put forward in some responses to the April 2013 consultation that, as an alternative, the Government should consider only withholding legal aid where a permission application is certified as 
default‘
defaulttotally without merit.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission notes that t
defaulthe Impact Assessment produced by the MoJ to support its revised proposal has estimated savings to the Legal Aid Agency of around 
default£
default1 million to 
default£
default3 million per annum. However, no consideration has been given to the potential burdens on the court system of 
defaultin
defaultdividuals who cannot obtain legal aid opting to bring judicial reviews as litigants in person. A literature review by the Ministry of Justice (2011) concluded that litigants in person could face problems in court, such as understanding the rules of evidenc
defaulte, identifying legally relevant facts and dealing with court forms.  Research 
defaultinto the views of
default other court participants, including court staff and the judiciary, suggested a concern that compensating for these difficulties created extra work and potential
defaultly presented ethical challenges.
default&#xa0;
defaultWard LJ recently commented on the difficulties faced by the judiciary at all levels when dealing with litigants in person, and the impact on access to justice:  
default&#xa0;
default‘
defaultThe expense of three judges of the Court of Appeal dealin
defaultg with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurred if the litigants had been represented. With more and more self-represented l
defaultitigants, this problem is not going to go away. We may have to accept that we live in austere times, but as I come to the end of eighteen years service in this court, I shall not refrain from expressing my conviction that justice will be ill served indeed 
defaultby this emasculation of legal aid.
default’
default&#xa0;
defaultImpact of legal aid reforms combined with proposed residence testdefault&#xa0;defaultThe JCHR is also seeking evidence on the effect of restricting legal aid for judicial review in combination with the proposed residence test for civil 
defaultlegal aid, by which applicants would need to prove current lawful residence in the UK as well as demonstrating that they had previously been 
defaultlawfully 
defaultresident for at least 12 months.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs suggested in the Commission
default’
defaults submission to the JCHR
default’
defaults earlier inquir
defaulty into the proposed legal aid reforms, applying a residence test to legal aid applicants may, in particular cases, result in breaches of Article 6(1) of the ECHR. This could affect both individuals living in this country,  and people living abroad whose ri
defaultghts have been breached by the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultBecause the proposed test would be based on residence, it is more likely to have an adverse impact on non-UK nationals, including those seeking to apply for judicial review. It is strongly arguable that the residence test would unjustifiably discriminate a
defaultgainst particular groups of people, whether these groups are defined by the status of 
default‘
defaultnon-UK national
default’
default 
defaultor 
default‘
defaultnon-UK resident
default’
default. This could be in violation of Article 6(1) read with Article 14 ECHR, which guarantees freedom from discrimination in the enjoymen
defaultt of ECHR rights.
default 
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission's analysis, the statement of Equalities Impact annexed to the MoJ
default’
defaults 
default‘
defaultTransforming Legal Aid
default’
default 
defaultconsultation paper
default (where the residence test was first proposed) gives inadequate attention to the potentially discriminat
defaultory impact of the residence test, whether it can be objectively justified and whether the impact could be mitigated.  Transforming Legal Aid refers to the need to reduce costs and better target public resources. As noted in our response to that consultatio
defaultn, case law makes it clear that costs alone are not a legitimate aim that can support the justification of indirect discrimination.
default  Direct discrimination (except in relation to age) is always unlawful.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission recognizes that the MoJ has now prop
defaultosed additional exceptions to the residence test, and intends to allow individuals a break of up to 30 days in the required 12 month period of lawful residence. However, spouses, partners and children of long-term residents and EEA nationals, together with
default those who have refugee status, might still be excluded if they have not completed a year
default’
defaults residence in the UK. Also excluded would be British citizens who have not lived continuously in the UK for a twelve month period.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe impact of the residence 
defaulttest is that excluded individuals would not receive funding for judicial review applications, even though Parliament has determined that judicial review is an important enough area of law to remain within the scope of civil legal aid.
default   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exceptional 
defaultfunding scheme
default makes provision for the Director of Legal Aid to grant funding for cases normally excluded from scope, where a failure to fund the case would breach the individual's rights under the ECHR or enforceable EU rights, or where funding is approp
defaultriate having regard to the risk of such a breach.  Funding is limited to the minimum services required to meet these international obligations. The Ministry of Justice maintains that exceptional circumstances funding would be available to people who did no
defaultt meet the residence test.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exceptional funding scheme has been in operation since April 2013. Applications under the scheme must be submitted to the Legal Aid Agency on a detailed form (14 pages in length).  Legal advisers are not paid for the time 
defaultinvolved in taking instructions from the client or completing the form unless the application for funding is successful.   As noted by the Commission in its response to the Transforming Legal Aid consultation, making providers take on the risk
default of
default not being
default paid for the work involved in making the application may reduce their willingness to help clients apply for exceptional funding.  Further, the existence of the scheme does not address the problem of clients being deterred from seeking legal advice in the 
defaultfirst place, especially if they assume that they will be turned away because they cannot satisfy the residence test.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Public Law Project (PLP) runs a project which helps people to make exceptional funding applications.  In their experience, the appl
defaultication process is onerous and complex, and ill-suited to applications made in person 
default–
default 
defaultespecially where there are barriers relating to literacy, English language skills or disability.
default  The Ministry of Justice had estimated that, in its first year of oper
defaultation, there would be between 5,000 and 7,000 applications for exceptional funding.  However, statistics provided to the Public Law Project by the Legal Aid agency show that, pro rata, a fraction of this number of applications is being made, and indicate a
default very low success rate.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Equalities Impact statement published with the Transforming Legal Aid consultation paper suggests that the discriminatory impact of the residence test would, in part, be justified by the exceptional funding scheme. The Commi
defaultssion notes that neither this consultation paper, nor the Government response to the consultation, explains how the exceptional funding provisions would apply in practice to cases that do not satisfy the residence test.  As well as showing that their case 
defaulthas legal merit, non-residents would be required to establish that a failure to give exceptional funding would be in breach of their ECHR or EU rights. 
defaultA pu
defaultblished legal opinion
default notes that this high-threshold additional requirement is only imposed on non-
defaultresidents and, being 
defaultpart of
default the differential treatment, it cannot be used to justify the differential treatment that the residence test would involve.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission's analysis also suggests the residence test would be difficult to operate in practice.  
defaultLawyers and advisers without expertise in immigration law cannot be expected to determine a client's status accurately. Even a specialist immigration practitioner may not be able to ascertain whether a person is lawfully resident in the UK unless the clien
defaultt can produce all relevant documents.  Some people may lack evidence of 12 months
default’
default 
defaultlawful residence in the UK 
default–
default 
defaultfor example if they are a British citizen or have a right of residence under EU law 
default–
default 
defaultor their status may be complicated or unclear for a range 
defaultof reasons.  Delays in ascertaining a person
default’
defaults immigration status may lead to them missing the three month deadline for a judicial review application. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposed residence test could also deny legal aid to people living outside the UK who want to bring
default judicial review proceedings under domestic law because of alleged human rights abuses by agents of the UK state. There is a risk that this exclusion would breach the strong procedural obligations
default of the state
default under Article 2 ECHR (the right to life) and A
defaultrticle 3 ECHR (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment).
default&#xa0;
defaultImplementing the proposed residence test could risk preventing litigation of the highest constitutional importance.  Examples of these cases are:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe cases of Baha Mousa (Al-Skeini
default) and Al-Sweady, which resulted in public inquiries being established into the ill-treatment of Iraqi civilians and the alleged non-combat killings of Iraqi insurgents by British troops; 
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR (Alaa
default’
default 
defaultNassif Jassim Al Bazzouni) v The Prime Minister &amp; Others,
default 
default which involved challenges to the guidelines under 
defaultwhich British Intelligence and military agents participate in joint combat operations with third party states overseas; and 
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAli Zaki Mousa v Secretary of State for Defence,
default which concerned whether the pr
defaultocesses set up to investigate allegations of ill-treatment by British forces in Iraq are sufficiently independent to satisfy the investigative duties arising under Articles 2 and 3 ECHR.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe residence test could also exclude judicial reviews by UK residen
defaultts who are not physically present in the United Kingdom when they become the victim of unlawful actions.  The Binyam Mohammed litigation, for example, concerned UK residents who were kept out of the country as victims of unlawful rendition and detention ab
defaultroad.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the residence test is implemented, such cases would be much less likely to be litigated in the UK courts or come to public attention - particularly as legislation has now excluded legal aid for judicial reviews that do not have the potential to p
defaultroduce a direct benefit for the claimant.
default  This will exclude funding for cases such as Maya Evans' judicial review concerning the transfer of detainees to Afghan custody. 
default&#xa0;
defaultProtective costs orders defaultThe system of Protective Costs Orders (PCOs) has been 
defaultevolved by the courts as a device for limiting the claimant
default’
defaults exposure to the risk of paying the defendant

defaults costs, should the claim fail and a costs order be made against the claimant.  The current PCO regime was established by the Court of Appeal,

default set out general principles for granting a PCO. These included whether the issues are of general public importance, the public interest in resolving them, the financial means of the claimant and whether the claimant lacks any private interest in the outcom
defaulte of the case.  The application of these principles is at the discretion of the court, taking into account all the circumstance of the case.  Cases where PCOs are granted may involve arguments relating 
defaultto equality or human rights, or the claimants may repr
defaultesent the interests of vulnerable individuals who share a protected characteristic.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn recent cases where PCOs have been granted, the courts have been less concerned to ensure that the claimant lacks any private interest in the judicial review.  This mor
defaulte flexible approach to PCOs was established by the Court of Appeal in the case of Morgan v Hinton Organics
default and has been applied by the High Court in a number of subsequent cases.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe MoJ suggests that this has 
default‘
defaulttipped the balance too far
default’
default 
defaultin favour of 
defaultclaimants and has proposed a new stipulation that a PCO should be denied to a claimant with a private interest in the case.  However, the impact of this proposal was not fully monetised in the MoJ
default’
defaults Impact Assessment and the Commission does not consider a 
defaultconvincing case for change has been made. The courts already apply a fact-sensitive analysis to the question of whether a PCO should be made and, if so, on what terms. In judicial review claims where a PCO is requested there is rarely equality of arms betw
defaulteen the parties; were that the case, it is unlikely that the claimant would be making such an application.   PCO applications with a realistic prospect of success can only be made by a claimant with limited resources who is challenging, in the public inter
defaultest, the decision of a public body with superior resources. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, the court should retain full discretion in relation to PCOs. If a case relates to an issue of general public importance which it is in the public interest to resolv
defaulte, the court should not be prevented from considering the grant of a PCO to a claimant who happens to have a secondary personal interest in the outcome.  
defaultProcedural defects in decisions defaultThe MoJ has put forward proposals to deal with the perceived problem
default of judicial review being used to challenge 
default‘
defaultprocedural defects.
default’
default  
defaultThese proposals suggest that the role of judicial review is perhaps not fully 
defaultunderstood.  It is not a system of appeal, but a process by which the High Court scrutinises the legality of de
defaultcisions by public bodies.  Essentially, judicial review is concerned with the manner in which a decision is reached, rather than the merits of the decision itself.   Remedies in judicial review are always discretionary; even if the court finds that a decis
defaultion or action was unlawful, it can refuse to order a remedy such as a quashing order or a mandatory order, or it can choose only to make a declaration that the decision was unlawful.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, on the rare occasions when a decision is
default quashed only to be remade in similar terms, this is not necessarily a poor use of court resources. The principal purpose of public law challenges is to ensure decisions are made properly by the executive bodies that are responsible for making them. Succes
defaultsful judicial reviews are not rendered 
default‘
defaultunsuccessful
default’
default 
defaultwhen they are followed by a properly made decision that is similar in substance to a decision that was unlawfully made before. 
defaultRelevant to this issue is the role of the PSED, which requires public auth
defaultorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality and foster good relations when performing their functions 
default–
default 
defaultwhether this involves formulating policies or taking operational decisions.  The PSED is a duty of consideratio
defaultn, rather than a duty to achieve any particular outcome or result. In judicial review cases involving the PSED and the predecessor duties, the courts have emphasised the importance of this duty of consideration and the need for authorities to have a consci
defaultous approach and state of mind when taking decisions.
default   In the recent Court of Appeal judgment in the Bracking case, Lord Justice McCombe emphasised the role of the PSED in making sure that a public body takes decisions lawfully: 
default&#xa0;
default‘
defaultIt seems to me that if
default a decision is reached without due regard to the PSED then it is an unlawful decision and, subject to any overarching discretionary features, the decision should be quashed.
default’
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, requiring the court to consider a 'no difference'
default defence at the permission stage risks forcing a full examination of the merits of the decision at the beginning of the case. The court would otherwise be unable to assess whether a different decision is likely or possible on the facts.  However, this appr
defaultoach could substantially increase the costs of the parties and those of the court at the permission stage. The Commission accepts that whether or not a remedy should be granted at the end of the case may sometimes turn on a 'no difference' argument. Howeve
defaultr, the 
defaultquality
default of decision-making should be the primary focus of the permission stage. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe recognise that 'no difference' arguments may be considered at a 'rolled up' hearing
default and that this can, in principle, save time and costs.  However, if the MoJ impl
defaultements its proposals to restrict legal aid for cases where permission is refused, rolled up hearings will be very unattractive for claimant lawyers who will 
defaultunderstandably want to avoid the financial risk of preparing the whole case without knowing whether
default permission will be granted.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother question is the extent to which, in practice, a clear distinction can be made between procedural flaws in administrative decisions, and substantive illegality. In the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, this is not a clear-cut as the MoJ suggests. Many judicial review claims are brought on multiple grounds and often more than one ground succeeds.  The principles of administrative law require the decision to be taken again, unless it is 
defaultinevita
defaultble
default that it would be the same as when it was made unlawfully.   It is not in the interests of the courts or the parties to generate more courtroom argument at the permission stage about whether that threshold, or any other lower threshold, is really met. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, it is important to consider the impact of encouraging a defendant to present a 'no difference' defence. If the defendant loses and the original decision is quashed, the decision must be taken afresh. However, as the defendant has previously a
defaultsserted (through the 
default‘
defaultno difference
default’
default 
defaultdefence) that the decision would remain unchanged if the judicial review succeeds, it will be hard to convince the claimant and the 
defaultgeneral public that the new decision will be made in good faith and with an open mind 
default–
default 
defaultas by law it should be.  
defaultThe Public Sector Equality Duty and judicial review defaultThe MoJ noted that the PSED review concluded that some public bodies adopt an overly risk adverse approach to the PSED because of 
default‘
defaultuncertainty as to how the courts would interpret the concept of 
default‘
defaultdue regard
default’’
default.  The review recommended a 
default‘
defaultproportionate and appropriate
default’
default 
defaultapproach to enforcing the PSED, and asked the Government to consider alternative means of reconciling disputes. 
defaultThe Co
defaultmmission
default’
defaults analysis suggests that excluding PSED disputes from the scrutiny of the courts
default, were that to be proposed,
default would be a counter-productive development.  As we note below, the courts have played a key role in clarifying the 
default‘
defaultdue regard
default’
default 
defaultduty 
default–
default 
defaultmost 
defaultrecently in the case of Bracking.
default   While the Commission
default’
defaults own role in enforcing the duty must be recognised, it would be unrealistic for this to become the primary means of scrutinising public authorities
default’
default 
defaultcompliance 
default–
default 
defaultespecially as using these formal po
defaultwers can be resource-intensive.  Our analysis of alternative methods of dispute resolution, particularly ombudsmen and mediation, suggests that they have a limited role to play in resolving PSED disputes.
defaultIn summary, our assessment suggests that insufficie
defaultnt account has been taken of the role of the pre-litigation protocol in assisting resolution of potential judicial review claims involving the PSED, and the role of the permission stage in encouraging early settlement.  As noted above, research indicates t
defaulthat a high proportion of judicial review claims settle in favour of the claimant, suggesting that the majority of cases have substantial merit.  Reminding a public authority that it is exposed to a potential judicial review can lead to a positive outcome w
defaultithout undue burden, if the authority promptly re-considers the decision in question to ensure 
defaultcompliance
default with the 
default‘
defaultdue regard
default’
default 
defaultduty.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission notes that relatively few judicial review claims involving the PSED proceed to a full hearing, and those 
defaultthat do almost always involve other grounds of challenge. We have undertaken our own analysis of 33 judicial review cases considered by the courts at a 
defaultsubstantive hearing where the claimant relied on the PSED under Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 (th
defaultese cases did not include claims that were settled without going to a full hearing.)  Our analysis suggests that, were the PSED to be eliminated as a ground for judicial review, most of these challenges would have been taken on other grounds in any event.
default&#xa0;
defaultOf these 33 cases, there were only three where the PSED was the sole ground of challenge; in the other 30 cases, one or more other grounds were advanced by the claimant (for example, breach of statutory obligations, breach of the HRA, failure to consult, 
defaultirrationality in decision-making, failure to follow own policies, acting ultra vires, breach of legitimate expectation).
default  In six cases, the PSED arguments were successful. In another case, the PSED arguments were not considered because the court allowed the claim on another ground.   Three other cases, where the PSED challenge did not succeed, were successful on non-PSED gr
defaultounds. 
defaultThe Commission of course recognises that it is preferable to avoid judicial review proceedings where possible. In our analysis, a statutory Code of Practice for the PSED would help public bodies understand their responsibilities under the duty and 
defaultmay help disputes arising in the first place. In response to the report of the PSED review, the Commission
default’
defaults chair, Baroness Onora O
default’
defaultNeill, wrote to the Secretary of State suggesting that:
default‘
default.....the best way to reduce bureaucracy and over-engineering of co
defaultmpliance with the PSED would be to publish a statutory Code. This would allow public bodies to be clear about what is legally required and to depend on the Code in defending challenges, because the courts place far greater weight on a Code than on guidance
default. Guidance cannot substitute for the certainty which a Code provides for bodies that may otherwise adopt what they intend to be a risk averse approach, which may lead to heavier bureaucratic requirements. This would be a key step in tackling the 
default‘
defaultgold plat
defaulting
default’
default 
defaultthat the report says has been identified.
default’
defaultThe Commission acknowledges its own role in helping avoid disputes relating to the PSED that might otherwise lead to individuals or organisations bringing claims for judicial review.  The Commission takes a 
defaultproportionate approach to the use of its powers, focusing primarily on promoting understanding of the PSED and encouraging compliance 
default–
default 
defaultincluding through publication of our guidance materials.  To maximise the impact of this work, we aim to collaborate wit
defaulth strategic partners, including regulators, inspectorates and ombudsmen (RIOs).   We recognise RIOs as key drivers for change in their sectors, as public authorities tend to focus on areas where they expect their performance to be scrutinised by sector reg
defaultulators.
defaultWhere the need for formal enforcement of the PSED is indicated, the Commission has a number of legal powers.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder Section 31EA 2006, the Commission may conduct an assessment of whether a body has complied with the PSED general duty. It must first
default publish terms of reference, after consulting with organisation(s) to be assessed.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder Section 32 EA 2006, if - following an assessment - the Commission thinks that an organisation has failed to comply with the PSED general duty, it can issue a complianc
defaulte notice setting out steps to be taken within 28 days.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithout first conducting an assessment, the Commission can also issue a compliance notice to a listed authority that has not complied with the specific duties under the PSED. 
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder Section 30 EA 2006,
default the Commission can bring a claim for judicial review in its own name against an authority that has not complied with the PSED general duty.  However, this power is rarely used.
defaultThe Commission recognises that using these formal powers can be resource inten
defaultsive and that they could, in some circumstances, risk encouraging defensiveness rather than openness on the part of the public bodies concerned.  In our response to the government consultation: 'Building a fairer Britain: reform of the Equality and Human 
defaultR
defaultights Commission',
default 
defaultwe noted that when fulfilling our role our status prevents us from using simple, effective methods such as mystery shopping that are open to charities and media organisations. We suggested in our response that allowing this modest incre
defaultase in our transparency powers would decrease costs and increase our effectiveness.
defaultIn the Commission
default’
defaults analysis, the MoJ has taken insufficient account of the pre-litigation protocol
default that must be observed before a claim for judicial review is issued (inc
defaultluding in disputes involving the PSED) and the impact of the 
defaultpermission filter operated by the 
defaultcourts
default. 
defaultThe pre-action protocol requires the parties to consider whether some form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedure would be more suitable than 
defaultlitigation, and if so, to seek agreement on which form to adopt. The list of ADR options includes discussion and negotiation, Ombudsman services, early neutral evaluation
default and mediation. Under the protocol, both the claimant and defendant may be required b
defaulty the Court to provide evidence that alternative means of resolving their dispute
default have been
default considered.
defaultThe permission stage for judicial review not only serves as a mechanism for filtering out cases that lack merit
default; it
default also allows the judge to provide a f
defaultorm of early neutral evaluation which can encourage the parties to reach a settlement without the need for a full hearing. As shown by research cited below, over half the cases that are granted permission are then settled without going to a full hearing.  
defaultAn additional factor is that, as part of the permission stage, the defendant must give the claimant disclosure of all relevant documents
default 
default–
default 
defaultwhich 
defaultputs the claimant in a better position to evaluate the strength of the claim and which may, in turn, support th
defaulte negotiation of a settlement.
defaultThere is some scope for Ombudsman schemes to investigate complaints involving alleged breaches of the PSED.  The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO), the Local Government 
defaultOmbudsman (LGO), the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and the Housing Om
defaultbudsman are likely to be the most appropriate options. The LGO has dealt with a number of complaints that involved breaches of the PSED and the former equality duties for gender, race and disability. 
defaultWhile some Ombudsman schemes may have a complementary r
defaultole in ensuring compliance with the PSED, in the Commission
default’
defaults analysis they cannot fulfill the same role as the courts. There are a number of reasons for this:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe role of the LGO and the PHSO (in relation to government departments) is to investigate comp
defaultlaints of maladministration. This is not the same question as whether a public authority has complied with the 
default‘
defaultdue regard
default’
default 
defaultduty under the PSED.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough Ombudsman recommendations are usually followed, unlike court orders their decisions are not binding on
default the authorities concerned.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOmbudsman investigations generally consider administrative decisions that have already been taken, whereas 
defaulta 
defaultjudicial review can consider the lawfulness of a decision-making process that has not yet been completed.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe three 
defaultmonth time limit for judicial review applications helps focus attention on the dispute, and on possible settlement, at an early stage. Ombudsman investigations can be quite slow to conclude: for example, complex LGO cases may take up to a year.  In 2012-20
default13, the PHSO
default’
defaults average investigation took 317 days.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOmbudsman schemes cannot usually consider cases that have gone to court, or would normally be expected to go to court. This means that complainants must decide from the outset which avenue of redress is 
defaultthe most appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith regard to the role of mediation as an alternative to judicial review in resolving disputes involving the PSED, the Commission has given careful consideration to research conducted by the Public Law Project (PLP) on mediation and
default judicial review.
default  The research project was devised in response to claims by the Government and mediation 
defaultproviders that mediation can lead to savings in costs and court time, and provide remedies to disputes that are not available to the courts.  It aime
defaultd to examine the reasons for practitioners
default’
default 
defaultlow take up of mediation for judicial review claims and consider whether it is possible or desirable to encourage greater take-up and 
default–
default 
defaultif so 
default–
default 
defaultin what circumstances.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission
default’
defaults analysis of the research fi
defaultndings is that, while there may be some limited scope for mediation in judicial review, the potential for expanding its use should not be over-stated.  The judicial review pre-action protocol already gives strong encouragement to ADR approaches, and a high
default proportion of potential claims do not go ahead because they are settled or withdrawn.  However, a major barrier to the use of ADR is the judicial review time limits, which require proceedings to be issued promptly, and within three months in any event.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe research recognised that the mandatory pre-action protocol for judicial review already plays a role in increasing the rate of settlement, by encouraging early correspondence between the parties.  Data was provided by a previous study, which looked at ne
defaultarly 1,500 judicial review claims from issue to conclusion, together with 170 cases from first contact between the parties.
default  It was found that these early communications led to an average of 60 per cent of initial threats of judicial review not going ahea
defaultd. Of these, 34 per cent were settled or withdrawn shortly after the claim was issued 
default–
default 
defaulteither because the court granted interim relief, which effectively resolved the dispute; because a remedy was provided by the defendants; or 
default–
default 
defaultmore rarely 
default–
default 
defaultbecause the
default claim was shown to lack merit. Of the claims that go forward to be considered at the permission stage by a judge, 60 per cent are refused permission to proceed. Of the cases that are granted permission, 56 per cent are settled before they reach a final he
defaultaring. Accordingly, only five per cent of judicial review claims were found to reach a substantive contested hearing.
default&#xa0;
defaultPractitioners interviewed for the research suggested that cases that cannot be resolved in direct negotiations could also be unsuitable f
defaultor mediation.  This included urgent cases and claims where there was need for a legal determination on a point of policy or law.  A number of 
defaultother factors appeared to militate against cases being mediated before a claim was issued 
default–
default 
defaultthe most important of 
defaultthese being the requirement to issue proceedings promptly, and in any event no later than three months from the date of the decision being challenged. Another factor was the frequent imbalance of power between the parties: four times as many defendant soli
defaultcitors as claimant solicitors gave 
default‘
defaultno room for compromise
default’
default 
defaultas a reason why they considered mediation to be unsuitable.  The research concluded that only in a small minority of cases would mediation seem attractive to defendants, namely where a duty has be
defaulten acknowledged, but the precise terms of its performance are disputed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the question of costs, the research found little, if any, evidence to support the suggestion that mediation is quicker or cheaper than judicial review.  The report concluded that 
defaultmediation may well be both quicker and cheaper than (say) a five day hearing involving multiple parties, but noted that a judicial review that proceeds to a final hearing typically lasts no longer than a day or two. Hence, mediation is likely to be a more 
defaultexpensive option for most judicial review cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission
default’
defaults assessment, the role of judicial review in allowing the courts to clarify the 
default‘
defaultdue regard
default’
default 
defaultduty under the PSED should not be under-estimated.  In the recent decision in Bracking,
default the Co
defaulturt of Appeal took the opportunity of endorsing the approach to 
default‘
defaultdue regard
default’
default 
defaultestablished in the Brown case,
default bringing alongside the 
default‘
defaultBrown principles
default’
default 
defaultthe dicta of other key judgments on the PSED/the former equality duties. The Court also emphasized the ro
defaultle of the PSED in the current climate of austerity:
default&#xa0;
default‘
defaultAny government, particularly in a time of austerity, is obliged to take invidious decisions which may exceptionally bear harshly on some of the most disadvantaged in society. The PSED does not curb gove
defaultrnment's powers to take such decisions, but it does require government to confront the anticipated consequences in a conscientious and deliberate way in so far as they impact upon the equality objectives for those with the characteristics identified in sec
defaulttion 149(7) of the Equality Act 2010.
