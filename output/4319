defaultAFS18default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by Richard Morgandefault&#xa0;defaultEducation Committee's enquiry on Academies and Free Schoolsdefault&#xa0;defaultI am a school governor, but I'm writing this as a concerned individual who recently had cause to lock horns with a local secondary academy over changes it wanted to make to its admissions process. The school in question is Tudor Grange Secondary Academy in Solihull.

defaultWhat became apparent during the protracted and widespread debate that raged as a result of their proposed changes, was the complete lack of accountability academies have. Compared to state schools where the local authority and ultimately the government can be called in to exert accountability, it's not even possible to have a dialogue with an academy's directors (aka governors) if they

default want to have one. Repeated attempts to contact and speak with parent governors were ignored, complaints to the secretary of state for education were referred to the education funding agency (no surprise there as no-one expects Michael Gove to do anything but support academies) and the EFA's response was to refer to the office of the schools adjudicator if we felt there was an issue with admissions (which we did).
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is a completely unsatisfactory situation which means the taxpayer (for it is still the taxpayer footing the bill) has no right to question what the academy does, no recourse to a formally laid down process to engage with the academy and the academy has no obligation to respond to questions raised or engage with the community. Academies are being run and treated like private companies, but companies have shareholders who can hold the directors accountable, dismiss  directors and appoint new ones. This is an impossibility at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultA school like this is in charge of a budget of approximately £5m per annum, assets of around £2m and around 600 young peoples' educations. All of this is put into the hands of unqualified, inexperienced and sometimes incompetent individuals some of whom immerse their ego's in the newly-acquired title of 'director'. Is it any wonder many of them are failing and some of them are subject to criminal investigations?
default&#xa0;
defaultIf I had to summarise my rant for the committee, it would be this:
default&#xa0;
default“There should be a legal obligation for academies to hold annual general meetings which are open to the public where directors can be held publically accountable for the money they're spending, decisions they're making and results they're producing?”default&#xa0;defaultanddefault&#xa0;default“The election of governors, trustees and directors onto the board of academies should be overseen and administered by an independent, local authority body”default&#xa0;defaultDecember 2013
