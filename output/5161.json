"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nLen \nTawn\n [TOB\n27\n]\n&#xa0;1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI would like to take the opportunity to add my voice in a small but I believe significant way to the debate your are having regarding tobacco smuggling and illegal product sales. By way of background my wife and I run a small specialists tobacconists amongst our other businesses, not ignoring the health issues it is important that small legal outlets survive because the alternative is much more dangerous for the health of those who are unable for whatever reason to quit smoking. The product we sell whilst harmful is far less harmful than the product that is undermining our business, it is not constrained by quality control.Â  Everything we sell has UK taxes paid which puts us at severe price disadvantage in the eyes of our customers.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is human nature, especially in this country, to get something for nothing and as long as contraband goods are freely available then customers will always be happy to purchase them despite the risks, more needs to be done to stop the goods arriving here in the first place, more powers of search, arrest and seizure of stock need to be given to whichever authority is ultimately responsible, the cost of extra officers would be more than met by the increase in legal UK tax paid sales that would result as less contraband becomes available.\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy way of example one outlet in Hereford openly sells illegal product and has been visited on a number of occasions, in the last 3 years goods have been seized with a market value in the thousands, within hours the shop is openly trading again with more illegal product, this clearly demonstrates that the deterrent is by nowhere near effective enough and the profit margin great enough to weather the inconvenience of disruption. Whilst this shop is trading illegally our business suffers by a reduction of 1/3 of our sales, multiply that across the country and the loss of revenue in taxes b\necomes a significant figure not\nwithstanding the detrimental effect on the health of the users of the illegal tobacco putting additional pressure on the Health Service.\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI would urge this committee to place a much stronger emphasis on prevention of the product entering the country in the first place and much stronger penalties for offenders, the ability to close down persistent offenders would be a step in the right direction.\n&#xa0;\nLen \nTawn\nRetailer, Hereford\nAugust 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n \n&#xa0;\n"
