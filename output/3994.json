"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Summit Power Group (CCS0046)&#xa0;Summit Power welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the committee on CCS. The development of CCS is fundamental\n to the UK and international ability to mitigate the effects of climate change whilst delivering society’s energy needs. CCS is complimentary to other low carbon energy sources such as renewables and nuclear.\n&#xa0;\nSummit Power has been focused on the developme\nnt of CCS projects for the last ten years and has in the last 3 years focused in the UK to develop a sister plant to its project in  Texas – the Texas Clean Energy Project (TCEP). Summit Power entered the UK in anticipation of DEMO 2-4 in 2011 when Longann\net was in FEED. As such, we are perhaps unique in bringing a perspective of the challenges the industry faces to get CCS started.\n&#xa0;\nSummit Power and CO2DeepStore are joint developers of the proposed Captain Clean Energy Project(CCEP), a new build IGCC plant\n at Grangemouth on the Forth Estuary. The developers are in discussion with DECC about the project.\n&#xa0;\nSummit Power offers the following input to the committee;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe would be glad to provide further input should\n the committee require.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;"
