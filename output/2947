default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultGatwick Airport Limited welcomes the opportunity to respond to the ‘Winter res
defaultilience in transport’ inquiry. 
defaultSince the severe weather that was experienced in 2009-2010 Gatwick has undertaken a number of 
defaultmeasures
default, including 
defaultinvesting £8 million to 
defaultsignificantly increase
default our snow clearing equipment
default,
default 
defaultto en
defaultsure that the airport is fully prepare
defaultd to deal wi
defaultth adverse 
defaultweather conditions. 
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn relation to winter resilience, 
defaultGatwick’s
default priorities are to maintain a safe pavement surface condition for aircraft operations, minimise disruption to airport operations and reduce inconvenience to airline passengers. In order to do 
defaultthis, we work closely with our airlines
default and their
default 
defaultground hand
defaultl
defaulters
default, NATs
default and other airport partners under a clear command and control structure. 
defaultIt is essential that all partners work well together to ensure success. 
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are confident that the necessary 
defaultsteps have 
defaultbeen
default taken to
default ensure
default 
defaultthat Gatwick is best placed to cope with adverse weather. This was highlighted over the 
defaultmost recent winter period 2012/2013 when Gatwick was 
defaultable to remain op
defaulten throughout the winter period. This was in contrast to other 
defaultLon
defaultdon
default airports which were forced to close or to cancel hundreds of flights the day before, causing widespread disruption to thousands of passengers. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultGatwick Airport is the UK’s second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in 
defaultthe world. It serves more than 195 destinations in 90 countries for around 34.2 million passengers a year on short- and long-haul point-to-point services
default (source:
default OAG
default)
default. It is also a major economic driver for the South-East region, generating around 23,000 
defaulton-airport jobs and a further 13,000 jobs through related activities. The airport is 28 miles south of London with excellent public transport links, including the Gatwick Express. Gatwick Airport is owned by a group of international investment
default and pension
default 
defaultfunds.
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe winter season runs from 1st November to 31st March and throughout this period 
defaultGatwick Airport is resp
defaultonsible for clearing snow and anti
default-icing the runway, taxiways, car parks and airport roads. This amounts to 1.8 million 
defaultsq.
default ft of runway and 23 miles of surface roads
default. During the winter season, we handle on average 650 flights per day, carrying 
defaultapproximately
default 
default100,000 passengers
default a day
default (arriving &amp; departing)
default.
default              
default 
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn December 2010 transport networks across Europe faced significant d
defaultisruption due to snow and ice. Airports experienced operational impacts which, alongside safety considerations, resulted in flight delays and cancellations. Gatwick was affected by the adverse weather conditions on two occasions during this period.
default2.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultSince this period Gatwick has undertaken 
defaulta series
default of measures to mitigate the possible risks of adverse weather. Gatwick has a clearly defined command and control structure, which is designed to 
defaultdeal with events such as extreme weather in an efficient and 
defaulteffective manner. 
default2.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultearly 2013
default the South East
default 
defaultexperienced over 5cm of snow. During this period, Gatwick was able to keep the airport open and running having introduced 
defaultmeas
defaultures to deal with such problems. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor all types of 
defaultincident or disruptive events Gatwick Airport Limited has a well-developed command and control structure. This is modeled on the three tier structure of Gold (strategic), Silver (tactical) and Bronze (operational). The three tier command and control model 
defaultis well understood and regularly rehearsed
default. 
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs part of this structure, Gatwick has an Airport Snow Plan. Th
defaulte
default aim of this plan is to 
defaultdeal with the 
defaultimpact of snow and ice in a professional manner, with a clear and constant focus on minimising disruption and inconvenience to airline 
defaultpassengers. In
default order to minimise risks, Gatwick works closely with our airlines
default and their
default handling agents
default, NATs
default and other
default airport partners. Throughout any disruption we are dedicated to the welfare of passengers and the provision of timely communications to airport users and external audiences.
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThroughout these periods Gatwick also works closely with the DfT, ensuring they a
defaultre kept up to date with all relevant development
defaults. This includes regular Situation Reports
default with the Department
default to keep them informed of our handling of the situation. 
default3.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultOur command and control contingency process is central to our ability to react swiftly and in a co-ordinated 
defaultmanner.
default The 
defaultstructure allows the inclusion of other stakeholders to facilitate a multi- agency response.  This 
defaultinvolves 
defaultensuring that all parties a
defaultre familiar with this process and the use of the relevant tools such as the Common Recognised Information Picture (CRIP) and Situation Reports.
default In order to improve performance Gatwick has invested £397
default,000
default in upgrading the 
defaultIT &amp; Communications 
defaultequipment wit
defaulthin the Silver and Bronze Disruption Suites.
default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultGatwick has coherent and interlocked plans
default,
default starting with the seven weather states
default (
defaultsee Appendix A
default)
default that dictate activation of certain elements of the plans. These p
defaultlans have been shared with the a
defaultirport 
defaultcommunity so that they understand and agree the processes.
default 
defaultTo ensure that the airport is ready and prepared in advance, each business function
default across the airport
default has 
defaultidentified the
default resources required to be effective.  These elements are separately listed 
defaultw
defaultith
default a Red, Amber or Green (RAG) status.  This 
defaultallows for the silver and bronze command structures to 
defaulthave an instant Common Recognised Information Picture to aid their decision making.  The status of each element is reviewed at each weather state within th
defaulte plans, ensuring that the decision makers have accurate information.
default3.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultGatwick also engage
defaults
default other surface providers such as the rail, road, coach, car parking and car rental companies
default, in order
default to align their plans with the airports.  All surface providers update Gatwick every two hours during disruption so that we can update our passengers and staff with the latest information.  The weather states and trigger points have also been provided to S
defaultussex Police to assist with their preparedness for any disruption.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultSince 2009 Gatwick has invested £8million in airfield snow clearing vehicles and equipment.  This has increased t
defaulthe vehicle fleet from 47 to 107, with 
defaultan 
defaultadditional 70 pieces of snow clearing equipment enabling Gatwick to clear the runway in a single sweep whilst simultaneously clearing taxiways and stands.  Over this period Gatwick has also doubled the number of vehicles available to the Surface Access tea
defaultm, increasing their capability to clear landside footpaths and roads.
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultGatwick now has 230 staff trained to operate the snow clearing equipment; this includes Handling Agent staff to assist with the clearance of 
defaultaircraft 
defaultstands and 150 business partners to 
defaultclear landside areas. 
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultGatwick has also developed a trained pool of non-operational staff who can be called on to assist with the implementation of the plans
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey are designated as ‘Polar bears’, (airside snow clearance) ‘Operational Foxes’, (frontline su
defaultpport) ‘Operational Leopards’, (leadership of support roles) and ‘Yetis’, (landside snow clearance).  There 
defaultare also
default 154 non-operational staff
default members
default that have been trained in bag loading to support the Security Operation
default (see Appendix B)
default.  
default4.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultEach plan has
default a trigger point as to when each of these pools are made aware (standby) and deploy
defaulted
default to ensure that the optimum resource is available.  To ensure that critical staff have the best chance of getting to the airport Gatwick has enabled all staff to order (fr
defaultee of charge) snow socks for their cars, and developed into the plan points where 4x4 vehicles will pick up staff.  The pick-up plan also incorporates Border Force staff.
default4.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn respect of 
defaulta
defaultnti–icing and 
defaultd
defaulte-icing Gatwick has increased its liquid storage capacity from 170,000 litres to over 500,000 litres and additionally holds 45,000kg of solid media 
default(i.e. salt) 
defaultwhich is sufficient for a ‘normal’ season or ten days of extreme conditions.  There is also a co
defaultntingency temporary storage facility for a further 147,000 litres.  Gatwick has also increased its de-icing fleet from three to six. 
defaultThis winter Gatwick will take another step forward with the introduction o
defaultf ‘engines running’ de-icing
default.  Remote de-icing is
default available for any airline or de-icing company that have submitted a risk assessment and method statement. 
default4.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultTo ensure that connectivity to both terminals is maintained to an optimum level
default,
default improvements have also been made to the inter-terminal shuttle.  Po
defaultwer rail heating 
defaultand brushes h
defaultave
default been installed and a new 5
default,
default000 litre Konsin tank has 
defaultbeen installed which pumps anti
default–icing fluid to the carriages.

defaultFuture Resilience across the London Airport Systemdefault&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the key issues that will need to be addressed when 
defaultlooking at future resilience acr
defaultoss the London airport system 
defaultis
default Heathrow’s over scheduling
default of flights in the key winter
default months. In order to ensure that the best plans are in place to deal with 
defaultany 
defaultadverse weather Gatwick believes that it is necessary for Heathrow to put in place a more robust plan to ensure future resilience. 
default5.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn January this year Gatwick called on the Government to bring together London’s three main airports to work out how we can 
defaultbest avoid significant numbers of business and leisure passengers being impacted by large numbers of pre-emptive flight cancellations at Heathrow. This was seen following the 
defaultunacceptable and damaging
default 
defaultnumber of 
defaultcancellations at Heathrow when London experie
defaultnced light amounts of snow early in 2013. 
default5.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the long-term, we believe that following the recommendations of 
defaultthe Airports Commission
default this issue will be addressed with a new runway in the South East creating greater capacity. However it is not likely that 
defaultthis will be delivered until the mid-2020s 
defaultat the earliest 
defaultand as such we believe that further measures need to be taken by Heathrow to ensure that such disruptions are limited. Gatwick put forward a number of proposals in a letter to the Secretary of Stat
defaulte in January this year
default. (
defaultAppen

defaultix 
defaultC
default)
default. 
default5.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to ensure that we can limit the impact of adverse weather
default we
default believe that Heathrow will need to stop their current approach to overscheduling during December, January and February. We believe it is vital for Heathrow to declare 
defaulta level of capacity it can cope with in winter conditions. The additional flights t
defaulthen, 
defaultfor those three months, would be able to
default move to Gatwick and Stansted. As a result there would be better use of the existing capacity at our London airports, safety would be enhanced and passengers will not have to panic every time it snows. 
defaultAs a result we
default are calling on the a
defaultirports and airlines 
defaultto
default work together to make this happen.
default5.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultClearly in extreme winter weather conditions a level of disruption at airports is to be expected but we should all be able to be open for business when confronted with normal winter weather conditions as 
defaultwas experienced in January of this year.

defaultPassengerdefault Welfare and Information default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe welfare of the passenger 
defaultis paramount to Gatwick and our Snow Plan includes provisions for 
defaultsleeping areas with beds, blankets
default, 
defaultfood and water.
default We have in stock 4,000 blankets, 600 mattresses, four pallets of water (8,000 bottles of water), 600 folding beds, 20 snow shovels, four baby bottle warmers, 10 travel cots and a mixture of baby food and nappies.
default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring periods of disruption
default,
default opening time
defaults of restaurants 
defaultand retail outlets are extended
default.
default We make all internet-zone access within the terminals free, allowing passengers to check with their airline websites or re-book flights if required
default.
default6.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are also aware of the vital role of communication in a
defaultny response
default.  The volunteers are provided with task cards and clear communication links so that they are capable of providing relevant and timely information.  Gatwick has also fully embraced the social media networks and use these to communicate and provi
defaultde upda
defaultted information.  Gatwick has 
defaultmodified Flight Information and Passenger Information screens to provide a more flexible information platform.
default We put on additional staff in the terminals to assist passengers with general enquiries. We also ensure our 
defaultTwitter feed and our website are constantly updated and monitored.

defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;default7.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe safety of passengers and airport
default 
defaultusers will always be our main priority during any adverse weather 
defaultconditions. 
default 
default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultSince the severe weather of 2009-2010 Gatwick has put in a place a series of measures, investing over £8m, in order to minimise any disruption. 
default7.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe winter period 2012-2013 saw widespread snowfall across the South East; however as a result of the processes
default in place, Gatwick was able to remain open throughout this period.
default7.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that Heathrow needs to develop a more robust approach to its winter resilience and that it should look directly at how to limit the overscheduling of flights during the winter months. 
default 
default7.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are confident 
defaultthat
default 
defaultwe have the correct structures in pla
defaultce to continue to uphold the highest of standards when dealing with adverse weather. 
default7.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe will continue to review any adverse weather events to ensure that we are aware or lessons learnt in order to shape future planning and preparation.
