Written evidence submitted by Rights Watch UK (JRR 0009)[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Our Mission: [bold]Promoting human rights and holding governments to account, drawing upon the lessons learned from the conflict in Northern Ireland. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our Expertise and Achievements: [bold]Since 1990 we have provided support and services to anyone whose human rights were violated
[normal] as a result of conflict. Our interventions have reflected our range of expertise, from the right to a fair trial to the government’s positive obligation to protect life. We have a long record of working closely with NGOs and government authorities to shar
[normal]e that expertise. And we have received wide recognition, as the first winner of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Prize in 2009 alongside other honours.
[normal]Our Judicial Review Experience: [bold]We have substantial experience as a th
[normal]ird party intervener in a number of judicial review applications before the courts of England and Wales and Northern Ireland.  We have intervened as both a sole third party intervener and as a co-intervener with other NGOs.  Our interventions have included
[normal] a range of human rights engaged issues including the length of pre-charge detention in terrorist cases
[normal] and
[normal] the certification of trial without jury in Northern Ireland
[normal].  In addition we intervened in an application engaging minority language rights 
[normal]regarding
[normal] the 
[normal]reasonable 
[normal]expectation to speak Irish in the courts in Northern Ireland.  We have also intervened in applications before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).  Our most recent co-intervention before the ECtHR was in 
[normal]A
[normal]l-Saadoon and Mufdh
[normal]i v UK
[normal] [61498/08] following litiga
[normal]tion before the domestic courts on the issues of the jurisdiction of the European Convention of Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.  We are in the process of developing a human rights strategic litigation policy.
[normal]R
[normal]ights watch (UK) has responded to both the Consultations of the Ministry of Justice regarding judicial review.  Our submissions to the Joint Committee on Human Rights are limited to the issues arising from the latter Consultation paper “Judicial Review 
[normal](CM
[normal] 8703) encompassing questions of standing and intervention and costs.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]Standing and Interventions[bold]We see
[normal] no 
[normal]problem in a judicial review application 
[normal]being 
[normal]made
[normal] by a claimant with no direct interest in the matter
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] In particular
[normal] when the case involves issu
[normal]es encompassing human rights, the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA98)
[normal],
[normal] which partially incorporates the European 
[normal]Convention
[normal] on 
[normal]Human
[normal] Rights 1950 (the Convention)
[normal],
[normal] and the powers invested in the judiciary to strike down aspects of policy and legislation which are found to be incompatible with the Convention
[normal]. The purpose of 
[normal]a 
[normal]judicial review 
[normal]by the judiciary 
[normal]is to hold the 
[normal]e
[normal]xecutive to account
[normal] in the exercise of its 
[normal]power
[normal] 
[normal]when engaged in 
[normal]decision making
[normal] on the implementation of legislation or policy. 
[normal]  
[normal]I
[normal]n
[normal] matters
[normal] relating to the exercise of executive power
[normal] 
[normal]when human rights are engaged
[normal], it is in the public interest
[normal] that 
[normal]the exercise of these powers
[normal],
[normal] which raise 
[normal]human 
[normal]rights based 
[normal]challenges
[normal],
[normal] can 
[normal]be 
[normal]brought to the attention of the 
[normal]judiciary 
[normal]for review 
[normal]T
[normal]he public has an interest in the operation of this process, as well as in th
[normal]e substantive issues concerned specifically when there has been a
[normal]n
[normal] actual or possible
[normal] human ri
[normal]ghts violation, an issue of incompatibility 
[normal]between domestic law and the Convention 
[normal]or 
[normal]the possibility of 
[normal]derogation
[normal] from an Article of the Convention. 
[normal]In terms of specific problems that would arise from a more restrictive test for standing, we are concer
[normal]ned about the impact this would have on 
[normal]human rights 
[normal]NGO
[normal]s in particular and their
[normal] ability to engage in the judicial review process. An NGO 
[normal]can hold an
[normal] important position 
[normal]in civil society 
[normal]that bridges the gap between a particular legislative 
[normal]instrument or p
[normal]olicy 
[normal]proposal
[normal],
[normal] and those 
[normal]directly or potentially 
[normal]affected by it. It is 
[normal]possible
[normal] that in some situations members of the public would be unaware of particular legislative details that would affect the
[normal]ir human rights, a
[normal]nd an NGO plays an important role in re
[normal]presenting 
[normal]and assisting individuals and 
[normal]groups to ensure they are not 
[normal]detrimentally affected by any such proposals
[normal] which interfere with their human rights, and by extension the rights held within wider society. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rights Watch (UK) understands 
[normal]that the 
[normal]policy motor driving 
[normal]the proposed 
[normal]reforms
[normal] to standing
[normal] 
[normal]in judicial review 
[normal]interventions
[normal] is the incorrect assumption put forth in the 
[normal]C
[normal]onsultation that “Parliament and the elected Government are best placed to determine what is in the public interest” (
[normal]p
[normal]arag
[normal]raphs 79-80). We
[normal] consider
[normal] this 
[normal] to be
[normal] fundamentally wrong in the context of judicial review 
[normal]and human rights
[normal], specifically
[normal] 
[normal]when it is 
[normal]the operation of executive
[normal] 
[normal]powers 
[normal]that are being scrutinised
[normal] and challenged to remedy or prevent human rights 
[normal]violations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] This may be
[normal] directly by the state
[normal],
[normal]  through 
[normal]a 
[normal]failure of the state to protect human rights
[normal],
[normal] or through a failure to comply with the Convention or under the HRA98
[normal]. 
[normal]The present Consultation 
[normal]misunderstands the purpose of judicial review and 
[normal]the need for 
[normal]publ
[normal]ic scrutiny 
[normal]of 
[normal]executive decision
[normal]-making
[normal].   This is particularly important when 
[normal]human rights issues (broadly defined and interpreted) are engaged
[normal] given the primacy of the Convention and its effect under the HRA98
[normal] and the powers of the judiciary to make dec
[normal]larations of incompatibility. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A similar concern can be seen in the context of the proposals 
[normal]regarding access to 
[normal]legal aid, where the assessment of 
[normal]financial eligibility 
[normal]is 
[normal]in 
[normal]part based on the prospects of success 
[normal](merits) 
[normal]of the case. In our opinion, the mere process of investigating and reviewing 
[normal]particular executive 
[normal]actions is essential to 
[normal]the process of 
[normal]effective public scrutiny and this is placed in danger if the process is amended 
[normal]along the lines proposed by the govern
[normal]ment. 
[normal]It may be that in other areas the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment
[normal]’s
[normal] superior expertise would be a convincing argument, but we do not 
[normal]consider
[normal] that it is justified in th
[normal]e
[normal] context
[normal] of what is fundamentally a constitutional challenge
[normal]. The proposed 
[normal] restriction 
[normal]has the effect
[normal] of 
[normal]reducing scrutiny and
[normal] 
[normal]accountability
[normal] on issues of huma
[normal]n rights
[normal] which have possible supranational consequences
[normal]. It would also impact on the powers vested in the judiciary to strike down as incompatible 
[normal]legislation and 
[normal]policy 
[normal]which offends the Convention
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A 
[normal]more 
[normal]restrictive test for standing would place 
[normal]both 
[normal]the effectiveness and 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential benefits of judicial review in an even more vulnerable position by limiting those who could challenge to individuals or groups that are
[normal],
[normal] in the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment’s persp
[normal]ective
[normal],
[normal] most 
[normal]engaged
[normal]. 
[normal] Assuming that 
[normal]judicial review 
[normal]is
[normal] a 
[normal]constitutional 
[normal]tool for accountability
[normal] exercised by the judiciary in relation to the executive
[normal], the whole of society has an interest in ensuring it is used to its full 
[normal]extent and 
[normal]potential and a 
[normal]more restrictive test for standing misunderstands
[normal] 
[normal]this. 
[normal]Of particular concern is the issue of when a human rights based challenged needs to be made when 
[normal]the effect of 
[normal]domestic policy or legislation is potentially incompatible with the Convention
[normal].  
[normal]Judicial
[normal] review remains the primary vehicle through which such a human
[normal] rights challenge can be bought and this should be protected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We stress
[normal] judicial review in relation to human rights 
[normal]is not a campaigning 
[normal]tool 
[normal]but 
[normal]is an issue of assistance and representation, 
[normal]government 
[normal]accountability
[normal] and human rights compliance
[normal]. 
[normal]Furthermore, it is not clear what issues may arise in the future and a more liberal approach to standing
[normal],
[normal] such as 
[normal]exists presently
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]allows for such flexibility as issues evolve. 
[normal] The presence of an NGO
[normal] adding value to a judicial review application or as claimant asserts the importance of civil society in the litigation system and enables a broader consideration of factors introduced by those with expertise and knowledge to be taken by the judiciary in i
[normal]ts consideration of the challenge made in the application. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A more restrictive test for standing not only misunderstands the nature and purpose of judicial review as a constitutional tool, but also may mean in specific cases that there is no 
[normal]individual or
[normal] group 
[normal]claimant to challenge a decision
[normal] in the exercise of power or policy
[normal] when human rights issues are engaged
[normal]. For example, there may be cases where a particular policy has not had a direct effect on an individual yet or the individual is unable to bring
[normal] a challenge.
[normal] 
[normal]The standing of a human rights 
[normal]NGO would therefore ensure that these human rights concerns are 
[normal]ventilated
[normal] before the courts ensuring the executive does not escape its human rights obligations
[normal] or avoid human rights compliance
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our view, the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment has failed to explain why the current test for standing is unsatisfactory. There is no evidence to suggest that the courts misapply the current test in a way that leads to problems asserted by the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment such as “to seek pub
[normal]licity” or “hinder the process of proper decision-making” (
[normal]p
[normal]aragraphs 79-80)
[normal] (however ‘proper’ decision-making is defined)
[normal]. Therefore
[normal],
[normal] we do not 
[normal]consider
[normal] that any of the proposed alternatives would be more reasonable. 
[normal] 
[normal]The current test for standing allows 
[normal]for flexibility that depends on context and issue whilst at the same time recognising the importance of judicial review in assessing 
[normal]the exercise of executive powers
[normal] specifically when h
[normal]uman rights issues are engaged and where human rights compliance is in 
[normal]question. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Costs and P[bold]ermissi[bold]on [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The government has suggested 
[normal]that providers should onl
[normal]y be paid for work carried out in
[normal] an application for judicial review in cases either where permission is granted or where the LAA exercises its discretion to pay the provider in a case where proceedings are issued but the case concludes prior to a permission decision
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We do not agree with
[normal] the above 
[normal]government 
[normal]proposal. 
[normal]Specifically in relation to human rights challenges through judicial review i
[normal]t would discourage
[normal] public
[normal] lawyers from 
[normal]undertaking
[normal] 
[normal]applications for judicial review as the financial risk
[normal],
[normal] if the case does not proceed beyond 
[normal]the 
[normal]permission 
[normal]stage
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]will lie with them
[normal] and permission stage is inevitably challenged by the government through the Treasury Solicitors
[normal]. 
[normal]Public l
[normal]awyers 
[normal]cannot 
[normal]be expected to bear 
[normal]this
[normal] financial burden
[normal] on matters as urgent as human rights 
[normal]as it would mean that
[normal] the focus of the application would be the financ
[normal]ial risk
[normal] as opposed to the benefit to the cl
[normal]aimant
[normal] whose human rights are in issue
[normal] or the potential 
[normal]wider public interest 
[normal]importance of the application.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]government’s 
[normal]proposal would lead to judicial re
[normal]view cases being restricted to those who could bear the financial risks associated with proceeding to 
[normal]the Administrative 
[normal]court, thus reducing the ability of many members of the public and 
[normal]civil society 
[normal]organisations
[normal] such as human rights NGOs
[normal] to challenge important policy decisions of the executive
[normal] which have implications for human rights
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For example
[normal] the important recent Supreme Court judicial review judgment in
[normal] 
[normal]Osborne and Booth v The Parole Board; In the application of James Clyde Reilly 
[normal]for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland)
[normal] [2013] UKSC 61
[normal] might not have been taken if the current funding proposals had been in place because public lawyers instructed on behalf of the claimants would have been deterred by the financial risk incurred in under
[normal]taking preliminary work before the permission stage. 
[normal]This case engaged human rights principles articulated in both common law and under the Convention. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore, the proposal undermines the purposes of judicial review and legal aid. 
[normal] 
[normal]Judicial review s
[normal]hould enable members of society to challenge 
[normal]the actions and decisions of the 
[normal]executive and this ability should be based on the importance of the policy and 
[normal]the merits of the challenge
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]not the ability to fund such a challenge. Legal aid should enable thos
[normal]e who cannot afford legal assistance to engage in the judicial review process and obtain the legal representation that is necessary to ensure fair legal access irrespective of finances
[normal].  This is with the safeguard that the judiciary determines standing and
[normal] that the public interest should be defined within the context of the balance and the separation of powers between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive
[normal]. 
[normal] When human rights issues are engaged then this demand for open access to justice becomes a
[normal]n imperative. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal 
[normal]undermines 
[normal]th
[normal]ese principles 
[normal]by distinguishing which stages of the process 
[normal]merit 
[normal] financial assistance, i.e. only if it satisfies the permission stage. 
[normal]This 
[normal]distinction 
[normal]offends the equality of arms principle
[normal] which is 
[normal]enshrined
[normal] in the Convention jurisprudence
[normal].  
[normal]However, the preparatory stage 
[normal]of a judicial review application 
[normal]is 
[normal]important in the 
[normal]process and 
[normal]legal service 
[normal]providers should not be expected to bear the costs themselves. The proposal also means that a decision about wh
[normal]ich cases are the most deserving is determining the availability of legal assistance. Legal representation is fundamental to the whole process
[normal] of judicial review 
[normal]and should not be dependent on the case reaching a certain stage
[normal], contested by the government
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Restricting funds 
[normal]until
[normal] after the permission stage would discourage many
[normal] public 
[normal]lawyers from engaging in the process at
[normal] the preliminary s
[normal]tage, further reducing the number of judicial review applications. This reduction would be based on 
[normal]the 
[normal]inability to
[normal] meet the costs, which would have a detrimental 
[normal]e
[normal]ffect on the most vulnerable members of society. Far from meeting the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment’s objectives of reducing judicial review to cases that are the most important (a judg
[normal]e
[normal]ment that is based on a flawed presumpti
[normal]on that the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment is 
[normal]always 
[normal]best placed to decide who is most deserving) it would only serve to skew judicial review applications to those with greater financial resources and exclude members of society who are most vulnerable in the face of the propo
[normal]sals that require challenge. 
[normal]These are the members of society whose human rights will often b
[normal]e
[normal] the subject of the application. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Protective [bold]C[bold]ost [bold]Orders[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The government has asked 
[normal]whether it is appropriate to stipulate that PCOs will not be available in any
[normal] case where there is an individual or private interest regardless of whether th
[normal]ere is a wider public interest.  
[normal]We oppose the restriction of the availability of PCOs. We do not 
[normal]consider
[normal] it is suitable to prevent PCOs being available in a case where there i
[normal]s an individual or private interest in the case. The public interest in the case is the most important 
[normal]form of 
[normal]interest and it would not be appropriate to restrict PCOs just because there is also a private or individual interest at stake. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposals w
[normal]ould generate greater uncertainty for claimants who may be 
[normal]deterred 
[normal]by the costs they may 
[normal]incur
[normal] if their 
[normal]application
[normal] is unsuccessful. It would create a chilling effect by placing financial barriers on those who w
[normal]ant
[normal] to engage in the 
[normal]judicial review 
[normal]process
[normal]. NGOs and vulnerable individuals who would not be able to bear the financial risk that would be associated if the availability of PCOs was limited would be discouraged from bringing claims which might be important to bring in the public interest. This wou
[normal]ld especially be true for NGOs whose role involves bringing cases to the attention of the court and the public even if the policy has not had a direct effect on an individual 
[normal]or group as of 
[normal]yet. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a link between the importance of bringing the case
[normal] into the public attention by NGOs who may take on the responsibility if the policy is not publicly known yet, and the consequent chilling effect because they are hindered by the potential costs. Sometimes, it is important for issues to be brought to the a
[normal]ttention of the public and the courts, even if in the particular case is not successful as it
[normal] is 
[normal]  the process of challenge
[normal] in itself
[normal] that must be preserved, and this should not depend upon financial resources. 
[normal]NGO funding is reliant on a mixture of philan
[normal]thropy or other form of 
[normal]membership
[normal] subscription.  Those funding NGO work in terms of strategic litigation would also be deterred from funding if they were to be co-joined as potential bears of litigation risk costs
[normal],
[normal] as would corporate sponsors (for example
[normal] pro bono units of commercial law firms) who might be exposed to unacceptable unquantifiable costs in public interest litigation.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The government asks h
[normal]ow could the principles for making a PCO be modified to ensure a better balance a) between the parties to litigation and b) between providing access to the courts with the 
[normal]interests of the taxpayer? 
[normal] 
[normal]We do not 
[normal]consider
[normal] that the principles for making a PCO 
[normal]should be modified. The public interest at stake in bringing certain cases to the attention of the courts should not be dictated to by the financial security of the parties. It not only restricts access to the legal process itself, but also jeopardises the
[normal] purpose of judicial review as it may mean that cases that are in the public interest (yet 
[normal]may 
[normal]also involve 
[normal]individual
[normal] or group
[normal] 
[normal]interests) are not brought to the attention of the court and the policy would go unchallenged. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Further, w
[normal]e do not 
[normal]consider
[normal] tha
[normal]t the source of funding should be relevant to the consideration of a PCO. The principles that currently govern the availability of PCOs are sufficient to achieve their purpose of protecting claimants from undue financial burdens and the source of funding i
[normal]s not relevant for that purpose. 
[normal] For example, 
[normal]NGOs are sponsored either through public subscription (membership) or by private philanthropy.  To require disclosure beyond what is available in the public domain through the Charity Commission is an unnecess
[normal]ary and pervasive invasion into the fund
[normal]ing
[normal] arrangements of these civil society organisation
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Costs arising from the involvement of [bold]T[bold]hird [bold]P[bold]arty [bold]I[bold]nterveners[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The government asks whether third parties who choose to intervene in judicial review claims
[normal] can
[normal] be responsible in principle for their own legal costs of doing so, such that they should not, ordinarily, be able to claim those costs from either the claimant or the defendant? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We do not 
[normal]consider 
[normal]that a
[normal]n NGO
[normal] third party intervener should be 
[normal]liable 
[normal]for 
[normal]their own legal costs. We are concerned that the proposals relat
[normal]ing
[normal] to third party interveners would have a detrimental impact on the role of NGOs and other important actors in the judicial review process. This is because making a
[normal]n NGO
[normal] third-party interven
[normal]er liable for their own costs not only impacts negatively on the quality of the decision b
[normal]y
[normal] dissuading parties who may add substantive and significant arguments from intervening, but would also have a disproportionate effect on the ability of NGOs and char
[normal]ities to engage in the judicial review process, insulating the executiv
[normal]e further from proper scrutiny and accounta
[normal]bility in the exercise of power and demonstrating human rights compliance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Third party interventions can be extremely beneficial to the quali
[normal]ty of the decision making process in the 
[normal]application
[normal]. They may be able to bring additional expertise and arguments, particularly if they are an interest group that represents a particular group 
[normal]within 
[normal]society or 
[normal]an 
[normal]issue. The rules on costs might therefore
[normal] discourage those who could bring something significant to the case due to their inability to bear the financial burden, particularly if they are an NGO with 
[normal]restricted 
[normal]financial resources. This would consequently 
[normal]limit
[normal] the ability of NGOs to engage in the
[normal] judicial review process in general as the costs would prove a practical hindrance. This would furthermore affect the effectiveness of the judicial review process by limiting those who can engage in it to the financially stable and resourceful. Such a poli
[normal]cy would again misunderstand the role of judicial review as a tool for the public to 
[normal]challenge the decision making function of 
[normal]executive power
[normal]s
[normal] by dictating the process along the lines of costs rather than the importance of 
[normal]the public interest/human rights
[normal] issues in play.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]From a practical perspective, the quality of the decision making process may be hindered if certain arguments or opinions are excluded. It may lead to an increase in subsequent costs because of the need for further litigation if important
[normal] points are not raised or clarified in the original case due to a costs barrier. There is no real evidence to support the assertion that third party interveners greatly increase the costs in the first place, and their participation at the outset may lead t
[normal]o a more efficient and thorough consideration of 
[normal]the 
[normal]issues in the 
[normal]application
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The intervention of a third party 
[normal]NGO 
[normal]may bring an important 
[normal]perspective to 
[normal]the 
[normal]application 
[normal]that would not have otherwise been considered. The benefits that they can bring mean they should not 
[normal]be responsible for any additional costs that may be incurred. Furthermore, any intervention is at the discretion of the court who are in the best position 
[normal]to restrict the involvement if it may not add anyt
[normal]hing of value to the process. 
[normal]A key consideration in deciding whether to apply to make a third party intervention in a judicial review is whether the intervention will add value to the application
[normal], and thus
[normal] appropriate safeguards are already in place.
