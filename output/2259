[normal]ANNEX A[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Response by the British Geological Survey to the [bold]Business, Innovation and Skills Committee Select Committee Announcement No.11 – [bold]EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES INQUIRY[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background to the British Geological Survey[bold]The British Geological Survey is a part of the Natural Environment Research Council (
[normal]NERC
[normal]) and is its principal supplier of national capability in 
[normal]geoscience
[normal]. It advances understanding of the structure, properties and processes of the solid Earth system through interdisciplinary surveys, monitoring and research for the benefit of society. The BGS is the UK's premier provider of objective and authoritative 
[normal]geoscientific
[normal] data, information and knowledge for wealth creation, sustainable use of natural resources, reducing risk and living with the impacts of environmental change. 
[normal]We are a world-leading 
[normal]geoscience
[normal] centre for:
[normal]MineralsUK
[normal] is the 
[normal]British Geological Survey (BGS)
[normal] Centre for Sustainable Mineral Development. Facilitated by the BGS Minerals and Waste science programme, the Centre is a global leader in the compilation, provision and analysis of mineral statistics and the major UK national provider of spatial and statistical minerals information. We also carry out research in areas directly relevant to our user community, such as 
[normal]metallogenesis
[normal], land-use impacts of mineral extraction and 
[normal]geomaterials
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Questions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The BGS publishes an annual compilation of statistics related to UK mineral production in the form of the UK Minerals Yearbook. (
[normal]http://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=2876
[normal]). The following are extracts from the latest version of the Yearbook which give a good indication of the contribution of the minerals sector to the UK economy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Note that the value of energy minerals (oil, gas and coal) dominates overall production. These data have been removed from the second pie chart to reveal the value of all non-energy minerals produced from the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The table above gives some context to the earlier value data by showing the volume of minerals produced in the UK. Note the very large tonnages of construction aggregate (igneous rock, limestone and dolomite, sand and gravel) and the very small volume of metals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BGS have no data on UK citizens employed overseas.

[normal]5. What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]At the national level the UK Minerals Forum facilitates regular and structured dialogue between industry, regulators, policy makers and NGOs. UKMF is valuable in debating contentious topics and identifying key issues relating to sustainable development of UK mineral resources. For example, the UKMF is currently undertaking a forty year horizon scan on the future of UK mineral extraction. The BGS is a founder member of the UKMF.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Outside of the UKMF our experience is that the larger NGOs do have an understanding of minerals related issues. However, across the sector many other groups find the technical aspects of mineral development challenging. The BGS has an important role to play in helping NGOs and the wider community understand the economic, social and environmental issues related to mineral development. For example, see our Mineral Planning Factsheets (link below) which are designed to inform debate and decision-making around planning for domestic mineral supply.

[normal]10. What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A large part of the UK domestic mining and quarrying industry is owned and operated by relatively few large multinational companies, the majority of which are foreign-owned. A high percentage of total output of construction aggregates in the UK is from quarries operated by four companies. These companies are all vertically integrated and include cement manufacturing in the UK or Europe. The indigenous silica sand and ball clay/ kaolin industries are also dominated by just two large, foreign owned companies. Ownership of the coal industry across the UK is more diverse. The consolidation of mining and quarrying companies is partly in response to competition for land use. The commercial risk involved in setting aside time and financial resources needed to obtain a licence to operate (planning permission and environmental permits) in the UK is relatively high by both world and European standards. The response of the market to this risk has been for companies to replenish reserves by acquisition (in order to access additional permitted sites or to deny them to rivals) and by vertical integration (for cement companies to secure supplies of vital aggregate raw materials). The result is a relatively small group of large companies who have sufficient investment capability to meet permitting costs and maintain a portfolio of different supply options. This situation may present a barrier to entry for smaller local operators. It may also encourage consolidation of production at fewer, larger quarries where larger companies can take advantage of economies of scale, as well as the ‘trading’ of sites with permitted reserves between companies and the giving up of dormant sites in scenic areas such as National Parks in exchange for a licence to operate elsewhere.
