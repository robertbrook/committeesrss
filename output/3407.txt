[[[ the Research Council for Complementary Medicine (RCCM) (AMR0020)]]]How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade? 1.0 IntroductionI am submitting comments on the above call for evidence on behalf of the Research Council for Complementary Medicine (RCCM), a charitable Trust (www.rccm.org.uk). In summary, we highlight the lack of&#xa0;synthesis and appraisal of current research evidence of effective natural products which may have potential against infection and drug resistance. In addition we believe that it is&#xa0;important that the UK work with different countries in order to obtain practical solutions

[[[.]]]2.0 What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance? 2.1 There is evidence of the potent antimicrobial activity for a number of natural substances used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western herbal medicine, Ayurveda, naturopathy and aromatherapy. A systematic review of the relevance of this for clinical practice and public health has not been conducted but would be a welcome addition to the evidence base on antimicrobial resistance. Since many of these natural substances are also low cost, this has the potential for identifying cost savings. This is particular pertinent since the high costs of developing new antimicrobial pharmaceuticals is reflected in their price. 2.2 Furthermore, the contribution of nutritional interventions in patients at risk of developing antimicrobial resistance has not been explored in depth, but evidence suggests that there are interactions between healthy intestinal microbes and resistant organisms that may be clinically exploited (1,2).3.0 &#xa0;Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified? The potential of a number of natural compounds, some of which that have already been evaluated and have been used in mainstream clinical use, should be explored further, and this should include cost benefit analyses (3-8)4.0  .What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives? 4.1 For example research on Chinese plant extracts have demonstrated the high levels potent antibacterial activities, demonstrated as being a result of a group of chemicals called flavonoids which are found in species such as. Radix Sophorae Flavescentis.&#xa0; The plant alkaloid berberine has been shown to possess different antimicrobial activities (an active ingredient of Rhizoma Coptidis). Antifungal effects from published research data have also shown that compounds isolated from these Chinese herbal medicines are effective against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms as well as drug resistant MRSA. Similarly plants found in the South America and Africa have been shown to have properties which could be harnessed. &#xa0;4.2 On 7th Nov 2008 in Beijing Dr. Margaret Chan, Director General – World Health Organisation (WHO), addressed the WHO Congress on Traditional Medicine by saying“The two systems of Traditional and Western medicine need not clash. Within the context of primary health care, they can blend together in a beneficial harmony, using the best features of each system, and compensating for certain weaknesses in each. This is not something that will happen all by itself. Deliberate policy decisions have to be made.&#xa0;But it can be done successfully.”The second World Health Organization (WHO) global strategy for traditional and complementary medicines is due for consideration and ratification by the World Health Assembly in May 2014.&#xa0; This is an excellent opportunity to identify how the UK can be a partner in a coordinated action in order to fight antimicrobial resistance and facilitate cross-border initiatives.5.0 What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?5.1 The focus on single compounds, working on single targets within microbial cells or viral replication, makes the development of resistance a question of when, not if, it will develop, due to the rapid mutation of microbial genes. One of the advantage of using some natural substances is that they usually contain more than one active substance, thereby reducing the risk of microbial resistance developing rapidly. &#xa0;5.2 And in the spirit of integrated medicine, some natural substances work in synergy with pharmaceuticals (for example the case of manuka cited previously).&#xa0;6.0 Background of the organisation The RCCM is a charity was founded in 1983 to encourage and facilitate research into complementary medicine and to ensure that the results were as widely disseminated as possible. With Department of Health funding the RCCM carried out detailed reviews and critical appraisals of the published research in specific complementary therapies focusing on key areas of NHS priority. This work was carried out in partnership with the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine and School of Life Sciences at the University of Westminster http://www.rccm.org.uk/node/11  and http://www.rccm.org.uk/node/12. The Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Specialist library subsequently developed based on critical appraisal of available evidence from randomised controlled trials was included in the NHS National Library for Health, and this was subsequently taken over by NICE. The content no longer appears as a specific topic entity but some reviews may be found by searching by specific topic areas on  www.evidence.nhs.uk/search . 7.0 ConclusionWe understand that to address the issues of increasing antimicrobial resistance requires a range of innovative strategies. The opportunities using naturally occurring products as a source of antibacterial/microbial agents and to take advantage of exciting advances in genomics. A systematic and comprehensive review of the current literature is needed to evaluate the potential of underexplored natural products which may yield new opportunities to fight infection.
