&#xa0;Written evidence from BiblioFox Research (HSR 033)&#xa0;1. BiblioFox Research is a research consultancy established in 2000. We specialise in document-based research and archival research and have recently been investigating the implications of the HS2 business case for existing intercity services on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines.&#xa0;2. In our opinion there is a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the HS2 strategic case.  This concerns plans to divert north-south intercity travellers to HS2 services and remove a high number of ‘classic’ (i.e traditional) intercity services from the existing north-south lines, thus freeing those lines for more commuter, regional and freight services.  We explain this contradiction below.&#xa0;3. On the one hand, the Government says its aim is that “all towns and cities which currently have a direct service to London will retain broadly comparable or better services once HS2 is completed” (Strategic Case, 4.2.6). On the other, it proposes that long distance services are diverted onto HS2, freeing capacity on the existing network for new services (Strategic Case, Executive Summary, para 57).  Figure 10 (Strategic Case p.24) shows how, with HS2 taking responsibility for most long-distance services, the number of commuter services into Euston can be increased greatly.  The same figure shows, though, that this comes through a massive reduction in classic intercity services.&#xa0;4. While it might be assumed that many passengers travelling between cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and London will be happy to use HS2 services instead of the classic intercity services that HS2 will replace, HS2 cannot – by its nature – exactly replicate the current north-south intercity timetables on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines.  It will call at far fewer stations than current intercity services. If classic intercity services are reduced in number, the towns and cities not served by HS2 trains, such as Stoke-on-Trent, Wilmslow and Stockport on the WCML, Leicester on the MML, and Wakefield and Doncaster on the ECML, will almost certainly face reductions in direct services to London.&#xa0;5. Despite the Government’s claim that all towns and cities currently with direct services to London should receive broadly comparable or better services, and that decisions on future services will be taken nearer the time, its own business case for HS2 is predicated on significant savings being made through reductions in intercity services on existing lines. These ‘classic line savings’ are a fundamental part of the business case, yet do not appear to be mentioned in the Strategic Case document.  They may be found instead in The Economic Case for HS2 (October 2013) at http://assets.hs2.org.uk/sites/default/files/inserts/S%26A%201_Economic%20case_0.pdf (Table 9). This reveals that savings of £8.2 billion are being used to offset part of the predicted cost of operating HS2, thus reducing the ‘headline’ operating cost.  The actual cost of operating the full HS2 network over the 60 year appraisal period is calculated to be £30,408 million.  Offset against this are savings from reductions in spending on the existing lins of £8,265 million (savings on staff, electricity, diesel, lease costs, maintenance etc). This gives a headline figure for the cost of operating HS2 of £22,143.  It is this latter figure that is used in the HS2 business case benefit-cost ratio (BCR).  If all these classic savings were not to materialise, the BCR would of course be significantly lower.&#xa0;6. The reductions in classic line intercity services that make up those £8.2 billion of savings may be found in HS2 Ltd’s report PFM V.4.3 Assumptions report http://assets.hs2.org.uk/sites/default/files/inserts/S%26A%2020_PFM%20assumptions%20report.pdf(section 6.4).  Comparing the proposed classic line intercity service patterns with today’s intercity services reveals that:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7. In conclusion, the Government’s claim that no towns and cities will face worse services to London appears to be in conflict with its incorporation of £8.2 billion of classic line savings into the business case for HS2.  Without these savings, the HS2 BCR will fall significantly, but with them, it will be extremely difficult, we believe, to maintain the levels of service to users of current intercity services to London that the Government claims is their aim.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
