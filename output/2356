[normal]Growth Duty[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]ACS (the Association of Convenience Stores) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill call for evidence.  This submission specifically addresses the introduction of a growth duty for non economic regulators.  ACS represents 33,500 local shops across the country including the Co-operative, Spar, Martin McColl and thousands of independent retailers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Retail businesses are open to an extensive range of regulations from numerous Government departments and external regulators.  ACS has strongly advocated the need for policy development process to actively consider how new regulations will affect businesses operationally and have particular regard for small business.  ACS supports the proposals for the introduction of a statutory growth duty for non-economic regulators.  However, it is disappointing that this will not be applicable to local authorities and devolved assemblies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The growth duty must compliment the Government’s wider better regulation principles and the one in two out policy.  The growth duty needs to assert change during the policy making process actively reforming or preventing policies that will be harmful to business.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is important that the statutory duty is complementary to existing duties allowing regulators to meet there existing purpose but still have regard for growth and economic impact.  There should be specific guidance developed for the interpretation of the duty by each regulator to ensure consistency across all regulators.  The duty should be applied as widely as possible to all regulators.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The introduction of a statutory duty will result in significant cost reductions for businesses; a good example of a regulator being mindful of their impact on growth is the Health and Safety Executive’s proposal for a National Local Authority Enforcement Code.  The codes sets out the roles and responsibilities of enforcers and businesses and ensures that proactive visits to low risk businesses are reduced or based on intelligence.

[normal]ACS will continue to work with the BRDO and Department for Business, Innovations and Skills and engage with the Government’s Redtape Challenge programme on retail relevant proposals.
