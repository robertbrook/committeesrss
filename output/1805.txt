&#xa0;Written evidence from Margot Fish (TIC 101)&#xa0;The village is 5 miles east of Cockermouth, ten miles west of Keswick.&#xa0; Please bear in mind, some years ago the Ombudsman declared that although some children live inside the three-mile limit, the education department must nevertheless send children to school by bus and at the County's expense, in view of the isolation of the community and the speed of the road transport.There is a bus service which runs through the village however it is only any good to the people who live on the north road.&#xa0; It is not accessible to the village of Wythop because a) villages separated from Embleton by the A66 - very busy and very fast road which very few people will feel safe to cross&#xa0;b).&#xa0; The population is mostly elderly and would&#xa0;be entirely unable to access this service.The bus service&#xa0;is quite frequent and for those who live on the north road it is very good.For those who live in Wythop the bus service is inaccessible, because of the A66 and the distance from the bus stop.(up to 2 miles).If it was possible, a community bus could be used, either to transport people to the north road in time to catch the service bus, or can be used as a community bus.&#xa0; Schoolchildren use the service bus and also the young ones who attend the primary school at Lorton are taken to school by contracted transport. Might it be possible to extend this contracted service, please?&#xa0; &#xa0;There is also a community bus in the area, run by&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ACT. I believe it is managed by the Cumbria County Council - I am not certain so you would have to check this to discover who actually is responsible for the community bus.&#xa0; This service is accessed by such organisations as the youth club and the seniors club, but it is hired out each time.&#xa0; This is a great drain on finances for both clubs.I would love to see a community bus, available for the people of the community, with a timetable.&#xa0; This could then be either put at the disposal of the youth club and the seniors club â€“ and any other club that required it.It is my contention that a lot of people who use their cars simply to go shopping in Cockermouth or Workington would in all likelihood use the community bus because it would be cost-effective and if it is smaller it can be accessed much more easily by the elderly and disabled.&#xa0; A small bus can go around the villages to collect passengers and deliver them back near their homes at set times.&#xa0; I think that this would be very popular, particularly in these days when petrol is so costly and we are&#xa0;adjured to save precious resources of.&#xa0; The bus can also be used to take people to and from the cottage hospital.I look after the seniors club and fund manage for the youth club.&#xa0; I am aware that many people are in their 60s, 70s and 80s in the village and think&#xa0;a feasibility study, properly conducted, would show a real need for a community bus.&#xa0; I am very well aware of the dangers of a community bus being purchased and standing idle for most of the time but I think that you will appreciate just how much this bus will be utilised.I have thought about this very carefully but I am not sure that I am providing it in a fashion to be of help to your inquiry.&#xa0; I just hope that it is.&#xa0; May I explain it in this way: I worked for five years to learn how to get a village hall from the big lottery.&#xa0; I had to go on many training courses and follow a very circuitous route.&#xa0; The village Hall has been erected for two years, thank God.&#xa0; At the same time as I worked for the village Hall I learned from the community that there is a great need for a community bus. If a feasibility study is required, I am quite sure that we can undertake the community aspect of it.&#xa0; We have a very active village hall trust, a rural safety group trust, and youth club trust,&#xa0; if you explain the aspects which you would like, I am sure we can&#xa0;undertake it on your behalf, but which will save a lot of money.September 2013&#xa0;
