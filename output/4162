[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Further written evidence from the RMT (WRT 041)[bold]The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) welcome the opportunity to submit our views as part of TRANSCOM’s inquiry into 
[normal]winter 
[normal]resilience of transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The RMT organises 
[normal]80
[normal],000
[normal] workers who are employed in all sectors of the transport industry, rail, maritime, bus and road transport.
[normal] The RMT is the largest of the rail unions and the only union that represents all grades of rail wo
[normal]rker.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key Points[bold]1[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Network Rail budget[bold]1
[normal].1   RMT has consistently argued
[normal] that Network Rail’s budgeting and workforce management practices directly lead to an avoidable backlog in essential maintenance and renewal of the national network.
[normal] Indeed, the process through which Network Rail’s budget is set implicates the Office of Rail Regulation itself in the deep cuts to jobs and the available budget for the maintenance and renewal work that is fundamentally important to the resilience of the 
[normal]rail 
[normal]network. The ORR’s demand of Network Rail that it make 21% efficiency savings during CP4 (2009-14) is a case in point.
[normal]1
[normal].2   Network Rail’s £1.19bn under spend on maintenance and renewal works in the first four years of CP4 has increased vulnerability
[normal] of the transport network to disruption and delay in the winter months. The Office of Rail Regulation has released data showing a 5% increase in infrastructure incidents and 59% of delays attributable to Network Rail, April to October 2013.
[normal]1
[normal].3 The ORR sta
[normal]tes that “
[normal]Between April and October this year, there were nearly 16,000 infrastructure incidents across the network, nearly 5% more than over the same period last year, despite 
[normal]benign weather conditions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] These incidents caused almost 1.7 million minutes o
[normal]f delay to trains nationally”. RMT believes that should weather conditions have been even marginally worse the delays would have been significantly greater.
[normal]1
[normal].4 Furthermore, RMT is greatly concerned that the ORR final determination
[normal] for CP5, which cuts Net
[normal]work Rail’s budget by 1.7 billion over the next five years, will hugely impact on the resilience of the Network.
[normal]1
[normal].5 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]In relation to the maintenance of the network, ORR states: “
[normal]we have decided that efficiencies of 16.4% are achievable by the final year 
[normal]of CP5 compared to the final year of CP4 but we have also changed the profile of efficiencies
[normal].”
[normal]1
[normal].6 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally, in relation to renewals the ORR “have assumed that efficiencies of 20.0% are achievable by the final year of CP5”.
[normal]1
[normal].7 
[normal]  
[normal]RMT believes that s
[normal]hould
[normal] these cuts be applied to
[normal] the renewal of track and maintenance of the railway, and embankments, ditches and drainage the network is going to suffer greatly in the coming years due to decreased weather resilience compounded by increasingly extreme weat
[normal]her conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Co-ordinated national strategy on resilience[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The disturbance to seasonal conditions brought about by climate change requires the Government to adopt a strategic approach to dealing with extreme weather conditions. Whilst there has been some progress in this area, we are concerned at the profusion of 
[normal]Government Departments and agencies that have nominal responsibility for the resilience of the transport network, namely, Department for Transport, Cabinet Office, Highways Agency, Network Rail, 
[normal]DEFRA, DCLG and the Met Office.
[normal] The independent rail regulato
[normal]r, the ORR also has a significant role, including the monitoring of Network Rail’s budget and performance.
[normal] Responsibility for resilience of the transport network in London has been devolved to Transport for London, and the Welsh Assembly and Transport Scot
[normal]land are responsible in Wales and Scotland respectively.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The plethora of organisations with responsibility for resilience of the rail network is symbolic of the wider fragmentation in the rail industry since privatisation and which has gained new momentum
[normal] under the Coalition Government 
[normal]as a result 
[normal]of the McNulty Review’s proposals to break Network Rail up into regional infrastructure entities
[normal]. The existing fragmentation is a significant barrier to a co-ordinated national strategy for improving the resilien
[normal]ce of the rail network in the winter months and any further moves toward the regionalisation or breaking up of Network Rail as the national infrastructure management body would ensure that the rail network remains vulnerable to avoidable disruption and del
[normal]ay in the winter. The Government’s Winter Resilience Review in October 2010
[normal] estimated the ‘welfare cost’ of winter disruption to the transport network to be £280m per day. We believe that this cost would rise if Network Rail is broken up and more responsi
[normal]bility for infrastructure management shared with train operating companies through the sort of ‘deep alliance’ that is currently in operation on the Wessex Line between South West Trains and Network Rail.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]RMT is also wary of the
[normal] potential impact on rail resilience improvements of the ORR’s proposals
[normal] to allow more open access operators onto the national rail network. This move is supported by the train operating companies as the ORR propose reducing the barriers to open access op
[normal]erators of rail passenger services but such a move would add to an already crowded network operators who are subject to less regulation and therefore far less likely to have any interest in investing or working with Network Rail to improve resilience.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Wit
[normal]h the exception of 2011-12, winters have become longer, colder and harsher in recent years. 2012-13 returned to the trend of extreme weather conditions over the winter period: it was the wettest for over a decade and 0.4 degrees colder than the average cal
[normal]culated by the Met Office between 1981 and 2010. The heavy and prolonged snowfall in January 2013 combined to cause significant disruption to the national transport network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the current administration’s avowed opposition to non-departmental public
[normal] bodies and ‘red tape’
[normal],
[normal] the harsh winter weather that has accompanied their term in office to date has met with a confused, ad hoc and poorly co-ordinated response. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The short section of Sir David Higgins’ evidence on resilience to the Transport Select Co
[normal]mmittee on 14
[normal]th
[normal] October
[normal] confirmed that Network Rail already lack a co-ordinated response to resilience problems, with only small amounts of work scheduled for the autumn to improve resilience. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This also illustrates that resilience work is largely reactive, only taking place when and where there are problems. 
[normal]Given the job cuts brought about by the ORR’s 21% efficiency demands, it is therefore no surprise that Network Rail have problems in findin
[normal]g drivers to operate vehicles to clear snow and ice: 
[normal]“
[normal]These are one-off events and we need to draw on a limited resource of drivers to be able to crew these road vehicles and trains that we set up especially for this.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]RMT is concerned that Network Rail c
[normal]ontinue to avoid even the discussion of 
[normal]the ORR’s 21% efficiency demand 
[normal]in the context of resilience
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rail infrastructure and rolling stock design[bold]3
[normal].1 
[normal]  
[normal]Components that assist in resilience, particularly to snow, in protecting the power supply to the rail network and in the design of new rolling stock should be given greater priority at an earlier stage by Network Rail and DfT.
[normal]3
[normal].1 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Furthermore, RMT believes that whilst ROSCO’s continue to monopolise the rolling stock market, a duty should be placed on them to ensure maximum weather resilience and readiness for 
[normal]extreme weather events caused by 
[normal]climate change.
[normal]4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rail franchises and resil[bold]ience[bold]4.1
[normal] [bold] [bold]              [bold]RMT
[normal] support re-nationalisation of the rail network but until then, train operating companies should be obliged to produce winter and extreme weather resilience contingency plans as part of any franchise agreement with the Government.
[normal]4.2 
[normal]              
[normal]RMT b
[normal]elieves that train operating companies should also bear the burden of climate change and costs to Network Rail associated with climate change
[normal]. 
[normal]As the table 
[normal]in Annex 1
[normal] demonstrates the revenue received by Network Rail from track access charges has fallen dramatically over the last decade. RMT believes that this does not ref
[normal]lect the increased risk to the n
[normal]etwork due to adverse 
[normal]weather conditions brought about by climate 
[normal]change. 
[normal]Consideration should be given to
[normal] a thorough review of track access charges which incorporates this problem.
[normal]5[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Regulation of bus companies[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]RMT believe that bus companies should be
[normal] municipally owned and at the very least
[normal] regulated by local authorities
[normal] and Traffic Commissioners. This should include some obligation to make provision for extreme weather conditions
[normal].
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]RMT believes that the upcoming review
[normal] of Traffic Commissioner
[normal]s’
[normal] resources should reflect the need to develop a strategy for combating the imp
[normal]act of climate change on the bus industry and the services provided to the travelling public.
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]RMT believes that any contracts rewards should include the maximum possible specification for increasing weather resilience.
