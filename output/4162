defaultKey Pointsdefault1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNetwork Rail budgetdefault1
default.1   RMT has consistently argued
default that Network Rail’s budgeting and workforce management practices directly lead to an avoidable backlog in essential maintenance and renewal of the national network.
default Indeed, the process through which Network Rail’s budget is set implicates the Office of Rail Regulation itself in the deep cuts to jobs and the available budget for the maintenance and renewal work that is fundamentally important to the resilience of the 
defaultrail 
defaultnetwork. The ORR’s demand of Network Rail that it make 21% efficiency savings during CP4 (2009-14) is a case in point.
default1
default.2   Network Rail’s £1.19bn under spend on maintenance and renewal works in the first four years of CP4 has increased vulnerability
default of the transport network to disruption and delay in the winter months. The Office of Rail Regulation has released data showing a 5% increase in infrastructure incidents and 59% of delays attributable to Network Rail, April to October 2013.
default1
default.3 The ORR sta
defaulttes that “
defaultBetween April and October this year, there were nearly 16,000 infrastructure incidents across the network, nearly 5% more than over the same period last year, despite 
defaultbenign weather conditions
default.
default&#xa0;
default These incidents caused almost 1.7 million minutes o
defaultf delay to trains nationally”. RMT believes that should weather conditions have been even marginally worse the delays would have been significantly greater.
default1
default.4 Furthermore, RMT is greatly concerned that the ORR final determination
default for CP5, which cuts Net
defaultwork Rail’s budget by 1.7 billion over the next five years, will hugely impact on the resilience of the Network.
default1
default.5 
default 
default              
defaultIn relation to the maintenance of the network, ORR states: “
defaultwe have decided that efficiencies of 16.4% are achievable by the final year 
defaultof CP5 compared to the final year of CP4 but we have also changed the profile of efficiencies
default.”
default1
default.6 
default 
default              
defaultAdditionally, in relation to renewals the ORR “have assumed that efficiencies of 20.0% are achievable by the final year of CP5”.
default1
default.7 
default  
defaultRMT believes that s
defaulthould
default these cuts be applied to
default the renewal of track and maintenance of the railway, and embankments, ditches and drainage the network is going to suffer greatly in the coming years due to decreased weather resilience compounded by increasingly extreme weat
defaulther conditions.

defaultCo-ordinated national strategy on resiliencedefault&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe disturbance to seasonal conditions brought about by climate change requires the Government to adopt a strategic approach to dealing with extreme weather conditions. Whilst there has been some progress in this area, we are concerned at the profusion of 
defaultGovernment Departments and agencies that have nominal responsibility for the resilience of the transport network, namely, Department for Transport, Cabinet Office, Highways Agency, Network Rail, 
defaultDEFRA, DCLG and the Met Office.
default The independent rail regulato
defaultr, the ORR also has a significant role, including the monitoring of Network Rail’s budget and performance.
default Responsibility for resilience of the transport network in London has been devolved to Transport for London, and the Welsh Assembly and Transport Scot
defaultland are responsible in Wales and Scotland respectively.
default&#xa0;default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe plethora of organisations with responsibility for resilience of the rail network is symbolic of the wider fragmentation in the rail industry since privatisation and which has gained new momentum
default under the Coalition Government 
defaultas a result 
defaultof the McNulty Review’s proposals to break Network Rail up into regional infrastructure entities
default. The existing fragmentation is a significant barrier to a co-ordinated national strategy for improving the resilien
defaultce of the rail network in the winter months and any further moves toward the regionalisation or breaking up of Network Rail as the national infrastructure management body would ensure that the rail network remains vulnerable to avoidable disruption and del
defaultay in the winter. The Government’s Winter Resilience Review in October 2010
default estimated the ‘welfare cost’ of winter disruption to the transport network to be £280m per day. We believe that this cost would rise if Network Rail is broken up and more responsi
defaultbility for infrastructure management shared with train operating companies through the sort of ‘deep alliance’ that is currently in operation on the Wessex Line between South West Trains and Network Rail.
default&#xa0;default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRMT is also wary of the
default potential impact on rail resilience improvements of the ORR’s proposals
default to allow more open access operators onto the national rail network. This move is supported by the train operating companies as the ORR propose reducing the barriers to open access op
defaulterators of rail passenger services but such a move would add to an already crowded network operators who are subject to less regulation and therefore far less likely to have any interest in investing or working with Network Rail to improve resilience.
default&#xa0;default2.4

defaultWit
defaulth the exception of 2011-12, winters have become longer, colder and harsher in recent years. 2012-13 returned to the trend of extreme weather conditions over the winter period: it was the wettest for over a decade and 0.4 degrees colder than the average cal
defaultculated by the Met Office between 1981 and 2010. The heavy and prolonged snowfall in January 2013 combined to cause significant disruption to the national transport network.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite the current administration’s avowed opposition to non-departmental public
default bodies and ‘red tape’
default,
default the harsh winter weather that has accompanied their term in office to date has met with a confused, ad hoc and poorly co-ordinated response. 
default&#xa0;default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe short section of Sir David Higgins’ evidence on resilience to the Transport Select Co
defaultmmittee on 14
defaultth
default October
default confirmed that Network Rail already lack a co-ordinated response to resilience problems, with only small amounts of work scheduled for the autumn to improve resilience. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis also illustrates that resilience work is largely reactive, only taking place when and where there are problems. 
defaultGiven the job cuts brought about by the ORR’s 21% efficiency demands, it is therefore no surprise that Network Rail have problems in findin
defaultg drivers to operate vehicles to clear snow and ice: 
default“
defaultThese are one-off events and we need to draw on a limited resource of drivers to be able to crew these road vehicles and trains that we set up especially for this.
default”
default 
defaultRMT is concerned that Network Rail c
defaultontinue to avoid even the discussion of 
defaultthe ORR’s 21% efficiency demand 
defaultin the context of resilience
default.

defaultRail infrastructure and rolling stock designdefault3

default  
defaultComponents that assist in resilience, particularly to snow, in protecting the power supply to the rail network and in the design of new rolling stock should be given greater priority at an earlier stage by Network Rail and DfT.

defaultFurthermore, RMT believes that whilst ROSCO’s continue to monopolise the rolling stock market, a duty should be placed on them to ensure maximum weather resilience and readiness for

defaultAs the table

defaultConsideration should be given to

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRMT believe that bus companies should be
default municipally owned and at the very least
default regulated by local authorities
default and Traffic Commissioners. This should include some obligation to make provision for extreme weather conditions

defaultRMT believes that the upcoming review
