[normal]              
[normal]Transport for London 
[normal](TfL) 
[normal]was 
[normal]established 
[normal]in 2000 and is the integrated body responsible for the Capital's transport system. Its main role is to 
[normal]implement the Mayor
[normal] of London's Transport Strategy 
[normal]and 
[normal]to 
[normal]deliver and 
[normal]manage transport services across the Capital for which the Mayor has responsibility.
[normal] 
[normal]These services include: London's buses, Lond
[normal]on Underground, Docklands Light
[normal] Railway
[normal], London Overgroun
[normal]d, Tramlink, London River Services and Victoria Coach Station. 
[normal]We are 
[normal]the owner and operator of the largest integrated transport network in Europe.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Department for Transport (DfT) is responsible for 
[normal]our 
[normal]funding settlement and the GLA
[normal] 
[normal]acts as a conduit for grants from the DfT to 
[normal]us
[normal].
[normal] On 1 April 2013, part of our 
[normal]general grant was replaced with retained business rates, under the Local Government Finance Act 201
[normal]2 arrangements, payable by 
[normal]the 
[normal]GLA.  
[normal]The Mayor 
[normal]approves 
[normal]our 
[normal]borrowing limit
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in accordance with the Local Government Prudential Borrowing regime, 
[normal]and is responsible for setting 
[normal]the general level and structure of 
[normal]fares in London. 
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The biggest transport infrastructure project currently underway in London, and notably in Europe, is Crossrail. It is a good example of a scheme that is being 
[normal]delivered successfully 
[normal]in a multi-bo
[normal]undary and multi-stakeholder environment.
[normal] The delivery of such a project is dependent on strong stakeholder support
[normal], integrated planning
[normal] and 
[normal]formal funding agreements
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Crossrail is a new railway
[normal] 
[normal]for London and the South
[normal] 
[normal]East of England which
[normal],
[normal] when complete in 2019
[normal],
[normal] will be 118km in length, connecting Maidenhead 
[normal]and Heathrow Airport 
[normal]in the West 
[normal]with 
[normal]Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the East. It will consist of 38 stations and 
[normal]is 
[normal]expected 
[normal]to 
[normal]cost £14.8bn to build. The Crossrail project is co-sponsore
[normal]d by 
[normal]us
[normal] and the DfT and 
[normal]is 
[normal]funded from several sources, including Government grant, borrowing and other contributions
[normal], including contributions from businesses
[normal]. Crossrail Ltd (CRL), 
[normal]a wholly owned subsidiary of TfL, 
[normal]is 
[normal]responsible fo
[normal]r the delivery of the 
[normal]project. CRL has its own Board, 
[normal]consisting of 
[normal]a majority of independent non-executives, to supervise the delivery of the project on time and to budget.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]There was a strong business case for the project that 
[normal]demonstrate
[normal]d
[normal] the need for a
[normal] new cross-London
[normal] route to alleviate
[normal] 
[normal]capacity constraints
[normal], relieve overcrowding on existing Tube and train services
[normal] and 
[normal]reduce 
[normal]journey times
[normal]. 
[normal]Crossrail will also provide a £42bn boost to the economy, generate thousands of jobs and facilitate business activity along the Hea
[normal]throw
[normal] – the 
[normal]City
[normal] – Canary
[normal] Wharf corridor.
[normal] The investment 
[normal]in the 
[normal]scheme
[normal] will unlock 
[normal]growth and development that w
[normal]ould
[normal] 
[normal]not 
[normal]otherwise take place
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]The success of the project depend
[normal]ed largely on
[normal] a feasible
[normal] long
[normal]-
[normal]term
[normal] 
[normal]funding package being 
[normal]put 
[normal]in place. 
[normal]Funding was derived from
[normal] 
[normal]three
[normal] primary
[normal] funding sources
[normal]: 
[normal]the Government, fare payers and business
[normal], contribut
[normal]ing
[normal] roughly 
[normal]equal p
[normal]roportions
[normal].
[normal] This is the first time major infrastructure has 
[normal]obtained 
[normal]a significant business contribution.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Crossrail 
[normal]ha
[normal]s
[normal] strong political support at both Mayoral and Governmental levels. There 
[normal]i
[normal]s also 
[normal]widespr
[normal]ead public and business support
[normal], which meant that 
[normal]the introduc
[normal]tion
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]new project-specific tax
[normal]es
[normal], 
[normal]Business Rates Supplement 
[normal](BRS) 
[normal]and Community Infrastructure Levy
[normal] (CIL
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] w
[normal]as
[normal] 
[normal]achievable
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he taxation mechanisms
[normal], however,
[normal] used to capture the contribution from businesses
[normal],
[normal] cover the geographical area of Greater London only
[normal].  This 
[normal]mean
[normal]s
[normal] that businesses located outside the boundary, although benefiting from Crossrail, do not contribute towards its funding. Ideally, the construction cost should be borne by all who benefit from the project. This is easier to achieve in a suburban setting, w
[normal]here the extent of benefit across the transport route is easier to identify than on a project that crosses not only local authority, but also many regional boundaries, such as H
[normal]igh 
[normal]S
[normal]peed 
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]t is also important to build 
[normal]links with the local communitie
[normal]s that are affected by the 
[normal]transport 
[normal]construction
[normal] works in order to obtain local support for the project. This may 
[normal]involve 
[normal]agreeing local priorities and infrastructure schemes that complement the main project
[normal], often from other funding streams
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]The project to extend the Northern 
[normal]l
[normal]ine from Kennington to Ba
[normal]ttersea Power Station 
[normal]also demonstrates the importance of cooperation between national, regional and local 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment
[normal] to deliver 
[normal]a 
[normal]robust 
[normal]financing and funding package
[normal]. The package will include 
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]GLA borrowing the
[normal] initial financing requirement, 
[normal]and central Government and the London Boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth 
[normal]providing the development-
[normal]related 
[normal]funding streams 
[normal]which
[normal] will go towards repaying the upfront finance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Our 
[normal]perspective on the funding arrangements
[normal] 
[normal]for major local transport schemes is likely to be quite diffe
[normal]rent to most local authorities given 
[normal]TfL’s 
[normal]funding context. 
[normal]Our 
[normal]funding 
[normal]currently come
[normal]s
[normal] from three key sources:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Major schemes, such as the Sub-Surface Railway
[normal] 
[normal]Upgrade and other parts of the London Underground Investment Programme
[normal],
[normal] are funded by a mix of 
[normal]fares 
[normal]revenue, 
[normal]Government grants
[normal] and our 
[normal]prudential borrowing. 
[normal]A 
[normal]substantial revenue base
[normal] provides an income stream to service debt obligations and hence make
[normal]s
[normal] debt
[normal]-
[normal]raising possible.
[normal] 
[normal]Current
[normal] 
[normal]funding 
[normal]arrangements fund
[normal] both
[normal] 
[normal]renewal an
[normal]d maintenance of existing transport provision and also, to some extent,
[normal] 
[normal]invest
[normal]ment
[normal] in 
[normal]increasing 
[normal]transport capacity for the 
[normal]future. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Our 
[normal]grants are set
[normal] out in a funding settlement agreed
[normal] 
[normal]during
[normal] Spend
[normal]ing Reviews
[normal]. 
[normal]These settlements provide some long
[normal]-
[normal]term capital guidelines, 
[normal]which 
[normal]allow for sensible investment planning
[normal]. Th
[normal]e
[normal]s
[normal]e
[normal] provide capital certainty for the first time and allow 
[normal]us 
[normal]to drive efficiencies through the Business Plan. While long-term profiles are extremely useful, change of Government and 
[normal]wider economic pressures and policies ha
[normal]ve
[normal] led to changes to funding settlements in the past.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]Since 
[normal]1 April 2013, the Government 
[normal]has 
[normal]allowed 
[normal]local authorities
[normal] 
[normal]to retain part of the non-domestic rates receipts locally. At the same time, certain grants, 
[normal]including our 
[normal]general transport grant, were 
[normal]cut
[normal]. The new system gives 
[normal]local authorities
[normal] 
[normal]more incentive to promote business growth in order to increase the business
[normal] rates receipts payable. 
[normal]Although it is meant to provide greater fiscal independence, the system creates a more complicated relationship with 
[normal]the
[normal] Government, which is still in control of the overall non-domestic rates policy 
[normal]and has the freedom to reset th
[normal]e system at any time. This makes it difficult for local authorities to plan for long-term transport investment that relies on retained business rates for funding and/or financing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]In London, the growth in business rates is retained by the Mayor and al
[normal]located according to his priorities. 
[normal]Whilst there is a risk that business rates receipts will not grow at a rate that fully compensate
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]the reduction in central Government grants, there is also an opportunity to benefit from 
[normal]increases in 
[normal]business rates. 
[normal]Provided that the Government maintains stability in its retained business rates policy, 
[normal]the GLA
[normal], together with other local authorities,
[normal] 
[normal]will have 
[normal]more control over its 
[normal]funding at a local
[normal] level
[normal].  This is 
[normal]welcomed by us
[normal], as part of the GLA 
[normal]g
[normal]r
[normal]oup.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst the current investment programme in 
[normal]our 
[normal]Business Plan 
[normal]is estimated to
[normal] meet the growth in London
[normal]’s
[normal] transport needs in 
[normal]the 
[normal]short-term, delivery of additional major transport projects that would both increase network capacity and unlock growth potential of certain areas of London 
[normal]is 
[normal]difficult
[normal] in a constrained funding environment
[normal]. Government funding is limited and London
[normal]’s 
[normal]taxat
[normal]ion powers
[normal] do not currently exceed the part-devolution of the business rates income.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7
[normal]              
[normal]In the past, we 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] 
[normal]successfully used a number of alternative funding sources to raise funding for specific projects, Crossrail being an example. CIL, Section 106 d
[normal]eveloper agreements and direct developer contributions played an important
[normal], but to date not the deciding,
[normal] 
[normal]role 
[normal]in ensuring that a viable funding package could be put together. 
[normal]These funding options represent a step change from previous arrangements and 
[normal]provide established mechanisms for generating revenues in the future
[normal] where applicable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Northern line 
[normal]extension is the first example of a major scheme that is planned to be 
[normal]funded 
[normal]entirely 
[normal]through 
[normal]third 
[normal]parties – property developers and business ra
[normal]tes payers. However, in the event 
[normal]that development fails to occur and/or business rate 
[normal]receipts
[normal] do not materialise as planned,
[normal] it is the 
[normal]public sector 
[normal]that will be required to bear the 
[normal]funding 
[normal]risk. The need 
[normal]for the public sector 
[normal]to underwrite 
[normal]such third p
[normal]arty
[normal] funding
[normal] mechanisms
[normal] undoubtedly limits the appetite of local authorities to undertake major transport projects that do not rely on Government grants as a primary source of funding.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.9
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]believe that
[normal],
[normal] although some innovation in transport project funding has occurred
[normal], which 
[normal]is a move in the right direction, more can be done. What will help 
[normal]l
[normal]ocal 
[normal]a
[normal]uthorities
[normal] to 
[normal]seek alternative funding sources
[normal] 
[normal]to fund major transport 
[normal]projects
[normal] is greater devolution of ta
[normal]xation powers and/or a Government guarantee of project funding
[normal] in 
[normal]certain scenarios
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Finance 
[normal]can be 
[normal]raised 
[normal]without sustainable
[normal] 
[normal]funding sources to repay the initial inv
[normal]estment
[normal],
[normal] however,
[normal] this 
[normal]is of limited value.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]t is important to understand what is meant by private sector investment.  New 
[normal]third
[normal] 
[normal]party funding from the private sector, for instance through business contributions or the business rates supplement, does permit higher investment.  The provision of finance from the private sector does not, unless it brings greater efficiency
[normal],
[normal] or a bette
[normal]r risk allocation
[normal], 
[normal]offset the higher cost of capital.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]Before 
[normal]we 
[normal]obtained 
[normal]borrowing powers in 2003 under the Local Government Act, the main form of attracting private sector investment into 
[normal]significant 
[normal]transport projects 
[normal]was the 
[normal]Private Finance Initiative (PFI). 
[normal]From 2000
[normal], 
[normal]we
[normal] managed 13 PFI
[normal]s (some of which 
[normal]we 
[normal]inherited from predecessor organisations)
[normal], with a combined value of £18bn. 
[normal]Since 2003, we 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] 
[normal]had 
[normal]greater access to alternative funding sources
[normal], coupled with a significant r
[normal]evenue base
[normal], and
[normal] therefore ha
[normal]ve
[normal] greater flexibility 
[normal]to consider 
[normal]the 
[normal]wider financing options
[normal] a
[normal]vailable
[normal]. 
[normal]As a natural consequence of this
[normal], we 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] moved
[normal] away from extensive use of 
[normal]PFIs
[normal], in part
[normal] 
[normal]because the cost of both debt and equity finance from the 
[normal]private sector has increased substantially
[normal] (particularly since the financial crisis), whil
[normal]e
[normal] the level of risk transfer remains constant
[normal].  H
[normal]ence it is 
[normal]our 
[normal]view that additional financing 
[normal]premia 
[normal]do not offer
[normal] value for money to the public sector
[normal] as compared wi
[normal]th alternative funding models
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]In 2012, the Government relaunched PFI as the 
[normal]Private
[normal] Finance 2 (PF2) initiative, looking to address the imbalances of risks and rewards under the PFI contract model. However, 
[normal]we
[normal] believe 
[normal]that 
[normal]the reforms did not go far 
[normal]enough to address the issues
[normal] of financing 
[normal]premia 
[normal]currently being charged by the private sector and the
[normal] 
[normal]level 
[normal]of innovation
[normal] that a private sector PFI partner 
[normal]would be 
[normal]free to introduce fo
[normal]r transport projects in London
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]given the 
[normal]constraints required to ensu
[normal]re London’s transport system 
[normal]remains 
[normal]integrated
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]For major projects, 
[normal]we 
[normal]develop a funding and financing package on a project-by-project basis, looking at the best mix of public and private investment. Some projects lend themselves more easily to private sector investment than others. Currently, there 
[normal]are 
[normal]different private 
[normal]fund
[normal]ing and financing sources
[normal] that we 
[normal]may draw upon: 
[normal]PFI, direct borrowing from capital markets, 
[normal]CIL, BRS, S
[normal]ection 
[normal]106 agreements, Tax Increment Financing (TIF) and sponsorship. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]              
[normal]In order to attract private sector investment, 
[normal]a project must
[normal] 
[normal]provide the 
[normal]pr
[normal]ivate sector 
[normal]a return
[normal] from its investment. For example, in the 
[normal]case of the 
[normal]Emirates 
[normal]Air Line
[normal], a substantial amount of sponsorship was secured for the project and
[normal],
[normal] in exchange, certain commercial rights were passed to the 
[normal]sponsor
[normal]. 
[normal]In the Crossrail project, both the developer and the general business community recognised the economic boost that the new 
[normal]transport link 
[normal]will generate, and were
[normal],
[normal] therefore
[normal],
[normal] more willing to contribute funds towards the scheme in the form of additional tax 
[normal]revenues and developer-specific contributions.
[normal] In PFI projects, private financiers earn a predefined level of return 
[normal]for taking on specific project risks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]              
[normal]In general, our 
[normal]experience is that there is
[normal] significant
[normal] investor appetite for infrastructure pro
[normal]jects and
[normal],
[normal] in particular
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]transport 
[normal]schemes
[normal]. Investors are looking for low risk long-term investment opportunities and infrastructure project
[normal]s
[normal], especially transport, provide the right investment environment.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his may not always
[normal] 
[normal]be value for money
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]however, 
[normal]as compared with Government funding or 
[normal]our
[normal] 
[normal]own 
[normal]borrowing, when risk transfer 
[normal]to the private sector 
[normal]is limited and scope for innovation is low.
[normal] 
[normal]The p
[normal]rivate sector will still expect a reasonable return and security of its investment
[normal] 
[normal]and will look fo
[normal]r projects that can demonstrate 
[normal]both
[normal]. This can be achieved 
[normal]only 
[normal]if the 
[normal]Government 
[normal]acts as 
[normal]a guarantor for the private sector investment return
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]here are limits 
[normal]to the extent to which private sector investment can be used
[normal] effectively
[normal] - not least because of the impact that such in
[normal]vestment may have against our 
[normal]borrowing limits and more broadly, Public Sector Net Debt
[normal];
[normal] but also
[normal] 
[normal]if
[normal]  private investment 
[normal]is generated over time,
[normal] rather than upfront 
[normal]to finance a project’s construction
[normal]. 
[normal]The org
[normal]anisation’s balance sheet constrains the amount of up-front finance that is available, even if funding can be secured 
[normal]over the long-term
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8
[normal]              
[normal]A more radical examination of alternative funding streams was presented by the London Finance Commission i
[normal]n its 
[normal]May 2013 report, ‘Raising the Capital’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Commission put forward a case for fewer borrowing constraints and greater devolved tax powers for London, which would 
[normal]enable 
[normal]London Government 
[normal]to invest more comprehensively without the need
[normal] for ad hoc, project-by-project 
[normal]financing arrangements.
[normal] The Commission’s recommendation was to devolve both domestic and non-domestic taxes to London and pass the responsibility for setting the tax rates and authority over all matters including revaluation
[normal], banding and discounts to the regional level of Government. 
[normal]The report also recommended 
[normal]lifting
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]GLA’s borrowing constraints. Such a reform would increase the number of alternative funding streams available to London and could provide sources of both f
[normal]inancing and funding infrastructure projects without the need
[normal] 
[normal]for central Government funding and 
[normal]with more reliance on the private sector.
[normal]  
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]City Centred
[normal] 
[normal]campaign 
[normal]has brought together the Mayor, London Councils and the Core Cities (Birmingham, Bristol, 
[normal]Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nott
[normal]ingham, Sheffield) to jointly press 
[normal]for fiscal devolution to England’s cities
[normal],
[normal] which would allow for increased power and freedom to fund local transport infrastructure projects.
[normal]  
[normal]Greater devolution to London and
[normal] other major cities may be an avenue the Committee will want to explore.
