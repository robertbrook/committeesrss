[[[Written evidence submitted by Graham E Conway]]]The news is again highlighting the expensive failure of Free Schools (Â£6.6 m. each to set) and Academies, under this Government, having departed from the initial intention to bring failing schools under control, before returning them to local authority control.&#xa0;Currently Academy status&#xa0;simply means privatisation by the back door, for profit, resulting in sub-standard teaching by un- or under-qualified staff. We are a long way from when the overriding mantra of the Government was "Education, Education, Education"&#xa0;and no Party is highlighting the shortcomings of these Academies at every opportunity and putting forward policies regarding how we will modify the sub-standard teaching post 2015.&#xa0;I speak from some experience; I was head of an Independent School for over 15 years before retiring, caring in the main for forces families' children. Not only were we subject to regular&#xa0;Ofsted inspections, but were regularly inspected by MoD education officials and had to come up to the standard expected by my professional organisation - i.e. HMC etc.&#xa0;My daughter has been employed for three years by a nearby Academy (for her sake I will not name it - suffice it to say it comes from&#xa0;one of the 'better' Companies, and she is now concluding the first term of her NQT year. Nevertheless, throughout this time she has been employed, unsupervised in the main, on a standard teaching timetable, responsible for exam classes. After Christmas, due to staff vacancies and maternity leave, she will effectively be head of her subject department. The only others in the section have NO teaching qualifications, one isn't even a graduate, nor are training for such.&#xa0;Last week alone, in the same School, two members of staff walked out after being humiliated by the Head in front of their students. All Geography and History classes have, since the start of the year, been covered - not by supply staff but by other staff on 'free' periods. No work set, of course, there's no-one employed to set it!&#xa0;This is just one example of what I suspect is happening in many so-called Academies around the Country, which are putting profits first to the continuing detriment of students' education and future careers. Gove continues with the fallacy that workplace experience is more important that teaching qualifications. [It's a good job the same criterion is not used in picking MPs and the Cabinet.] Is the Labour front bench too embarrassed by its own background to stand up for qualified teachers against this hyped-up Govian fallacy?&#xa0;Of course, this is the old Thatcherite Tories all over - privatise everything - put their supporting business interests&#xa0; and their profits first; but why, oh why is this disgraceful policy and Government nor being more carefully scrutinised, failure to do so allowing the Government to get away with it?&#xa0;I know there's a cost of living crisis but Cameron isn't ever going to answer one of Ed Milliband's questions on Wednesday lunchtime if he carries on asking about it until Domesday. Someone needs to take him to task on education, highlight what is being done to the lives and futures of our children all over the country to support Gove's misguided experiment in education.December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
