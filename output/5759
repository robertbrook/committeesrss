[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to take the opportunity to supply an additional matter for consideration by the Public Accounts Committee for its hearing today. Publications ahead of the hearing have raised potential for debate around whether DMI should have continued and not been terminated in May of 2013. I consider from what I know of the project in its latter stages particularly the narrative provided to me by key stakeholders, the BBC made the correct decision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I do not wish to imply that as a result of the write down of assets, commercial suppliers of the system components delivered were poor performing or dysfunctional technology, quite the contrary, I have been made aware that a number of these components were delivered to the specification the BBC had commissioned however their performance was governed by the overall vision of the technology system which was controlled by the corporation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I consider that faced with a project that had failed to meet benefits expectations for the second time Lord Hall was left with no other option than to shut down DMI to remove the corporation from further risks created by the technology and cultural challenges of the project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I had not referred to this in my written evidence as I did not believe that this would be a matter of debate.
