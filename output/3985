default&#xa0;
default2. A short recap about the creation of the IPCCdefault&#xa0;
default[3] During the late 1970's and early 19780's the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) tripped to whip up publicity for the 
defaultclaim that carbon dioxide emissions were causing global warming. It enlisted the help of the International Union of Scientific Councils (ICSU), a shadowy body that proposed scientific studies and provided everything but the money.  The ICSU presented repor
defaultts in book form to the UNEP and those books were not independently reviewed.
default&#xa0;
default[4] The UNEP and ICSU arranged a conference of government representatives in Villach in 1980 but it was inconclusive.  It tried again in 1985, also in Villach, this time inviting
default scientists as individuals. When the conference proceedings were documented some months later the chairman Bert Bolin declared that there had been unanimous agreement that human activity was causing warming, which is certainly not the view of attendee Dr
default.
default 
defaultJohn Maunder of New Zealand (personal communication).
default&#xa0;
default[5] 
defaultAfter working the media even more, and with the support of a few key presentations, including one in the USA where James Hansen undermined the air-conditioning in the room 
defaultwhere the presentation was to take place, the IPCC was formed in 1987, with the 
defaultUNEP
default successfully proposing 
defaultBert Bolin 
defaultas chairman
default.
default&#xa0;
default[6] 
defaultThe IPCC's initial charter directed
default it to examine the risks associated with the human influence on climate
default, which of course pre-supposed that such an influence existed.  A UN conference in Rio de Janeiro
default in 1992 saw the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and it promptly declared that the human influence was significant and that carbon dioxide was the cause, notwithstanding the fact that the IPCC was yet (and still h
defaultasn't) conclusively proved that claim.
default  Following the establishment of the UNFCCC the IPCC was 
defaultdirected to support it.
default&#xa0;
default[7] The IPCC is charged with producing assessment reports, which are basically a summary 
defaultof 
defaultthe available literature, usually but not al
defaultways 
defaultin the form of 
defaultpeer-reviewed papers, combined with some commissioned climate modelling.  Each of the three IPCC Working Groups then summarises its contribution to the assessment report into the respective "Summary for Policymakers" whose final wording
default is negotiated between government representatives.
default&#xa0;
default[8] The writing of an IPCC assessment report is made much easier if there is general agreement between the Lead Authors and Coordinating Lead Authors of a given chapter.  One way to achieve this is to avoid involving any potential authors who might be scep
defaulttical of the claim of a significant human influence on temperature.
default&#xa0;
default[9] From all this one can conclude that the IPCC

default&#xa0;
default3. Comments on the findings of IPCC AR5 WG I default&#xa0;
default[10] Taken in the context of other comments in the WG I SPM the main finding of AR5, '
defaultIt is 
defaultextremely likely 
defaultthat human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century' (pg. SPM-12) is merely an assertion, not a claim based on convincing evidence.
default&#xa0;
default[11] On page three of the SPM we are told that tempe
defaultrature data in the previous 15 years (1998-2012) show negligible warming. The statement about recent temperatures is couched in technical language that in essence says that it is unclear whether there was slight cooling or slight warming from 1998 to 2012 
defaultbut whatever the exact trend it was lower than the temperature trend from 1951 to 2012.
default&#xa0;
default[12] 
defaultThe IPCC blames the flat trend on "several small volcanic eruptions" during the period 2008-2011
default"
default 
default[pg SPM-9] 
defaultbut fails to name any of these, which prevents any va
defaultlidation of the claims.  
defaultThis claim is very suspicious.
default&#xa0;
default[13] Firstly, f
defaultifty percent of the Earth's surface lies between latitudes 30N and 30S but little volcanic activity has been reported in that region since the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.  
default&#xa0;
default[14] 
defaultSecondly the first of the 
defaultthree references cited 
defaultin 
defaultWGI section 8.4.2
default (Nagai et al (2004
default)
default) claims (and graphs) volcanic emissions as 
defaultpersistent and 
defaultalmost constant since about 1994 when the effects of Pinatubo had weakened
default, albeit these sustained atmo
defaultspheric particles  at less than 1/30
defaultth
default the amount immediately after the Pinatubo eruption
default. 
default 
defaultTh
defaulte period described in Nagai et al (2004) 
defaultis not the 
default"
default2008 to 2011
default"
default period described in the WG I SPM but why should there be a discrepancy?
default  
defaultNot for the first time
default is there a difference between what the IPCC claims a reference says and what it actually says
default.  Maybe the problem is that 
defaultFoster and Rahmstorf (2011
default)
default showed, by a different technique (optical depth v. Lidar), that 
defaultafter the sulphide emissions from the 
defaultP
defaultinatubo
default eruption faded (approx. 1994)
default to 2008 the atmosphere contained negligible particles that might obstruction solar radiation.
default  Together it seems that, regrettably, the basis for the IPCC's claims about the cooling caused by volcanic emissions is some
defaultwhat "flexible".
default&#xa0;
default[15] 
defaultOn page 10 of the SPM we are told
default that various improvements have been made to climate models, but deep within that text is the comment 
default"There may also be... in some models, an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse 
defaultgases."
default&#xa0;
default[16] This is a critical 
defaultadmission because the IPCC
default relies on the output of climate models to attribute a certain portion of any warming to human activity and projections of future temperatures are determined by models.
default&#xa0;
default[17] I also draw 
defaultyour 
defaultatten
defaulttion to 
defaultrecent 
defaultwork by von Storch et al (2013)
default, which found that only about 3% of 251 climate models predicted temperature trends as low
default,
default or lower than
default,
default the trend in observed temperatures over the last 15 years.  It seems that the IPCC's use of the word "
defaultsome" would be more accurately expressed as "the vast majority".
default&#xa0;
default[18] 
defaultI submit that the climate models used by the IPCC are constructed in such a way that the impacts of carbon dioxide are exaggerated and that 
defaultthe 
defaultinfluence
defaults
default of natural climate forces are 
defaultdownplayed.
default  One should not interpret this as the models per se exaggerating the influence of carbon dioxide; the error lies in the algorithms in the computer software.
default&#xa0;
default[19] 
defaultThe IPCC's AR3 and AR4 (published 2001 and 2007 respectively) listed 
defaultclimate forc
defaultes associated with heat transfer by radiation and indicated that the level of scientific understanding (LSU) of many of these forces was low or very low.  Table 2-11, starting on page 201 of the 2007 report, listed 16 forces and indicated that the LSU of 1
default3 of them were rated as 'Low' or 'very low'. The latest IPCC assessment report modifies the format of reporting (see table 8.14), lists
default 14 forces associated with heat transfer by radiation and now claims that one
default 
defaultforce is very well understood, five
default others are of 'medium' understanding and 
defaulteight are of less than 'medium'.  And note that these are only the subset of climate forces associated with heat transfer by radiation, not a list of all climate forces.  
defaultIt 
defaultsimply 
defaultbeggars belief that accurate clim
defaultate models can be constructed when 
defaulteven the IPCC admits that many 
defaultforces are poorly understood.
default&#xa0;
default[20] 
defaultThe 2007 IPCC assessment report (i.e. 4AR) 
defaultindicated that the output of climate models was a relatively close match to historical temperatures.  
defaultTo the be
defaultst of my knowledge
default,
default since that report there have been no fundamental changes to algorithms for the influence of carbon dioxide on temperature, so because 5AR says that climate models exaggerate that influence then it logically follows that the models also 
defaultexaggerated the influence 
defaultdiscussed 
defaultin IPCC 4AR and IPCC 3AR.  Further, if the influence of carbon dioxide was exaggerated in 4AR but the output of models was a reasonable replication of historical temperatures, it means that the influence of other forces 
defaultwas under-estimated.
default&#xa0;
default[21] 
defaultThe IPCC's finding 
default'
defaultIt is 
defaultextremely likely 
defaultthat human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century' is firstly vague because 'dominant' can mean anything from 50.1% to 99.9% when two fa
defaultctors are considered, 33.4% to 99.9% when three are considered, 25.1% to 99.9% when four are.  I'm sure you the picture.  The second reason for the claim lacking credibility is because it is based on the output of climate 
defaultmodels, which as I have shown abov
defaulte, very likely over-estimate the influence of carbon dioxide.
default&#xa0;
default[22] In short the IPCC's primary finding is one without any credible basis.
default&#xa0;
default[23] 
defaultIncidentally, please note that I do not accept the wording of your question "
defaultHas AR5 sufficiently explained the
default reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?"
default  The word "hiatus" implies that warming will resume at some point in time but in fact no-one can say with any certainty if this will be in the near future or distant futu
defaultre.  In this instance the word "stopped" would also be unacceptable because no-one can be certain that it has stopped.  I prefer the neutral expression "absence of warming" (or if you prefer "absence of statistically significant warming").
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4. defaultResponse todefault your question default- default"defaultHow effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveyingdefault&#xa0;defaultwhat is meant by udefaultncertainty in scientific terms?"default&#xa0;default[24] I appreciate the IPCC's difficulty in uniformly conveying uncertainty but the present approach
default,
default of expressing
default uncertainty in
default 
defaultterms of 
defaultpercentage likelihood
default (i.e. probability),
default gives a 
defaultvery 
defaultfalse impression 
defaultthat these expressions have a mathematical basis.
default&#xa0;
default[25] As I am sure you are aware, the IPCC guidance document for expressing uncertainty says 
default"Likelihood may 
defaultbe based on statistical or modeling analyses, elicitation of expert views, or other quantitative analyses."
default 
default(point 10 of IPCC document '
default 
defaultGuidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties')
default&#xa0;
default[26] 
defaultThe
default IPCC's documented procedures fail to mandate that the basis for any statement of likelihood should be clearly stated
default, especially which of the above methods was used.  As a result 
defaultwe have no idea of the foundation of certain clai
defaultms.
default&#xa0;
default[27] If expert opinion
default was sought then surely we are entitled to know whose opinion that was so that we might judge their credibility for ourselves.
default  (Could perhaps, any expert opinion of likelihood expressed in 5AR have come from 'experts' who previously predicted continued wa
defaultrming over the period 1998-2012?  If that is correct then the credibility of their opinions is low.)
default&#xa0;
default[28] 
defaultEven worse, 
defaultIPCC procedure
defaults describe how 
defaultany passage of text in an IPCC assessment report is likely the work of one or two 
defaultLead Authors, perhaps 
defaultusing material supplied by one or more Contributing A
defaultuthors
default, and the passage subject to the general 
defaultapprov
defaultal of the one or two 
defaultCoordinating Lead Author
defaults.  That's a total of about 
defaultfive people
default,
default but if only one LA and one CLA were involved it would be as few 
defaultas two.  Without clear documentation of the basis of expressions of likelihood there is nothing to prevent this small number of authors basically fabricating or at least enhancing a claim.  This might sound like an outlandish suggestion but 
defaultalmost every IP
defaultCC assessment report has claimed an increase in likelihood but failed to show credible evidence to support those statements.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultResponse to your question – "defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?default"default&#xa0;
default[29] 
defaultAs noted above in the 
defaultdiscussion 
defaultof the creation of the IPCC (section XX), sceptics of the notion that human activity has a significant impact on climate are not invited to take part.  Two examples stand out as to why this is not the case. For the 2007 rep
defaultort hurricane expert Dr Chris Landsea was invited to be an author of one but found the Coordinating Lead Author of that chapter
default, who was not an expert in the matter,
default making public statements
default that Landsea did not agree with.  Also for the 2007 report Dr Pau
defaultl Reiter, an expert in mosquito-borne diseases had to threaten legal action before the IPCC would remove his name from the list of authors for a chapter, Reiter objecting very strongly to the draft text that was in contradiction to his expert views.
default&#xa0;
default[30] 
defaultFurther, 
defaultIPCC reports rarely cite the papers written by sceptics of significant manmade warming.  There are multiple reasons for this
default:
default-
default              
defaultthe IPCC's charter does not instruct it to consider alternative opinions
default-
default              
defaultrelatively few such papers exist, due mainly
default to the research funding emphasis on supporting the IPCC view
default-
default              
defaultthe IPCC appears to cite alternative papers only t
defaulto try to show them to be flawed
default which
default,
default by extension
default,
default reinforce
defaults
default the IPCC view
default-
default              
defaultresearchers who are sceptical of the IPCC view do not share an
default alternative common view but in fact h
defaultold many opinions and hypotheses and to talk of a specific alternative hypothesis would mean ignoring a large number of other hypotheses.
default&#xa0;
default[31] 
defaultIf the IPCC had been instructed to investigate all possible causes of clim
defaultate variability
default then it follows that these alternative views would likely have received due consideration and discussion, especially if research in these areas was better funded.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6. defaultResponse to your questions - defaultIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?default&#xa0;default[32] If your question relates to the process of summarising th
defaulte latest findings (i.e. papers) and
default then presenting a summary of that summary for government approval then my response is that this method is unsuitable for climate science because (a) the subject is poorly understood and (b) 
defaultthe source information is skewed because 
defaultlarge areas of climate s
defaultcience research, especially those investigating natural forces, are poorly funded and produce nowhere near the volume of papers 
defaultproduced 
defaultby 
defaultthe heavily-funded 
defaultresearch 
defaultthat is aligned to the IPCC view.
default&#xa0;
default[33] If your question relates to the IPCC itself, the
defaultn my response is that the IPCC's charter is far too specific and makes the presumption that the force it is to investigate (a) exists and (b) is significant enough to warrant action.  Making presumptions is not how science should be done. 
default&#xa0;
default[34] 
defaultA far bett
defaulter approach would be to direct a body to investigate all possible causes of climate variation
default, and if this was too much for one body then construct separate bodies to consider separate forces.  Associated with this is the need to ensure the absence of publ
defaulticity bias and any similar attempts to manipulate public opinion towards a certain view.
default&#xa0;
default[35] Your question about 
defaultwhether 
defaultthe IPCC process 
defaultis focussed on 
defaultjustifying a political commitment is difficult to answer.  I don't understand the context that you re
defaultfer to and my only option 
defaultis to comment briefly on two
default political contexts that may be relevant.
default&#xa0;
default[36] 
defaultAt the top level we have 
defaultUnited Nations bodies, firstly 
defaultthe UNEP
default 
defaultwhich as explained above, 
defaultagitated for the creation of the IPCC on the assumption that 
defaultthe human influence was significant.  Secondly there is the UNFCCC, which has stated that the post-1950 warming is caused by human activity.  To show that these organizations were wrong would be potentially damaging to the standing of the UN.
default&#xa0;
default[37] (I rhet
defaultorically ask, what does one do when the UN is wrong?  The UNEP was wrong on "acid rain" being a major threat to trees, was wrong about DDT and was wrong about CFC's causing the hole in the ozone layer 
default- 
defaultbecause it wrongly believed that a reaction occurred 
defaultten times faster than it really does and the slower speed is too slow to sustain critical chemical reactions.  
defaultThis were all major issues that governments were pressured into reacted to and yet the UNEP appears to have escaped any censure.
default)
default&#xa0;
default[38] 
defaultIf the qu
defaultestion relates to governments and political parties then
default yes, I believe there is some bias in that direction.  
defaultIf the IPCC view is shown to be wrong either by alternative theories or by temperatures that do not match IPCC predictions then g
defaultovernments and a
defaultll political parties that appear to concur with the IPCC view will suffer backlash on two front – (a) from some voters, for being slow to see through the IPCC's claims and (b) from other voters who still believe, for not supporting the IPCC view.
default&#xa0;
default[39] 
defaultFur
defaultther 
defaultit was reported from Stockholm that some governments did not want the WG I SPM to mention the absence of warming across 1998 to 2012.  This to me sounds like 
defaultthose governments were worried about the consequences of mention of failure of temperatures 
defaultto rise as predicted.
default&#xa0;
default[40] 
defaultFinally 
defaultI note that the last few UNFCCC conferences have proposed that develo
defaultped countries should fund climate mitigation in developing and under-developed countries.  Surely the promise of money is a powerful incentive
default for thos
defaulte beneficiary countries to support the IPCC view.
