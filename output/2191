[normal]Just want to make some comments re the draft deregulation bill. I think it like the recent lobbying bill a dogs breakfast badly drafted the explanatory notes are not in turn with the clauses as don’t give any background and explanation in  the expltory notes are poor and incomplete. And it has no structure it has too much in it.

[normal]And sorry to make it brief. I think it only fit for the dustbin and never should be presented in any format and the committee should be clear what a
[normal] complete dog’s breakfast it is.
