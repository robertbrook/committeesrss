default3
default.
default1
default 
defaultEven though the clinical desc
defaultriptions are different, ME is
default also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and post-viral fa
defaulttigue syndrome (PVFS)
default.
default 
defaultThere is a great deal of 
defaultconfusion and 
defaultdebate over
default nomenc
defaultlature and definition.
default 
defaultF
defaultor the purpose of this submission
default, we will refer to
default the commonly used composite term of ME/CFS.
default3
default.
default2
default 
defaultME
default/CFS is thought to affect at least
default 250,000 people in the UK.
default 
defaultIt affects all age groups, including children and adolescents
default where it has been identified as
default one of the common
defaultest causes of long-
defaultterm sickness absence from school.
default 
defaultThe most common age of onset is
default between 20 and 40 years of age in adults and 11 to 14 in children.
default3
default.
default3
default 
defaultME/CFS
default affects all social classes and ethnic groups.
default3
default.
default4 
defaultME/CFS is 
defaultrecognised
default to be
default a neurological disorder by the World Health 
defaultOrganisation
default (in section G 93.3 of ICD10) – a classification that is accepted by the Department of Health.
default3
default.
default5 
defaultIn the majority of cases the illness affects fit and healthy people who predate
default the onset of their illness to 
defaulta
defaultn acute
default viral infection
default, or some other immune system stressor,
default 
defaultbut
default then
default ‘fail to recover’.
default 
default3
default.
default6
default 
defaultThe key symptoms include
default:
default3
default.
default7 
defaultMore serious neurological symptoms occur in a minority of people with ME/CFS, especially those at the severe end of the spectrum.
default 
defaultThese may include blackouts, atypical convulsions, loss of speech, loss of swallowing – which may require assisted feeding.

default(R1

default(R3)
default, Royal Medical Colleges

default – have all 
defaultrecognised
default the serious and persisting ill health and disability that is caused by ME/CFS
default along with an 
defaulturgent need to provide hospital-
defaultbase
defaultd
default referral 
defaultservices and carry out research into both cause and management
default.
default3
default.
default9 
defaultAround a quarter of all people with ME/CFS fall into the severely a
defaultffected category – meaning 
defaultthey are housebound, wheelchair-bound
default or bed-bound at significant
default stage
defaults
default in the illness.
default3
default.

default 
defaultResearch into prognosis indicates that 
defaultwhile many people with ME/CFS stabilize 
defaultonly a smal

default.
default1
default 
defaultWe would like to bring to the attention of the Health Committee a number of concerns in relatio
defaultn to the management of ME/CFS. Some are shared with other long-term conditions whereas others are unique to ME/CFS.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.
default2
default 
defaultThese concerns are repe
defaultatedly raised by people with
default ME/CFS. They have also have been raised on numerous occasions in both the House of Comm
defaultons and the House of Lords, 
defaultin meetings of the All 
defaultParty Parliamentary Group on ME, which is Chaired by Annette Brooke MP, 
defaultin adjournment debates, 
defaultand in a joint charity forum (Forward ME Group) that is chaire
defaultd by the Countess of Mar
default.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.
default3 
defaultUnfortunately, very little progress has been made in addressing 
defaultthese concerns.
default 
defaultA
defaultnd in relation to some aspects of management
default 
defaultand NHS service provision 
defaultthe position has become worse.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.
default4 
defaultThe key
default points that we wish to make cover all points in the patient journey from diagnosis
default right
default through to management and support
default.
default&#xa0;
default5default defaultLack of epidemiological datadefault&#xa0;default5
default.
default1 
defaultHealth service commissioners do not have meaningful epidemiological data on the prevalence and incidence of ME/CFS
default – information that is vital
default for 
defaultcommissioners
default in order to plan appropriate levels of service
default provision
default.
default 
defaultSub
defaultm
defaultissions from 
defaultprimary care trusts 
default(
defaultPCTs
default)
default to the 
default2010 
defaultAPPG report on NHS Service Provision
default (R6) 
defaultconfirmed that they do not have accurate patient numbers
default.
default 
defaultThere is
default therefore
default an urgent need for
default 
defaulta comprehensive and accurate
default epidemiological study to ascertain the true extent of both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS.
default&#xa0;
default6default defaultDelay in diagnosisdefault&#xa0;default6
default.
default1
default 
defaultMany doctors lack the necessary knowledge and experience to confidently diagnose ME/CFS.
default 
defaultDue to the historical background
default, some doctors sti
defaultll refuse to accept that ME/CFS exists as a clinical entity or are unwilling to use it as a diagnostic label.
default 
defaultConsequently, a significant proportion of people with ME/CFS remain undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or have to wait for an unacceptable period of time before the diagnosis is made.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6
default.
default2
default 
defaultA report by the ME Alliance (R
default7
default) found that:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6
default.
default3
default 
defaultAs a result
default,
default people with ME/CFS
default 
defaultoften 
defaultreceive inappropriate or even harmful advice on management 
defaultfor a considerable period of time 
default– which has a very negative impact on 
defaultall aspects of management and the 
defaultoverall prognosis
default.
default 
default7default defaultLack of medical educationdefault&#xa0;
default7
default.
default1
default 
defaultMuch of the
default problem
default relating to diagnostic delay and bad initial management
default relates to the lack o
defaultf medical education about ME/CFS
default at both an undergraduate and postgraduate level.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7
default.
default2
default 
defaultOrganisations
default that are responsible for medical education – Medical Schools, Royal Colleges, General Medical Council – must therefore take a much more proac
defaulttive role to ensure that all health professionals
default in training 
default– doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists - 
defaultsee people with this illness and receive appropriate teaching on clinical assessment and management.
default&#xa0;
default8default defaultHeterogenedefaultity of ME/CFSdefault&#xa0;default8
default.
default1
default 
defaultME/CFS is a heterogeneous condition – both from the point of view of clinical presentation and factors that are involved in causation
default and perpetuation
default.
default 
defaultConsequently, any management 
defaultprogramme
default must be linked to individual symptoms, severity of symptoms, and any other issues that may be involved in maintaining the illness – there is no place for a
defaultn inflexible
default ‘one size fits all’ 
defaultor an overly centralized 
defaultapproach.
default 
default&#xa0;
default9default defaultLack of hospital-defaultbased referral servicesdefault&#xa0;default9
default.
default1
default 
defaultThere is currently a worrying lack of consistency
default in the way in which hospital-
defaultbased referral services are organized for patients with ME/CFS, or where there is a possible diagnosis of ME/CFS.
default 
defaultThis was one of the main conclus
defaultions in the report on NHS Se
defaultr
defaultvice Provision that was prepared by the APPG on ME
default.
default 
defaultThe report noted that:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe APPG finds the degree of variation in the availability of and access to services unacceptable.
default 
defaultPatient evidence also indicates people want services that are physician led, multidisciplinary, and are situated in locations that are accessible to those with significant mobility problems.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe APPG recommend the 
defaultDoH
default tak
defaulte
defaults steps to remedy the variation and ensure that each PCT offers a range of services promptly – a process that should involve meaningful consultation with local patients or patient support groups.
default&#xa0;
default10default defaultLack of services for children and adolescentsdefault&#xa0;
default10
default.
default1
default 
defaultIn relation to children and adolescents the
default situation is even worse
default.
default 
defaultThis is largely
default due to the fact that
default most of the existing NHS referral services only provide diagnosis and management to people over the age of 16.
default 
defaultThe APPG report 
defaultconcluded
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is 
defaultunacceptable and can lead to tragic consequences
default&#xa0;
default10
default.
default2
default 
defaultThe APPG report went on to recommend that all involved should:
default&#xa0;
defaultUndertake a detailed review of current
default servi
defaultces for children and adolescents to ensure that all receive adequate care and that all decisions are made in conjunction with personal 
defaultcarers
default, education authorities and social services where appropriate.
default&#xa0;
default10
default.
default3
default 
defaultDespite these
default very clear recommendation
defaults
default there has been no 
defaultmeaningful 
defaultaction from
default the vast majority of
default PCTs since 2010 
default– 
defaultand in some locations 
defaultwhere 
defaultspecialist referral services h
defaultave been 
defaultset up these have later been 
defaultdowngraded or closed. This is clearly an unacceptable situation
default that
default must now be addressed by the new Clinical Commissioning Groups
default.
default&#xa0;
default11default defaultLack of services for people with severe ME/CFSdefault&#xa0;default11.1
default 
defaultAs already noted, approxi
defaultmately 25% of people with ME/CFS
default will be classified as being severely affected at some stage in their illness.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, this group
default have great difficulty in accessing hospital 
default-
defaultbased services, 
defaultand 
defaultare not normally offered any form of home 
default- 
defaultbased domicil
defaulti
defaultary service. Dedicated in-patient beds for the assessment 
defaultand mana
defaultgement of people with severe ME
default/CFS are almost non-
defaultexisten
defaultt.
default 
defaultConsequently, many people at
default the severe end of the spectrum receive no NHS care at all – a situation that is clearly inconsistent with the NICE guideline
default on ME/CFS
default.
default&#xa0;
default11.2
default 
defaultThe APPG report concluded:
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecialist referral services must ensure that high priority is given to the needs of the severely affected, especially in relation to domiciliary services and in patient facilities for assessment and management
default 
default&#xa0;
default12default defaultThe NICE guideline on ME/CFSdefault&#xa0;default12
default.
default1
default 
defaultThe current 
default(2007) 
defaultNICE guideline for the management of ME/CFS has been heavily criticized by people with ME/CFS
default, and the charities,
default 
defaulton the grounds that it places far too much emphasis on the use of two 
defaultbehavioural
default interventions – graded exercise therapy
default (GET)
default 
defaultand cognitive 
defaultbehaviour
default therapy (CBT) 
default– that are 
defaultconsistently 
defaultfound to be either ineffective or even harmful by a significant proportion of people with ME/CFS. 
defaultIn addition, NICE has failed to recognize the fact that repeated surveys of patient opinion, including the one in the CMO report, have concluded that the most effective and safe form of activity management is a process known as pacing.
default&#xa0;
default12
default.
default2
default 
defaultSurveys carried out by the ME/CFS support charities have repeatedly confirmed a high degree of dissatisfaction with the way in which the NHS is 
defaultalmost indiscriminately
default 
defaultrecommending these two treatments
default to people with mild or moderate ME/CFS
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default12
default.
default3
default 
defaultThe largest and most recently reported survey carried out by the MEA
default (R8
default)
default, which involved over 4,000 respondents, found that in relation to CBT
default 
default(
default997 respondents
default)
default:
default&#xa0;
default2.8% were ‘greatly improved’
default23.1% were ‘improved
default54.6% were ‘no change’
default11.6% were ‘slightly worse’
default7.9% were ‘much worse’
default&#xa0;
default12
default.
default4
default 
defaultI
defaultn relation to GET
default (906 respondents)
default:
default&#xa0;
default3.4% were ‘greatly improved’
default18.7% were ‘improved’
default21.4% were ‘no change’
default23.
default4% were ‘slightly worse’
default33.
default1% were ‘much worse’
default&#xa0;
default12
default.
default5
default 
defaultI
defaultn relation to pacing (2137 respondents):
default&#xa0;
default11.6% were ‘greatly impro
defaultved’
default59.6% were ‘improved’
default24.1% were ‘no change’
default3.5% were ‘slightly worse’
default1.2% were ‘much worse’
default&#xa0;
default12.6
default 
defaultThe NICE guideline also downgrades most aspects of 
defaultthe 
defaultpragmatic management of key symptoms on the basis that there is an inadequate evidence based guidance of guideline production.
default 
defaultThis is not the position taken by the 2002 CMO Report into ME/CFS.
default&#xa0;
default12
default.
default7
default 
defaultThe MEA does not therefore believe that the NICE guideline is fit for purpose and we are very disappointed to learn that a proper review of this guideline with stakeholder input that was planned for 2013 appears to have been cancelled and 
defaultwill now 
defaultreplaced by some form of brief internal review. 
default&#xa0;
default13default defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default13
default.
default1
default 
defaultIn summary, there are a number of issues rela
defaultting to the management of ME/CFS
default that are not being addressed
default by all those who should be taking action
default.
default 
defaultMost of these is
defaultsues have already been referred to
default in reports to government – including the 2002 Chief Medical Officer’s Report and the 2
default010 report from the APPG on ME o
defaultn NHS Service Provision.
default 
defaultSadly, there has been a distinct lack of action on behalf of 
defaultall those responsible
default to address these concerns.
default 
defaultThis is clearly unacceptable.
default&#xa0;
default13
default.
default2
default 
defaultAction therefore needs to be taken in the following areas:
default&#xa0;
default13
default.
default3
default 
defaultAn epidemiological study to establish the number of people – adults and children -
default 
defaultwith ME/CFS
default, along with the degree of severity.
default 
defaultThis will enable Clinical Commissioning Groups to plan an appropriate
default local
default level of service provision.
default&#xa0;
default13
default.
default4
default 
defaultAl
defaultl health professionals should receive
default a proper period of medical education on the diagnosis and management
default of ME/CFS during their 
defaulttraining
default.
default 
defaultME/CFS should also form part of continual professional development/education
default at a postgraduate level
default.
default&#xa0;
default13
default.
default5
default 
defaultEarly and accurate diagnosis
default in primary care
default, along with appropriate early management,
default to reduce the chance of a more severe and prolonged illness occurring
default&#xa0;
default13
default.
default6 
defaultAn end to the postcode lottery of NHS referral services
default – everyone with ME/CFS, adults and children
default, severely affected, should 
defaulthave access to a local hospital where 
defaultphysician-led 
defaultspecialist
default 
defaultinput on diagnosis and management can be obtained, where appropriate.
default&#xa0;
default13
default.
default7 
defaultPhysicia
defaultn
default-
defaultled multidisciplinary
default management 
defaultprogrammes
default should be introduced which
default recognize that treatment has to be tailored to individual needs based on stage, severity and symptoms 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ME Association would be very willing to give oral evidence to any of the hearings that the Health Committee intends to arran
defaultge on this very important topic
default.
