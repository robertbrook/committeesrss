&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence from the ME Association[bold] (LTC 13)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1[bold] [bold]The ME Association[bold]Th
[normal]is is the submission from Th
[normal]e ME Association (MEA)
[normal]. The MEA is a national charity that provides information and 
[normal]support for people who have ME (
[normal]myalgic
[normal] encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy)
[normal] and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
[normal]. 
[normal]It 
[normal]also funds research into the cau
[normal]se and management of ME/CFS through the MEA Ramsay Research Fund.
[normal]2[bold] [bold]Summary[bold]The key points being made in this submission relate to:
[normal]3[bold] [bold]ME/CFS[bold] 
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]Even though the clinical desc
[normal]riptions are different, ME is
[normal] also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and post-viral fa
[normal]tigue syndrome (PVFS)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]There is a great deal of 
[normal]confusion and 
[normal]debate over
[normal] nomenc
[normal]lature and definition.
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]or the purpose of this submission
[normal], we will refer to
[normal] the commonly used composite term of ME/CFS.
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]ME
[normal]/CFS is thought to affect at least
[normal] 250,000 people in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]It affects all age groups, including children and adolescents
[normal] where it has been identified as
[normal] one of the common
[normal]est causes of long-
[normal]term sickness absence from school.
[normal] 
[normal]The most common age of onset is
[normal] between 20 and 40 years of age in adults and 11 to 14 in children.
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]ME/CFS
[normal] affects all social classes and ethnic groups.
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]4 
[normal]ME/CFS is 
[normal]recognised
[normal] to be
[normal] a neurological disorder by the World Health 
[normal]Organisation
[normal] (in section G 93.3 of ICD10) – a classification that is accepted by the Department of Health.
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]5 
[normal]In the majority of cases the illness affects fit and healthy people who predate
[normal] the onset of their illness to 
[normal]a
[normal]n acute
[normal] viral infection
[normal], or some other immune system stressor,
[normal] 
[normal]but
[normal] then
[normal] ‘fail to recover’.
[normal] 
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]6
[normal] 
[normal]The key symptoms include
[normal]:
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]7 
[normal]More serious neurological symptoms occur in a minority of people with ME/CFS, especially those at the severe end of the spectrum.
[normal] 
[normal]These may include blackouts, atypical convulsions, loss of speech, loss of swallowing – which may require assisted feeding.
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]8
[normal] 
[normal]R
[normal]eports into the illness – from the Chief Medical Officer
[normal] 
[normal](R1
[normal])
[normal], Medical Research Council
[normal] 
[normal](R2)
[normal], NICE
[normal] 
[normal](R3)
[normal], Royal Medical Colleges
[normal] (R4)
[normal] – have all 
[normal]recognised
[normal] the serious and persisting ill health and disability that is caused by ME/CFS
[normal] along with an 
[normal]urgent need to provide hospital-
[normal]base
[normal]d
[normal] referral 
[normal]services and carry out research into both cause and management
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]9 
[normal]Around a quarter of all people with ME/CFS fall into the severely a
[normal]ffected category – meaning 
[normal]they are housebound, wheelchair-bound
[normal] or bed-bound at significant
[normal] stage
[normal]s
[normal] in the illness.
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]10
[normal] 
[normal]Research into prognosis indicates that 
[normal]while many people with ME/CFS stabilize 
[normal]only a smal
[normal]l minority
[normal] return to normal or near normal levels of health.
[normal] 
[normal]Most people experience a significant degre
[normal]e of long-
[normal]term ill health and disability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]11
[normal] 
[normal]The annual cost to the UK economy 
[normal]in relation to medical costs, benefit payments and lost revenue 
[normal]has been estimat
[normal]ed to be around £3.5 billion (R5
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold] [bold]Management[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]We would like to bring to the attention of the Health Committee a number of concerns in relatio
[normal]n to the management of ME/CFS. Some are shared with other long-term conditions whereas others are unique to ME/CFS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]These concerns are repe
[normal]atedly raised by people with
[normal] ME/CFS. They have also have been raised on numerous occasions in both the House of Comm
[normal]ons and the House of Lords, 
[normal]in meetings of the All 
[normal]Party Parliamentary Group on ME, which is Chaired by Annette Brooke MP, 
[normal]in adjournment debates, 
[normal]and in a joint charity forum (Forward ME Group) that is chaire
[normal]d by the Countess of Mar
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]3 
[normal]Unfortunately, very little progress has been made in addressing 
[normal]these concerns.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]nd in relation to some aspects of management
[normal] 
[normal]and NHS service provision 
[normal]the position has become worse.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]4 
[normal]The key
[normal] points that we wish to make cover all points in the patient journey from diagnosis
[normal] right
[normal] through to management and support
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold] [bold]Lack of epidemiological data[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5
[normal].
[normal]1 
[normal]Health service commissioners do not have meaningful epidemiological data on the prevalence and incidence of ME/CFS
[normal] – information that is vital
[normal] for 
[normal]commissioners
[normal] in order to plan appropriate levels of service
[normal] provision
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Sub
[normal]m
[normal]issions from 
[normal]primary care trusts 
[normal](
[normal]PCTs
[normal])
[normal] to the 
[normal]2010 
[normal]APPG report on NHS Service Provision
[normal] (R6) 
[normal]confirmed that they do not have accurate patient numbers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]There is
[normal] therefore
[normal] an urgent need for
[normal] 
[normal]a comprehensive and accurate
[normal] epidemiological study to ascertain the true extent of both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold] [bold]Delay in diagnosis[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]Many doctors lack the necessary knowledge and experience to confidently diagnose ME/CFS.
[normal] 
[normal]Due to the historical background
[normal], some doctors sti
[normal]ll refuse to accept that ME/CFS exists as a clinical entity or are unwilling to use it as a diagnostic label.
[normal] 
[normal]Consequently, a significant proportion of people with ME/CFS remain undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or have to wait for an unacceptable period of time before the diagnosis is made.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]A report by the ME Alliance (R
[normal]7
[normal]) found that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]As a result
[normal],
[normal] people with ME/CFS
[normal] 
[normal]often 
[normal]receive inappropriate or even harmful advice on management 
[normal]for a considerable period of time 
[normal]– which has a very negative impact on 
[normal]all aspects of management and the 
[normal]overall prognosis
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]7[bold] [bold]Lack of medical education[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]Much of the
[normal] problem
[normal] relating to diagnostic delay and bad initial management
[normal] relates to the lack o
[normal]f medical education about ME/CFS
[normal] at both an undergraduate and postgraduate level.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]Organisations
[normal] that are responsible for medical education – Medical Schools, Royal Colleges, General Medical Council – must therefore take a much more proac
[normal]tive role to ensure that all health professionals
[normal] in training 
[normal]– doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists - 
[normal]see people with this illness and receive appropriate teaching on clinical assessment and management.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8[bold] [bold]Heterogene[bold]ity of ME/CFS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]ME/CFS is a heterogeneous condition – both from the point of view of clinical presentation and factors that are involved in causation
[normal] and perpetuation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Consequently, any management 
[normal]programme
[normal] must be linked to individual symptoms, severity of symptoms, and any other issues that may be involved in maintaining the illness – there is no place for a
[normal]n inflexible
[normal] ‘one size fits all’ 
[normal]or an overly centralized 
[normal]approach.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9[bold] [bold]Lack of hospital-[bold]based referral services[bold]&#xa0;[bold]9
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]There is currently a worrying lack of consistency
[normal] in the way in which hospital-
[normal]based referral services are organized for patients with ME/CFS, or where there is a possible diagnosis of ME/CFS.
[normal] 
[normal]This was one of the main conclus
[normal]ions in the report on NHS Se
[normal]r
[normal]vice Provision that was prepared by the APPG on ME
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The report noted that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The APPG finds the degree of variation in the availability of and access to services unacceptable.
[normal] 
[normal]Patient evidence also indicates people want services that are physician led, multidisciplinary, and are situated in locations that are accessible to those with significant mobility problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The APPG recommend the 
[normal]DoH
[normal] tak
[normal]e
[normal]s steps to remedy the variation and ensure that each PCT offers a range of services promptly – a process that should involve meaningful consultation with local patients or patient support groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10[bold] [bold]Lack of services for children and adolescents[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]In relation to children and adolescents the
[normal] situation is even worse
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This is largely
[normal] due to the fact that
[normal] most of the existing NHS referral services only provide diagnosis and management to people over the age of 16.
[normal] 
[normal]The APPG report 
[normal]concluded
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is 
[normal]unacceptable and can lead to tragic consequences
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]The APPG report went on to recommend that all involved should:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Undertake a detailed review of current
[normal] servi
[normal]ces for children and adolescents to ensure that all receive adequate care and that all decisions are made in conjunction with personal 
[normal]carers
[normal], education authorities and social services where appropriate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]Despite these
[normal] very clear recommendation
[normal]s
[normal] there has been no 
[normal]meaningful 
[normal]action from
[normal] the vast majority of
[normal] PCTs since 2010 
[normal]– 
[normal]and in some locations 
[normal]where 
[normal]specialist referral services h
[normal]ave been 
[normal]set up these have later been 
[normal]downgraded or closed. This is clearly an unacceptable situation
[normal] that
[normal] must now be addressed by the new Clinical Commissioning Groups
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11[bold] [bold]Lack of services for people with severe ME/CFS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]11.1
[normal] 
[normal]As already noted, approxi
[normal]mately 25% of people with ME/CFS
[normal] will be classified as being severely affected at some stage in their illness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, this group
[normal] have great difficulty in accessing hospital 
[normal]-
[normal]based services, 
[normal]and 
[normal]are not normally offered any form of home 
[normal]- 
[normal]based domicil
[normal]i
[normal]ary service. Dedicated in-patient beds for the assessment 
[normal]and mana
[normal]gement of people with severe ME
[normal]/CFS are almost non-
[normal]existen
[normal]t.
[normal] 
[normal]Consequently, many people at
[normal] the severe end of the spectrum receive no NHS care at all – a situation that is clearly inconsistent with the NICE guideline
[normal] on ME/CFS
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.2
[normal] 
[normal]The APPG report concluded:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specialist referral services must ensure that high priority is given to the needs of the severely affected, especially in relation to domiciliary services and in patient facilities for assessment and management
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12[bold] [bold]The NICE guideline on ME/CFS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]12
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]The current 
[normal](2007) 
[normal]NICE guideline for the management of ME/CFS has been heavily criticized by people with ME/CFS
[normal], and the charities,
[normal] 
[normal]on the grounds that it places far too much emphasis on the use of two 
[normal]behavioural
[normal] interventions – graded exercise therapy
[normal] (GET)
[normal] 
[normal]and cognitive 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] therapy (CBT) 
[normal]– that are 
[normal]consistently 
[normal]found to be either ineffective or even harmful by a significant proportion of people with ME/CFS. 
[normal]In addition, NICE has failed to recognize the fact that repeated surveys of patient opinion, including the one in the CMO report, have concluded that the most effective and safe form of activity management is a process known as pacing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]Surveys carried out by the ME/CFS support charities have repeatedly confirmed a high degree of dissatisfaction with the way in which the NHS is 
[normal]almost indiscriminately
[normal] 
[normal]recommending these two treatments
[normal] to people with mild or moderate ME/CFS
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]The largest and most recently reported survey carried out by the MEA
[normal] (R8
[normal])
[normal], which involved over 4,000 respondents, found that in relation to CBT
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]997 respondents
[normal])
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8% were ‘greatly improved’
[normal]23.1% were ‘improved
[normal]54.6% were ‘no change’
[normal]11.6% were ‘slightly worse’
[normal]7.9% were ‘much worse’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal].
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n relation to GET
[normal] (906 respondents)
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4% were ‘greatly improved’
[normal]18.7% were ‘improved’
[normal]21.4% were ‘no change’
[normal]23.
[normal]4% were ‘slightly worse’
[normal]33.
[normal]1% were ‘much worse’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal].
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n relation to pacing (2137 respondents):
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.6% were ‘greatly impro
[normal]ved’
[normal]59.6% were ‘improved’
[normal]24.1% were ‘no change’
[normal]3.5% were ‘slightly worse’
[normal]1.2% were ‘much worse’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.6
[normal] 
[normal]The NICE guideline also downgrades most aspects of 
[normal]the 
[normal]pragmatic management of key symptoms on the basis that there is an inadequate evidence based guidance of guideline production.
[normal] 
[normal]This is not the position taken by the 2002 CMO Report into ME/CFS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal].
[normal]7
[normal] 
[normal]The MEA does not therefore believe that the NICE guideline is fit for purpose and we are very disappointed to learn that a proper review of this guideline with stakeholder input that was planned for 2013 appears to have been cancelled and 
[normal]will now 
[normal]replaced by some form of brief internal review. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13[bold] [bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]In summary, there are a number of issues rela
[normal]ting to the management of ME/CFS
[normal] that are not being addressed
[normal] by all those who should be taking action
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Most of these is
[normal]sues have already been referred to
[normal] in reports to government – including the 2002 Chief Medical Officer’s Report and the 2
[normal]010 report from the APPG on ME o
[normal]n NHS Service Provision.
[normal] 
[normal]Sadly, there has been a distinct lack of action on behalf of 
[normal]all those responsible
[normal] to address these concerns.
[normal] 
[normal]This is clearly unacceptable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]Action therefore needs to be taken in the following areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]An epidemiological study to establish the number of people – adults and children -
[normal] 
[normal]with ME/CFS
[normal], along with the degree of severity.
[normal] 
[normal]This will enable Clinical Commissioning Groups to plan an appropriate
[normal] local
[normal] level of service provision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]Al
[normal]l health professionals should receive
[normal] a proper period of medical education on the diagnosis and management
[normal] of ME/CFS during their 
[normal]training
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]ME/CFS should also form part of continual professional development/education
[normal] at a postgraduate level
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]Early and accurate diagnosis
[normal] in primary care
[normal], along with appropriate early management,
[normal] to reduce the chance of a more severe and prolonged illness occurring
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]6 
[normal]An end to the postcode lottery of NHS referral services
[normal] – everyone with ME/CFS, adults and children
[normal], severely affected, should 
[normal]have access to a local hospital where 
[normal]physician-led 
[normal]specialist
[normal] 
[normal]input on diagnosis and management can be obtained, where appropriate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]7 
[normal]Physicia
[normal]n
[normal]-
[normal]led multidisciplinary
[normal] management 
[normal]programmes
[normal] should be introduced which
[normal] recognize that treatment has to be tailored to individual needs based on stage, severity and symptoms 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ME Association would be very willing to give oral evidence to any of the hearings that the Health Committee intends to arran
[normal]ge on this very important topic
[normal].
