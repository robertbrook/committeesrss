"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Residential Landlords’ Association &#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Residential Landlords Associatio\nn (RLA) is the premier national\n \nlandlords association\n operating in Engl\nand and Wales. We have some 14,5\n00 subscribers repres\nenting a membership of around 17\n,000. Our members own o\nr control over 2\n50\n,\n0\n00 units of accommodation. Primarily our members are landlords in their own right but a number are managing and letting agents, some of whom are also landlords. Our members operate in all sub-sectors of the Private Rented Sector (PRS). Properties are rente\nd out to families, working people, young professionals, the elderly, students and benefit customers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summary, o\nur concerns about the new arrangements \nrelating to Universal Credit are as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe look at some of the issues further below.\n&#xa0;\n2.2. \nIn the longer term\n:\n&#xa0;\na. There needs to be wider, longer term view of the place of \nhousing benefits;\n&#xa0;\nb. It is \nvital to retain the involvement of private landlords in housing provision to benefit claimants\n,\n par\nticularly the low paid in work;\n&#xa0;\nc. \nBreaking the link between benefit rates and\n market rents is a key concern;\n&#xa0;\nd. \nHousing conditions will deteriorate if \nbenefit leve\nls do not reflect market rents; and,\n&#xa0;\ne. \nIncreasing housing supply is vital. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe introduction of Universal Credit\n, particularly around housing costs\n is of particular concern\n to our members as a significant\n number \nlet their\n properties to tenants in receipt of benefits\n. Some operate by choice in this subsector of the market\n or because circumstances dictate this\n. Others become involved because their tenants suffer a change of circumstances, particularly unemployment, which means that they have to claim welfare benefits. \nThis latter group are \ninvoluntary landlords of benefit cust\nomers.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConcerns are not just about\n Universal Credit. The welfare changes which are now in place threaten the provision of housing in the private rented sector to the less well off.  These will be carried throug\nh into Universal Credit.  This I\nnquiry provides the opportunity to take a longer\n term view. Paying down the deficit is important but as the economy improves longer term decisions are needed about ways in which the private rented sector will play its increasingly important role in housing the less we\nll off.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur concerns\n around Univers\nal Credit\n fall under \nfive\n \nkey themes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.4. \n              \nWe\n acknowledge that the government has listened to stakeholders like ourselves; there are further issues to be addressed as outlined above. T\nhe RLA agree that the objective of helping tenants manage their financial affairs is a laudable \none.  However, this c\nomes at considerable risk.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need for clear communication between DWP, landlords and Local Authorities&#xa0;4.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nL\nast year the RLA and \nthe Scottish Association of Landlords (\nSAL\n)\n conducted a survey of member\ns to assess attitudes towards Universal Credit. Between 22\nnd\n October and 5\nth\n November 2012, 1,023 landlords from across the UK took part in the survey.  Results showed that 65.2 per cent of respondents do not support the Government’s plans for universal credit\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would urge the Government to be open in their communication with \nprivate landlords regarding Universal Credit to offer reassurance\n to attempt to change this negative perception\n.  With the demand for social housing at an all-time high\n,\n benefit customers are increasingly being encouraged to look to the Private rented sect\nor for an alternative to council or hous\ning association accommodation.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe needs, worries and views of \nLandlords must be considered\n by DWP\n if\n the housing costs part of\n Universal Credit is to \nbe successful. If \nl\nandlords decide that they will not support th\ne welfare changes the \nless well-off \ntenants will suffer due to a lack of housing options available to them. \nThis will simply put more pressure on an already\n over stretched housing supply.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLandlords\n must feel supported through this \ntransition of \nbudgeting \nresponsibility being given to the tenant and must feel able to access the help and support that they may need if things don’t work out. At the moment Universal Credit is a major worry for Landlords - the Gove\nrnment cannot ignore this fact and they must pro\nvide a resource that can accommoda\nte for challenges and queries.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe feel that Landlords should be \nable to see how a claim is progressing. \nThe current proposals offer no \nprovision for landlords to c\nheck that a claim has been made and there is no \nnotification system so that landlords know that a c\nlaim for housing costs \nis actually being paid, which could lead to\n further\n apprehension in the sector.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.    Lack of clarity around the ‘guidance’ that will replace regulation&#xa0;4.2.1. \nThe RLA will o\nbvio\nusly strive to support its\n members through this \nperiod of transition\n \nbut \nthe RLA\n,\n \nand othe\nr l\nandlord\n \ntrade \nassociations\n,\n can only do this w\nith clear guidelines.  This will present a challenge as \nthe existing system of regulations \nbegins\n to disappear.  Decisions as to \nhow \npayment will be made\n will be based\n individually on a case-by-\ncase basis \naccording to guidance\n.  \nIf Landlords cannot access information about progress of claims then they will not be willing to take claimants on as tenant\ns in the first place.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.2. \nWe feel that too much \ndepend\ns\n on how efficient\nly\n \nDWP administers the new system. \nLandlords may have to wait longer for payment with increased risk of d\nefault. \nThe greater interval between payments, however, poses r\nisks. \nIt is not at all clear \nhow advance payments will work.\n&#xa0;4.2.3. \nAnother concern for the RLA and its members is the \nhuge risk\n that comes with having\n a\n new\n \nscheme heavily dependent on as yet untried computer systems. \n Given that the intention is for \nthe \nUnive\nrsal Credit system to \nbe digital when possible \nthis is understandably leaving us wondering how this\n will all work out in practice.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.4. \nWe feel that until these uncertainties are addressed by government and tangible guidance is offered around housing co\nsts and payment of rent within \nUniversal Credit, l\nandlords will continue to be wary of the welfare changes. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.    Lack of protection for landlord’s interests and financial stability&#xa0;\n4.3.1. \nWe feel that there is a common misconception that Landlords in the private rented sector are profiteering from housing benefit. \nThis \nis not the case. According to DCLG's most recent Landlord Survey from 2010\n, \n79 per cent\n of all landlords earned less than a\n quarter of their income from letting properties in the private rented sector with 2\n1 per cent\n of all landlords earning no income at all.\n We therefore feel it unfair that under the new proposals there are no means of redress for landlords if things go wro\nng or no rights of appeal\n as\n potentially \nl\nandlords could be left worse off than under the current system\n.  \nWe feel that the need for security of income on the landlord’s part\n is still an issue on which private landlords at large require reassurance\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.2\n. \nImportant\nly, for the PRS the Government is pursuing a policy of using Universal Credit\n to improve financial responsibility and financial ma\nnagement skills on the part of c\nlaimants.  Whilst we feel that this is a worthwhile exercise in all other parts of \na claimant’s life, a home is the one thing that needs to be stable for the individual to prosper.  Simulating a monthly salary to benefits claimant\ns is a risky strategy when a significant number \nwill have bee\nn used to weekly rent payments. \n \nCurrently, p\nayment of different benefits at different times of the month also helps these tenants to budget. \n The long wait between payments and inexperience of money management with benefit claimants could have serious implications on bot\nh the landlord and the tenant\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.3. \nIt is not fair to expect that a private landlord will \nbe able to absorb the cost and risk of mounting rent arrears compared with a large social landlord as many simply do not operate on that scale or have resources as back up when things go wrong\n. \nMost importantly, they do not have any public subsidy for providing housing for those tenants who would normally rent with a social landlord. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.4. \nWe appreciate that the intention is that those who cannot manage their own financial affairs or are unl\nikely to pay rent should be identified as being vulnerable at\n the outset and arrangements will t\nhen\n be\n made which can include direct payment to the landlord.  \nThe\n system of vulnerability should be assessed according to the tenant’s interest of keeping a ro\nof over their head and the landlord’s interest to receive the money, as well as the public interest of making sure that the benefit is u\nsed for its intended purpose. We do question how robust these mechanics currently are.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.    The greater risk of increasing rent arrears and homelessness overall&#xa0;4.4.1. \nThe\n introduction of the Local Housing Allowance and the resulting switch to paying benefit to the tenant instead of direct to the landlord has already had profound implications and landlords have reported increasing problems with arrears.  This ca\nn only get w\norse when Universal Credit is rolled out nationally and we would urge the government to listen to the concerns of our members. \nWe remain strongly of the view that\n the tenant should be offered the choice to receive their housing cots directly or for them to\n be paid directly to the landlord.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.    Monthly payments&#xa0;\n4.5.1. \nWe have concerns for tenants who could face budgetary challenges as all of their benefit payments are \ncombined into one monthly sum\n. The long wait between payments and inexperience of \nmoney management could have serious implications on both the landlord and the tenant.   This could lead to the tenant not allocating and saving enough money to pay the rent and getting into debt and rent arrears.  It is essential therefore that the local s\nervice framework which is intended to provide budgetary support for claimants is designed with the private sector in mind not just the social sector.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.    Emphasis on the social sector&#xa0;\n4.6.1. \nWe also feel that there is a lot of emphasis on ensuring that the social sector is prepared for the changes that will come with Universal Credit and how they will support their vulnerable tenants. This sector has the support \nlocal authorities\n to ensure tha\nt they are delivering the programme as a partnership.  \nThe private rented sector must\n be incorporated into these local delivery partnerships\n effectively\n to prevent landlords from feeling disengaged.  \nPrivate landlords\n are very much a part of the local prov\nision of housing for the most vulnerable at a time when demand for social housing is high an\nd supply low. T\no lose their support in the long term would have detrimental consequences on vulnerable tenants.  A consistent approach a\ncross all authorities is nee\nded –\n not a postcode lottery.\n&#xa0;\n5.       Recommendations around Universal Credit&#xa0;\n5.1.    \nWe would like to recommend the fo\nllowing to the \nIn\nquiry:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.       The longer term effects of Welfare Reforms &#xa0;6.1.    \nWe feel that the welfare changes provide an opportunity to take a wider view on housing supply and ways to ensure that landlords\n in the private rented sector remain willing to continue to provide housing to benefit claimants who are out of work \nor in work but on a low income.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.    \nIn terms of the amount of housing costs payable we recognise that the transfer of LHA into Univers\nal Credit is relatively seamless with no changes being made to how the rates\n are calculated. \nHowever, we are concerned that by no longer linking local housing allowance rates to market rents there\n are two key wider implications:\n \n&#xa0;\na. \nThose private landlord\ns who only rent their properties to benefit claimants because of demand for low rent housing in their areas will not feel there is any incentive to\n continue to invest if the rates\n d\no not rise with market rates. \nThis will then add to the already shortage of\n affordable rental accommodatio\nn in the private rented sector.\n&#xa0;\nb. \nHousing conditions will be compromised if landlords are not able to increase rent in line with other market rents and in a climate where the cost of living is rising\n. This will affect the way \nlandlords maintain and repair their properties if they do not have the mone\ny to spend on their properties.\n&#xa0;\n6.3.    \nWe feel that the longer term willingness of private landlords to continue to rent to benefit claimants will be co\nmpromised as rents move away from market\n rents. We perceive the fixed one per cent\n maximum rise in rates for 2013/14 and 2014/15 as well as the Government\n’\ns previous policy of\n linking rises in rates to the Consumer P\nr\nices I\nndex to be a major threat so far as sufficient provision of accommodation to claimants is concerned.  In many areas landlords are able to \nswitch to non-benefit claimants;\n this is something that we have repeatedly warned of and we can back this up by our re\ncent survey findings. \n&#xa0;\n6.4.    \nThis must be looked at in the wider context of housing supply. This is particularly true in L\nondon and other hotspots.  The G\novernment contend\ns that it is, \nin effect\n,\n a large purchaser who can use reductions in rates to infl\nue\nnce the market. W\ne question this assertion\n,\n but\n,\n even if it is correct\n,\n it will not work in those areas where the landlord is able to let to a non-benefit claimant.  A far better way is to improve supply which will then let the market restrain rents. \n&#xa0;\n6\n.5.     \nA key function of housing benefit must be support those\n working on low wages. As Beverid\nge pointed out\n,\n it is essential that rates of housing benefit reflect local rental market conditions.  If you are on low wages and you do not get this extra sup\nport what is the\n point in working at all?\n&#xa0;\n7.       Conclusion &#xa0;7.1. \n   \nBoth\n the welfare reforms and the introduction of Universal Credit come with considerable risks. \nThere is likely to be\n be a much higher level of arrears, an unwillingness of landlords \nto house benefit claimants (at a time when there is huge pressure on social housing), increased unwillingness by banks to lend for this kind of property (or increased interest rate\ns\n to reflect the risk), much higher levels of evictions and much greater hom\nelessness.\n&#xa0;\n7.2.    \nWe recognise\n that this is an evolving system\n.\n \nWhat we do ask is that the C\nommittee an\nd the G\novernment do not forget the risk that\n private\n landlords will be taking once Universal Credit is rolled out\n more widely and offer a workable system which encourages these landlords to participate in this important subsector of the housing market.\n&#xa0;\n7.3.    \nMore widely\n,\n th\ne government needs to recognise the long term necessity of providing less well-off tenants w\nith sufficient support for their housing costs in light of increasing pressures on incomes. Supply side reforms are vita\nl.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Appendix I: RLA case study &#xa0;A member of th\ne RLA recently appealed to his L\nocal\n Authority \nafter he was owed a\n considerable amount of money from hi\ns tenants in rent arrears.  The\n landlord has\n \nover 50 tenants\n&#xa0;\nand works wi\nth several \nlandlord\ns and associations. Since November 2012\n he has personally lost over £3\n,500 in\n rent owed to him\n, from tenants claiming housing b\nenefit:\n \n&#xa0;\nTenant ‘A’A\n&#xa0;\nmother of t\nhree children, the tenant constantly falls\n into arrears with her\n rent\n.\n The landlord \nha\ns\n taken a loss on the arrears as\n&#xa0;\nit is extremely difficult to get the rent arrears back from the tenant.  \nAt one stage, \nt\nhe tenant \nwas \nassisted by her mother in opening a bank \naccount for the rent to be paid into\n. Unfortunately, this did not resolve the situation and \nthe temptation \nof having large amounts of housing benefit provided to her directly \nwas too great\n and she lapsed into arrear\ns once again, and reluctantly the landlord is now having to consider evicting her.\n&#xa0;\nTenant ‘B’ This tenant was \npreviously penniless and homeless\n.  \nThe landlord accepted him as a tenant with his mother acting as a guarantor and controlling his rent payments and other household bills. Within a year \nt\nhe tenant requested \nthe \nLocal Authority to \npay hi\ns housing benefit directly to him. \nHis mother repeatedl\ny asked \nthe Local Authority not to allow this, but her requests were rejected. The landlord has now not been paid any rent since November 2012 and has instigated the eviction process.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTenant ‘C’ This tenant fell into arrears as a consequence of having rent paid directly into his bank account. In addition, as recovering alcoholic, the temptation of the rent money being paid into his bank account proved too great and he subsequently suffered a relap\nse and is now drinking heavily once more. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Appendix II: RLA/SAL Universal Credit Survey 2012&#xa0;\nLast year the RLA and the Scottish Association of Landlords (SAL) conducted a survey of members to assess attitudes towards Universal Credit.
