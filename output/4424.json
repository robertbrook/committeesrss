"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nJolyon\n Western\n (CYS0097)\nCYCLING SAFETY\n – Changing \nrule  163\n of the Highway code.\nAs more cyclists venture onto the road drivers unused to sharing the road with \nbicycles  frequently\n  treat  cyclists as they would other cars passing within close proximity often at speed.\nCurrently “Rule 163 of the Highway Code adds that a driver should give cyclists ‘at least as much room’ as you would a car,”\n \nThis is far too vague and subjective \n.It\n \nignores \n completely\n \nthe inherent difference in the risk involved in passing a four wheele\nd vehicle in which the driver is enclosed in the vehicle\n and that in passing  a two wheeled vehicle which is subject to wind or road surface  irregularities that can deflect the path of the rider.\nNew drivers and indeed current drivers need to be given \nuna\nmbiguous  directions\n on what a genuinely safe distance to allow is. \nIn other \ncountries ,\n Germany &amp; Spain  for example there is a clearly stated 1.5 metre passing standard written into law.  Other areas have mandated minimum 3 ft limit \nyet  the\n UK apparent\nly has nothing beyond the bland statement &amp; potentially misleading advice in rule 163.\nChanging this to a specific distance and ensuring that \ndrivers ,new\n and old  become aware of this is a crucial  step in creating a safer environment on our roads for cyc\nles and for car drivers.\nObviously  this\n is in the interests of cyclists but  there will be many well-intentioned but  ill-informed  drivers who armed with this awareness may  as a result  not experience the trauma of being involved in what are frequently \nserious or deadly bicycle car collisions.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
