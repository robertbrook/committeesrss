[[[Written evidence submitted by Kudos [FBB0068]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I write in reply to the invitation for written submissions to the Future of the BBC inquiry and committee hearings ahead of the Corporation’s forthcoming Royal Charter. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I write as Chief Operating Officer of Kudos, one of the leading television and film production companies in the UK specialising solely in scripted content. We produce drama and comedy for all the main UK networks and work with other broadcasters in Europe and the US including Canal Plus and HBO.  Recent programmes have included Utopia (Channel 4), The Tunnel (Sky Atlantic), The Hour (BBC) and Broadchurch (ITV) our previous credits includes Spooks, Hustle, Life on Mars (BBC). &#xa0;We are actively involved with PACT and a key member of the Television coalition group working with HMRC on the introduction of the high-end television tax credit. From this we have gained a ‘hands on’ understanding of the domestic and global marketplace for drama, the role that BBC plays in it and I draw the following insights from this experience.&#xa0;Firstly, some current market considerations.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
