defaultLCICG fills a gap for co-ordination of fundi

default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA strong, stable and long-term carbon price would provide an efficient long-term signal across the economy for investment in low-carbon innovation
default, leading to the achievement of carbon targets at lea
defaultst cost
default. However, this economically efficient outcome is in practice not achievable, because a) the long-term credibility of such a carbon price is very difficult—if not impossible—to achieve, since current parliaments cannot bind the hands of future legis
defaultlators
default, legally binding targets notwithstanding
default; b) an international carbon price would be required to embed this price signal throughout all products and services, and c) there are many market and system failures within innovation systems that 
defaultprevent eff
defaulticient
default responses to price signals, and which may block low-carbon innovation even where it is economically rational. 
defaultEffective innovation policy must engage with that complex reality. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government
default’
defaults active approach to innovation policy
default, set out in the 
defaultBIS 
defaultInnovation and Research Strategy for Growth 
defaultis therefore very 
defaultwelcome
default, as it recognises the complexity of innovation and innovation policy
default. The recent development of industrial strategies in particular represents a 
defaultsensible 
defaultpragmatic break from years o
defaultf polarised debate between ‘laissez faire’ and ‘picking winners’; it recognises that government is an inevitable player within the innovation system, and that intelligent strategic engagement and support is the best approach. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, there are a number 
defaultof shortcomings to the 
defaultgovernment’s 
defaultapproach
default to low carbon innovation
default. 
defaultIn particular, o
defaultverall public funding for energy 
defaultRD&amp;D 
defaultremains low compared to many competitors. There is a case for increasing the overall level of funding support. In particular, there
default is a case for providing more long-term forms of finance
default. 
defaultThe UK 
defaultlow-carbon sector 
defaultdoes relatively well at attracting venture capital, second only to the US among major economies in terms of clean energy VC per unit GDP
default (according to data from Bloomberg Ne
defaultw Energy Finance)
default; but there is a dearth of longer-term supporting finance for em
defaulterging low-carbon technologies.
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is also a problem with strategic co-ordination. 
defaultThe failure to join up 
defaultlow carbon R&amp;D 
defaultpolicy and deployment policy with sufficient credi
defaultbility is undermining the UK’s ability to 
defaultattract investment in manufacturing 
defaultand R&amp;D 
defaultcapacity for key technologies, such as offshore wind. 
defaultThe continued uncertainty over mid-term carbon targets (particularly in the power sector) and renewable energy commi
defaulttments will raise costs of ultimately meeting targets, and will reduce the chance of the UK benefitting from the associated manufacturing and export opportunities. 
defaultPart of the problem is the political challenge of achieving alignment on key issues around d
defaultecarbonisation policy. But a second part of the problem is the lack of a strategic co-ordination mechanism for low-carbon innovation. LCICG, while a welcome development, has not been designed for an overall strategic co-ordination mission, nor has it been 
defaultresourced to meet such a mission. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a lack of clarity about how government has chosen its priority areas
default, and in particular how LCICG has chosen 
defaulttarget technology areas
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultParticularly striking is the absence of both aviation and automotive technologies 
defaultfrom the LCICG list of target technologies 
default(with the exception of hydrogen, for which a TINA is yet to be 
defaultreleased). Aviation and automotive sectors both receive innovation support from government, and have well-developed industrial strategies. Recent evidence presented to UCL’s Green Economy Policy Commission
default (to be published in early 2014)
default also suggests that
default the UK has a weaker performance in low-carbon innovation in these two sectors (as measured by patents), than other major economies. Furthermore, the Committee on Climate Change
default highlighted both aviation and electric vehicle technologies as priority techn
defaultology areas. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMoreover
default, low-carbon innovation should not only address energy technologies. A
default broader low-carbon perspective might include agricultural technologies and techniques, and land-u
defaultse management, for example. 
defaultSimilarly, it might move beyond techn
defaultologies to support low-carbon 
defaultbusiness models. 
defaultKey carbon-intensive sectors may be better ways of structuring government strategy around low carbon innovation needs
default and opportunities. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe TINA process has been valuable in highlighting the innovation pote
defaultntial of a small number of key technologies
default and technology areas
default.
default It is to be hoped that the process can expand its view of technology areas of relevance, including those that are less well represented in systems modelling tools (either because they are le
defaultss mature, or because there is disagreement about technology cost estimates). Potentially important options excluded from the current set of TINAS include some that are technically achievable, but which would raise significant governance challenges (e.g. H
default2
default in gas networks), and those that are longer term and more speculative (tethered high-altitude wind turbines; direct photocatalysis; various energy harvesting technologies). 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLCICG has been an important development in enabling government to co-ordinate 
defaultR&amp;D spending on low-carbon technologies
default. However, 
defaultLCICG 
defaultdoes not meet t
defaulthe need for strategic co-ordination of low-carbon innovation policy identified by the CCC and others. LCICG’s remit is narrow, focused on improving the co-ordination of 
defaultpublic spending
default on 
defaulttechnologies
default. 
defaultThis had been missing, and LCICG has been useful in ov
defaultercoming that lack. 
defaultHowever, this focus on spending on technologies is only one part of innovation policy, which requires management and co-ordination not only of government-funded R&amp;D programmes, but also of the demand-side and enabling activities.  
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA g
defaultrouping that could co-ordinate and strategically develop low-carbon innovation policy might be expected to also have representation from
default, for example,
default the Government Procurement Service (given evidence that well-designed public procurement policies can sti
defaultmulate ‘mission-driven’ innovation) and from the Green Investment Bank. Similarly
default, it seems unfortunate that the LCICG does not explicitly aim to co-ordinate R&amp;D funding with efforts to remove market or regulatory barriers to low-carbon technologies, or ef
defaultforts to stimulate markets for low-carbon technologies, such as the various subsidy schemes
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLCICG is not particularly well-resourced, and it faces
default challenges in achieving buy-in from across member organisations
default. Both of these factors
default are key limitations 
defaulton its ability to have a significant 
defaultpositive 
defaultinfluence
default, even within its current narrow remit
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn short, LCICG has been a positive addition to reduce the lack of co-ordination across low carbon R&amp;D funding agencies. However, there remains 
defaulta l
defaultack of 
defaulta 
defaultcle
defaultar champion for low-carbon innovation. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUltimately, the value for money of funding low-carbon technology R&amp;D will depend on how well the government is able foster an innovation system that effectively develops 
defaultand deploys
default low carbon technologies. Focusin
defaultg only on the achievement of technology development from a technology-push perspective will 
defaultgenerate limited results 
defaultif the efforts are not aligned with 
defaultcredible
default long-term energy and carbon policy. 
default&#xa0;

defaulthere does not appear to be significant effort from LCICG to link to, or co-ordinate with, the European level, which is a major source of funding for low-carbon R&amp;D.
