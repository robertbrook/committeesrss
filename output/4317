[normal]The UK Food Group welcomes the opportunity to make 
[normal]this
[normal] submission to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Com
[normal]mons Select Committee’s (EFRA) 
[normal]i
[normal]nquiry on ‘food security’. 
[normal]The UK Food Group is the main network of NGOs in the UK working on global food, agriculture and hunger issues, including development, environment, farmer, consumer and academic groups.

[normal]This submission is structured according to
[normal] 
[normal]questions posed in the inquiry
[normal]’s terms of reference
[normal]. It
[normal] cover
[normal]s the first four of the
[normal]se
[normal] questions
[normal], with 
[normal]some of the issues 
[normal]raised in
[normal] the second set of four questions dealt with

[normal]The impact of UK domest
[normal]ic food security policies and practices on international food security policies and practices, and vice versa, 
[normal]is
[normal] of critical importance
[normal] to securing future food
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] food system characterised by an
[normal] industrial model of agriculture
[normal], a global market in which a 
[normal]few companies hold concentrated market power
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]long unaccountable
[normal] supply chain
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]is vulnerable to shocks
[normal], damages the environment and
[normal] can seriously reduce
[normal] the capacity of
[normal] food 
[normal]producers
[normal],
[normal] especially small-scale
[normal] producers, to 
[normal]provide healthy and delicious 
[normal]food and achieve the right to food
[normal].

[normal]GM crops have not provided yield improvements
[normal] and
[normal] do not provide any nutritional advantage that cannot better be realised
[normal] through
[normal] biodiverse food production. 
[normal]They are promoted as a result of proprietary interests

[normal]iodiverse and ecological 
[normal]approaches
[normal] of small-scale food providers
[normal], 
[normal]adapted to local circumstances and control
[normal]led democratically

[normal] offers the potential for a

[normal]fairer food syste

[normal]It would also

[normal]ld Food Security (CF
[normal]S)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the UK 
[normal]could strive to be more inclusive in its normative processes
[normal] relating to food provision. It could invite
[normal] r
[normal]epresentatives of small-scale food producers
[normal] networks, particularly those linked with La Ví
[normal]a Campesina, the international peasant movement,
[normal] 
[normal]to participate 
[normal]in UK decision making forums

[normal]National food security in the UK, as well as European food security can only be secured by achieving global food securit
[normal]y. 
[normal]Food security
[normal] should be measured in terms of
[normal] availability
[normal],
[normal] affordability
[normal], nutritional value
[normal] and 
[normal]the resilience and 
[normal]sustainability 
[normal]of these three over time
[normal]. 
[normal]Governments, including the UK’s, have a legal obligation
[normal] in the Right to Food
[normal] to 
[normal]progressively 
[normal]reach a point where food security
[normal] for all
[normal] is achieved. 
[normal]This includes ‘extraterritorial obligations’ to be aware of any impact of the UK’s national policies elsewhere in the world and to take action to prevent them causing any damage.

[normal]Policy approaches for 
[normal]achieving th
[normal]e Right to Food
[normal]. Global networks
[normal] and social movements of small-scale food producers, including farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk and indigenous people, have defined their own 
[normal]policy 
[normal]vision for the food system 
[normal]as
[normal] the framework of food sovereign
[normal]ty:
[normal]10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts the aspirations and needs of tho
[normal]se who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations.”
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The world already produces enough food to be able to feed everybody.
[normal] It is over a decade since the then UN Special 
[normal]Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Jean Ziegler, noted that the world already produced enough food to feed 12 billion people,
[normal] and food production has increased since then.
[normal] The problem is access to food and the means for its production.
[normal] Increasing productio
[normal]n, per se, will not alter levels of hunger, if those who are food insecure or are malnourished continue to be unable to afford adequate nutritious food: reducing poverty is the most effective way to improve food security. 
[normal]One aspect of this is policies to 
[normal]support the ability of 
[normal]small-scale farmers, in the UK as well as elsewhere in the world, to make decent living.
[normal]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support for biodiverse small
[normal]-
[normal]scale and ecological producers is vital for UK and EU food security because genetic diversity is critical for resil
[normal]ience to pests and other challenges which are likely to get worse with climate change. The Irish potato famine was caused by Ireland’s dependence on very few varieties of potato – making the crop very susceptible to disease. 
[normal]Indigenous and local plant vari
[normal]eties
[normal] in the field continue to evolve and adapt to environmental change unlike those in gene banks, making them more resilient. Thus, centres of genetic diversity
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]such as potatoes in the Andes,
[normal] are important for the UK and EU’s food security and economy.
[normal]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Two 
[normal]UK and EU 
[normal]policies that have damaging effects on food security are:
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]biofuels subsidies, which promote 
[normal]production of non-food commodities and undermine
[normal] food provision
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]restrictive measures and technologies that reduce Farmers’ Rights to sow, use, exc
[normal]hange and sell their seeds
[normal]Some further drivers of food insecurity are discussed in more detail below.
[normal]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The majority of agricultural resources are not currently used to feed people, but instead are either used for animal feed, 
[normal]agrofuels and other industrial commodities, or produce foods that are wasted. A redirection of these resources towards producing food for direct human consumption, in ways that are socially and environmentally sustainable would secure future food provision
[normal] both in the UK and internationally
[normal]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Modern intensive a
[normal]griculture faces many environmental problems – soil degradation and erosion, water pollution and excess demand for irrigation, loss of agricultural biodiversity. In addition it faces social problems – l
[normal]oss of rural jobs and livelihoods and undermining of local 
[normal]and traditional knowledge of ecosystem management
[normal], sustainable agriculture and genetic resources for food and agriculture
[normal]. 
[normal]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In response to these food, equity and e
[normal]nvironmental challenges, the UN/
[normal]World Bank-sponsored International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) recommended that:
[normal]“An increase and strengthening of AKST [agricultural knowledge, science and technology] towards agroecological scienc
[normal]es will contribute to addressing environmental issues while maintaining and increasing productivity
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Agroecology is explained by UN Special Rapporteur 
[normal]on
[normal] the Right to Food, Olivier De Schutter as follows:
[normal]“Agroecology is both a science and a set of pract
[normal]ices. It was created by the convergence of two scientific disciplines: agronomy and ecology. As a science, agroecology is the “application of ecological science to the study, design and management 
[normal]of sustainable agroecosystems.
[normal]” 
[normal]As a set of agricultural pr
[normal]actices, agroecology seeks ways to enhance agricultural systems by mimicking natural processes, thus creating beneficial biological interactions and synergies among the components of the agroecosystem. It provides the most favourable soil conditions for pl
[normal]ant growth, particularly by managing organic matter and by raising soil biotic activity. The core principles of agroecology include recycling nutrients and energy on the farm, rather than introducing external inputs; integrating crops and livestock; divers
[normal]ifying species and genetic resources in agroecosystems over time and space; and focusing on interactions and productivity across the agricultural system, rather than focusing on individual species. Agroecology is highly knowledge-intensive, based on techni
[normal]ques that are not delivered top-down but developed on the basis of farmers’ knowledge and experimentation.”
[normal] 
[normal]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Investment and support in strengthening 
[normal]and protecting 
[normal]agroecological farming by small-scale food producers, in the framew
[normal]ork of food sovereignty, has the most potential for supporting livelihoods and rural communities, reducing poverty, 
[normal]ensuring access to food for vulnerable groups, 
[normal]creating resilient food systems, enabling people to have a healthy diet and regenerating the 
[normal]environment. 
[normal]This in turn is important for enhancing peace, stability and prosperity worldwide.
[normal]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK Government, as a member of the CFS, is party to the negotiations for the principles for responsible agricultural investment in the context of food securi
[normal]ty and nutrition
[normal] (
[normal]rai
[normal])
[normal] that are currently underway at the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS)
[normal]. The CFS is
[normal] forum that brings together not only member states but also civil society, the private sector, research networks, other UN bodies and philanthrop
[normal]ic organisations
[normal] and
[normal] is the foremost international platform for work toward the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security and nutrition for everyone. The UK could provide increased support for developing investment principles in the CFS that will bu
[normal]ild on the investments made by small-scale food providers themselves both in the UK and internationally. 
[normal]20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important to recognize the role of food waste in 
[normal]undermining
[normal] food security. Every step of 
[normal]the food chain
[normal] has certain losses or waste 
[normal]associated. 
[normal]A small propo
[normal]r
[normal]tion
[normal] of that waste is unavoidable and intrinsic to the product (e.g. non edible portions of fruit and vegetables), whereas 
[normal]a much larger proportion
[normal] is avoidable and usually related to inefficient systems or market and cultural res
[normal]trictions. 
[normal]Estimates suggest that between one third and one half of global food production is thrown away, wasting not only the food but also all the energy and resources that have gone into producing that food.
[normal] 
[normal]Some of the major culprits of food waste are
[normal] inadequate storage and transport infrastructure, irresponsible consumption (buying more than is needed) and restrictive selection rules (as in the case of fruits that are only accepted by retailers if the fit some predetermined aesthetic characteristics).
[normal] An
[normal]other aspect of food waste that i
[normal]s usually not discussed is the one represented by the inefficiency of feeding human edible crops to animals instead
[normal] of directly to people.
[normal]21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]n eminently sensible
[normal] measure that could both reduce waste and use existing resou
[normal]rces more efficiently has been put forward by the Pig Idea 
[normal]policy campaign
[normal] 
[normal]with their proposal to reintroduce the conversion of food waste into feed for pig production, using approved cooking processes that render it safe for use as feed by killing any 
[normal]pathogens present such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever. DEFRA is encouraged to work with the Pig Idea and BPEX to implement this initiative, already common in other countries such as Japan, South Korea, China and many states in the USA
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This would not only reduce the financial costs of meat production (animal feed costs have gone up markedly over recent years), but also greatly reduce the demand for very large amounts of soya and other crops for animal food, which in turn have enormous s
[normal]ocial and environmental impacts during production and processing – such as
[normal] land dispossessions and conflicts, high levels of
[normal] water and fertiliser use
[normal],
[normal] a
[normal]nd wide-spread forest clearance
[normal] particularly in tropical ar
[normal]eas.
[normal]22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bilateral and international trade 
[normal]agreements can undermine food security. Excluding elements in the agreements and negotiations that impact on food provision is demanded by the social movements of the world’s food providers 
[normal]23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture came into force in 1995,
[normal] unequal powers are distorting food trade, and a few multinational agribusinesses have increased their domination of global input supply, trade and food distribution.
[normal] Conflict between 
[normal]WTO rules and food security have been highlighted at the recent WTO Mini
[normal]sterial in Bali, without resolution other than in a temporary ‘peace clause’.
[normal] There are deep concerns about current EU trade negotiations with the USA and Canada. The possible Trans-Atlantic Trade Agreement risks undermining the UK’s (and EU’s) ability to 
[normal]control its own food system. 
[normal]24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These negotiations should be fully transparent. As the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy has emphasised, 
[normal]“the TTIP negotiations should result in an agreement that prohibits—rather than promotes—efforts by corporation
[normal]s to play off regulatory standards in one jurisdiction against the other. Those dialogues should hold open the possibility that the best avenues for progress could be outside the constraints of trade rules, as happened with the recent U.S.-EU agreement on 
[normal]organic standards. Proposals to broaden the definition of investment to apply to SPS and financial market regulations, making 
[normal]them subject to challenge under investor-state dispute resolution, should be firmly rejected
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The relationship between the price of food and what farmers receive for producing it has become increasingly disconnected. In a trend that started at the end of the last century, most of the money spent on food purcha
[normal]ses goes to non-farmers. It is estimated that UK farmers receive only 9p of every £1 spent on food
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]According to 
[normal]DEFRA’s own figures
[normal], 
[normal]farmers
[normal]’
[normal] income
[normal] 
[normal]fell
[normal] by 1
[normal]3
[normal]% 
[normal]between 2011
[normal] and 
[normal]2012.
[normal] Over this same period, the profits of the big
[normal]gest
[normal] s
[normal]even
[normal] supermarkets 
[normal]rose to £7.6bn
[normal].
[normal] The market power of intermediaries enables them to influence both farm-gate and consumer prices to their benefit.
[normal]26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The relationship between price and production is also affected by:
[normal]27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]global market which links local market prices to factors
[normal] affecting prices in other parts of the world
[normal]28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]link to oil prices through mechanisation, chemical inputs and biofuel production
[normal], which is further complicated by fossil fuel subsidies

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]waste (see above)
[normal]30
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Quality food production, with enhanced incomes for farmers, could be encouraged with incentives for providing ecosystem services and for using agroecological approaches for localised food systems that provide multiple benefits for society. Facilitating dis
[normal]tribution of food through 
[normal]f
[normal]air
[normal] t
[normal]rade and similar mechanisms to protect the prices paid and the working conditions of food producers, would further enhance incomes
[normal]31
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Simultaneously, consumer prices for industrially produced foods could better reflect the true
[normal] costs of production
[normal] and also the costs of treating diet related ill health.
[normal] 
[normal]Methods for
[normal] internalising the externalities of production and consumption 
[normal]include
[normal] differential taxing for products and production systems with high negative impacts on health and 
[normal]the environment, creating a disincentive. 
[normal]T
[normal]he revenue generated
[normal] could be used
[normal] to subsidise foods with positive health and environmental impacts, 
[normal]such as UK-grown fruit and vegetables or
[normal] healthy and sustainable school meals
[normal].
[normal]32
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Locally resilient food systems, incorporating adequate stocks of foods, can mitigate food price volatility. In contrast, the global industrialised commodity regime can exacerbate volatility. It is contro
[normal]lled by a handful of corporations that dominate the development and marketing of inputs (agrochemicals, seed varieties and livestock genetics), commercialisation of products, transport, trade and retail. They may redirect investments towards agrofuels, cel
[normal]lulose production, livestock feed or other commodities as subsidy 
[normal]regimes change and market opportunities arise, affecting prices and volatility in the global supply of crops.
[normal]33
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UK food self-sufficiency has declined rapidly in the past two and
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]half decades
[normal], from almost 80% in 1984 to the current 60%. Even locally produced food in the UK is highly dependent on imports for feed and fertilizer. Food insecurity in the world will impact the UK. The demand for land to produce crops for other uses presents a serio
[normal]us risk to food security and greater vulnerability to shocks. 
[normal]34
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is now generally agreed that the EU biofuels targets and the use of land to produce crops to feed animals, to name a few, affect food prices and 
[normal]availab
[normal]ility. 
[normal]G
[normal]rowing livestock feed for i
[normal]ndu
[normal]strial livestock production, 
[normal]in the service of
[normal] an unhealthy increase in meat and dairy production, has significant impacts on food price volatility and availability.
[normal]35
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Speculation in commodity futures markets is creating volatile price movements that do not 
[normal]reflect true changes in demand and supply. Position limits were used effectively in the US for most of the twentieth century to prevent market manipulation and excessive speculation, and are used on markets in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China 
[normal]and South Africa today. They are transparent and give traders legal certainty. The introduction of position limits could be a reduction in the opportunity cost of excessive speculation, through the diversion of capital into genuine, productive investment. 
[normal]On the issue of liquidity, the argument that position limits, if set too low, could damage liquidity for hedgers is redundant when current levels of financial speculation are so far above historic norms. The UK’s current self-regulatory approach has a trac
[normal]k record of failure and creates conflicts of interest and a regulatory race-to-the-bottom.
[normal] 
[normal]36
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Public procurement of food can be a tool to tackle both increasing levels of food poverty and lack of support for small-scale farmers. 
[normal]For example over the past 15
[normal] years Brazil has shifted 
[normal]public food procurement from an industriali
[normal]s
[normal]ed and centrali
[normal]s
[normal]ed system to a locali
[normal]s
[normal]ed farm system
[normal], improving the quality of school meals while reducing the ecological footprint
[normal].
[normal] The EU Food Links project has developed an action pl
[normal]an for public procurement with environmental, social/health and economic indicators, which could inform UK policy.
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]37
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]GM crops have not provided yield improvements, are 
[normal]mainly developed for industrial commodity production, and facilitate increased concentration of power over agriculture by biotech corporations. They do not provide any nutritional advantage that cannot better be realised through diverse diets provided by b
[normal]iodiverse food production. They have no role in any part of the solution for a sustainable and equitable food system in the UK or elsewhere. With regard to biotechnological research and development, the Precautionary Principle / Approach should prevail.
[normal]38
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ge
[normal]netically modifie
[normal]d
[normal] crops are frequently put forward as an essential tool for securing food supply in the future
[normal].
[normal] However, despite four decades of development GM crops, only two GM traits, herbicide tolerance and insect resistance(Bt), in mainly soya, maiz
[normal]e, oilseed rape and cotton account, for about 99% of the GM crops grown commercially, predominantly used for animal feed , agrofuels and fibre production.
[normal]39
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Herbicide tolerance (HT) and insect resistance (IR) are relative simple traits to genetically enginee
[normal]r because they only code for additional novel proteins within the plant.  These are agronomic traits which produce some short-term savings for farmers until weeds and insects developed resistance to the herbicides and the Bt toxins. There is no evidence th
[normal]at the addition of these GM traits has improved crop yields as compared with non-GM varieties. Indeed a comparison of maize and oilseed rape yield in predominantly GM USA and predominantly non-GM EU showed that the former has lagged behind in terms of annu
[normal]al yield increment since th
[normal]e advent of commercial GM crops.
[normal]40
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Metabolic changes, intended and unintended, in GM crops raise the possibility of harmful changes taking place which require detailed assessment during risk assessments before crops can be approve
[normal]d to enter the food/feed chain. In addition, the direct application of herbicides on GM HT crops will increase exposure to toxic residues in the end food/feed product.
[normal]41
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More complex traits such as genes to produce beta carotene (for instance in Golden Rice)
[normal], drought tolerance, saline tolerance and nitrogen fixation have proved to be much more difficult to develop because they seek to alter the metabolism of crop plants in a way that may have unexpected consequences in other biochemical pathways of the receiv
[normal]ing plants.
[normal]42
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Golden Rice cannot deliver the required amounts of vitamin A to people of a nutrient poor diet. The low levels of fat and oil in diets of poor people will also limit the conversion efficiency into Vitamin A. In the case of GM nitrogen-fixing ce
[normal]reals, little progress has been made over the last three decades. To achieve this objective, both the plant and N fixing bacterium have to be genetically modified to form a symbiotic relationship. It is worth noting that during evolutionary history, grass/
[normal]cereal species have never naturally evolved nitrogen fixing. The reason for this may lie in the high energy requirement for fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere which would divert significant amounts of sugars in cereals away for other functions such as gra
[normal]in formation. The consequence may be lower yield
[normal]s.

[normal]The combination of advance traditional plant breeding techniques (such as marker assisted selection) and using agroecological approaches for the natural re-building of soil f
[normal]ertility using crops rotation
[normal]s,
[normal] N-fixing crops such as clover and beans, crop rotations and efficient cycling of plant nutrients from the waste stream offer a quicker, surer, more efficient and environmentally sounder way forward than GM in protected varieties of crops containing elit
[normal]e genes. Developing diverse varieties and populations, grown in crop/livestock mixed production will improve resilience and sustain yields in all conditions
[normal] as well as
[normal] increas
[normal]ing
[normal] access to the diverse diets needed to prevent the malnutrition 
[normal]which 
[normal]products
[normal] such as Golden Rice are supposed to tackle
[normal]. These methods are included in agroecological approaches to food production.
[normal]44
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A key part of successful agroecological approaches is formed by policies and practices that will sustain agricultural biodiversity. Thi
[normal]s is generated by and underpins agroecological production systems. Agricultural biodiversity comprises the diversity of seeds, plants, livestock breeds and fish and other aquatic organisms used for food and of the associated pollinators, pest predators and
[normal] soil organisms. Agricultural biodiversity is the component of biodiversity that has been developed by and has co-evolved with people, and it underpins the food system and the wider economy, human health, the security of food supplies, and the viability of
[normal] the biosphere. It is therefore essential to regulate, transform or prohibit any systems, methods, processes or technologies, which might damage or restrict agricultural biodiversity 
[normal]and
[normal] its related ecosystem functions. In order to develop agricultural bio
[normal]diversity, priority should be given to in situ conservation and development of domesticated species on-
[normal]farm, on the range and in rivers, ponds and lakes, by small-scale food producers, respecting their Farmers’
[normal] Rights
[normal] and related
[normal] rights
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]45
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As mentioned abo
[normal]ve the IAASTD report recommended strengthening 
[normal]agricultural kn
[normal]owledge, science and technology
[normal] towards agroecological sciences
[normal]. The UK is a signatory to the IAASTD reports. The UK could set an example globally by redirecting its science efforts from providi
[normal]ng research in support of industrial commodity production towards agroecological approaches that support localised food regimes
[normal]46
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is thus an imperative for the UK government to re-direct R&amp;D and UKAid funding towards agroecological research and develop
[normal]ment which is 
[normal]driven by the needs of farmers
[normal] and small scale producers, as expressed by their social movements. Only 1% of public agricultural investment on research is allocated to agro-ecological projects while GM projects receive 15% of the funding
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]D
[normal]espite the rhetoric, the BIS AgriTech strategy will do little to address this imbalance and help realise food security. Instead a swift reversal of 
[normal]the UK 
[normal]government’s research investm
[normal]ents by the BBSRC, and Defra, 
[normal]and DFID’s investment in the CGIAR and oth
[normal]er national, regional and international research activities is required, so that agroecological approaches, developed in the framework of food sovereignty, receive the majority of the funding. 
[normal]47
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly there is a need to ensure that the research outcomes
[normal] can be taken up by farmers through well-funded and well-designed public extension services both in the UK and other regions. The direct involvement of farmers in training other farmers in improved agroecological techniques is a proven means to achieve thi
[normal]s. 
[normal]48
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A series of guiding questions to help determine whether an agricultural system, small-scale or large-scale, contributes to sustainable livelihoods has been outlined by some leading academic thinkers
[normal].
[normal] Responding to tho
[normal]se questions 
[normal]in the
[normal] context of the UK food system c
[normal]ould be a useful exercise for the EFRA committee
[normal].
[normal]49
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Should the EFRA committee require further information on the points raised, the UK Food Group would be pleased to provide this.
