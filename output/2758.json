"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from CTC (TIC 114)\n&#xa0;\nI assist CTC, a National organisation who have been working for improved road conditions for cycling since 1878, as a founding member of the Road Improvement Association, and having an interest on matters involving \ncycling and its interfaces with public transport.  This includes the points where cyclists cross railway and tramway tracks.  These are recognised as having the potential to present a serious hazard, mainly from falling off, when the surface conditions are\n poor.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to the crossing surface conditions CTC also has made regular submissions, through local members, in securing safe and practical arrangements when Network Rail or others propose the closure or modification of a level crossing.  In the pa\nst work with CLT3 at DfT (then DETR) has sought to make sensible assessments of the significant impact of  diversion of footpaths or bridleways in the programme of reducing the number of these crossings for the East Coast Main line enhancements, linked to \nthe electrification programme, through direct provision of grade separated crossings or use of other nearby crossing points.  \n&#xa0;\nThere remains a great concern that the removal of a crossing from the railway delivers a less safe route for pedestrian, horse a\nnd cycle traffic, though use of a busy major road.  Some schemes such as the removal of the public road crossing at Wareham (Dorset) delivered a new bridge which offered a road with no footways and a major diversion out from the housing and shops  on eithe\nr side of the railway to gain access to that road, which as a result had Dorset CC having to sign a long term licence for a pedestrian &amp; cycle crossing (with the British Railways Board) until a second bridge or underpass could be provided.  The demand for \na direct route between the 2 parts of the community near to the station is now conflicting with the increased level of rail services, and because of the crossing arrangements – relying on a chicane with miniature coloured lights to deter pedestrians and cy\nclists from crossing the line.  As a result the crossing has been a hot spot for what is considered to be abuse, of crossing users ignoring the red light and crossing the tracks, often with a train clearly approaching and leaving no margin for any stumblin\ng or hesitation\n&#xa0;\nThere have also been instances where cycle users have been threatened with prosecution by Network Rail and TOC staff, or obstructed from using safely, existing crossings with cycles, as they were permitted to do, when the railway staff hav\ne been ignorant of the status of the crossing (Wareham as an example), or the rail operators have acted apparently without awareness of the extent of traffic and related access issues to make the use of a crossing, or the route imposed as an alternative po\ntentially less safe (Wivenhoe Way, Colchester ; Walnut Grove, Perth).\n&#xa0;\nThere is further an apparent preference by Network Rail to provide overbridges which present a visually intrusive structure, with a requirement for extensive land-take, and often extend\ning the route previously available by 200-300% through the 120 metres of ramp required on each side of bridge, and this we note can increase the likelihood of illicit restoration of the original crossing because of the obvious and severe degradation of the\n level of service offered by the route using the original crossing.  By contrast the provision of an underpass requires around 60 metres of ramp, and this may well be reduced by the fact that the rail lines are often slightly above the surrounding ground. \nand a sloping approach directly along the existing path alignment can be constructed.\n&#xa0;\nWidths are often restricted and bridges and approach ramps are below that appropriate for shared use between the groups with access to the route – cyclists, walkers and \nhorse riders. Some of this may be due to cost of providing a wider bridge or underpass, but for a given span the costs of marginal variations in width are generally small compared to the cost of placing the supports or abutments and putting the span in pla\nce.  Often the local group is faced with challenging specialists brought in to design a specified solution and there is a need to have transparency in making the case for a contentious proposal, or technical support to consider any alternatives put forward\n by local \nusers.  \n&#xa0;\nAn example of this greatly extended route is where the crossing at Tubbs Lane Bicester is being removed through the building of the new chord from the Chiltern main line.  CTC suggested that a route passing under the line would have bee\nn possible with substantially less visual intrusion and overlooking residential properties and a nursery play area, and minimal extension of the distance travelled.  The bridge would also have a potentially higher risk of ice forming in winter.  Lack of re\nsources to make the case for an underpass which would have required careful review of drainage detail against a well resourced project left no option but to have the footbridge, which adds around 200 metres to the distance via the original crossing – this \nshould be taken in the context that most walked journeys are likely to be around 0.5-2 Km at the most and 0.2Km is a significant increase to the distance and time taken.  \n&#xa0;\n CTC notes that the current work by the Law Commission and Law Commission for Scotl\nand, combined with the appropriate application of the ALCRM modelling system for risk may on some route allow for the creation of new level crossings.  We suggest that a formalised access point, especially to remote areas, is preferable to unregulated tres\npassing which is difficult to police effectively.\n&#xa0;\nWe have through our own approaches to Network Rail pressed for a better reporting of surface defects, as these clearly present a greater hazard to the 2-wheeled road user than a 4 wheeled one.  It would ap\npear that when a crossing surface has been improved to deliver better alignment between rails and road surface elements the number of incidents can reduce. A notable example would appear to be Walton Street (Springfield) LC in Hull, where at one stage CTC \nsolicitors (Russell Jones &amp; Walker) had 18 valid claims to be considered for this location.\n&#xa0;\nThe CTC launched the Fillthathole website and has, through linking to Network Rail location data,  been able to identify the Network Rail crossings on public roads\n and divert reports to the Network Rail in place of the roads authority for these locations.  This website usefully monitors reports of defects and reports of repairs, providing a ranking facility to see which roads authority responds fastest to clearing d\nefective roads.  Regrettably several level crossings are reported on more than one occasion as repairs made may only be temporary, or lack the substance of a full rebuilding of a damaged structure.\n&#xa0;\nCyclists appear, from the reports coming in to CTC, to be\n falling more often that reported though official channels. The ORR guidance on reporting rightly places a great importance on reporting when motor vehicles become trapped on a level crossing but appears to consider a cyclist of pedestrian fall less import\nant, although the risk of loss of a road-users life remains.\n&#xa0;\nWe are also concerned that a fallen cyclist or pedestrian may be missed by some currently developed obstruction detection systems, as the low level scanning is reported to be triggering frequent\nly through non-hazardous events, and we understand that consideration is being given to de-sensitising or switching off this equipment where spurious tripping has been regularly disrupting services (Brandon LC)..\n&#xa0;\nReports suggest that there have been some \nfortunate coincidences that have prevented a cyclist from being stranded across train tracks.  When this has happened the reporting of incidents is piecemeal and enquiring about incidents on Network Rail crossings can often reveal that no record has been m\nade on the signallers or incident logs for the route.\n&#xa0;\nAre current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved?&#xa0;\nThere are several types of level crossing which are used by cyclists, and several \nhundred licensed railway operators with the responsibility for the maintenance of these crossings. Indications are that there is a lot to be learned and applied in the delivery of appropriate presentation of the railway to the user of the crossing both in \nthe way that the observation of approaching rail traffic is delivered by the way in which the crossing is approached and use controlled, and the importance of maintaining standards for the crossing surface appropriate to the conditions on the approaches to\n the crossing.  The resources available to Network Rail are we recognise, finite and thus a clear dialogue on how to maintain the levels of service provided by existing crossings, whilst delivering an inherently safe sequence for the approach and preparati\non to cross, and exit on the opposite side.\n&#xa0;\nAbility to get through gates on both sides :  At Scremerston on ECML near Berwick on Tweed, a downgraded public road crossing, now a foot crossing over which cycles can be wheeled.  Two CTC members went to cross\n the railway and found that the gate on the opposite side of the railway was narrower that that they had come on to the railway through.  As a result they were unable to pass smoothly through the second gate and were ’stalled’ for a short period on the liv\ne side of the gate and later realised that they had not been fully clear of the running line in a place of safety as they tried to get their cycles through the second gate.        \n&#xa0;\nPositive positioning of the user : Of the fatal crashes investigated by RA\nIB, every case, had evidence to suggest or confirm that the way that the crossing could be used with the cyclist able to proceed across the line without making a positive action of checking the line in both directions, and no provision to prevent them from\n getting on to the line when a train is approaching.  The ability to hear an approaching train or a siren may have been shut-out by some of the victims, but this position applies equally to those who are deaf.  The Morden Hall Park (Croydon) tram fatality \nreport highlighted the detail that the crossing point had been relocated and it had been possible to cross the line, in such a way that a sequence of looking in both directions required a special effort to turn round and look.  The report recommendations s\naw the crossing approaches altered to ensure a crossing user was forced to face the oncoming trams, as they negotiated the chicanes on their approach to the track .  These fatal crashes have generally been at crossings where there is no gate or the user op\nerates a gate or otherwise gains access to the line without having to take an action to release the gate or check the approach of a train.\n&#xa0;\nRemote Gate Locking : There may be some options to use a GSM phone signal to power a gate release using a mechanical\nly stored energy (eg CISA mortise latch for door entry systems). systems which open for authorised users only (UWC for vehicles) or on demand from a direct push button request, with the release of the locks inhibited when a train is approaching          \n&#xa0;\nRoad signage : From the observations at Three Horseshoes No 3 and Kirton Lane Thorne the condition of the signage, the provision of signage, and the introduction of non standard signage, can be an issue. We have also lost the old general signage for an une\nven crossing which had relevance to cyclists and pedestrian traffic, and now only the grounding of large and low vehicles and the danger from overhead HV wires is covered by TSRGD road signs manual.  There have been some special signs authorised for the No\nttingham Tram scheme which may be appropriate to consider, and a review of level crossing signage relating to pedestrian and cycle traffic is needed.  \n&#xa0;\nThe advisory sign Cyclists Dismount, (Diagram 966) has been incorrectly use on a widespread basis and m\nay create confusion for both cyclists and motor vehicle drivers.  BT Police and railway staff have attempted to prosecute on the basis that this is a prohibition sign, and that the crossing was not open to cyclist riding across neither of which applied. Th\nis has on occasion caused great distress. The use of this sign on a general purpose road, that carriageway of which has to be fit for the use of all carriages, including cycles is spurious.   \n&#xa0;\nThe sign No Cycling, (Diagram 951) which requires a Traffic Re\ngulation Order has been used on level crossings.  The general principle in providing a general purpose road still holds but if a route is unsuitable for certain types of traffic there should be an alternative route provided for that traffic, or the problem\n fixed.  The legal position on Traffic Regulation orders being applied to level crossings and the signage used on roads/highways covered by TSRGD and the signage applied by Network Rail and presumably the Rail Regulator are not clearly set out for pedestri\nan and cycle traffic.                                                                                                                                                       \n&#xa0;\nIn addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?&#xa0;\nThere is a major reluctance from the rail operators to install underpasses, and this can result in ridiculous extensions in the distance travelled or the sheer number of steps required to maintain\n a sensible route across the barrier presented by the rail line. By creating such lengthy diversions the temptation can be for some users to continue to use the at grade crossing.\n&#xa0;\nCTC tried strongly to get underpasses at 2 crossing points for the new Bice\nster chord. on one, an existing crossing we noted the massive increase in the distance being delivered by the proposal for a bridge, but the lack of resources to check and prove a robust case for an underpass which would not have increased the distance tra\nvelled to cross the line, and linked with this the lack of resources to compare the costs for the underpass, and detail – challenging the conventions used in the UK but common in NL and elsewhere*, resulted in this bid being defeated.\n&#xa0;\n*In the Scottish Hig\nhlands culverts are often vastly over-sized for the streams that pass through them as this accommodates the surge flows of melt-water which occur for a relatively short period in the spring.  In an early example the access to the Speyside Railway at Aviemo\nre was generating unwelcome trespass from the public crossing the Highland Main Line.  A concrete ledge was cast in the invert of the culvert passing under the railway close to the car park and Speyside Railway station, and signposted as the route to be us\ned.  A direct crossing was thus provided, which is available for at least 50 weeks per year, and generally only unusable when demand to use it is low.  In other words it will be raining heavily or very wet with the spring snow melt..\n&#xa0;\nIn NL and also in Ger\nmany there are also path crossings under the rail line which share the span with  a water course with the water level above that of the path.\n&#xa0;\nAt the second crossing point, in Bicester a route clearly used by cyclists, but not recorded as such by the local\n council was deemed not to be one which would have any provision of a ramp or even a wheeling ramp on the stepped footbridge proposed. That footbridge is to be constructed from the existing ground level over the top of a railway line on top of an embankmen\nt nearly 3 metres high, resulting in a climb of around 90 steps up and a similar number down, a near guaranteed deterrent to using the path, or bridge.  Our call to put an underpass beneath the rail line before building the embankment (itself a way to main\ntain the path in use whilst the construction work takes place) was turned down.  The Inquiry, taking a strict formal approach refused to recognise the use of the route by cyclists, but incorrectly suggested that it was illegal use the route for cycling.   \n&#xa0;\nHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?&#xa0;\nGiven that much of the damage to level crossing surfaces comes from the speeds and weights of road traffic it may useful to \nconsider whether a contribution from the highways budget is appropriate, especially where the type and volume of traffic has changed, due to a short or long term issues.  A case which exemplifies this is that of 2 crossings on the Wensleydale Railway where\n \nit is crossed twice by the A 684 between Leeming and Bedale.  At both locations (Bedale Station and Aiskew) the crossings get punished by the HGV traffic using this key route from the Yorkshire Dales, and especially during the period of work upgrading the\n A1 at Leeming Bar. Several cyclists have suffered serious injuries, and one died following falls on uneven crossing surfaces with large gaps between crossing panels.  The WRC has had to carry out various remedial works on the crossings to keep them safe b\nut the fact has to be faced that the crossings have been worn out by the road traffic.   \n&#xa0;\nIt is very important to note here that it is not the Network Rail budget which would have a level of contingency funding to deal with urgent repairs but the consider\nably smaller budget of the Wensleydale Railway Company, having to cater for the wear &amp; tear delivered by the road traffic.\n&#xa0;\nFootpath and bridleway crossings, whilst not getting the same traffic loads are more remote, and less visited issues such as surface\n slipperiness, clearance of fallen leaves etc.  The urgency of any call for remedial work has under previous regimes seen slippage, where defects have taken a long time to be fixed, and problems a long time to be resolved.     \n&#xa0;Is Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?&#xa0;\nThe balance of spending and direction of of how that resource is best delivered poses a major challenge, but as highlighted in the preceding answer  \n&#xa0;Is Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?&#xa0;\nNo, the current reporting system does not place a high enough level of importance on incidents involving pedestrians and cycli\nsts, which do not place an large object, such as a motor vehicle on the running lines.\n&#xa0;\nReporting and management of hazards on crossings which are not public roads does not appear to have the same level of concern\n&#xa0;\nWhen a proposal to close a level crossing\n is developed there should be a clear focus on delivery of a scheme that does not excessively increase the distance that the pedestrian and cycle traffic has to cover to get between the key points on each side of the rail line.  The AXIAT modelling used fo\nr road level crossings would need to be adjusted to account for the shorter times and distances generally used in populated areas eg from large  residential developments (with few shops) on one side of a rail line to the town with shops and services on the\n other.\n&#xa0;\nHow should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?&#xa0;\nCTC has been involved in the revision of level crossings legislation undertaken by the Law Commission and the Law Commission for Scotland.  The ability to obtain land and resources \nfor appropriate works to eliminate or resite a level crossing, including works away from the railway itself  is an area which may need to be addressed.  The assessment model for the changed risks in the delivery of an alternative route, is not routinely ap\nplied to footpath and bridleway diversions\n&#xa0;\nCTC also notes that the ability to create a new level crossing particularly in remote areas, and where existing demand makes a formal crossing point preferable to informal routes being created by trespass, this \nmay be a more cost-effective option than policing the railway and fence lines.  The key may be in the delivery of effective management measures which make it difficult to be on the \ncrossing when trains are approaching (remote release gate latches, miniatur\ne colour lights) and effective delivery of penalties for abuse.\n&#xa0;\nHow should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?&#xa0;\nThe CTC and other cycling organisations can encourage and facilitate (eg through Fillthathole system reporting directly \nto Network Rail regional centres) the reporting of defects, and incidents (such as trips and falls) through the available channels mostly through the number 08457 11 41 41, but where a potentially serious hazard arises thorough detachment of parts of the c\nrossing equipment, to use the direct telephone to the signaller.  Where the railway is not operated by Network Rail, the difference should be made clear at the crossing.  \n&#xa0;\nThe option to warn the train drivers and signallers at the earliest opportunity \nneeds to be appropriately highlighted in the highway code, and where appropriate guidance for use of paths and other networks using level crossings not on a public road. The call to alert or stop trains, should ideally be an action taken simultaneously wit\nh any attempt to remove people from the railway lines.  The use of telephones at the crossing as a means to rapidly contact the signaller is perhaps not emphasised enough, both as an emergency when the line is obstructed, and after a fall or loss of contro\nl to ensure that the incident is logged, and where CCTV is in use the events can be downloaded promptly before they are overwritten.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
