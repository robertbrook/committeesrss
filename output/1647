[normal]BNI0011[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Danske[bold] Bank[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. [bold]Background on [bold]Danske[bold] Bank[bold]In 2005 the Danish-based 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank Group acquired Northern Bank from National Australia Bank.
[normal] 
[normal]In November 2012, in a move replicated across all Group brands, Northern Bank was rebranded and now trades as 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank retains the sound lending principles applied by Northern Bank throughout its 200 year history.
[normal] 
[normal]Customers benefit from the Bank’s local 
[normal]knowledge

[normal] has 
[normal]emerged from the most difficult years of the financial crisis with strong capital and liquidity ratios.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Historically
[normal] the 
[normal]four main
[normal] banks operating in Northern Ireland were Northern Bank, Ulster Bank, First Trust 
[normal](AIB) 
[normal]and Bank of Ireland
[normal],
[normal] with building societies from Great Britain operating primarily in the 
[normal]personal 
[normal]mortgage
[normal] and savings
[normal] market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over recent 
[normal]decades
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]competitive 
[normal]landscape in Northern Ireland has changed significantly with the entrance of new 
[normal]banking 
[normal]players from 
[normal]G
[normal]reat Britain, including the consolidation and 
[normal]demutualisation
[normal] of building societies
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Offering the same products to customers in this market as elsewhere in
[normal] the UK
[normal], 
[normal]some of 
[normal]these banks 
[normal]now 
[normal]gain a higher proportion of new accounts opened each year
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]volume of business they are acquiring 
[normal]highlights
[normal] their steady penetration 
[normal]of 
[normal]the local market, and 
[normal]a
[normal] healthy level of competition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite the arrival of these new entrants, 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank 
[normal]has competed strongly
[normal] to 
[normal]increase

[normal]Concerns have been expressed about the historic availability of finance for start-ups and expansions
[normal] in Northern Ireland
[normal]. 
[normal]A useful context 
[normal]and assessment 
[normal]of the market 
[normal]prior to the financial crisis
[normal] can be found in the Ulster Society of Chartered Accountants 
[normal]200
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]Report 
[normal]“Financing for Growth”.[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This report found that contrary to perception, Northern Ireland was a 
[normal]favourable
[normal] place in which to borrow funds at competitive rates. 
[normal]“This conclusion has emerged from the Study’s extensive research in comparing interest rates in N
[normal]orthern Ireland
[normal] with other international regions of the U
[normal]K and the 
[normal]Republic of Ireland. 
[normal]Most SMEs in Northern Ireland borrow at rates which are at least as competitive as those offered by other regions – and in many cases at better rates
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The report further concluded 
[normal]“it would appear that competition between the leading banks in Northern Ireland has resulted in
[normal] a competitively priced market for funds throughout Northern Ireland, providing attractive borrowing terms for many SMEs.”
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]S
[normal]ource: Ulster Society of Chartered Accountants “Financing for Growth” 2001.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Danske
[normal] Bank does not agree 
[normal]that bank finance for start up and expansion has played a lesser role in the 
[normal]Northern Ireland 
[normal]market when compared to the intervention of Government agencies.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence from a range of 
[normal]recent 
[normal]reports suggests that access to finance has been 
[normal]both 
[normal]available[bold] 
[normal]and 
[normal]competitive[bold] 
[normal]in the local market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The recent Economic Advisory Group report concluded, “
[normal]Even allowing for differences in sampling methodologies, the evidence would suggest that more Northern Ireland SMEs use external finance tha
[normal]n
[normal] the UK average.
[normal] 
[normal]This is particularly so for overdrafts, which is typically a working capital rather than a business growth product.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the report it is noted that
[normal] SMEs in Northern Ireland had more access to cheaper finance than in G
[normal]reat Britain
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]At the peak of the ‘boom’ the borrowing norm in Northern Ireland was base +1% (or lower) as intense competition between banks for
[normal] greater market share ensured. 
[normal]The rate is now more 
[normal]typically
[normal] base
[normal] 
[normal]+3% which is in line with lending rates for SMEs in Great Britain.”

[normal] [bold]Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme[bold] (EFGS)[bold]Danske
[normal] Bank is a participating lender in EFG
[normal]S
[normal] and was one of the first subscribers to the Scheme.
[normal] 
[normal]Since 2009 
[normal]eight 
[normal]loans with a total lending 
[normal]value of £1
[normal],
[normal]618k
[normal] have been drawn down
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Before considering an application under the 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme, the Bank must be satisfied 
[normal]with
[normal] the viability of the business proposal. 
[normal]An 
[normal]assessment of viability is based on the ability to repay the loan and the
[normal] company’s
[normal] cash flow quality, rather than on the security cover
[normal] offered or available
[normal]. The inclusion of a guarantee, such as this 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme offers, does not inherently improve an assessment of the viability of the business.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme is one of a number of sources of support for SMEs and must be seen in the wider context of the support and funding 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank already provides to customers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Given that there is a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]extra 
[normal]cost to the customer when supported under this 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme, most customers tend to choose less expensive, conventional loans in preference to the EFG
[normal]S
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] fact that the 
[normal]Scheme
[normal] 
[normal]in itself does not make a lending pr
[normal]oposal more viable
[normal] for a lending institution
[normal], and
[normal] that 
[normal]Danske
[normal] 
[normal]can often meet customer’s needs at a lower cost using conventional loans, is crucial to understanding the modest uptake of the 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme 
[normal]in this market.
[normal] 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank’s limited u
[normal]se of th
[normal]e
[normal] EFG
[normal]S
[normal] reflects

[normal] and success
[normal] in conventional lending.

[normal] Bank is at the stage of

[normal]Funding for Lending S
[normal]cheme. At present there 
[normal]is
[normal] not a need to draw on the 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme as 
[normal]the 
[normal]current liquidity and funding position for 
[normal]Danske

[normal]8.[bold] [bold]Branch banking – the impact of changing customer trends[bold]Branch closures have taken place over many decades in the local market
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Over the past decade in particular, 
[normal]how customers use the branch network has changed
[normal] significantly
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With 53 branches 
[normal]across Northern Ireland, 
[normal]branches
[normal] 
[normal]remain an extremely important channel to 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank.
[normal] 
[normal]Much
[normal] of the
[normal] 
[normal]b
[normal]anking business previously conducted at the branch counter is now done through cash machines, online, 
[normal]smartphones
[normal], tablets and by telephone. These trends in turn shape the role of the branch and the decisions made regarding 
[normal]future 
[normal]investment 
[normal]in
[normal] all bank channels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The vast majority of the banks
[normal] in
[normal] Northern Ireland 
[normal]have been 
[normal]rationali
[normal]s
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]their branch network
[normal]. 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank has reduced its network gradually
[normal],
[normal] in line with c
[normal]hanging customer habits and across
[normal] both urban and rural locations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The percentage of customer activity by channel continues to change in 
[normal]favour
[normal] of new ways to bank.
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst the decline in branch use is continual and steady, the increase in 
[normal]online, 
[normal]mobile and tablet 
[normal]use is sharp and unprecedented. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]S
[normal]ource: internal analysis
[normal]C
[normal]onsumer changes 
[normal]are necessitating ongoing reviews of the traditional 
[normal]branch network: how branches are used by both business and personal customers, other branches in the area, the cost of maintaining the branch
[normal] given falling transaction volumes
[normal], what customers use the branch for and how sustainable 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]branch is for the longer term as more investment
[normal] is directed
[normal] into online
[normal], mobile
[normal] and telephone channels to keep pace with these changes.
[normal]The financial crisis has
[normal] had
[normal] an impact on all business, including banks, an
[normal]d it is therefore only prudent for the 
[normal]Bank 
[normal]to 
[normal]review 
[normal]its
[normal] cost base, alongside the 
[normal]changing 
[normal]customer trends
[normal].
[normal]
