So we have been somewhat surprised to see it used extensively by supporters of the coalition's pol\nicy on academies…This seems rather hard to justify, given that the new academy programme is different in a number of ways.” (The Guardian 9 April).  He told BBC Radio 4’s The Report that it was not appropriate to extrapolate the research to primary schools\n.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic Accounts Committee Report – Whilst this research supports some aspects of the academy model, the evidence is very fragile.  It used data from the National Audit Office 2010 research, but chooses to ignore the NAO’s conclusion (see below).  It only\n considered the performance of two chains, ARK, which the NAO noted had mixed success across its academies, and ULT, which the previous government had not allowed to sponsor any more academies as several had been judged to be ‘inadequate’. The Committee al\nso warned of “potential financial and governance instability” in the expansion of the academy model.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNational Audit Office – Concluded “many of the academies established so far are performing impressively in delivering the intended improvements. It cannot \nbe assumed, however, that academies’ performance to date is an accurate predictor of how the model will perform when generalised more widely. Existing academies have been primarily about school improvement in deprived areas, while new academies will often \nbe operating in very different educational and social settings.”\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPWC Final Evaluation Report 2008 - This concluded at page 19 that, “There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive judgement about the Academies as a model for school improvement.”  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 3Harris Primary Academy February 2013Letter Home for a 4 year old &#xa0;\nUnfortunately your child has still not met their initial target of being able to recognise numerals 1-10.
