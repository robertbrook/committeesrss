defaultQ371 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultGood afternoon, Mr Jones and Mr 
defaultGauke
default,
default 
defaultSecretary of State, Minister.
default 
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultGood afternoon, Minister Davies.
defaultQ372 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am glad to see that some of us agree that a certain air of formality is a good thing on these occasions. 
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultMr Chairman, I did make a request that I deliver a very
default, very
default brief statement beforehand. If you would be willing to allow me to do so, I would greatly appreciate it.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am perfectly happy with that.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultCan I say that I am very pleased to appear before you here today to 
defaulttalk about the draft Wales Bill?
default I am grateful to you and the Committee for the rigorous scrutiny of the Bill and the commendable speed with which you are undertaking it. It is eight years since a Wales
default&#x2011;
defaultonly
default Bill was last before Parliament
default, and I think that this Bill is 
defaultevery bit as important for Welsh devolution as the Government of Wales Act 2
default006. 
defaultThrough this Bill, the Government will deliver an ambitious package of devolved powers for 
defaultWales
default. I believe that the tax and borrowing powers we propose devolving, as well as the power to trigger a referendum on the devolution of a portion of income tax, present very real incentives and opportunities for the Welsh Government to grow the Welsh economy and increase prosperity in 
defaultWales
default. Since devolution, the Assembly and the Welsh Government have been accountable only for how they spend taxpayers
default’
default money. This draft Bill will ensure that they now become more accou
defaultntable for how they raise it. 
defaultThe draft Bill also includes provisions relating to Assembly elections, on which we consulted in 2012, and several provisio
defaultns that the Welsh Government have
default specifically requested. Taken together, Mr Chairman, I believe that the significant package of powers contained in the draft Wales Bill makes devolved governance in Wales fairer, more accountable and places more economic levers in the hands
default of the Welsh Government, which 
defaultthey hope
defaultfully
default will use to support economic growth in Wales 
defaultand 
defaultto give the Welsh economy a real competitive edge.
default Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.
defaultQ373 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much. May I say 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are grateful for your recognition of the quite significant extra wor
defaultk this has put on the Committee? The m
defaultembers have been very happy to fulfil
default their obligation, of course. 
defaultOne thing that would interest us is, given the amount of work the Committee has put into scrutinising this and the criticisms that we have heard, how willing are you as a Government, as Ministers
default,
default to amend the Bill following the report that we will be shortly writing?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultPredictably, Mr Chairman, I must say it depends on what the proposed amendments are. Clearly
default,
default we will give very careful consideration to them and we will respond in the usual course, but
default,
default without knowing what they may be
default,
default it is hard for me to comment further. 
defaultQ374 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But you would be open-
defaultminded and willing to make those changes if you feel they are reasonable
default.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultIf we felt that there were compelling reasons to make amendments, we would. What I would say, however, in all fairness
default,
default is that parliamentary time is very constrained now. We are anxious to proceed with this Bill as quickly as the pa
defaultrliamentary calendar will allow, and
default I would hope that that would be borne in mind by this Committee too.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much.
defaultQ375 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default Good afternoon. Both Gerry 
defaultHoltham
default and the Silk Commission came out against the lockstep. The First Minister, giving evidence to us down in 
defaultCardiff
default, said that it would be an immense straitjacket
default,
default and 
defaulthe also 
defaultwent as far as to say that it would make the power unusable. Indeed, that was the evidence given to us by other witnesses, both people from the world of business and from political studies. Do you accept that the Welsh Government would be unlikely to call a referendum because of their perceived difficulties in using this power?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI have to say, Mr Chairman, that that really will be a matter for the Welsh Government
default,
default because, as you know, we propose to devolve the competence to the Welsh Government to call a referendum at such time as 
defaultthey consider
default appropriate. But I disagree entirely with the suggestion that the powers proposed are unusable. I think that the powers proposed are extremely desirable. Frankly, too much focus has been placed on the
default issue of variation—of varying the rates.
defaultThe important thing about the proposed devolution of income tax powers is, first, that it renders the Welsh Government far more accountable to the people of 
defaultWales
default. It would provide that almost half of the income tax raised in 
defaultWales
default would be spent, if you like, by the Welsh Government. I think it is very important to introduce that level of accountability into the process. Importantly
default,
default too, it would act as a strong incentive to the Welsh Government to grow the Welsh economy
default,
default because, clearly, the more the economy improves
default,
default the more likely it 
defaultis that the tax take from the devolved eleme
defaultnt of income tax would increase—
defaultand that is desirable as well. Thirdly
default—
defaultand I think possibly, in the eyes of some, most importantly
default—
defaultit would provide a significantly enhanced income stream against which the Welsh Government could borrow. So
default, while on the face of the Bill
default we have £500 million
default&#x2011;
defaultworth
default of borrowing powers, which is actually more than the Welsh Government should have strictly if we have regard only to the devolved small taxes, 
defaultit
default could increase to around £1 billion once the income stream from the income tax is there. But, to complete my answer, I 
defaultactually 
defaultbelieve that 
defaultWales
default should be ambitious
default,
default and 
defaultI believe 
defaultthat it could give a strong competitive advantage to 
defaultWales
default if they were to go for a modest reduction in the level of tax that they levy on the people of 
defaultWales
default.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultCan I just add
default,
default with regard to the lockstep
default,
default that it is worth pointing out that our view, as a Government
default—
defaultand this applies across the United Kingdom
default—is 
defaultthat, in terms of the differentiation between rates, we do believe that that is something that should be determined on a UK basis in Westminster elections
default?
default I think, in a way, putting aside for the moment the merits or otherwise of the shadow Chancellor
default’
defaults announcement at the weekend, none the less tha
defaultt does demonstrate the degree in
default which the gaps between rates is a very important issue that should apply across the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default. That, as I say, is the approach that we have taken in 
defaultScotland
default,
default and we believe that the same case applies with 
defaultWales
default. 
defaultThere is also an issue, looking at this, in terms of not causing any detriment to the public finances collectively in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default. One possible result of allowing a different rate to be set for the additional rate is that 
defaultWales
default, for example, might decide that the rates set in 
defaultWestminster
default are too high. They may be right in making that judgment, potentially, and in those circumstances we see a degree of tax competition, trying to get people to move from, say, 
defaultEngland
default to 
defaultWales
default. That throws up a number of issues, but one consequence of that is likely to be a detriment to the overall public finances in the 
defaultUK
default. So we are nervous about that. 
defaultQ376 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultI would like to question you about that particular issue next, but can I go back to the question I asked you, Secretary of State? I think most people would accept the points that you make about accountability, about growing the Welsh economy, and, of course, the point about the income stream, but the question I asked you was specifically, I suppose, aimed at the variation issue. I am in danger of repeating myself, but all the evidence we have had points to the lockstep making variation in rates across all the rates essentially unusable. Would you concede th
defaultat—
defaulton that narrow point?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: No, I don’
defaultt think it does. 
defaultI think i
defaultt is quite possible for the Wels
defaulth Government to be brave and 
defaultdecide to go for a modest reduction in the rate of income tax. That would be thoroughly good for the Welsh economy. It would give 
defaultWales
default that little competitive advantage and I think that that is what they should do.
defaultQ377 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultCould you, for the purposes of the record, tell the Committee how much, say, a reduction of 1p across income tax in 
defaultWales
default would cost or generate?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt depends which way you look at it. It would probably equate to a reduction in the block grant of £185 million and £200 million. That, of course, is not the net figure because clearly there would be more money in the economy. My suggestion is that a reduction in the rate of tax would stimulate the economy further. But I think I have to get back to the fundamental point: that does not render the tax unusable. The tax is extremely usable to the extent that it amounts to an incentive to the Welsh Government to grow the economy
default,
default and
default, 
defaultof course,
default it gives that additional borrowing stream, which is enjoyed in 
defaultScotland
default, which does have the lockstep.
defaultQ378 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultIs it your perception that
default—
defaultperhaps this is a rather political question
default—
defaultthe Welsh Government, as presently constituted, 
defaultare
default sufficiently courageous to take this step?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultJane Hutt described the proposals on the day of their announcement as, and I quote, 
default“
defaulta good deal for 
defaultWales
default,
default”
default and I can only assume that she is enthusiastic about the proposal.
defaultQ379 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultCan I therefore ask you about another position down in the Assembly
default?
default Your colleague Mr Andrew R.T. Davies was giving evidence this morning 
defaultand he
default, to say the least, does not share your enthusiasm for the lockstep. I wondered
default—
defaultagain, Chair, forgive me for being perhaps overtly political
default—
defaultwho speaks for the Conservative Party in 
defaultWales
default. Is it you
default or him?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI think that the view that Mr Davies is enunciating is very much a personal view
default of his own
default. It certainly does not represent the policy of the Welsh Ass
defaultembly Group, nor, certainly, does it 
defaultrepresent the policy of HM Government.
defaultQ380 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default 
defaultTo follow on from that, I find that rather strange, Secretary of State, given that he is the leader of the Conservative Group in the Assembly and the leader of the opposition. 
defaultI
defaultf you could dig into it a little bit more, what are the differences between you and 
defaulthim,
default and why have you come to those different positions? To the Minister from the Treasury, what assessment 
defaultperhaps 
defaulthas the Treasury made of the differing positions of the Secretary of State and
default,
default indeed
default,
default of the le
defaultader of the Welsh Conservatives, because I think i
defaultt is important to know and understand
default, obviously,
default what the implications of those t
defaultwo different policies would be?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI find it hard to see that there are any implications at all. The Government
default’
defaults position has been set out clearly in the draft Bill. That is what we propose. Mr Davies has enunciated a personal opinion this morning.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultI am not sure I have anything much more to add to that. The
default position of the Government, 
defaultthe Secretary of State for 
defaultWales
default and the position of the Treasury is one and the same. 
defaultQ381 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Doughty:default 
defaultHas the Treasury made any assessment of the statements by the leader of the Welsh Conservatives?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultThe Treasury makes an assessment of what we think is the right policy to pursue
default,
default and we believe this is the right policy to pursue.
defaultQ382 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultMr 
defaultGauke
default, on this matter you made it quite clear in your earlier answer that you believed that progressivity is something that should be decided by the UK Government at a 
defaultUK
default level. That is absolutely something you firmly believe.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultYes. That is the approach we have taken in 
defaultScotland
default as well.
defaultQ383 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultSo
default,
default if 
defaultScotland
default does not vote for independence, the 
defaultdevo
default max procedures that are being touted as an alternative will not include the end of the lockstep or freedom for 
defaultScotland
default to vary income tax outside of a lockstep mechanism. Am I correct?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultOur position is that we believe that progressivity, the differentiation between rates, should be at a 
defaultUK
default level. I am not going to get into
default—
default 
defaultChair:default 
defaultNo, but if that is your position
default—
default 
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: —
defaultareas of speculation. That is the position that we hold and have held consistently. 
defaultQ384 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIncidentally, I fully agree with you personally, but that is neither here nor there for the moment. If that is the UK Government
default’
defaults position, obviously we can assume that the UK Government will not suddenly change 
defaulttheir
default mind and allow 
defaultScotland
default to have greater freedom over income tax levels if, after a referendum, the Scots decide to vote against full independence. We can make that assumption, can we not?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultI am not in a position to bind what future Governments may do or over a long period of time.
defaultQ385 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt would be this Government. 
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultIn terms of the position of this Govern
defaultment, our view is that it remains the case 
defaultthat progressivity is a matter for the UK Government.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you.
default Mark Williams?
defaultMr Mark Williams:default The Chair
default has just pinched the question.
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf I have, I apologise. 
defaultQ386 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Mark Williams:default Don’
defaultt worry
default—well, 
defaultthe theme anyway. I was going to talk specifically about 
defaultScotland
default and the line that we have heard so far about the need to have that consistency of income tax models between 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultScotland
default. It has been asserted by some, at least, that the real reason for the lockstep in the current political climate is that it would not be possible to give 
defaultWales
default a more advanced form of tax devolution than 
defaultScotland
default. How do you respond to those assertions, for instance, by Mr Gerry 
defaultHoltham
default, who described the lockstep as a great flaw
default,
default with 
defaultWales
default getting hand
default&#x2011;
defaultme
default&#x2011;
defaultdown policies that others have had? What is your analysis of those kinds of comments?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultPerhaps I can say in response to this that I was the Treasury Minister involved in the Scotland Bill and the 
defaultCalman
default process
default,
default and gave evidence to Select Committees of the Scottish Parliament on this matter. 
defaultCalman
default recommended a lockstep arrangement. It was an issue that was not, if my memory serves me correctly, particularly controversial in 
defaultScotland
default. There was an acceptance of that as a principle and it was not one of the more contentious elements to that Bill. As I say, we believe that there is a very strong case that progressivity should be a matter for the Westminster Parliament. I would perhaps highlight the amount of interest there has been in the last few days in the general debate in the UK because of the intervention by the shadow Chancellor, which rather underlines that this is an important UK issue. 
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultAll I would add is that I was very surprised by Mr 
defaultHoltham
default’
defaults
default comments about 
default“
defaultrunts of the litter
default,”
default 
default“
defaulthand
default&#x2011;
defaultme
default&#x2011;
defaultdown policies
default”
default and other colourful bits of language. The fact is that Wales is being treated exactly the same as Scotland in this respect
default,
default and it seems to me 
defaultthat, far from treating Wales with a lack of respect, it is treating Wales with full respect and according Wales equal respect to that it accords to Scotland.
defaultQ387 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Mark Williams:default 
defaultThank you. Quickly on the lockstep again, one of the messages from the three party leaders
default—
defaultthe Plaid 
defaultCymru
default leader, the Conservative leader and the Lib Dem leader
default—
defaultwas that they s
defaultaw the original Silk proposals—
defaulthe used the 
defaultphrase, I think—
defaultas a 
default“
defaultpackage
default.”
default Those three party leaders did similarly this morning
default,
default and somehow the lockstep is deviating from that principle that actually drew all four parties in the National Assembly to the process in the first place. What are your thoughts on that?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultAll I can say is that we gave very careful scrutiny to what the Silk Commission proposed. We accepted almost all of the recommendations, as you know. The two respects in which we deviated from the recommendations were air passenger duty and the form of income tax devolution. It was not done lightly. It was done after careful consideration
default,
default and we believe, for the reasons that Mr 
defaultGauke
default has set out, that it is the right way forward.
defaultQ388 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultCan I ask you about progressivity as a principle, as it were? You did refer, Mr 
defaultGauke
default, to uniformity across the 
defaultUK
default and also 
defaultto 
defaultthe dangers or otherwise of tax competition. However, thinking in terms of progressivity, the jump from one rate to another, if the Welsh Government increased, say, all rates by 1p, the actual progressivity of the system is lessened, is it not, because of the ratios of 1p to 30p, 40p, 45p, or even 50p, w
defaulthatever we have as a top rate? So they would not have a
default uniform progressivity comparing 
defaultWales
default perhaps 
defaultwith
default 
defaultEngland
default or 
defaultScotland
default, whatever their arrangements. The emphasis that you put on the 
defaultUK
default actually would not be observed in that way, would it?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultI can see the point 
defaultthat 
defaultyou are making in terms of ratios, but at a practical level the idea that any change in thi
defaults way—
defaultthat the ratio should be the ba
defaultsis rather than the percentage—
defaultwould result in a great deal of complexity
default,
default with rates running into several decimal points before you got very far. I do think that that is not workable. But I think that
default—
defaultQ389 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultBut you can see the point, though.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultI think in broad terms
default, with regard to
default the difference between 20 and 40 and 45, the significant point, particularly within the range that we are talking about here, is the difference of 20p and 5p
default—
default 
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultAnd, of course, in terms of pence it would remain exactly the same.
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultYes, of course. Thank you.
defaultQ390 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultMy first question is to the Exchequer Secretary. Obviously, with the devolution of some taxes as a result of this Bill being passed there will be a need to cut the Welsh block grant. Could you explain how that process will work initially and what subsequent changes would then occur on a year
default&#x2011;
defaultby
default&#x2011;
defaultyear
default basis to the formula used to reduce the block grant?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: Yes, c
defaultertainly. In terms of funding, the issue will be first of all to make an assessment of the amount raised from the devolved element of income tax. It will then be based on an assessment of changes in the 
defaultUK
default tax base, excluding dividends and savings, versus the Welsh tax base. So there is an indexation in terms of what happens to the Welsh element, if I can put it that way, versus the changes to the 
defaultUK
default tax base on a non
default&#x2011;
defaultsavings
default/non
default&#x2011;
defaultdividend
default basis. The consequence of that means that changes in the Welsh 
defaulteconomy relative to the 
defaultUK
default economy will result in changes in the revenue coming to the Welsh Government. That, as the Secretary of State was pointing out, puts in an incentive within the formula for the Welsh Government to grow the Welsh economy.
defaultQ391 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultTo clarify, if the Welsh 
defaulteconomy grows
default, the impact upon the block grant would be po
defaultsitive for the Welsh Government
default therefore?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: Than w
defaulthere it remains
default—
default 
defaultQ392 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultSo there is an incentive, in effect
default—
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. 
defaultQ393 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default —
defaultto use these powers for the benefit of the
default Welsh economy. That is fine. 
defaultThe second point I would like to ask is in relation to the issue of the Barnett formula. We were taking evidence in Cardiff two weeks ago
default,
default and the First Minister made it very clear that he did not believe we should be approaching the issue of income tax devolution unless there was a review of the Barnett formula. Quite clearly, with the reduction in public spending over the past three or four years, the issues of the Barnett squeeze have gon
defaulte into some degree of reverse. 
defaultIs there a likelihood of 
defaulta 
defaultreassessment of the Barnett formula as it affects Wales prior to any potential referendum on income tax devolution?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultThe point I would make on that, and the point that we have consistently made as a Government, is that our focus is on reducing the deficit. That is the key challenge. Any change to the Barnett formula has to await the stabilisation of the public finances. That remains the case. Obviously, the Barnett formula is a UK
default&#x2011;
defaultwide
default issue and we would need to evaluate that in its application across all parts of the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default.
defaultQ394 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultI accept the point about the stabilisation of the financial position of the UK as a whole, but
default,
default in terms of going for a referendum on income tax as it stands, is it not the case that
default,
default unless the Barnett formula is actually revised
default,
default there is a potential that the issue of the Barnett squeeze will come back into play once income tax has been devolved to the detriment of the Welsh public purse, as it were? Is it not the case, therefore, that it would be irresponsible to go for that devolution of income tax powers without at least the issue of a floor under the Barnett f
defaultormula being taken into account?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: I don’
defaultt think so. I am sure the Secretary of State has his views on this, but I 
defaultdo 
defaultthink that
default,
default because of the case which the
default Secretary of State has set out
default in terms of the advantages for Wales of proceeding with this devolution, it would be a pity to miss the opportunity to proceed with that at a time when, rightly, our focus is on the stabilisation of the public finances and then we will return to it. The idea that one should wait until all elements of uncertainty are eliminated before moving on this may result in waiting some time because there are always elements of uncertainty.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultCould I add to that too? In October 2012
default,
default HM Government and the Welsh Government made a joint statement outlining commitments on funding in Wales, including putting in place a mechanism to review convergence of relative funding levels in advance of each spending review, and in fact that was done prio
defaultr to the last spending review. 
defaultThat
default,
default to a large extent
default,
default addresses the Barne
defaulttt squeeze point that you made—p
defaultlus, of course, convergence is not currently happening.
defaultQ395 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultMr 
defaultGauke
default, over the years we have heard compelling evidence on this Committee that 
defaultWales
default receives less than its fair share of funding as a result of the 35 or 30
default&#x2011;
defaultyear
default&#x2011;
defaultold Barnett formula. I entirely agree with you about the need to stabilise public finances
default; 
defaultI might even go further than you if I were in your position
default. B
defaultut surely the issue of the Barnett formula is absolutely nothing to do with it
default,
default because the Barnett formula is a formula used to determine how much a give
defaultn amount of money is divided up
default or
default,
default rather
default,
default to which parts of 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry it is sent. The overall figure that is used obviously has an effect on the stabilisation of public funds, but the way in which that amount is divvied up does not affect 
defaultUK
default finances at all. It is a matter of a fair division of spoils for everyone. Is that not the case? 
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultThe point I would make is that there is a very significant challenge for us as a country and as a Government in getting the public finances back under control.
defaultChair:default 
defaultAbsolutely.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultWe have made considerable progress on that but there is still much more to do. In terms of dealing with public spending, departmental spending and spending in particular nations and regions within the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default, there is a very large task in front of us, which is to get public spending under control. Were we at the same time to be trying to re
default&#x2011;
defaultopen
default 
defaulta 
defaultwell
default&#x2011;
defaultestablished formula, 
defaultit
default would add complexity and additional challenge to what is already a difficult task.
defaultQ396 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI may not be asking the question in a very clear way. I am not asking about the amount. There are some that would like more to be allocated and some might argue less, but that is not my question. My question is about the way in which it is allocated
default—
defaultthe formula itself. We have heard compelling evidence that the formula is unfair to 
defaultWales
default—
defaultthat it underfunds 
defaultWales
default. Is it not possible for the Government to look into this and to look at the formula rather than the overall amount, which I agree would have an impact on the stability of the 
defaultUK
default’
defaults finances? I mean the formula itsel
defaultf. You say, S
defaultir, that it is well established, but my interpretation is that it was made up on the hoof about 35 years ago and nobody has done very much about it since. That seems to be the verdict of the man who actually produced it, although I paraphrase him slightly.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultYes. I am not sur
defaulte he ever quite used the phrase
default 
default“
defaultmade up on the hoof.
default”
defaultChair:default 
defaultNo, he did not put it quite like that
default; I agree
default.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultBut I appreciate where you are coming from. It is not possible to just remove the formula from the whole issue of the debate. The reality is that all nations and regions of the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default are having to make a contribution towards deficit reduction. It is particularly challenging to look also at a formula where
default,
default inevitably
default,
default there will be winners and losers
default,
default and put that into the context of significant deficit reduction.
defaultQ397 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThis is my last go at this because I also take that point. Where formulas such as this have been changed previously and there have been winners and losers, what are called floors and ceilings are put in place. I think it happened with the police funding formula a few years ago in 
defaultWales
default. So it would still be quite possible to change the formula but to do so in a way that re
defaultduced the impact for the losers
default or
default,
default rather
default,
default brought in the changes over a period of years so tha
defaultt people were not affected over
defaultnight, would it not? 
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultYes, it would be, although that of course has consequences in terms of reducing the benefit for the winners as well as softening any loss for the losers.
defaultChair:default 
defaultOf course.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultBut, as I say, the position of the Government
default—
defaultwe have been very consistent on this and I am sure, Mr Davies, you have heard others make this point before
default—
defaultis that we do believe that our focus has to be on stabilisation of the public finances before 
defaultwe re
default&#x2011;
defaultopen the Barnett formula.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI must not take up any more time.
defaultQ398 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultC
defaultan I ask you bluntly whether
default your reluctance to re
default&#x2011;
defaultopen
default the Barnett question 
defaulthas 
defaultanything at all to do with the question of the money that goes to 
defaultScotland
default,
default because changing the proportion that goes to 
defaultWales
default might have some implications pre
default&#x2011;
defaultreferendum
default for our Scottish colleagues?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultThe position has been very straightforward and very clear throughout this coalition Government that we were not going to look at the Barnett formula until the public finances were sorted. The focus is on the public finances. They need to be stabilised
default,
default and
default being 
defaultin a position where public finances are strong
default 
defaultis a much better time to look at a funding formula of this sort than at a time where it is already the case that, as I say, every nation and region in the 
defaultUK
default is having to make a contribution towards deficit reduction.
defaultQ399 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultI thought the agreement between the Welsh Government and the Government here was that the Barnett formula would be reviewed at every future spending review. Is that the case?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultNo. It is the operation of the Barnett formula, which is a slightly different matter.
defaultQ400 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultThis question is for the Secretary of State. We have heard evidence that the partial devolution of income tax to t
defaulthe Welsh Government is not of “
defaultsufficient constitutional importance to warrant a referendum.
default”
default How do you respond?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI think it is a serious constitutional issue. The Scottish people, of course, had the opportunity to vote on income tax devolution
default,
default and I think, frankly, the people of 
defaultWales
default would be affronted if they felt that income tax devolution was being imposed upon them without having their say. Of course, in 
defaultWales
default, a large number of people live and work very close to the border with 
defaultEngland
default. A lot of people cross the border daily backwards and forwards to work. The issu
defaulte of income tax devolution will
default be a very significant issue 
defaultparticularly 
defaultfor that particular category of people. I think it shows proper respect to the people of 
defaultWales
default,
default and, of course, it was specifically recommended by the Silk Commission.
defaultQ401 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultThe Electoral Commission told us that a referendum should only be held when there is a clear campaign on both sides. Are you concerned at all that there may not be clear leadership from both sides of the campaign?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI think 
defaultthat 
defaultit is necessary for people to be fully informed about the pros and cons of the proposal. Therefore, I would agree entirely with the Electoral Reform Society that we do need to see a properly organised campaign, both yes and no, and this is a matter that we will be taking a very close interest in.
defaultQ402 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultAre you confident in that
default,
default because in part of that evidence the issue comes up time and time again of the good, clear information that go
defaultes
default out and somebody has to pick up the cost for that?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultYes, and of course there was an unfortunate experience, as you know, in the last referendum we had in 
defaultWales
default in 2011 when there was no 
default“
defaultno
default”
default campaign, which of course had an immediate impact upon the 
default“
defaultyes
default”
default campaign. I think lessons have been learned from that and we are quite clear that there should be properly organised campaigns on both sides.
defaultQ403 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultAgain, 
defaultwhat do you think turn
defaultout would be for a referendum? Professor Scully thinks
default that it could be as low as 25%.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultIf you are talking about tax devolution, 
defaultit
default might be a fairly strong incentive to people to turn out and vote.
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultThank you. 
defaultQ404 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultSecretary of State and Minister, I would like to turn to the issue of borrowing now. Could you give us a little bit more detail as to how you came to the conclusions that you did in terms of the amount of borrowing that is to be allowed in the first stage, pre
default&#x2011;
defaultincome
default tax devolution, and how do you respond to the comments from the First Minister about wanting to see £1 billion as the limit for borrowing rather than what you have been suggesting, which is half of that?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultIf you like, there are two stages there. First of all, it is worth looking at the amount of tax that
default 
defaultis devolved and applying the same ratio that applies in 
defaultScotland
default where, of course, an element of income tax is devolved. That would give us a number in the region
default of round about £100 million. 
defaultBut we are very keen to proceed with the M4 improvements. That is the reason why we have a higher number, which is the £500 million. In terms of it going up and getting to the £1 billion mark, again
default,
default we do have to look at the relationship with the control over taxes which the Welsh Government would have, and in the circumstances where there is devolution of income tax, as is proposed, then, yes, the number would be around the £1 billion mark.
defaultQ405 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultSo you would tie that number to the devolution of income tax.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultExactly, yes, precisely. 
defaultQ406 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultHow would you respond to comments by Jo
defaultcelyn Davies AM, who chairs the Finance C
defaultommittee in the Assembly
default,
default that there should not actually be a figure on the face of the Bill but it should be something that is negotiated between the Welsh Government and the UK Government?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultIt doe
defaults provide a degree of certainty—
defaulta degree of reassurance, as I say. If we were just doing it purely on the ratio with the tax powers, the number would be significantly l
defaultower and one could look at the £
default500 million 
defaultnumber 
defaultas being generous, in these circumstances, and the reason is our support of the work on 
defaultthe 
defaultM4. As to whether or not it is in the Bill, it provides a degree of certainty and reassurance
default. P
defaultarticularly given that the sum is significantly more than would be the case if we simply applied the ratio, it seemed to me to be something that should be welcomed and supported.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI think it is fair to say, for the information of the Committee, that that figure would be likely to be £100 million. So 
defaultI think it is very unlikely
default that, having regard to that, a negotiated process would be preferable to having the certainty of the 
defaulthalf a billion
default 
defaultpound figure 
defaulton the face of the Bill.
defaultQ407 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultThat is very useful. I move on now to the issue of bonds. Obviously, in the Scotland Act there is 
defaultthe
default provision that 
defaultScotland
default could, without further legislation, issue its own bonds
default,
default and we do have examples of housing associations doing likewise. Why is that not something which 
defaultis
default be
defaulti
defaultn
defaultg
default considered for the Welsh Government?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultThe reality is that the cheapest way of borrowing is through the NLF
default—
defaultthe National Loans Fund. That was recognised by the Silk Commission. That, alongside commercial lending, which provides a degree of flexibility, we believe
default,
default provides the Welsh Government with the most suitable sources for borrowing.
defaultQ408 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default But i
defaultf the Welsh Government could
default obviously 
defaulthave the option to make 
defaulttheir
default own mind up as to whether to issue them 
defaultthemselves
default or whether to work through the Treasury, could there not be some provision in the Bill to allow for that?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultAs I say, partly this is an issue where we have to look at the overall position of the public finances
default, and, p
defaultarticularly in the circumstances that we are in with the public finances
default,
default a degree of caution is always appropriate
default when it comes to these matters. B
defaultut we do believe that, as a matter of practicality, the best ways open for the Welsh Government to borrow are through the National Loans Fund
default,
default with some flexibility as a consequence of commercial borrowing. In truth, 
defaultas to 
defaultthe bonds that are issued by, for example, local authorities, it very rarely happens other than if you
default are looking at—I think in recent years—
defaultBirmingham
default and Transport for London. The reason for that is 
defaultthat there are better ways of doing it.
defaultQ409 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf I could put you on the spot there, is it not the case
default—
defaultand
default,
default if it is, by the way, I agree with you
default—
defaultthat the reason you wish to do that is that the Treasury will maintain some control over how much the Welsh Assembly could borrow, because obviously the Welsh Assembly could issue its own bonds? There would be nothing to stop it from doing so left
default,
default right and centre. It would presumably have to pay higher interest rates, depending on what the international markets thought of the Assembly
default’s credit
defaultworthiness, but ultimately the UK Government would become responsible for any debts that the Assembly might decide to run up. The route which you are taking allows yo
defaultu to have control over that. Some may disagree, but 
defaultI actually think you are doing the right thing if that is what your motive is.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultIt is worth pointing out the overall limit, say
default,
default the £500 million limit
default,
default still applies
default.
defaultQ410 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes, but it would not if they were issuing bonds, would it?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: No, i
defaultt would still apply with bonds. As I say, the approach that the Treasury tends to take, and this is an historic approach, is a certain reluctance to give that power out. But the reality, on a practical level, 
defaultis that 
defaultthat is not the cheapest way in which the Welsh Government would be able to borrow.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI think that was recogn
defaultised by Silk 
defaulttoo, Chairman.
defaultQ411 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultFraming the question slightly differently, it does 
defaultallow
default you to refuse to 
defaultallow 
defaultthe Assembly 
defaultto 
defaultborrow money if you felt that it had not made a good business case for whatever project it 
defaultwanted
default to b
defaultorrow money on.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: The Welsh Government have
default the ability to borrow up to the limit, which is, as I say, £500 million
default, and were income tax to be devolved
default that number would go up.
defaultQ412 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultLet me have one last try and then I will go back. Why not let them issue bonds? After all, if it is going to be cheaper to do it via the UK Government, there is no particular reason why they would go elsewhere anyway, is there, so why not just give them the power to do so?
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultIf your argument is that we should give the Welsh Government power which is in reality not likely to be used
default—  
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat is what we are doing.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: —
defaultthat may be what you want, but I am not sure that necessarily adds anything to the capability of the Welsh Government to deliver for the Welsh people.
defaultChair:default Well, 
defaultI have tried. Thank you.
defaultQ413 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultMoving on to the electoral issues, can I ask the Secretary of State what advantages you see to the ban on dual candidacy?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultThe advantage I see is restoring the position to what it was prior to the Government of Wales Act 2006
default,
default when this proposal was universally condemned. In fact, Mr Chairman, looking around this Co
defaultmmittee today, it is very much déjà 
defaultvu because a lot of the 
defaultm
defaultembers on this Committee sitting here today, myself included, actually carried out pre
default&#x2011;
defaultlegislative
default scrutiny of the Government of Wales Bill.
defaultQ414 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultBut why do you th
defaultink it is the right thing to do?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultWhat I would like to do, if I may, is quote Professor Scully, who I think has given evidence to this Committee on this particular occasion. I was reminded of what he said when he appear
defaulted before this Committee on 18
default October 2005. Someone had referred
default—
defaultyou might remember, Mr Chairman
default—to the proposal as the “Mugabe
default&#x2011;
defaultisation
default of Welsh politics.
default”
default That may strike a chord, Mr Chairman, with you. 
defaultW
defaulthen I asked him about this, 
defaultDr Scully 
defaultfirst of all disapproved of that label because he said it was intemperate, but he went on to say
default—
defaultand I think it is worth quoting
default— “G
defaultiven that the reasons offered in the White Paper for doing this do not stack up, frankly, 
defaultare 
defaultnot supported by the evidence, given also that La
defaultbour currently do not have any m
defaultembers coming through the list so if it is going to create problems for any parties it is going to create problems for the other parties, it is difficult to rule out the hypothesis of partisan motivation. I have no particular 
defaultprivate evidence on that matter
default but, as we say, even if thi
defaults is not intended
default it is unfortunate because it is going to look deeply partisan.
default” He went on to say:
default 
default“
defaultIt appears to be trying to adjust the electoral system in favour of one party against the interests of the other parties
default,
default and it is not being done on an inter
default-
defaultpartisan
default,
default cross
default&#x2011;
defaultparty
default basis.
default”
default 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan we hear from Jessica Morden again?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI agree entirely with everything that Professor Scully said.
defaultQ415 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultAre you not just adjusting it back, though? Are we just ending up in a farcical situation where whoever is in just changes it back and forth?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultNo. It should never have been introduced in the first place. It was a nakedly political measure intend
defaulted to favour the Labour party. 
defaultEvery other party thought that it was thoroughly reprehensible and I am very proud of the fact 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are overturning the
default—
defaultQ416 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultWhat are the positive advantages, though, of letting people stand on both lists for the election? 
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultBecause they can s
defaulttand in two electoral processes.
default 
defaultIn fact,
default under t
defaulthis particular electoral system,
default the ban on dual candidacy is unique to 
defaultWales
default,
default and were we 
defaultengaging in a debate
default I would be asking you to justify its continued existence.
defaultQ417 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultIf you have, 
defaultlet us 
defaultsay, 
defaultin an Assembly election local issues coming
default in 
defaultin
default a particular constituency and on a particular local issue
default—
defaultclosing something or another
default—
defaultthe electorate vote tactically against a particular candidate and then that candidate gets in on the list and is able to call themselves the AM for a local area. Are you happy with that situation?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultThat was the situation that was entirely envisaged until the Labour party decided that it was unpalatable to them politically
default,
default and I think it is right to revert to the position as it
default—
default 
defaultQ418 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultWould you be happy with that position then
default—
defaultyes?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI am entirely happy. That is why I am proposing to put it in the Bill.
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultI
default was going to move on to double-
defaultjobbing then.
defaultChair:default 
defaultNia
default wants to come in quickly on that point first.
defaultQ419 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default C
defaultould
default you
default just clarify a cou
defaultple of things on dual candidacy?
default First,
default as you well know
default, Secretary of S
defaulttate, in the impact assessment the 
defaultresponse from the public was not for reversing the ban
default.
default 
defaultIn his 
defaultevidence
default,
default Professor Scully makes a distinction bet
defaultween what he calls MMM and MMP—
defaultin other words the MMP, which is the proportional idea that we have in Wales where, if you like, the list people are in reverse proportion to what w
defaultas elected in the constituency, 
defaultover eight or nine constituencies or however many are in each block. 
defaultIt
default is a very unusual system, so most of his examples come from MMM where you have a parallel voting for your regional and 
defaultvoting 
defaultfor your own area, which we do not have. We have a proportional thing
default,
default which automatically calculates that. 
defaultM
defaultost of the examples are not all that comparable
default. S
defaulto the problem we have in our particular system is that, as my colleague has just said, you end up with a situation where people think they have not voted for somebody and they actually get them all the same, as you well know in your own seat, where not only did the Labour candidate get in for the constituency but all three of the opposing parties als
defaulto all got in at the same time. I
defaultn other words, you might as well not have bothered to go out to vote.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultThat was a perfectly foreseeable state of affairs from the outset. That was something that was inherent in the system that was put in place in the original Government of Wales Act
default,
default and, frankly, the ban, just to reiterate, on dual candidacy is unique to 
defaultWales
default under this particular system
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf you have regard to the other system that you mentioned
default, it is still pretty rare.
default I think 
defaultthey
default have it in the 
defaultUkraine
default, 
defaultSouth Korea
default and one or two other places. I 
defaultthink that it was a straightforward, nakedly partisan introduction by the Labour party and I am very proud of the fact 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are overturning it.
defaultChair:default We had better move on to double-
defaultjobbing
default where I should declare an interest myself
default.
defaultQ420 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultLess controversially
default then, double-
defaultjobbing. Can you exp
defaultlain why you want to ban double-
defaultjobbing?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt is quite clear that the job of an Assembly Member is a significant one and has become more significant as a consequence of the devolution of primary powers after the 2011 referendum. We take the view that Assembly Members should concentrate on being Assembly Members
default,
default and Members of Parliament should concentrate on being Members of Parliament. 
defaultI
defaultt is a bit disrespectful to Assembly Members to suggest that they have the sort of job that they can fit in on a part
default&#x2011;
defaulttime basis
default—
defaultto sort of do a foreigner.
default I don’t think that is acceptable.
defaultQ421 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultCorrect me if
default I am wrong, but did you double-
defaultjob at one stage?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultNo.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ422 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultThen why does that not apply 
defaultto
default being a councillor
default,
default a Lord or an MEP? Why should it apply just between AMs and MPs
default?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt is generally recognised that the duties of a Member of Parliament and 
defaultthe duties of 
defaultan Assembly Member are fairly onerous. 
defaultI
defaultt is possible to fit in the work of a council
defaultlor—which is still significant,
default but nevertheless not 
defaultas
default onerous as either of the two functions
default—
defaultwith the work of being an MP and an Assembly Member. It is important to distinguish between the level of commitment that we are expecting. I hear constantly that Assembly Members feel that they should be doing more work
default. I
defaultn fact there was a suggestion this week that they should be doing more work. I think, therefore, it is 
defaultreally 
defaultimpossible to fulfil two important functions satisfactorily.
defaultQ423 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultWhat about being an MEP?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: Well, t
defaulthat is a matter for 
defaultEurope
default. They have already introduced a ban on Members of Parliament also sitting as MEPs
default,
default and we feel that if any prohibition should be introduced it should be from Europe rather than Parliament. 
defaultQ424 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default 
defaultI want to ask you a question on this one, Secretary of State. I must admit that I am not wholly convinced about this. I agree with every point you make about the desirability of not having people sit as Assembly Members and as MPs. I think that is right
default. I actually think
default it is a fair point to be made about other jobs as well, including substantial private sector jobs and being an MP 
defaultand being
default an AM. But why do we have to pass a law? The electorate has the power to deal with it. Every political party can ban it within their own systems. Generally speaking, I am suspicious of passing a law to ban something that nobody actually wants.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt is not exactly unprecedented. Of course it is happening in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, as you know, too. 
defaultG
defaultenera
defaultlly, the Government have
default made an assessment that
default,
default 
defaultif 
defaultpeople want to 
defaultbecome Members of Parliament
default,
default 
defaultthey 
defaultshould be full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime Members of Parliament. Similarly, if they want to become Assembly Members, they should be doing 
defaultthat on a full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime basis too. S
defaulto I take your point, but we will have to agree to differ.
defaultQ425 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut, Mr Jones, as a Secretary of State
default,
default you must have very many onerous duties in addition to your role as 
defaulta 
defaultconstituency MP. Surely
default,
default your position as Secretary of State for 
defaultWales
default has not affected your abil
defaultity to serve your constituents.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt 
defaultha
defaults not, Mr Chairman, but I work seven days a week.
defaultQ426 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut surely you can see that it would be possible to hold a position as an Assembly Member or an MP
default,
default and to also hold down another difficult and time
default&#x2011;
defaultconsuming position
default at the same time
default, as I did myself.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: I was going to say
default that you probably are now speaking from experience
default,
default and I am disappointed to hear that Ms Morden is confusing you and me.
defaultQ427 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I h
defaultave n
defaultever had the privilege of the 
defaultred box, but I would have said that probably you have an even more onerous time of it than I did because all of my constituency casework was exactly the same
default,
default taking up no extra time. My problem was managing to do work in Parliament and
default the Assembly—
defaultthe political
default or
default legislative side of it. But I found that it was possible to do it, albeit challenging at times, for a short
default period of time. I must say I agree with 
defaultGlyn
default.
default 
defaultI don’t
default 
defaultreally 
defaultsee why we are makin
defaultg a law on this and why we can’
defaultt simply allow the voters to decide.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: O
defaultne has to bear in mind too that
default,
default since you were an Assembly Member, of course, primary powers have 
defaultnow been devolved. Again,
default 
defaultI think 
defaultwe are goi
defaultng to have to agree to disagree. T
defaulthe view of 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment is very clearly that the focus of elected Members should be either in the Assembly or in Parliament, depending on where they are elected. 
defaultQ428 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultI have one small technical point on the time scale. 
defaultW
defaulte know that there are some current AMs who are going to put their names forward as candidates for the general election in 2015. 
defaultI
defaultf they are list candidates, then there will probably be someone else on the list who can take their place straight away without a by
default&#x2011;
defaultelection, but if they were constituency Assembly Members and they became Members of Parliament in 2015
default—
defaultand there is a six
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth limit by which t
defaultime an election has to be held—
defaultthen obviously an election would be being held just six months before the actual Assembly elections. So is there a case for maybe revisiting that time limit in the Bill and considering whether a year might be more practical?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI would be very interested to hear the views of the Committee
default,
default but the view that we took when considering the Bill was that six months was about right. But
default,
default clearly
default,
default it is not an exact science. 
defaultI
defaultf the Committee wishes to feed in its views, I will be very interested in seeing what those are.
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhich in your first answer you kindly said you would be taking great note of, so we will definitely feed that in. Could I ask 
defaultSiân
default James if she has some questions
default?
defaultQ429 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultI have a quick couple of questions about changing the term and the length of the Assembly. Why do you think it is important that the Welsh Assembly elections do not coincide with the 
defaultUK
default general elections?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI think it is generally accepted that there would be a strong possibility
default—
defaultif not a probability
default—
defaultthat
default, if you like,
default Assembly issues would be overshadowed by national issues. I think it is proper that, at an Assembly election, the focus should be given to those issues for which the Assembly is responsible. What we are seeking to do, as you know, is to ensure, so far as possible, that general elections and Assembly elections do not coincide.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ430 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultWe have a possibility of a clash in 2021 with the local government elections. You are always in some part of the cycle going to have a clash with something. So that could apply to other elections as well.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultThat is true. On the other hand, of course, you have two bodies with primary powers
default.
default I believe it is essential that the elections to those two bodies should not become confused and that the important issues to be considered in an election for the Assembly should not be drowned out by the debate about general election issues.
defaultQ431 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs James:default 
defaultAgain, we have had evidence th
defaultat the Welsh Government believe
default that the changes to the Welsh electoral arrangements should be a matter for them and for the Assembly rather than 
defaultWestminster
default. Would you prefer to maintain the status quo?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultCertainly for the purpose of this Bill we do not intend to make any changes. The Silk Commission, of course, has yet to produce part 2 of its work. It remains to be seen what they recommend in that regard.
defaultQ432 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default I have
default a question on the issue of the capacity of the Welsh Assembly to deal with the proposed new powers 
defaultthat
default are to be devolved. We have heard a lot of evidence claiming that the proposals in question will put a strain on the current number of AMs, which is 60. Do you in any way share those views
default,
default or is it your view that the devolution of further power should result in a change in the working practices of the Welsh Assembly? 
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultThat
default,
default of course
default,
default has attracted interest only this week
default,
default and it seems to me that a significant number of Assembly Members do believe that their own working practices should be reviewed. But I was heartened by
default,
default I think
default,
default the First Minister
default’
defaults comments
default,
default who said that he was quite satisfied that the Assembly, in its current form, could deal quite happily with the fiscal powers
default 
defaultas proposed
default 
defaultthat will be devolved to it.

defaultTherefore, in your view, 60 Members should be sufficient even if there are further powers given.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultYes, otherwise we would not be recommending the devolution of powers to the Assembly.
defaultQ434 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default O
defaultn the issue of whether the decision as to whether there could be more Members or not could be taken in the future, should that be an issue for Westminster
default,
default or could it be an issue for the Welsh Assembly itself?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultThat is not something within the contemplation of this Bill
default,
default and, interestingly, it is not something which is within the remit of the Commission itself because that is something that has been excluded. 
defaultA
defaultgain, to reiterate, 
defaultI 
defaulttake heart from what the First Minister says. I 
defaultbelieve there is plenty of capacity in the Assembly to deal adequately with the 
defaultpowers that are to be devolved—
defaultor we hope will be devolved.
defaultQ435 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultWe certainly have some evidence to support that viewpoint, which I am quite sympathetic with. 
defaultThe other issue I would like to highlight is the issue of the Silk recommendations in terms of legislative control of budgetary issues. Currently
default,
default there is no proposal within the Bill as it stands to devolve those legislative competencies and controls over the budgetary issues. Is there a specific reason why there is a view that we are going to devolve income tax powers perhaps, subject to a referendum, but no devolution of the issues in terms of legislative control of the budgetary process?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI believe it is something that we are giving further consideration to, but
default,
default again
default,
default I think it is a matter that we would welcome the Committee
default’
defaults views on.
defaultQ436 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultFrom a purely practical viewpoint, the Government would be open to practical suggestions in relation to that issue.
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultYes. It is a matter 
defaultto which
default we are giving consideration and I think that any recommendations that this Committee were to make would be paid close attention.
defaultMr defaultGaukedefault: 
defaultIndeed
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaultI think the response to the Silk Commission very much confirmed what the Secretary of State has just said.
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe are coming to a close, bu
defaultt I am quickly looking 
defaultround to see if anyone has any final questions for the Ministers while they are in front of us. Nobody seems to be catching my eye.
defaultQ437 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultI have one question about time scale. When does the Secretary of State think that he will be bringing forward the actual Bill itself?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultClearly, a lot depends upon the work of this Committee
default,
default and that was why I was at pains at the outset to thank this Committee for the hard work it is putting in
default,
default and particularly the speed with which it is proceeding. We hope to publish the Bill as soon as 
defaultparliamentary time allows, and I think
default 
defaultw
defaulte have made that clear repeatedly. 
defaultW
defaulte look forward to your report, which will be an important stage of the process.
defaultQ438 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith: defaultAre we saying it would be through i
defaultts p
defaultarliamentary stages by the next election?
defaultMr Jonesdefault: 
defaultI sincerely hope so. As I say, we have made a commitment
default to proceed with it as soon as p
defaultarliamentary time allows
default,
default and I do not think I can give a clear
defaulter
default indication of our intention to proceed with it than saying that.
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe are grateful to you, Secretary of State. I think the Committee will not mind my saying that probably we would have welcomed it if we could have had a look at the draft Bill earlier given the amount of meetings that we have had to have this month. I am about to call this session to a close, but we are going to meet afterwards in private and start to discuss our findings
default,
default fo
defaultr those who are still available. B
defaultut thank you very much indeed for coming along this afternoon to both Ministers. T
