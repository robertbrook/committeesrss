"&#xa0;\nAFS0064Written evidence submitted by the Nisai Group\n&#xa0;\nThe effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes;&#xa0;\nThe Government claims that the 2012 GCSE results show that sponsored academies were improving at five times the rate of non-academies.  However,\n&#xa0;\nWays in which academies can narrow the gap for disadvantaged c\nhildren include:\n&#xa0;\nUse of Technology In Academies&#xa0;\nO\nne in ten children between the ages of one and 15 has a mental health disorder\n and \n61,570 children in state-funded schools who are recorded as having some kind of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)\n.  These\n two figures alone are terrifying and it is vital that support is given to these young people in education or they will have a higher chance of ending up on the NEETs register.  \nIndeed, only 15% of adults with autism in the UK are in full-time paid \ne\nm\nployment\n.  \n&#xa0;\nAs \nattending school is much harder for a vulnerable young person due to wellbeing, health or bullying issues, the use of o\nnline and blended learning can be adapted to the mainstream environment to allow these young people \nto focus on learning without being bogged down by external influences, which they may struggle to deal with.  In addition, \nit can help to \npromote best pract\nice as any academy involved in the project can pass this information on electronically to others increasing understanding and standards overall.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe \nNisai Virtual Academy (NVA) – created by the Nisai Group delivers the National Curriculum together with so\nme Vocational Qualifications and is completely interactive, allowing students to engage in live lessons with teachers and other students as well as move around the online campus, whilst using the same frameworks as a student would receive in a traditional \nschool.  \n&#xa0;\nIn addition \nyoung people using \nthe Nisai Virtual Academy have an entire virtual support team around them including their subject tutors and a specially assigned tutor to deal with their personal wellbeing.  This has proved to be a very \nsuccessful route for vulnerable young people, and can help them get the support they need to deal better with their mainstream lessons\n.  \n&#xa0;\nReduction of Exclusions&#xa0;\nT\nhere needs to be a rethink regarding the recommendation made by PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding \n“a system for monitoring exclusions in Academies … and provide support to Academies, similar to that provided through Local Authority Behaviour Support Teams… \nto reduce the disproportionate number of exclusions in some Academies”.  This will help to make sure that disadvantaged students are not being unfairly excluded and that students are given the help and education they need if they are excluded for example, \nthrough the use of online and blended learning tools.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/19715\n http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1008038/Unleashing-greatness.pdf\n \nStatistical First Release: Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions From Schools and Exclusion Appeals in England, 2009/10, \nDepartment for Education, 2011\n \nThe Office for National Statistics Mental health in children and young people in Great Britain, 2005\n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2118804/Autism-Number-schoolchildren-classified-autistic-soars-56-years.html\n \nRedman, S et al (2009). \nDon't Write Me Off: Make the system fair for people with autism.\n London: The National Autistic Society, p8\n"
