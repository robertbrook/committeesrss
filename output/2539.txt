I didn’t know that the council would be able to help me with it or that the jobcentre would be involved too. Childcare, rent and travel for the first month was a big worry so it was a great that I could go to the council and get it all sorted under one roof. “&#xa0;&#xa0;Quote from claimant about their experience: &#xa0;“I was under a lot of stress when the cap came in. Even though I did the research it felt like the walls were closing in… I really appreciate what you’ve done. Helpful, informative and understanding; you have been in contact with me for months so you understand on a different level what is really happening with me. It has been really helpful.”&#xa0;&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
