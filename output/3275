defaultWritten evidence submitted by Alan Jordan, owner of Jordan Products Ltd (SRN 051)defaultHaving established my own design and manufacturing business in Ballyclare, Northern Ireland, I have worked with the Highways Agency (HA) since 2002 to develop a fully HA-approved 
defaultmechanised system (Conemaster) to lift and lay traffic cones on the Strategic Road Network with new levels of speed, efficiency and safety. My reason for this submission is to set out how Conemaster can improve the network for all users and to draw on my o
defaultwn experience with HA to illustrate the need for its reform. 
defaultConemaster is a British product which has been independently assessed by the International company Jacobs. It
default’
defaults report in February 2012 accepted that Conemaster had the potential to save lives, 
defaultto provide high value for money and to reduce congestion across the HA strategic road network. Despite being market ready and available since 2006, powerful vested interests working, in my view, with HA have ensured that Conemaster remains excluded from en

defaultIt is a very serious question why, collectively, the HA and all its major contractors on the strategic road network have been able to turn 
defaulttheir back on 
defaulta technology which can provide greater efficiency, improve journey time reliability and reduce road worker casualties without any significant challenge by either Government or Parliament. Conemaster has been excluded from the market since 200
default6, largely through the responses of the HA and its major contractors. In my view this has the appearance of some kind of cartel in operation. They have clearly all decided, possibly in concert, to reject investment in a technology which would bring conside
defaultrable benefits to the public purse and to road users and road workers. Ministers, Parliament and taxpayers rightfully deserve higher standards from the HA especially in dealing with issues where the public interest is so clearly at stake.

defaultMr Fitzpatrick M.P., in a PQ in September 2012 [120374], was informed that there was a total of 47 road worker injuries during 2011 on motorways. Over a 3 year period from 2009 – 2011 there were 2 fatalities involving road workers on mo

default2.1
default 
default Travel disruption caused by road maintenance is a big issue for the road user. Journey time reliability is directly impacted by these road closures. New technology such as Conemaster has been independently assessed by Jacobs to save at least 30 minutes pe
defaultr closure across the Strategic Road Network. Journey Time Reliability would be significantly improved, using Conemaster, for the 21% of road closures which take place during the day (between 6am and 8pm) and the 79% of closures at night (between 6pm and 6a
defaultm).

defaultThe current Aiming for Zero Safety Strategy seeks to eliminate dangerous carriageway crossings by 2016. Carriageway crossings are frequently required to manually carry cones and lamps across often several live motorway lanes. Conemaster would all but elimi

defaultThe adoption of new technology brings with it the potential to effect major efficiencies and cost control. This does not appear to have influenced either the HA

default2.4
default 
default An average saving across the Network of at least 30 minutes per road closure through the adoption of Conemaster has been independently assessed as valid by Jacobs. This would improve Journey Time Reliability across the Strategic Road Network for the 21% o
defaultf road closures during the day (between 6am and 8pm) and the 79% of closures at night (between 6pm and 6am).*

defaultHow should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?  default&#xa0;
default3.1
default 
defaultGovernment policy to increase direct spend 
defaultwith SME’s has the capacity to introduce competition into a market which is already averse to modernisation and investment in new technology.
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReform is required for procurement contracts in respect of SMEs to ensure that small companies are not exploited.
default A TRL draft contract 2009 regarding a Conemaster trial sought the manufacturing and Intellectual Property Rights for Conemaster in bad faith for the benefit of the Crown. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default 
default The method by which Road Worker Safety is managed across the Network is deserving of major reform. For years, a flawed system has evolved which accepts significant conflict of interest between the HA and its major contractors. The Road Worker Safety Forum
default (RoWSaF), chaired by the HA, involves major contractors in the decision making process even though safety concerns and commercial interests are inevitably open to conflict of interest. This potentially allows powerful commercial vested interests to exerci
defaultse considerable influence over any SME wishing to enter this lucrative market with a new innovative, HA-approved, safety-driven product.
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultin my view, this possibly explains the problem of the acceptance of poor data in respect of ‘reportable’ incidents, wh
defaultich has meant that the true extent of “reportable” incidents has not been brought fully to the attention of Ministers and Parliament for many years.

default 
default There is a lack of transparency relating to important matters such as safety. Under-reporting of work-related incidents has existed across the HA Network for many years. Despite this, figures for road worker incidents did

defaultConflicts of interest appear to exist between the HA and major contractors. The industry appears free to dictate cost, effici
