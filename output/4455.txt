[[[CBM]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]CBM recognises that disability and poverty are inextricably linked in a cycle - disability contributes to and deepens poverty on an individual, family and community level, and poverty is often a cause of disability. This means that poverty cannot be addressed without addressing disability.&#xa0;CBM’s work is aligned to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and explicitly promotes inclusive development in relation to all articles, and with specific emphasis on articles 11 (humanitarian assistance) and article 33 (international cooperation).

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[CBM and Livelihoods]]]&#xa0;CBM’s strategic framework for livelihood development stresses the importance of inclusive approaches to skills development, access to financial services, and paid employment, with the underlying aim of enabling persons with disabilities to become productive contributors to social insurance systems. &#xa0;CBM is working actively with the Centre for Financial Inclusion, an industry-facing think tank, at Accion (a global microfinance pioneer) on inclusive livelihood development and access to financial services. CBM is also in dialogue with the Village Savings and Loans organisation (VSL), with a view to including persons with disabilities. VSL is a pioneer in village savings and loans, and has nearly nine million members, mostly in Africa.

[[[&#xa0;]]]In recent years there has been marked growth in the number of persons with disabilities becoming involved in open employment, cooperatives, micro-finance and savings &amp; loans schemes. Last year, CBM skills development and work creation programmes reach over 100,000 people with disabilities. &#xa0;Participatory planning is used to involve the individual with a disability and his or her family, together with the economic realities of the community in which the individual lives, taking into account what products and services are in high demand and short supply. &#xa0;A twin-track approach of economic empowerment of persons with disabilities, together with sustained advocacy for inclusive livelihood development at local, national and international levels has been shown to be a successful model of engagement.&#xa0;

[[[Case Study: Inclusive Development through Organic Farming ]]]&#xa0;“Inclusive Development through Organic Farming” is a five-year project and initiative of CBM partner Naman Seva Samiti, with the aim of providing livelihood opportunities for a total of 1,500 farmers with disabilities and their families in Madhya Pradesh, central India. &#xa0;This is the first project in India which trains people with disabilities in organic farming in their local language. Participants in the programme include people with physical, hearing and visual impairments as well as parents of children with disabilities. During the project, farmers will develop a cooperative movement where they are responsible for the entire production and marketing cycle.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Each year, 300-350 farmers receive training in soil testing, the production of organic manure, crop selection and processing of products through a mix of both theory lessons at the training centre and practical sessions in the fields. Farmers also take part in exposure visits to learn from the experiences of other farmers’ groups and organisations in different parts of the country. In addition to training, Naman provides transportation, promotion and marketing support and reaches out to larger markets and suppliers of bigger supermarkets wherever feasible.&#xa0;Naman’s advocacy activities at government level in Madhya Pradesh have led to the state government providing technical support for the project and declaring Athner block as an ‘organic block’. Already, other organisations are approaching Naman to share its experiences and gain help in establishing pilot projects in other parts of India.

[[[Farmer showing her organic vegetable production]]]  &#xa0;Most importantly, the project is bringing significant change to the lives of persons with disabilities and their families. Persons with disabilities are leading a process of economic empowerment and agricultural innovation, changing perceptions within the wider community, giving hope to thousands of persons with disabilities in rural India. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[CBM and Inclusive Education]]]&#xa0;There is a growing recognition that the inclusion of children with disability in mainstream schools builds self-confidence and self-respect through social inclusion, as well as increasing employment choices. Governments around the world are therefore starting to introduce inclusive education as a strategy in their mainstream education programmes. &#xa0;CBM is working with our partners to forward the inclusive education agenda through targeted programme work and advocacy initiatives in a number of inclusive education projects. Challenges of the quality of education for all children (in particular children with disabilities), accessibility of school sanitation and toilets also remain high on the CBM agenda. &#xa0;CBM is also a key partner in the Global Campaign for Education 2014 which is highlighting the inclusion of children with disability in Education.&#xa0;

[[[ India]]]&#xa0;CBM and Mobility India are supporting persons with disabilities and their families to gain greater inclusion in their communtiies by taking part in decision making,  and to gaining access to employment, health and education.&#xa0;Mobility India trains and supports after-school club coordinators to run daily after-school clubs for children from families with disabilities. These coordinators serve as inspiring role models as many are persons with disabilites themselves, so they bring their own valuable experience to their work.

[[[ ]]]In addition, government teachers are trained on inclusive approaches to their classroom practise and how to develop individual education plans for children with disabilities and special educational needs. &#xa0;The after-school clubs and school teachers work together to meet the needs of the children and ensure that the individual education plans provide a framework for each child to progress towards reaching his or her full potential.&#xa0;Local advocacy initiatives are starting to grow as the inclusive education trained teachers and after school club coordinators raise awareness of disability-related issues.

[[[CBM and Mental Health]]]&#xa0;The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1 in 4 people will experience an episode of mental illness in their lifetime, and that 300-400 million people worldwide are disabled as a consequence. 85% of these people are in low and middle income countries.&#xa0;CBM is an active member of the Movement for Global Mental Health, and supports three calls for action related to the post-2015 development agenda and mental health. &#xa0;

[[[Case Study: ]]]

[[[A voice for mental health in Sierra Leone]]]&#xa0;In Sierra Leone, mental health needs are especially great as a result of the 1991-2002 civil war that left deep scars on the nation's psychological well-being and its social capital. A whole generation of young people missed out on education, and continues to struggle to participate in the economy. People with psychosocial disabilities in Sierra Leone are often ostracised from their communities and human rights violations are common. This may be due to traditional beliefs that attribute mental illness to spiritual causes and often blame the person with the problem. A lack of public health awareness and negative attitudes surrounding mental illness has contributed to high levels of stigma and discrimination.  &#xa0;Existing services consist of a single national psychiatric hospital, which has shortages of staff, medication, and other essential resources, resulting in challenging conditions, including routine chaining of patients. The few civil society services that started after the war are now closed. With no decentralized mental health services available through government health services, people must rely on traditional treatment or travel to the hospital in the capital Freetown.&#xa0;

[[[The Mental Health Coalition of Sierra Leone]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Mental Health Coalition of Sierra Leone was founded in September 2010 with the purpose of creating a body that empowers stakeholders to advocate for their rights, promoting practical change that will improve quality of life and inclusion in society. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[CBM and Disaster Preparedness]]]&#xa0;CBM knows that the involvement of persons with disabilities disaster management planning saves lives.  Disasters have a huge impact on human infrastructure, and livelihoods. The key to diminishing their impact is to reduce people’s vulnerability. Through inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programmes, incorporated in human development plans and poverty reduction programmes, risks can be reduced and communities’ resilience to disasters can be strengthened.Persons with disabilities are often overlooked throughout the disaster management cycle and especially during relief operations, and are seldom considered as important actors in conflict prevention even though they are often more exposed during conflicts and displacement. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), in its articles 11 and 32, requires that persons with disabilities benefit from and participate in disaster relief, emergency response and disaster risk reduction strategies as persons with disabilities are the most vulnerable in a disaster situation. The disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction training run by CBM partners in the Philippines before Typhoon Haiyan struck has shown how effective this can be through the number of lives saved.  &#xa0;CBM adheres to the key principles for inclusive disaster risk reduction policies which include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case Study: Putting Disability on the agenda of Disaster Risk Mana]]]

[[[gement]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Disability Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction Network for Asia and Pacific participated in the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Management in Geneva in May 2013. The network achieved its objective of assuring that disability is included and mainstreamed across disaster risk reduction management projects and working towards a disability-inclusive post Hyogo Framework for Action. For the first time disability was included in the outcome document. “Even the best early warning systems and preparedness efforts to evacuate populations in dangers do not address fully the diversity of disabilities that we have in our societies. The only way to address this is to ensure that persons with disability are involved in the deism and planning of the systems that are designed to protect the safety of the population in all countries.” Margareta Wahlstrom, Special Representative for UNISDR.&#xa0;

[[[CBM and Community Based Rehabilitation ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]CBM has been instrumental is the adoption of the Community-based rehabilitation (CBR) approach which is now an integral part of most CBM supported partners approach to disability- inclusive development, ensuring that projects and programmes meet the requirements of people with disabilities and their families in their own communities through a holistic approach to a person and their environment in the areas of health, education, livelihood, social inclusion, skill development and empowerment.

[[[: Elim Programme, ]]]

[[[Igede Nigeria ]]]&#xa0;The Christian Vocational Training Centre “Elim” runs a community- based rehabilitation programme, aiming to empower and build the capacities of persons with disabilities. It covers a large rural area in Benue State in central Nigeria with a population of about 300,000. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Needs assessments by community workers clearly identify the problems faced by persons with disabilities and mothers/parents who have children with disabilities in this region. These include: &#xa0;Services are then offered to persons with disabilities and include eye surgery, orthopaedic surgery, rehabilitation services, special education for both people with hearing and visual impairments and an economic integration programme. An orthopaedic workshop has also recently been developed. &#xa0;Experts in education and physiotherapy provide additional support in the community. The Elim programme team also dedicates a significant amount of time and effort to raising awareness of disability within the local communities to reduce the stigma and discrimination that many persons with disabilities face.

[[[Key Recommendations]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]December 2013                            1. The MH Coalition of Sierra Leone was started under the Enabling Access to MH in Sierra Leone programme, funded by EU and CBM, and implemented by CBM, GIP, University of Makeni, City of Rest, and CAPS. It is also supported by the University of Ibadan mhLAP programme, funded by the Australian Government and CBM   Women’s Commission for Refugee Women and Children. “Disabilities among refugees and conflict affected populations”, Women’s Commission for Refugee Women and Children, New York, 2008. Article 11 - States Parties shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law,… all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters. Article 32 – International Cooperation a) Ensuring that international cooperation, including international development programmes, is inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities. The rehabilitation and reconstruction phases after a disaster provide a good starting point for building a better and a more inclusive society for all. If disability is taken into account in reconstruction of physical infrastructures (schools, hospitals, clinics, public buildings, roads etc.), in community planning, in workforces, in monitoring and evaluation, a solid ground for a more equitable society can be built.
