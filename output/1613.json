"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Crown Estate (CCS19)Summary:The key messages articulated below can be summarised as the following:-&#xa0;\nThe Crown Estate welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to\n the\n Commons Select Committee inquiry into carbon capture and storage (CCS)\n.\n  \nT\nhe focus of our\n response \nis \non the offshore transport and storage components\n,\n \nas this is where we are able to bring to bear an in\n-\ndepth understanding of the potential benefits that \nCCS could have\n,\n as well as the barriers to development and ways to overcome them\n. \n The statements contained are in the context of The Crown Estate’s role and \nresponsibilities with \nregards to \nrights to leasing of carbon dioxide transportation and storage in\nfrastructure \nwithin areas \non \nand beneath \nthe \nUK \nseabed\n that we manage\n. \n \nThe Crown Estate has been working with\n the CCS\n industry\n on project specific cases, (including power station developers, potential industrial users and potential storage providers)\n \nas\n well as \nthrough the CCS Cost Reduction Task Force\n in 2012/13, which was chaired by the CCSA, \nto identify ways of \nhelping to \nreduc\ne\n the cost of \ndeploying \nCCS infrastructure\n and promoting an intelligent systems design in the 2020s. \nThe Task Force signalled \nthe importance of storage to the cost and deployment of this technology and highlighted \naspects\n such as \nstorage \nsite availability and \nstore \nviability as being critical to its delivery. \n We are now leading an industry Transport and Storage Development Group\n to take forward recommendations of the Task Force and assist delivery of proven storage sites and transport infrastructure.\nDuring the past year, we signed the UK’s first two Agreements for Lease for the permanent geological storage of CO2, representing a\n positive milestone in the plan to build a demonstration project in the UK. These agreements provide exclusive time-limited options with pre-agreed terms for leases, allowing developers to progress their projects through to a Final Investment Decision (FID\n).\nWe suggest that any policy developed for CCS needs to enable opportunistic deployment for all sectors that can make use of the infrastructure, e.g. the offshore oil and gas sector (enhanced oil recovery (EOR) &amp; enhanced gas recovery (EGR)), \nnatural gas \nprocessing, coal and gas fired power generation, and \nindustrial \nprocesses such as iron and steel\n.  \nIn order to de-risk the delivery of the UK’s aspirations for energy security, decarbonisation and retention of its industries in a low carbon world, w\ne belie\nve that domestic policy should support a clear route to market across \nall \nthese\n sectors\n \nthat can leverage an early clear\n route to market for the power sector.\nIn\n our view policy should help drive both ends of the \nCCS \nchain (capture, along with transport and storage) towards \ndeployment of \nfull chain \ninfrastructure\n (through incentives and obligations)\n,\n as well as clearly setting out how this sits alongside the wider discussion on energy security.  This should include pro\nviding incentives for bringing storage forward at a pace that delivers de-risked stores, in parallel with designing and developing new low carbon fossil fuel power stations.\n&#xa0;\nQuestions posed in call for evidence:Each of the questions asked by the Committee has been considered in turn. \n \nWe have focused the submission of evidence primarily on those \nin which we can add most value \nfrom the experience we have gained \nin our role \nat\n The Crown Estate\n.\nIt was clear from our work on the cost reduction taskforce that \ncapture \ntechnology providers will be able to answer this in far more precise detail \nthan \nwe could offer on post\n-combustion, pre-combustion or oxyfuel techniques and product delivery.\n  The capabilities of CO\n2\n transport and storage technologies have been demonstrated elsewhere, for example in North America and Norway, over many years and experience in these operation\ns is best provided by the oil and gas industry.\nIt is widely acknowledged\n that tackling climate change requires \na \nglo\nbal \nresponse\n.\n \n \nThe International Energy Agency\n (IEA)\n considers successful deployment of CCS as critical to global efforts \nin\n mitigat\ning\n climate change and to keep\ning\n global warming \ntemperature rises \nbelow 2°C.\n \nFor the UK\n, the 80% reduction in greenhouse ga\nses by 2050 (as defined by the Climate Change Act 2008) requires a significant \nchange in the way we generate and use energy\n. Projections from the Committee on Climate Change show that the power sector will need to be largely decarbonised by around 2030 in \norder to be on track to hit the 2050 targets (given the difficulties in achieving emissions reductions elsewhere in the economy\n)\n.\n \nMany alternate scenarios can be created as to what the energy mix could or should \nlook like \nin the future\n; but one thing which seems clear is that by just shifting the fossil fuel use from coal to gas will not in itself deliver the targets that are required in the Climate Change Act\n (2008)\n – particularly given the \nextent of \n“locked-in” fossil fuel plant, whic\nh has been made \nmore certain\n by the gas generation strategy and the grandfathering of gas plants\n under the Emissions Performance Standard\n.  \nCCS can be used with both coal or gas power stations and therefore early deployment of transport and storage infrast\nructure can provide an effective hedge, keeping options open for \neither fuel within the nation’s \nlow carbon \nportfolio.\nBoth DECC and the Committee on Climate Change identify the primary options for power sector decarbonisation to 2030 as (in no particular \norder): large scale renewables, nuclear, CCS, and energy efficiency. DECC’s CCS Roadmap identifies that CCS has the potential to be one of the most cost effective technologies for decarbonisation of the UK’s power and industrial sectors. In the power secto\nr, CCS has a unique \nplace \nin providing a continuing role for flexible fossil fuel capacity that is able to respond to demand in the way that other low carbon technologies \ncan\nnot. \nOf course it is understood that the three-stage process of CCS, including tra\nnsportation and storage, has yet to be demonstrated on large scale power stations, which is why the successful deployment of projects in the DECC commercialisation programme is critical.\nBeyond the power sector, \nCCS is almost unique in its \npotential \nto hel\np reduce emissions from industries where there are no alternative abatement technologies e.g. cement\n,\n \nfertiliser \nand \nsteel \nproduction processes\n.\n \n \nWhilst we feel that CCS power projects are likely to come before industrial CCS; smaller scale industrial proj\nects do need to start sooner rather than later in order to leverage synergies wherever possible to ensure that learning occurs in sufficient time to hit decarbonisation targets beyond 2030.\n \n \nDECC and the Committee on Climate Change have outlined \na wide ran\nge of scenarios for the relative contribution \nof low carbon technologies \nin recent publications\n.\n \nFigure 1: DECC Scenarios for installed capacity in 2030 (GW)Figure 2: CCC Scenarios for installed capacity in 2030 (GW) – note that all the scenarios presented reach a power sector emissions intensity of 50g/KWhOur observations on these scenarios are as follows:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe scenarios \ndemonstrate that CCS could potentially make a very significant contribution to decarbonisa\ntion by 2030 – with up to 15GW of capacity envisaged.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the level of ambition for 2030 power sector decarbonisation increases, the need for CCS to make a contribution also increases. CCS makes a very significant contribution to all of the scenarios which \nhit 50g/KWh by 2030 (for example 9GW in DECC’s scenarios; 10-15GW in CCC’s scenarios).\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCS could play an important balancing role alongside other low carbon technologies such as nuclear and renewables.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe risk of not developing CCS is that decarbonisation\n options become more limited, and power sector decarbonisation becomes much harder to achieve.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst\n the scenarios show potential for CCS, they also highlight the uncertainty \npower generators face in making investment decisions without targeted policies t\nhat go beyond the renewables focus of t\nhe EMR Delivery Plan\n.\n \nIn order to give greater confidence to the CCS industry, it will be important for the government to provide\n early and \nconsistent signals over the level of ambition for decarbonisation\n; and f\nurth\ner \ndetails on \nto how CCS \nwill be supported \nbeyond the current commercialisation programme\n. It will be important to consider the contribution CCS can make in reducing industrial emissions as well as power sector emissions. \n&#xa0;T\nhe storage space (and use of) in the North Sea \ncreates an\n export opportunit\ny\n \nfor sell\ning\n the service of permanently dispos\ned\n \nCO\n2\n \nthat \noriginat\ned\n from\n European countries need\ning\n \nstorage\n.\n \n Many countries will be looking to the North Sea rather than using dry land storage potential.\n&#xa0;\nIn relation to \na\n \nNorth Sea \n“storage market”\n, there is an opportunity for large scale deployment through the development of infrastructure (pipelines to storage) in a coordinated manner. \nI\nt would seem prudent for the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and other North \nSea\n basin countries to collaborate in o\nrder to drive forward early projects.\n \n \nThis would help to increase trade and supply chain opportunities\n.\n&#xa0;\nPotential \neconomic opportunities \nwill exist \nfor UK supply chains that currently support the North Sea oil and gas industry\n.  If a CO\n2\n transport and st\norage sector is encouraged to develop it will be possible to transfer skills, services and supply chains from oil and gas construction and operations.  Any decline in North Sea activity could be compensated for in CTS activity.  Growth could also be possib\nle if CTS \ndeployment\n was to leverage oil and gas activity in both conventional storage and CO\n2\n enhanced hydrocarbon recovery.  \nAny roll-out of CCS power and industrial plant will increase the need for supply chains providing capture technologies and associ\nated services. \n&#xa0;\nThe Crown Estate is very supportive of the\n £1bn commercialisation programme capital grant and \ncontract for difference\n support \nbeing provided by the Government \nfor the two early projects\n – these projects will help understand deployment \nand operational barriers along with the viability\n \nof full scale\n CCS power generation. \nIn a European context this is very progressive and \nan excellent kick-start for\n the sector.  \nThis section will focus on \nwhere we see the barriers that can potentially prevent CCS being a viable option for energy decarbonisation and \nwhich can create a gap between aspiration and delivery in the UK.\n \n \nThese \nbarriers \ncan be seen as risks that need to be managed and mitigated.  W\ne have provided some suggestions for \nmitigating these risks\n.\nContracts for Difference&#xa0;\nThe EMR framework \noffers \na\n suite of measures to support and encourage the deployment of non-commercial technologies for energy system decarbonisation. In respect of CCS, it is\n \nthe \nContract for Difference Feed in Tariff \n(\nCfD FiT\n)\n that will be used initially to remunerate b\noth of th\ne projects \nthat are currently preferred bidders in the DECC \ncommercialisation \ncompetition\n. This FiT is suitable for the first demonstration projects alongside capital grants because they are full chain and have an integrated transport and storage solution \nallowing for risk and liability sharing to be established ahead of final investment decision (FID).\n&#xa0;\nCfD FiT focuses on\n, and is designed for, \nthe investment risks involved in power generation projects.  \nAs with the first commercialisation project\ns\n, this ap\nproach only \naddresses \nthe risk and risk sharing for full chain CCS projects.  \nHowever t\nransport and permanent storage of CO\n2\n as a disposal service face\ns\n a number of complex investment and deployment issues with risks that are quite different from those in \npower generation.\n&#xa0;\nIn order for \nfuture CCS \nprojects to benefit from CfD FiTs, they will \ntherefor \nneed to have reached agreement across the full CCS chain.  Power generators generally do not have the expertise to develop CO\n2\n transport and storage solutions,\n and are dependent on third parties to agree novel business structures and counterparty arrangements to deal with the complex new value chain.  \nUnder the EMR framework there is therefor\ne\n a significant drag on \npower generators even being able to negotiate a\n CfD.  Furthermore, \nwho, without an incentive, could deliver transport and storage infrastructure ahead of a guaranteed income?\n \n \n&#xa0;\nAnother barrier to the development of efficiently sized CTS infrastructure under EMR arises because \nCfD FiT \n funding \nis directed \nto the power \ngenerator \nonly\n.  A\ns power plant developers will not build capture plant without guaranteed assurances of access to a transport and storage\n solution\n \nproject development will\n likely \nbe \nlimit\ned\n to point to point projects rather than e\nncourage over sizing and sharing of infrastructure.\n \n \nK\ney to the success of CCS \ndelivery \nwill be avoid\ning the\n uncoordinated deployment of full chain integrated projects over the next decade\n, as this would\n do little to promote a\nn integrated\n transport infrast\nructure \napproach \nor the development of storage hubs\n – both of which will lead to substantial cost reductions\n. \n \nSuch ‘point to point’ CCS projects will suffer economically from having \nunnecessarily \nexpensive transport and storage systems.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nBecause of thes\ne timing, business model and coordination barriers, a significant risk therefor\ne\n exists that CCS will not become a viable option for power generators because the necessary disposal infrastructure will not be independently built.\n  \nThe Crown Estate is develo\nping an understanding of the market failures that we believe will stand in the way of the development of a mature CTS infrastructure and therefor\ne\n CCS as a viable power generation option.  Workshops with industry representatives have provided a comprehensi\nve background to various sources of market failures impeding the development of CTS infrastructure. \n&#xa0;\nThe activities of Capture, Transport and Storage of CO\n2\n differ by industry type, risk/return profile and their development stage and must therefore be tac\nkled appropriately. \nStorage development lead times can \nbe \naround 10\n years \nfor a new unexplored site \ncompared to an average of 5 years for power generation projects.\n \n \nEncouraging up-front investment in de-risking storage and providing ’proven and bankable’ \nstores will need to be a key policy focus.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn light of the above, \nThe Crown Estate believes there are risks \nin the current approach to\n \n‘\nrolling out\n’\n CCS on power generation beyond the demonstration phase \nand we see that this could be addressed through \nenhancing EMR with additional interventions that recognise the particular complexities of the CCS value chain\n. \n \nThe power sector needs to see the \nrequirement and purpose\n \nof \nCCS and needs to have the storage solutions delivered to them.\n&#xa0;\nCapacity MarketWe suggest that existing government policy for CCS and \nthe \nEMR \ncapacity mechanism \nin combination with the gas generation strategy and \nCarbon Capture Readiness (\nCCR\n)\n creates\n \na further barrier to the development transport and storage infrastructure due to no\n clear imperative for developers to invest in CO\n2\n disposal.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Capacity Market\n \nis \ndesigned \nto ensure there is sufficient capacity in place to cope with peaks and troughs in demand.  This can, however, lead to a large amount of money \nbeing spent on\n plan\nt\ns\n with ever-decreasing load factors over the next 15-20 years.  The alternative is that this plant is fitted with CCS and efficiently utili\ns\nes a transport and storage infrastructure \nsolution \nthat has been facilitated through smart policies in addition to \nEMR.\n  \nETI energy system modelling has indicated that deployment of CCS-equipped power generation will lead to a lower overall cost of decarbonisation for the UK economy. \n&#xa0;\nCarbon PriceCarbon pricing can only influence power generator behaviour not\n that of\n the companies who are potential\n CTS \ninfrastructure \ndevelopers.  Whilst the carbon price floor can be a market mechanism to drive investment \nby producers of carbon emissions \nit does \nexacerbate the timing, coordination and \nphasing problem \nhighlighted above.\n  Without a penalty on emissions commensurate with the cost of building the full CCS chain there are not likely to be investment\ns\n \nin CTS infrastructure.  With the current carbon price floor trajectory\n \nthere is a high risk that \ninvestment decisions \non CCS-e\nquipped gas power plants would not be influenced\n \nuntil \nthe mid-late 2020s.\n&#xa0;\nIndustrial CCSIndustrial decarbonisation is likely to require its own bespoke set of policies and support interventions.  However, it will require CTS infrastructure to be in \nplace in advance if the least cost pathway is to be achieved and to ensure that industry is not adversely affected.  Logically this means that the use of CTS in power should be planned and designed with the whole system in mind.\n&#xa0;\nOvercoming the barriersTo\n \nde-risk the viability of CCS as cost effective decarbonisation option \npolicy interventions \nare required to address \nthe structural problem \nthat\n C\nO2 transport and storage needs \na development pathway in parallel to EMR\n. \n \nAs it stands, EMR requires all CTS i\nnfrastructure to be funded from payments made to the power station (a trickle-down funding approach).  \nAn alternative would be a direct revenue stream for transporting and storing CO\n2\n, which results in removing (or lowering) one element of contractual risk\n for both the power station and the transport/store operator.\n \n As all of the initial projects would by definition, need to be full chain, direct funding for the CTS infrastructure would not significantly impact the risk for early projects.  Any payment to \nthe Transport and Store would net directly off payments that would have been made to the power station under EMR.  Once multiple CCS projects are operating in the UK\n,\n direct funding can reduce risk for all parties by providing greater price certainty and l\nower contract\nual\n risk.  The eventual contracting structure that arises in the industry will partially dictate the impact of this intervention.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nRevenue \nc\nould most likely come from the CfD FiT\n funding body that is paid via a levy on suppliers and be delivered in the form of a fee per tonne of CO\n2\n.  If the revenue would otherwise have been supplied by a CfD FiT such a scheme could be reasonably cost-neutral.\n \n&#xa0;\nInformation on most of the potential storage sites in the UKCS is still sparse. \n \nCollection of the necessary data is time-consuming and at the later stages of site characterisation costly. The gap between initial site screening and operation therefore puts\n significant capital at risk. \n \nThis will be most noticeable when developing new geological formations.  Not surprisingly, storage is therefore currently regarded as the most risky part of the CCS chain for project developers.\n \nSpecifically targeted storage \nexploration subsidies focused on early-stage development of the industry, could be used to target ‘new’ areas of storage or incremental work at existing storage sites (which would bring wider benefits).  \nA lower limit on\n \npre-FID exploration and appraisal\n c\nost \nis likely to be \nin the region of \n+\n£\n50\nm per storage site\n.\n \n The incentive could be relatively revenue neutral for Government if it was associated with a project which would otherwise have required a higher CfD FiT. \n \nAny\n exploration subsidies could encou\nrage early appraisal of storage and provide benefits through the de-risking of the wider storage area and gains from knowledge sharing to the CTS industry.\nInvestment in storage site appraisal could \nalso \nbe encouraged through different tax break options. O\nne option is \na c\nross-sector tax break which would allow losses or some form of ‘allowances for investment’ to be transferred from the CCS industry to other activities undertaken by the same company even if it is completely outside the CCS sphere. \n \nFor exam\nple if a potential s\ntorage developer\n was able to expense &gt;100% of their exploration cost against oil/gas income this could act as a sufficient primer\n.  \nThis can change the perspective of oil and gas operators late in a field life if they could appraise fro\nm their platform and potentially convert the facility. \n \nIts key benefit would be to encourage companies who would otherwise not be involved in CCS to get involved and provide equity at the early stage of the industry roll-out.  It could help\n to\n incentivise\n oil companies who due to their skills and expertise are seen as key stakeholders but have no incentive to get involved at present into the sector.\n \nTax breaks could be relatively revenue neutral for Government as an improvement in project economics through a tax break should enable a lower CfD FiT price to be paid to power stations offsetting the loss in tax revenue.  \n&#xa0;\nThe\n setting \nof \ntargets / emissi\non \ndrivers offer\n an understandable and robust commitment that would offer the power and storage industry the level of security it needs to invest in CCS. \n \nThe lack of targets / emissions drivers for CO\n2\n emissions \ninevitably \ncreates uncertainty for investor\ns. \n A target \nc\nould be seen as a positive rather than a negative thing to\n pursue\n.  \n&#xa0;Taking CCS from an early stage technology to a commercially viable one \nwhich is \nsuitable for private sector development and widely adopted\n,\n will require reducing the overal\nl costs\n, \n includ\ning\n the cost of capital sufficiently enough to make CCS commercially competitive with traditional generating technologies.\n \n While the outcome from DECC’s commercialisation programme may result in one or two projects\n being successfully devel\noped\n, the challenge will be how to maintain momentum among other projects \nwhich have been \nunsuccessful in obtaining DECC funding and \nto \nscale up the industry beyond that.\n&#xa0;\nSupport beyond EMR for follow-on projects needs to be progressed if the sector is to\n be capable of ramping up, lowering costs and making a large scale contribution \nto the energy mix \nthrough\nout\n the 2020s. \n \nThe first follow\n-\non CCS projects will need to progress\n (\npotentially to \nFID),\n before many learnings\n have emerged from the projects supported by DECC’s commercialisation programme. \n \nGiven the challenges identified for the sector\n,\n there is a real risk that without targeted intervention\n,\n follow-on projects will not emerge\n.\n \n \nIn the long\n \nrun\n,\n projects need t\no be investable without the benefit of public funding\n.\n \n \nT\nhis will require significant progress on a range of issues and \nis \nnot \nable to \nbe delivered by the market on its own.  Further targeted intervention is required to facilitate these developments and de\nliver these opportunities.\n \n This is not about capital grants as they do not resolve structural failings; instead smart design of policy drivers is required to bring forward the sector to invest in the technology on a realistic scale.\n&#xa0;We would propose that the two best starting places to cover these issues are the \nEU CCS Directive, which places \nvery stringent requirements related to storage site selection, characterisation and monitoring\n, along with the FAQ’s that can be found at\n (\nhttp://www.ccsassociation\n.org/faqs/ccs-general/\n. The CCSA has a working group dedicated to this area.\n&#xa0;On a wider global scale\n,\n it can be seen that th\ne drivers for delivery of projects in Australia, Canada and \nthe \nUSA are all very different to the UK and largely derive from \nassistance such as grants and loan guarantees that support a semi-viable conventional business model\n. \n Examples include\n \ndevelopment\n of \n(15%) CO\n2\n-rich \ngas fields \nfor LNG export\n,\n tar sand oil fields \ncombined with \nEOR, or commercial EOR operations.\n  In \nNorth America\n,\n CO\n2\n \nhas a commercial value and \ncan be sold for use \nin oil production using EOR\n.\n \n \nTherefore there is\n no obvious cross-over to the UK\n model,\n although\n we do agree that\n all the deploying countries offer lessons to be learned.\n  Capture plants are being built on power stations in both Canada and the USA. \n&#xa0;\nNorway \nincentivised the use \nof CCS \nin offshore \ngas pr\noduction \nthrough\n a carbon tax, however similarly to the countries above there is an associated conventional business model in the production and sale of natural gas.  Norway has plans to \ndeploy CCS on the combined heat and power plant \nat Mongstaad \n(\nwith go\nvernment support\n)\n, where there is an industrial scale test facility currently using waste gas from the refinery\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn contrast to these countries, the UK’s approach for encouraging\n CCS beyond the commercialisation programme relies on a mixture of policies using “carrots” and “sticks”, including CfD FiTs, Carbon price floor and the emissions performance standard.  \nIt is our view that carbon floor prices are not a driving force in th\ne short to medium term unless they go immediately to £50 /tonne (or thereabouts).  This also means that the ETS is unlikely to drive European projects. By way of contrast, the Norwegian carbon tax was set at a level that meant avoiding emissions was\n \nthe pr\neferred outcome.  \n&#xa0;\nIn relation to the \npricing of CO\n2\n emissions as a penalty \nand\n its role in the delivery of CCS, we note that \nunder the current UK carbon floor price trajectory of £30/tonne in 2020 rising to £70/tonne in 2030\n \nthe level at which \npower gene\nrators \nwould be incentivised to build CCS \nCCGTs\n \nrather than pay the penalty \nwould unlikely \noccur until the mid-late 2020’s at the earliest\n. \n \nTherefor\n unabated gas will remain \na \npreference and transport and storage infrastructure will not be built until \nbeyond the mid 2020’s\n. \n \nThis delay in deployment will mean costs will not be reduced ahead of essential use of the \ntechnology \nin \nthe 2030’s\n \nfor achieving emissions targets \nin both power and \nindustry\n. \n \n&#xa0;The roadmap was important in setting out the need for CCS and stating its role as a key technology in the fight against the dangers of climate change. \nHowever, the\n roadmap did not set out a route \nto market for the transportation and storage segments of CCS. Without the delivery of this infrastructure \nwe believe \nthe \nviability of CCS as an option for decarbonisation is at risk\n. \n&#xa0;\nKey risks to CCS development not addressed by the roadmap include: \n \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nf\ninance and cost (lack of suitable incentives and drivers to encourage projects and make them viable); \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nstorage (the need to provide up-front proven bankable stores, how they can be accessed and delivered to the market\n);\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndevelopment of transport and storage\n infrastructure independent of power generation decisions\n;\n and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe lack of real power sector economics and drivers (and therefore desire) for CCS deployment.\n&#xa0;\nAs discussed earlier, we suggest that any policy developed for CCS needs to enable opportunistic \ndeployment for all sectors that can make use of the infrastructure.  This means creating incentives and pathways that can work as proxies for the business models existing in other countries.  We believe the whole financial model for delivery also needs to \nbe re-explored by collaborative regional groups such as the UK, with Norway and the Netherlands.  The North Sea Basin is an asset that can be used for Europe and will be needed to meet European decarbonisation aspirations.  Hence the energy system will nee\nd infrastructure so that CO\n2\n could be transported from countries without the benefit of offshore storage solutions.\n&#xa0;\nQuite simply we would flag that the IEA has said CCS is essential. \nTo stimulate an industry, by demonstrating the UK’s ability to achieve delivery of CCS\n \nin a complicated offshore environment, then it will contribute to the confidence that CCS is a “real” \nsolution, both in a European and global context.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWe trust that you will find these comments constructive\n and w\ne would be very willing to provide additional information on any of the points we have raised above. \n \nAll of this response may be put into the pu\nblic domain and there is no part of it that should be treated as confidential.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Energy Act 2008 – “GISZ” Gas importation and storage zone\n DECC (July 2013) Consultation on the Draft Electricity Market Reform Delivery Plan; Committee on Climate Change (May 2013) \nNext steps on Electricity Market\n \nReform – securing the benefits\n \nof low-carbon investment\n ZEP (Zero Emissions Platform) actually su\nggests a medium case for a large unexplored aquifer could be c£300m, whereas the lower amount could refer to a known reservoir site. \n"
