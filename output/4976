defaultSummarydefault1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK’s Department for International Development (
defaultDFID
default)
default 
defaulthas provided t
defaulthe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) 
defaultwith
default 
defaulttwo
default 
defaultgrants
default totaling £6 million (FY10/11-14/15) for 
defaultan extensive 
defaultlegal advocacy project targeting Israeli policy in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is one of the largest disbursements from a government to a non-governmental organization (NGO) in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict. NGO Monitor is unaware of any similar DFID grant anywhere in the worlddefault,default in both size and scopedefault,default targeting the judicial system of a democratic defaultstatedefault.default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis massive DFID 
defaultfunding, which is 
defaultin turn transferred 
defaultby NRC to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs, is being used 
defaultto pursue hundreds of legal cases aimed at defaultinfluencing defaultIsraeli policdefaultiesdefault, to lobby for international sanctions against Israel, and to support international campaigns of demonizationdefault. A lawyer connected to the program 
defaultreportedly stated
default that the 
defaultstrategy is to “try every possible legal measure to disrupt the Israeli judicial system… as many cases as possible are registered and that as many cases as possible are appealed to increase the workload of the courts and the Supreme Court to such an extent that there will be a blockage” – in other words, 
defaultto ddefaulteliberately sabotage Israeli courts.default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe scope of interference in the Israeli justice system is unprecedented in relations between democratic countries. 
defaultAs of May 2013
default, 
defaultUK funding financed 677 cases that received “full legal representation at the relevant court/administrative body.”  
defaultAccording to 
defaultone assessment
default, the
default data suggest that 35% of all legal cases dealing with housing, land, and property claims in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank are funded by the UK via NRC. 
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to 
defaultdocuments
default relating to the
default funding, “NRC hopes to obtain legal precedents in public interest cases.” However, 
default“without DFID funding, [NRC’s] capacity to take on public interest cases would be greatly reduced and the strategy of using such cases to highlight key issues of concern and increase international pressure on Israel would be less effective.”default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs part of this project ostensibly focused on Israel, NRC also financed a 
defaultcomplaint against Canada
default at the UN Human Rights Committee, impugning the Canadian justice system and calling for censure of Canada.
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe activities being carried out by NRC and its NGO partners are deceptive, and part of a hostile campaign aimed at undermining Israeli democracy and its institutions. 
defaultThese efforts amplify images of Palestinian victimization and Israeli culpability, thereby fuelling the conflict and interfering with peace negotiations. 
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe information available on the British government’s Development Tracker website reflects limited transparency. defaultDetails on the NGO recipients of funding disbursed by NRC are “
defaultwithheld
default.”
default defaultAdditionally,
default NRC’s “low visibility policy” suggests a deliberate attempt to prevent public scrutiny and to avoid accountability vis-à-vis the Israeli defaultdemocratic processdefault. default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe evidence suggests that the British government has little control over how NRC uses taxpayer funds and was unable to prevent the resulting abuse and damage. It also appears that further funding was provided to NRC without proper accountability or careful consideration of the implications of British government support for NRC’s legal advocacy.default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUK funding for this project represents a manifest violation of sovereignty and diplomatic relations between 
defaultdemocratic 
defaultcountries.
defaultBackground – The “Durban Strategy”default&#xa0;default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn August 2001, the UN held the World Conference 
defaultAgainst
default Racism in Durban, South Africa. At the NGO Forum, which ran parallel to the governmental conference, 1,500 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
defaultadopted 
defaulta strategy 
defaultof 
defaultsingl
defaulting-
defaultout Israel as a “racist” and “apartheid” state, and isolat
defaulting
default it through campaign 
defaultbased on 
defaultlawfare
default and 
defaultboycotts, divestment, and sanctions.
default 
defaultLawfare
default is the exploitation of legal frameworks to advance the political war against Israel. 
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultNGO Durban declaration
default also 
defaultcalled for the “adoption of all measures to ensure [the] enforcement” of international humanitarian law, including “the establishment of a war crimes tribunal to investigate and bring to justice those who may be guilty of war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing and the crime of Apartheid . . . perpetrated in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.”
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn implementing the Durban strategy s
defaultince 200
default1, political advocacy NGOs have exploited courts in democratic countries in order to harass Israeli officials with civil lawsuits and criminal investigations for “war crimes,” “crimes against humanity,” and other alleged violations of international law.
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has been 
defaultan important venue for promoting this 
defaultlawfare
default s
defaulttrategy.  On several occasions, anti-Israel NGOs have sought to 
defaultinterfere with UK foreign policy and diplomatic relations
default by attempting to secure 
defaultex parte
default 
defaultarrest warrants against Israeli officials travelling to the UK for high-level government meetings and charity events.  These same NGOs have filed civil lawsuits (all subsequently dismissed) against British ministries to block economic relations between the UK and Israel. In 2011, the British Parliament amended the 
defaultPolice Reform and Social Responsibility Bill 2010-11
default,
default to prevent further abuse and exploitation of its judicial system by these organizations.
default 
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNGOs have also 
defaultpromoted 
defaulta 
defaultstrategy to discredit the Israeli justice system
default and to falsely paint Israel as an anti-democratic state. The strategy has encompassed specifically targeting the Israeli Supreme Court.  In November 2010, the Palestinian NGO, Al 
defaultHaq
default, issued a report, “
defaultLegitimising
default the Illegitimate? The Israeli High Court of Justice and the Occupied Palestinian Territory
default.
default” Al 
defaultHaq
default advocated for an NGO
default “campaign against the Court,” proposing that “the legal community 
defaultflood[default] the Court with petitions in the hope of obstructing its functioning and resourcesdefault” (emphasis added). Al 
defaultHaq
default has also 
defaultcalled
default for the international community to “actively engage and exert pressure on the Israeli judiciary to comply with international law in manner that respects the international consensus” regarding evictions in East Jerusalem. 
defaultOverview of DFID Funding to NRCdefault16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) 
defaultdescribes
default itself as “an independent, humanitarian, non-profit, non-governmental 
defaultorganisation
default which provides assistance, protection and durable solutions to refugees and internally displaced persons worldwide.” Its budget for 
defaultPalestine
default in 2013 alone was 56 million NOK (~£5.5 million), with the bulk coming from governments: the UK, the EU, Norway, and Sweden. 
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBetween December 2010 and March 2013, DFID transferred £2,990,599 to NRC for the “Information, 
defaultCounselling
default and Legal Assistance 
defaultProgramme
default in the Occupied Palestinian 
defaultTerritories.” The 
defaultstated goal
default of this funding is “Improved access to justice in the Occupied Palestinian Territories for refugees, internally displaced persons, and persons/communities at risk of displacement or affected by displacement.”
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNRC is 
defaultcurrently receiving
default an additional £3 million for FY 13/14-14/15 for a seemingly identical project
default,
default “Legal Assistance to prevent displacement and demolitions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs).”
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese grants are unprecedented in content, scope, and size. NGO Monitor is unaware of similar funding for NGO legal advocacy in the context of another conflict region or another democratic country. 
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK’s Development Tracker website provides a certain level of transparency regarding these grants – including a breakdown of spending in each financial year, as well as 
defaulthighly detailed documents
default on the activities undertaken by NRC 
defaultwith UK funding 
defaultand 
defaulta number of 
defaultDFID evaluation
defaults
default.  
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, there is also a marked lack of transparency regarding NRC’s expenditures. According to the 
defaultDevelopment Tracker
default, £2,890,599 of the first grant was disbursed as “Aid to civil society organizations/NGOs.” Yet, the final recipients of the funds are “withheld” and unidentified. The 
defaultsame language
default is used regarding the single disbursement to date (£189,679) from the second project.  
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTherefore, concerned citizens in the UK and Israel cannot know which organizations are receiving and spending British taxpayer funds. As seen below, NGO Monitor was able to independently reconstruct some of the sub-grants by cross-referencing the partial information provided by DFID with NGO financial statements.
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDFID is also providing an additional £7,629,435 over three years (FY11/12-13/14) to NRC, as part of a 
defaultProgramme
default Partnership Arrangement
default. An unknown amount is earmarked for NRC
default’s
default shelter coordination and housing reconstruction projects in Gaza. 
defaultNRC’s Non-transparent Roledefault&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNRC uses British government funds to provide legal assistance and legal training, as well as “research and advocacy” on alleged “violations of international law by Israel.” This is accomplished, “
defaultin the vast majority of cases
default,” by transferring funds to “local lawyers and NGOs to carry out legal 
defaultcounselling
default and represent cases in court.”
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNRC acknowledges that it engages in “
defaultpolicy change work
default,” consisting of “research and advocacy….through engagement with the diplomatic community and use of international justice mechanisms. NRC will also take on public interest cases that highlight discriminatory laws and practices and will carry out related advocacy on these cases.”
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to the documents available through Development Tracker, NRC engages in a “
defaultlow visibility policy
default,” obscuring its involvement in legal advocacy and political activities. This is “to ensure that their legal status to carry out their work is not threatened” – most likely referring to restrictions 
defaultagainst 
defaultactivities that are not strictly humanitarian
default upon which entry into Israel is conditioned. 
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNGO Monitor repeatedly attempted to contact
default NRC’s representatives in Israel and the Palestinian Authority in order to discuss their activities and learn more about the project. Reflecting the lack of transparency and secrecy regarding the NRC’s activities, however, the organization did not respond. 
defaultScope and Damage of NRC’s Legal Advocacydefault28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe scope of NRC’s interference in the Israeli legal system is staggering. Among other activities, UK funding financed 677 cases that received “full legal representation at the relevant court/administrative body.” 
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to an 
defaultevaluation conducted in April 2012 and discussed in the 
defaultProject Completion Review
default, NRC is responsible for 51% of all house demolition cases in Area C of the West Bank. According to 
defaultanother assessment
default, the data suggest that 35% of all legal cases dealing with housing, land, and property claims in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank are funded by NRC. 
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAdditionally, NRC has a 
defaultfocus
default on “public interest cases that highlight discriminatory laws and practices and will carry out related advocacy on these cases.” These cases are highly important
default, as “NRC hopes to obtain legal precedents in public interest cases that will likewise increase the pressure to change policy and practice” – in other words, to manipulate the Israeli democratic system. 
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to a 
defaultreport by a Dutch national
default, who attended a presentation by a lawyer apparently affiliated with this NRC program, these cases are an attempt to 
default“try every possible legal measure to disrupt the Israeli judicial system… as many cases as possible are registered and that as many cases as possible are appealed to increase the workload of the courts and the Supreme Court to such an extent that there will be a blockagedefault” (
defaultemphasis added, 
defaulttranslation from original Dutch by NGO Monitor).
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAnother lawyer connected to the project has advocated 
defaultfor
default universal jurisdiction lawsuits, blacklist
defaults
default, and other 
defaultharassment against justices
default of the Israeli Supreme Court, including the widely respected 
defaultAharon
default Barak, for their alleged 
default“
defaultlegalizing 
default[of] 
defaultIsraeli violations.
default”
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to manipulating Israeli democracy and attempting to sabotage the Israeli justice system, NRC 
defaultused this project
default to call upon various UN bodies –
default 
defaultthe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and the Special 
defaultRapporteur
default on Adequate Housing – to sanction Israel. 
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn a highly irregular and improper deviation from the project’s focus on Israel, NRC used UK funds to 
defaultfinance a defaultcomplaint against Canadadefault at the UN Human Rights Committee, 
defaultimpugning the Canadian justice system and calling for censure of Canadadefault. The complaint was a punitive attack against the independence of Canada’s justice system, following repeated losses in Canadian courts by NRC’s partners. 
default35.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNRC also 
defaultcreated
default a “hub network… to provide an electronic ‘working space’ for legal experts and litigators to share information and experiences about international litigation and legal developments.” In other words, to better facilitate international cases (“
defaultlawfare
default”) against Israel. 
default36.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRegarding the 2010-2013 project, it appears that turning to “international mechanisms” was not part of the original “
defaultBusiness Case Intervention Summary
default.” Rather, the planned “preventative legal response” was expanded to include these international initiatives. In contrast, the “
defaultBusiness Case Intervention Summary
default” for 2013-2015 highlights the use of “international justice mechanisms” and the importance of international advocacy and “international pressure for policy change.” 
defaultChanneling of UK Funds to Local NGOsdefault37.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs noted above, the 
defaultDevelopment Tracker website
default does not list the names of the NGOs that received UK government funds via NRC. 
default38.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA review of the documents posted on the Development Tracker website reveals the names of several NGO partners that participated in the NRC project. These include 
defaultYesh
default Din, Israeli Committee 
defaultAgainst
default House Demolitions (ICAHD), St. Yves, Community Action Center, Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR), and Palestinian Centre for Democracy and Conflict Resolution. However, the documents do not indicate whether these groups received British government funds, and if so, in what amounts. 
default39.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIndependent research by NGO Monitor identified additional partners, including 
defaultBimkom
default, 
defaultHaMoked
default, and Jerusalem Legal Aid Center (JLAC)
default,
default as well as the following information on funding from NRC to local NGOs:

default&#xa0;
default40.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2012, the Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
defaultreceived
default $5,850 from NRC. This grant appears to be for the aforementioned complaint against Canada.
defaultConclusions default41.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWith UK funding, NRC has engaged in political warfare against Israel, manipulating Israeli democracy and attempting to sabotage the Israeli justice system. NRC has also initiated international campaigns against Israel and Canada
default,
default targeting the judiciaries 
defaultof
default those countries. 
default42.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis exploitation of human rights and international relations is magnified by the misuse of massive amounts of British taxpayer funds.
default43.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe ongoing funding for NRC raises serious concerns about violations of best practices within the British government, as well as possible misconduct by NRC staff: 
default44.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis funding violates diplomatic norms and accepted relations between states.
default45.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBy outsourcing its NGO support to NRC, the British government has lost control of over £6 million in taxpayer funds, which are being used to undermine British interests in Israel. 
default46.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt appears that funding for NRC was renewed without sufficient due diligence by officials from DFID and other government offices. 
default47.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe extent to which British government officials have been aware of NRC and its partners’ activities is unknown. At the very least, there is a lack of understanding regarding the implications of the activities being supported. 
default48.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNRC’s “low visibility policy” suggests a deliberate attempt to prevent public scrutiny and to avoid accountability vis-à-vis the Israeli government. 
default49.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn particular, it is possible that NRC’s legal activities in Israel put its staff at risk for violating the terms of their visas, which most likely preclude such political advocacy. It is also unknown if NRC staff gained entry into Israel under false humanitarian pretenses.  
default50.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere are also serious implications for how Israelis perceive the UK, in light of the manipulation of Israeli democracy and attempts to disrupt the Israeli justice system: 
default51.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDue to funding for NRC, as well as other support for NGOs, the UK cannot be seen to be a fair or credible partner in the Middle East peace process.
default52.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis recalls longstanding UK efforts to interfere with and prejudice negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, including UK funding for the Palestinian Negotiations Affairs Department and Negotiations Support Unit. 
default53.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLegal-political advocacy projects, such as the one conducted by NRC, may lead to further populist efforts in Israel to prohibit NGOs from receiving funds from the British and other governments.
default54.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe British government would not tolerate a similar situation in the UK, where a foreign government was funding hundreds of lawsuits in British courts involving private property disputes and UK foreign and anti-terror policies.  Indeed, when faced with the abuse and exploitation of its 
defaultown 
defaultlegal system by these same NGO actors, the British government amended its law
default to stop it
default.
defaultRecommendationsdefault55.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn the basis of the findings discussed in this submission, NGO Monitor recommends that the UK: 
default56.
default&#xa0; 
defaultImmediately freeze all funding to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) pending a public investigation. 
default57.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCommission an independent evaluation of all aspects of UK funding for NRC, including an audit of funds disbursed to other NGOs, activities undertaken, and potential violations of democratic norms and Israeli law. This evaluation should be made public. 
default58.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCorrect the lack of transparency by publishing (a) the complete list of NRC’s NGO partners; (b) the amounts given to each NGO, as well as a description of the activities undertaken with them; (c) the names of all attorneys employed as part of the NRC project; and (d) a comprehensive list of cases that were enabled by British taxpayer funds. 
default59.
default&#xa0; 
defaultReconsider the UK’s ongoing partnership with NRC.
