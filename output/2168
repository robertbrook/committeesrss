[normal]              
[normal]England Golf is currently consulting with its stakeholders on developing a strategic pl
[normal]an 2014 to 2017 and it is expected that the development of women and girls golf will be a key theme that emerges from this process.

[normal]              
[normal]England Golf is a member of t
[normal]he England Golf Partnership (EGP) together with the PGA and supported by the Golf Foundati
[normal]on
[normal] and Sport England.  The
[normal] Whole Sport Plan 
[normal](WSP) 
[normal]for golf identifies how England will achieve its vision of becoming ‘The Leading Golf Nation in the World by 2020’ from grass root
[normal]s right through to elite level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]According to the Sport England Active People Survey (June 2013), 105,100 females play golf once a week and 151,400 on a monthly basis; between 12% and 14% of the total participants within golf.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]In terms of affiliated membership
[normal] (2012 figures)
[normal], the
[normal]re are 
[normal]107,037
[normal] females who are members of an affiliated golf club in England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Grass roots development programmes that are delivered through the network of County Golf Partner
[normal]ships (CGPs) attracted over 86,
[normal]764 participants into golf between April 2012 
[normal]and March 2013
[normal]; 
[normal]the proportion of female participants was 44% which exceeds the current profile of all participants within golf.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]There are currently 1,944 golf clubs affiliated to England Golf (September 2013)
[normal] with the majority providing playing
[normal], coaching
[normal] and membership opportunities for both females and males.  There are approximately 22 affiliated golf clubs where membership is on
[normal]ly open to wome
[normal]n (by comparison there are 
[normal]4 golf clubs where membership is 
[normal]only 
[normal]open to men).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]England Golf has an accreditation scheme called GolfMark (incorporating Sport England Clubmark) that identifies beginner and junior friendly facilities.  The
[normal]re are currently 650 a
[normal]f
[normal]filiated golf clubs in possession of this award and a further 450 working towards 
[normal]obtaining it.  The criteria for a club to obtain 
[normal]GolfMark is split into
[normal] four main areas, all of which assess 
[normal]on the basis of 
[normal]opportunities for 
[normal]women an
[normal]d girls and men and boy
[normal]s
[normal].  GolfMark facilities become focus clubs within a county to work in partnership with and for potential investment to help drive participation and membership through women’
[normal]s specific 
[normal]and/or family sessions for example.  See 
[normal]www.golfmark.org
[normal] for more detail.

[normal]              
[normal]At elite level,
[normal] England Golf provides 
[normal]6
[normal] 
[normal]women’s 
[normal]national 
[normal]championships 
[normal]and 
[normal]3
[normal] girl
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]national 
[normal]championships
[normal] 
[normal]and the number of participants within these events totals 
[normal]1,024
[normal] participants
[normal] (compared to the equivalent events
[normal] for males which totals 1,248
[normal] participants
[normal])
[normal].  Below 
[normal]national
[normal] level, there are many competitive opportunities for women and gi
[normal]rls at 
[normal]county and club level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]From an elite coaching perspective, England Golf
[normal] has squads 
[normal]for both
[normal] 
[normal]women and girls
[normal].  In total there are 
[normal]10 women and 7 girls in the national performance squad
[normal]s
[normal] that utilise 
[normal]5
[normal] different training facilities and also warm weather training.  T
[normal]here are also co
[normal]aching opportunities at an earlier
[normal] stage of the
[normal] talent pathway
[normal], which 
[normal]in addi
[normal]tion to 35 county coaching squads
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]there are 
[normal]10
[normal] 
[normal]regional 
[normal]performance 
[normal]squads (consisting of a maximum of 
[normal]8 players per region).

[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although we do not have specific statistics on 
[normal]media coverage
[normal], England Golf delivers specific content for female participants through 
[normal]a variety of media, including 
[normal]w
[normal]eb, social
[normal], magazine, 
[normal]e-newsletter
[normal]s
[normal] and the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Get into golf
[normal]’
[normal] marketing campaign
[normal] (see also paragraph 6.6)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The opportunity to 
[normal]increase the number of women and girls p
[normal]articipating within golf is 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]a 
[normal]significant
[normal] 
[normal]growth 
[normal]area and England Golf believes that this can be achieved by delivering nationally co-ordinated programmes focusing on recreational, social and family aspects, whilst ensuring that there are acces
[normal]sible and affordable exit routes into golf club membership for those participants that wish to sustain their engagement with the sport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]England Golf has previously conducted research into the barriers and motivations of market segments playing golf an
[normal]d thi
[normal]s has provided valuable insight
[normal].  
[normal]Whilst across all segments
[normal] 
[normal]the main barriers highlighted were time, cost and perception; within the female segments the 
[normal]emphasis
[normal] was more 
[normal]about
[normal] not knowing what opportunities were available to them and how golf can better communicate and market the sport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]The research highlights the importance that England Golf places on understanding the requirements of female segments and the ability to ac
[normal]t upon the findings.
[normal]  In addition to implementing a specific women’s 
[normal]marketing 
[normal]campaign, 
[normal]County Golf Partnerships now focus on delivering 
[normal]group taster and structured sessions for similar abilities
[normal] at
[normal] 
[normal]targeted facilities that are 
[normal]friendly, accessible and af
[normal]fordable
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]Many women and girls view golf as male dom
[normal]inated and feel self-conscious; 
[normal]women only groups are an ideal way to learn and support each other, it is also important that 
[normal]participants experience playing the game from the earliest opportunity (
[normal]as opposed to just 
[normal]receiving 
[normal]coaching sessions).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.

[normal]              
[normal]Based on examples of best practice and in particular an extremely successful women’s programme called ‘Here come the girls’ run at Fynn Valley Golf Club in Suffolk, the following factors are vital:

[normal]The 
[normal]national 
[normal]‘
[normal]Get into golf
[normal]’ marketing campaign (
[normal]s
[normal]ee 
[normal]www.getintogolf.org
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]provides information for new golfers and returners to experience a variety 
[normal]of 
[normal]opportunities.  The campaign 
[normal]engages
[normal] with different organisations to target groups of women, including 
[normal]networks such as the Women
[normal]’
[normal]s Institute (WI) and 
[normal]Mums in the Know; 
[normal]working 
[normal]with other sports 
[normal]for example
[normal] British Cycling’s
[normal] Cycletta
[normal] events; 
[normal]online 
[normal]magazines including
[normal]

[normal] and the NHS.

[normal]              
[normal]Engla
[normal]nd Golf works
[normal] closely with the Golf Foundation 
[normal](a charity committed to the sporting and social development of young people through golf) 
[normal]through the
[normal] England Golf Partnership 
[normal]to provide opportunities for young people, specifically those within schools.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Golf Foundation delivers its operational activity through a single programme - HSBC Golf Roots - and aims to achieve its mission by supporting community and city projects.  Through the community projects the Golf Foundation supports school and school/
[normal]club link activity and includes 
[normal]delivery
[normal] in primary schools (Tri-Golf), secondary schools (Golf Xtreme) and in clubs (outreach work).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]              
[normal]The number of schools now offering some form of golfing activity has significantly increased since 2005/2006 and 
[normal]Golf
[normal] Xtreme 
[normal]within secondary schools 
[normal]has been particularly effective in attracting girls to have a go at golf, 
[normal]due to the social aspect of the programme and also there is no requirement to get changed into PE kit which can sometimes be a barrier in itself
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Recent 
[normal]Sportivate 
[normal]data
[normal] for 201
[normal]2 to 2013 highlighted that 
[normal]2,757 young people 
[normal]had
[normal] engaged across 248 golf programmes, 
[normal]of which 
[normal]31% were female.
