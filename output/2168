defaultThe opportunity to

default 
defaultgrowth 
defaultarea and England Golf believes that this can be achieved by delivering nationally co-ordinated programmes focusing on recreational, social and family aspects, whilst ensuring that there are acces

default6.2
default              
defaultEngland Golf has previously conducted research into the barriers and motivations of market segments playing golf an
defaultd thi
defaults has provided valuable insight
default.  
defaultWhilst across all segments
default 
defaultthe main barriers highlighted were time, cost and perception; within the female segments the 
defaultemphasis
default was more 
defaultabout
default not knowing what opportunities were available to them and how golf can better communicate and market the sport.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultThe research highlights the importance that England Golf places on understanding the requirements of female segments and the ability to ac
defaultt upon the findings.
default  In addition to implementing a specific women’s 
defaultmarketing 
defaultcampaign, 
defaultCounty Golf Partnerships now focus on delivering 
defaultgroup taster and structured sessions for similar abilities

default6.4
default              
defaultMany women and girls view golf as male dom
defaultinated and feel self-conscious; 
defaultwomen only groups are an ideal way to learn and support each other, it is also important that 
defaultparticipants experience playing the game from the earliest opportunity (
defaultas opposed to just 
defaultreceiving 
defaultcoaching sessions).
