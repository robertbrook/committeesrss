default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 24default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultWhen revisiting a topic, previous recommendations and minutes are always referred to in order to remind the Committee of its original view and the circumstances which led to that opinion. This is especially 
defaultimportant when there is a high turnover of members
default 
defaultresulting in a short-term collective memory. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Chair, via the Clerk, regularly seeks informal feedback from the House Service about the performance of the Committee and how it could get the best out of
default witnesses. Likewise, the views of members have been sought about what is needed from witnesses to make meetings more effective. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 33default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee has only 
defaultproduced
default one report since the Liaison Committee 
defaultmade
default its recommendations. Howe
defaultver, that 
defaultreport (
defaultFirst weeks at Westminster; induction arrangements for new MPs in 2015, 
defaultHC 193, 2013-14) was shorter than previous reports at 100 paragraphs long and did put conclusions in bold and recommendations in bold italics.  The recommendations cl
defaultearly identified who was expected to deliver the recommendation and where possible a timeframe for delivery. (The Committee finds the mnemonic ‘S.M.A.R.T.’ useful when considering the wording of recommendations to ensure that they are 
defaults
defaultpecific, 
defaultm
defaulteasurable,
default 
defaulta
defaultchievable, 
defaultr
defaultealistic and 
defaultt
defaultime-bound).
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example:
default“We recommend that PICT consults this Committee by May 2014 on the detailed mechanics of how the post-2015 scheme for providing IT equipment to Members would work in practice”. 
default              
defaultRecommendation 34default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee continues to ask the Clerk to ensure that sessions are scheduled i
defaultnto the Committee’s future programme when it can review, with those responsible for delivery, whether and how the recommendations in its reports have been acted upon. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, in November 2013 it will be reviewing the delivery against recommendations in its 
defaultCatering and Retail Services 
defaultreport (HC 560, 2010-12) and the report 
defaultVisitor Access and Facilities
default (HC13, 2012-13).  The Committee has already scheduled a review
default of recommendations in its more recent report 
defaultFirst Weeks at Westminster; induction arrangements of new MPs in 2015
default (HC 193, 2013-14) to take place in May 2014.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 36default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee has had a 
defaulthigh 
defaultturnover of new members in the last 12 months. 
defaultAll new members to the Committee receive an induction pack with recent minutes and reports. Since April 2013 the Clerk, on the Chair’s behalf, meets all new members to learn more about their specific interests in the House Service and brief them on how the
default Committee works and what topics are currently being discussed.
