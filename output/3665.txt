[[[Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime [CST0019]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I have been made aware of an allegation made today by James Patrick about the challenge set by the Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC) to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to reduce 7 key neighbourhood crimes (the MOPAC 7) by 20 per cent over the period 2012/13-2016/17. I understand that your committee heard an 'anecdote' that this target emerged following an error by a speechwriter. This is categorically untrue.&#xa0;Following consultation with the MPS a high-level target for a reduction in victim-based offences was defined in 2012 and was consulted on as part of our draft Police and Crime Plan in early 2013. Our final plan was published in March. The plan, which includes further details about this challenge, can be found on the GLA website (www.london.gov.uk). I would be happy to write to your committee in more detail about the process for developing the MOPAC 7 if this would be helpful.&#xa0;I also understand that allegations were made that the creation of the MOPAC 7 will lead to manipulation of crime figures, or victims being ignored, with crimes that fall within the 7 being categorised as different crime types- so called 'cuffing'. There is no evidence to support this.&#xa0;Your witnesses specifically referred to officers re-categorising robbery offences as theft from the person and burglary offences as criminal damage. As both theft from the person and criminal damage are included in the MOPAC 7, along with robbery and burglary, this would be entirely counterproductive. Consideration was given to this when the MOPAC 7 were developed.&#xa0;With regard to sexual offences, we have set no targets on these and so it is incorrect to suggest that MOPAC targets are driving inappropriate behaviour. In fact, we have celebrated increased reporting of these offences in the light of significant levels of underreporting.&#xa0;Finally, I entirely reject the suggestion that the only way the MPS can meet the challenge we have set them is by 'fudging' the figures. The ambition is a challenging one, but it is manageable, and good progress is being made as we seek to ensure that London is the safest big city in the world.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
