"&#xa0;\nJohn Cotsell – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOff Roading in the Peak District\n&#xa0;\nI have been walking regularly in the Peak District for more than 40 years and have always been aware of the damage done by vehicular traffic using green lanes.  These old ways do not have hard surfaces and are very vulnerable to wear from motor cycles  and 4 x 4's, especially in wet weather.\n&#xa0;\nIn recent years the problem has become more acute, particularly  with the increasing  popularity of off-roading  vehicles, and many routes of historical, aesthetic  or scientific importance  have been severely damaged  or, in some cases, like the Long Causeway  near Hathersage,  made almost impossible  to access.\n&#xa0;\nThe Deregulation Bill does seem to be an opportunity  to preserve our heritage by classifying green lanes as restricted byways, and making Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATS) restricted byways, at least in National Parks and Areas of Natural Beauty.  This would decrease  red tape and litigation, together with the animosity generated when people see the natural environment devastated. There should also be rights of appeal against authorities  which do not take action by issuing Traffic Restriction Orders.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n2\n of \n1\n&#xa0;\n"
