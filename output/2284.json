"RCH0005&#xa0;Written Evidence submitted by Children’s Services Development Group and the \nIndependent Children’s Homes Association (CSDG and ICHA)&#xa0;Sector urges DfE to take a strategic approach to care system &#xa0;\nWith the closure of the DfE consultations on regulatory reform of children’s homes, \nt\nhe Children’s Services Development Group and the Independent Children’s Homes Association have joined together to express our concern that\n the Government’s changes to care regulations will do little to protect vulnerable children form harm or abuse. Without a wider strategic approach to the care system, the Department for Education is hindering the comprehensive changes needed and stands only to reinforce the silos that already exist in children’s services. \n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the \nintention of the \nchanges\n, but are concerned that the narrow focus will not be effective\n in protecting children and young people\n. \nAll children should have safe, effective care whether in fostering, kinship care or children’s homes, and whether placed in- or out-of-area. Many children at risk of abuse and \nexploitation will still be living with their birth families, as was the case in Rochdale, and these changes do little to safeguard them.\n&#xa0;\nThere is more that providers can do, but they cannot effect change alone. More has to be asked of social work\n colleagues\n, schools, health services and the police in order to achieve effective multi-agency working. Revising regulations without acting to ensure effective implementation and better strategic commissioning of placements will not truly make a difference in the lives of children in the care system. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nDfE\n has recognised that too often children’s homes are used by local authorities as a ‘last resort’. 7,900 of the 67,000 looked-after children in England are cared for in residential homes,\n and we believe that residential \ncare can and should play a vital role as part of a range of provision for children with complex needs.\n&#xa0;\nMany \nyoung people\n in residential homes will have had multiple placement breakdowns and often have the most complex needs.\n Statistics released in the \nChildren’s Homes Data Pack\n show that nearly a third of children in children’s homes have had 6 or more placements.\n This is a scandal, with poor commissioning denying children stable and secure placements that meet their needs. \n&#xa0;\nThe DfE’s own data contradicts recent misleading statements made by the Education Secretary.\n The \nData Pack\n shows that 71% of children’s homes are rated good or outstanding, and there is no direct correlation between level of deprivation and location of children’s homes.\n&#xa0;\nWhere homes are inadequate or located in unsafe areas, this must be addressed and quickly, but the majority of children’s homes \nprovide young people with intensive and specialist therapeutic support that will enable them to live fulfilled adult lives\n. \nWhere local authorities lack provision, and so turn to out-of-area placements, we would encourage them to work in partnership with providers to develop high quality provision that meets children’s needs. \n&#xa0;\nRecent parliamentary questions have revealed that the DfE decided against developing a care strategy.\n Instead the department has chosen to implement piecemeal reforms – such as to the adoption system – that do not impact upon the majority of looked-after children. \n&#xa0;\nWe\n would urge the\n DfE\n to\n rethink this decision and\n take a strategic approach to reforming\n the wider care system in order \nto best meet the needs of vulnerable children, rather than making piecemeal changes in \nisolation.\n Only by doing so will they safeguard vulnerable children and help to provide the high-quality care and support they deserve.  \nChildren’s Services Development Group\n&#xa0;The Children’s Services Development Group is a policy coalition of leading independent providers of \nspecialist services for looked after children and young people with complex needs.
