In particular, the combination of\n new DNA sequencing technologies\n,\n improv\ned bioinformatics and \nadvanced \nanaly\ntical methods has:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrevolutionised approaches to \ncrop\n \nimprovement\n;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nidentified new routes to crop protection\n;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nincreased our ability to extract value from \nfood a\nnd agricultural waste; and\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ng\nrea\ntly increased \nunderstanding \nof \nthe complex intera\nc\ntions between crops, soil and \ntheir\n microbial communities\n,\n both beneficial and pathogenic\n&#xa0;\n1.2 The University of York recommends that:\n&#xa0;a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the development of advanced \nplant breeding \ntechniques to \nrestore\n lost resilience to importan\nt food crops, increased investment should be made to shorten the time to translate new varieties from laboratory to \nfull scale \ncultivation\n.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompetition for food crops between the food and \nbio\nfuel industries could be lessened if \nmore efficient \nroutes to co\nnvert woody agricultural and forestry waste into biofuels were available. Lignocellulose-degrading enzymes have been discovered and their exploitation should be accelerated.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBiofumigation\n, the\n suppress\nion of crop pests by co-cultivating plants \nthat \nnatura\nlly \nprod\nuce chemicals detrimental to\n pests\n, is an exciting route to natural crop protection that warrants increased attention\n.\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsidering \nfood waste\n \nas a\n valuable \nsource\n of energy and raw materials\n will aid the much-needed reduction in the amount of food \nthrown away\n.\n \nIt is important that t\nhe investigation of n\novel strategies for the \ncommercial exploitation\n of food \nand agricultural \nwaste \ngo\nes\n beyond current \nnarrow \norganic w\naste reuse and recycling\n.\n&#xa0;\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA greater u\nnderstanding \nof the molecular and biochemical basis of the interactions between crops and soil biota, both beneficial and pathogenic, \npresents an exciting opportunity to increase yields\n. Exploitation of the \nlatest meta-genomic and high throughpu\nt sequencing techniques make advances \nin this field\n particularly timely\n \nand \nthey \nshould be prioritised\n.\n&#xa0;\n2. Background&#xa0;\n2.1 \nThe University of York \nis\n \none of the UK’s leading research universities, consistently ranked in the top \nten\n in the UK\n&#xa0;\nand\n in the wor\nld top \none hundred\n. \nYork is \nranked \nseventh \nin the world for universities under \nfifty\n years old (the only UK University in the top \nten\n) \nand attracted over £200 million of funding last year. \nA member of the elite Russell Group of universities, it\n was ranked \neighth \noverall \nin the UK’s most recent e\nvaluation of research\n excellence\n.\n It has \nacknowledged\n \nresearch \nstrengths in biology, \nthe environment and green chemistry.\n \nBiol\no\ngy\n at \nYork \nwas ranked \nequal \nfirst\n among broad spectrum bioscience departments in the UK for research judged to be world-leading\n. \nThe impact of the ecological and environmental science at York was ranked second in the UK and \nseventeen\nth in the world. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nYork has several specialist resea\nrch centres relevant to food security\n:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe Centre for Novel Agricultural Products (\nCNAP\n) \nis an award winning\n,\n \ninternationally recognised \nresearch centre \ndelivering research \nwith impact, \nfocused on development of \nplants and microbes as green factories.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe\n \nYork Environmental Sustainability Institute \n(\nYESI\n) \nis a \npioneering inter-disciplinary research partnership\n that\n spans the social, natural and physical sciences to \nprovide the evidence for sustainable solutions to global environmental \nchallenges\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe\n Stockhol\nm Environment Institute at York (\nSEI-Y\n) \nhas strong links to global\n policy makers such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organisation.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPart of one of the top university chemistry departments in the UK, t\nhe \nGreen Chemistry Centre of\n Excellence\n is a world leading research cent\nre\n, which aims to promote the development and implementation of green and sustainable chemistry and related technologies into new products and process\nes.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nBiorenewa\nbles Development Centre\n provides industry with new processes to convert plants and bio-waste into high value products.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 In July 2013, \nDEFRA’s\n Food and Environment\n Research Agency (\nFERA\n) \nin Sand Hutton, York, \nand \nthe\n University of York\n announced a joint initiative in Agri\n-\nfood Resilience\n. This\n \nbring\ns together \nexpertise on food and non-food crop production systems and address\nes\n the key issues of food security an\nd environmental sustainability.\n \nThe aim of th\ne\n \nin\nitiative\n is to ensure the stability and integrity of agri-food supply chains in the face of climate change, declining resources and rapid socio-political transformations\n.\n Uniting the world-class research at York with FERA’s unrivall\ned expertise in applied science \nhas\n create\nd\n a research platform for researchers and companies in the agri-food supply chain to work together to understand and quantify the multiple challenges faced, to develop innovative solutions to those challenges, and to identify and exploit the comm\nercial opportunities that arise in responding to them.\n&#xa0;\n2.4 This expertise and research excellence makes the University of York \nwell placed\n to give evidence to this committee. \n&#xa0;\n3. The Challenges&#xa0;\n3.1 \nGlobal and local agri-food supply chains face multiple \nchallenges: economic uncertainty\n;\n a\n changing and more unpredictable\n climate\n;\n new pests and diseases\n;\n crop and commodity shortages\n;\n inferior, contaminated and adulterated food\n;\n and the drive to reduce inputs, increase yields and extract value from waste wit\nhout compromising on food quality, crop pest and disease control, and biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. \nFurthermore, securing supply chains is proving difficult\n \nin an increasingly complex world.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nT\no ensure that food production \nis\n rob\nust and resilient\n in the face of \nthese challenges, w\ne urgently need new crop varieties with higher yields, \nbetter\n nutritional \nand by-product \nvalue, resistance to drought and pests, lower external inputs, produced and harvested in ways that protect natural \necosystems and the services they provide.\n \nI\nncreasing vulnerability due to climate change and more complex supply chains mean we need better strategies to deal with \nexotic pests and diseases\n \nas well as existing threats\n,\n including\n horizon scanning for biosec\nurity risks, models to predict their spread and new plant protection agents designed, discovered and tested\n.\n&#xa0;\n4. How science can contribute to improved UK (and EU) food security and the more efficient use of resources&#xa0;4.1\n \nFeeding a growing population in a\n warming world, whilst protecting biodiversity and\n the services it provides, \nrequire\ns\n innovative thinking, unprecedented collaboration between countries and academic communities,\n and a willingness to cross disciplinary boundaries\n.\n \nWe need new ways to incre\nase\n yields, but \nn\not\n at the expense of the agricultural environment and the ecosystem functions and services it provides. Nor can we neglect the ne\ned to conserve \nscarce resources\n:\n land, healthy \nsoils, and adequate \nnutrients and water.\n \nScience, including \nadvanced genetic techniques\n allied to traditional plant breeding\n, can\n -\n \nand\n will need to\n -\n play a significant role in \ngrowing more food from less land using less energy, less water\n, less\n fertiliser\n,\n and \nless and fewer pesticides\n.\n \nI\nncreasing \nfood security\n \nb\ny maintaining yields in the face of reduced inputs and increased frequency of extreme weather events is a key goal for agricultural innovation, as is \nusing res\nources, including waste, \nmore efficiently\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nBreeding lost attributes back into modern crops&#xa0;\n4.2\n \nAgricultural crops will need to supply sufficient food to nourish around \nnine\n billion people by 2050\n but climate change is expected to \nthreaten this endeavour. \nRecently the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall event\ns\n was described by the President of \nthe National Farmers Union as the greatest threat to UK agriculture\n,  whilst\n globally both high and low extremes in rainfall increasingly limit food production, particularly for the poorest farmers. \nD\nroughts and floods are predicted to occur more frequentl\ny under climate change, whilst the availability of water for agriculture will decline. \nS\ncientific \ninnovations are required \nto create \nnew \ncrop\n varieties\n that are \nmore \nresistant to \nsuch \nenvironmental stress\nes\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nCrop \nvarieties \ncommonly grown today\n were developed\n \nto maximise yield at the expense of other traits\n, and\n so \nhave \nlost some of their \nresilience to \nextreme events \nsuch as drought\ns,\n \nfloods\n and pest outbreaks\n. \nT\nraits \nproviding \nresilience to \nthese threats \nremain in the wild ancestors of modern c\nrops\n,\n \nand now \nneed to \nbe bred back into the modern \ncultivars \nthat have lost th\nis resilience\n.\n \nThe recent advent of new DNA sequencing technologies has transformed our ability to collect genomic information quickly and cheaply. \nThis\n,\n along with improved bioi\nnformatics and analytical methods\n,\n has \nrevolu\ntionised the approaches that \ncan now \nbe \ntake\nn\n to source the natural variation that exists in \nboth \ndomesticated crops and their wild ancestors. \nFor example, \nsuch\n approaches allow\n CNAP\n t\no \ndomesticate \nneglected and\n underutilised \ncrops \n(‘orphan’ crops)\n, which have \nnot previously benefited \nfrom modern breeding techniques\n,\n \nand \nto \napply new molecular breeding tools to established crops such as rice and oil\n-\nseed rape.\n \nThese \nmodern \nmethods speed up the breeding process \nsuch that what previously took six generations can now be achieved in two\n. \nAlmost any trait can be targeted\n: \n resistance to \nspecific \npests, the ability to\n resist pathogens,\n fix nitrogen\n, consume less water and \nneed \nless fertilis\ner.\n \nIn York we are particula\nrly interested in developin\ng \nboth \nmore resilient crops and \nthose\n with increased by-product value.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuantifying the impact of climate change on wheat&#xa0;\n4.5 \nC\nlimate\n change\n \nis predicted \nto affect\n wheat production in the UK\n, but t\nhere is little consensus\n on whether \nany potential \nbenefits to \nyields from rising temperatures\n \nwill be offset by \nextreme and\n unpredictable rainfall\n, \nnor sufficient understanding of how these changes will affect the quality of grain upon which food manufacturers rely, \nlimit\ning\n the\nir\n ability \nto assess\n \nthe \nrisk\n \nto their supply chains \naccurately\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMore efficient use of biomass&#xa0;\n4.7 \nThe economy of the future will increasingly rely on biological rather than fossil resources for \nmaterials, chemicals and\n fuels. \nThe rising demand for crops for fuel has put them in direct competition with\n food crops over land and water\n; \n the use of food crops for non-food purposes to meet environmental objectives is increasing. For \nexample, the Vivergo \nF\nuels refin\nery near Hull\n require\ns\n \nover one\n million tonnes of whe\nat each year, equivalent to nearly 60% of\n the r\negion’s cultivated area of wheat\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.8 \nThe impact of using \ngrain\n crops \nto produce fuel \non food supply is \ndebated, but it is clear that\n g\nrowth of the bio-economy\n \nrequire\ns\n new technology\n. \nI\nf\n agricultural \nwaste could be turned into \nuseful products\n, it \nwould\n lessen \nthe risk of divertin\ng farmland or crops for biofuel\n production to the detriment of food supply\n.\n \nThe \nexploitation\n \nof biomass\n as a feedstock for biofuel production is\n \ntechnically challenging but\n attractive.\n&#xa0;\n4.9 \nS\ntraw \nfrom \nmaize, \nwheat\n, \nbarley\n a\nnd oilseed rape\n, dedicated biomass crops such as \nM\niscanthus\n \nand forestry products \nare \nall \npotential bioethanol feedstocks. \nAnnually, over five million tonnes of \nwheat and barley straw is \nproduced\n in England\n, of which around half\n could be sold for bioenergy purposes\n, with\n the potential to generate \nsufficient \nethanol\n to\n contribute around 2% of the UK petrol requirement\n as a fuel additive\n. \nT\nhe major cereal producing areas \nof \nYorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands and East of En\ngland\n \nhave\n the potential \nto \nsupply \nalmost two million tonnes \nof straw for bioenergy purposes. The environmental and economic cost of straw transportation would \npoint to\n biofuel processing plants being \nsituat\ned within these region\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.10 \nSusta\ninable \nbiofue\nls can be produced from wood and straw\n as t\nhe\ny\n contain poly\nmeric sugars\n that can be converted into simple sugars \nfor fermenting into fuel\n; \nuseful by-products can \nalso \nbe extracted from straw before digestion. \nUnfortunately, w\ne \ncurrently \nl\nack effective enzy\nmes \nto \ndigest \nwoody materials\n; \nCNAP\n have \ndeveloped \nrapid screening methods \nfor\n discover\ning\n n\novel\n enzymes \nto \nfacilitate the move to a bio-based economy from a petrochemical-based one.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nExtracting value from waste&#xa0;\n4.12 \nFood is a valuable resource and yet UK households throw away over \n7 \nm\nillion tonnes every year\n. \nConsidering\n \nfood – and agricultural \n– \nwaste \nto be a \nvaluable \nresource \nwould\n ameliorate the related problems of waste management and resource scarcity. \nNovel strategies for \nthe utilisation of \nfood waste \nneed \nto\n \ngo beyond\n \norganic waste reuse \nand recycling\n to include \nanimal\n feed, composting,\n and\n anaerobic digestion\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.13\n \nA\nnaerobic digestion (AD) is the best option\n for food waste processing\n. AD is the process where \ncomplex \npla\nnt and animal material\n is converted into \nsimple molecules \nby \nmicroorganisms\n in th\ne absence of air. The \nuseful \nproducts of AD\n are b\niogas\n (around \n60% methane, 40% carbon dioxide\n)\n, which\n is combusted to generate heat\n and\n power\n, and d\nigestate\n, \nwhich \ncontain\ns\n \nvaluable plant nutrients and organic humus\n.\n \nI\nmportant approaches t\no creating more \nvalue from\n \nwaste \ninclude\n:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nt\nhe\n extract\nion\n and reuse \nof \nvaluable complex molecules from the waste before digestion\n;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nimprov\ning\n the efficiency of methane production by methanogenic bacteria in digesters\n;\n \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npre-treating\n waste using microwave\ns\n to improve digestion efficiency\n.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNew routes to sustainable weed, pest and disease control and improved soil health&#xa0;4.17 \nModern crops deliver high \nyield\ns\n with the aid of extensive irrigation, ferti\nliser \nand chemical pesticides, but this may not be environmentally sustainable.
