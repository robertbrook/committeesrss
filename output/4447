[normal]T
[normal]he Treasury 
[normal]select 
[normal]committee
[normal] (TSC)
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]identified six principles for tax policy
[normal]: that it should be 
[normal]fair; support growth[bold] and competitiveness;[bold] certain[bold] [bold](i.e. legally clear, targeted and simple);
[normal] stable;[bold] practical[bold];[bold] [bold]and
[normal] coherent[bold].
[normal] Following the 2013 Autumn Statement, ICAEW has assessed how this year’s new tax policy matches up to the committee’s six principles of tax policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Business Rates: [bold]Rate increases capped at 2% increase from April 2014 (to match inflation).
[normal] [bold]Extension of small business rate relief for another year from April 2014.
[normal] [bold]Reoccupation relief: [bold]For
[normal] the
[normal] next two years, every retail premises in England with a rateable value of up to £50,000 will get up to £1000 discount on their business rates
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We’re pleased the Chancellor met our call for an extension in small business rate relief until 2015.
[normal]The rates discount (up to £50K)
[normal] and allowing businesses to pay
[normal] business rates in 12
[normal] rather than 10
[normal] monthly instalments will both help business cash flow – the most vital factor for their survival.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HMRC[bold] is exempt from £3 billion 
[normal]additional[bold] spending cuts over the next two years 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This will be 
[normal]little
[normal] comfort for HMRC - its budget 
[normal]is 
[normal]still due to be cut by a further 5% in 2015/16.
[normal]Abolition of employer [bold]National Insurance Contributions (NICs)[bold] for 18-21 year olds[bold] from April 2015 (except those earnin
[normal]g more than the £42,285 a year),
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The National Insurance (NI)
[normal] cut for small businesses may well help small businesses take on young people. ICAEW research found a quarter of SMEs would consider taking on young people if offered a tax break. The scheme needs to be easy to administer though, and not add to the red tape companies already encounter.
[normal] Problems 
[normal]possible with what happens when someone reaches 21 years of age. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Marriage Tax Allowance[bold] or ‘transferable tax allowance’: From 2015; married couples and civil partners can transfer £1,000 of their income tax personal allowance to their spouse. Worth £200 a year to four million couples from 2015, at a cost of £700 million. Will be 
[normal]uprated
[normal] in future along with personal allowance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Transferring the allowance will mean the couple’s take-home pay will rise. This is could affect their benefits entitlement, and their 
[normal]universal credit could go down as a result
[normal].
[normal] This is symptomatic of still-separate tax and benefits systems, and means in practice that particularly for lower-paid couples, the government is giving with one hand while taking with the other.
[normal] 
[normal]This creates practical difficulties because it mixes a cap, a transfer and a taper. This will make for a complex system, running counter to the government’s com
[normal]mitment to tax simplification.
[normal]It puts a
[normal] new burden on an already-stretched HMRC, whose budget will be cut by a further 5% in 2015/16.
[normal]Tougher rules to limit use of 
[normal]personal service companies[bold] 
[normal](PSCs) 
[normal]to disguise employment as false self-employment to avoid NI (from April 2014).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PSC legislation is already complex. This latest change introduces further anti avoidance legislation. The workers affected 
[normal]are likely to
[normal] be either unaware of their tax position or 
[normal]possibly 
[normal]powerless to do anything about it. 
[normal]This measure is a yet another sticking plaster to address the wider problems in this immensely difficult area. A
[normal] complete review and overhaul
[normal] is needed.
[normal]A new, limited power 
[normal]requiring people to pay upfront their taxes where the scheme they used has already been struck down by the courts in an [bold]avoidance case[bold], with effect from July 2014. At the moment, taxpayers can hold onto disputed tax while it’s investigated. Some are using this for cash flow benefit. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This s
[normal]eems a sensible move
[normal],
[normal] although good consultation on implementation is essential
[normal]Community Amateur Sports Clubs[bold] (
[normal]CASCs
[normal]). The amount clubs can earn tax free in income and rent will rise to £50,000 and £30,000 respectively. 
[normal]It w
[normal]ill also be easier to qualify for the relief.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Higher 
[normal]limits are
[normal] welcome, as is C
[normal]orporate Gift Aid for donations to CASCs.
[normal]Main concerns are the new rules for eligibility for CASC status. D
[normal]etailed record keeping 
[normal]on what members do for the club 
[normal]will place a greater burden on many volunteer club treasurers. HMRC must adopt an 
[normal]educational
[normal] approach to those caught transgressing
[normal],
[normal] rather than penalising them.
[normal]Loss of business rates relief will be a serious financial blow to clubs affected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Universal credit [bold](UC) [bold]DWP announced that the roll-out will miss its 2017 deadline
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This was always a challenging deadline. In our view, UC for the self-employed is still in need of radical rethink. In its present form it imposes an unrealistic reporting burden on businesses and is
[normal] 
[normal]potentially unfair
[normal] on those whose businesses with low income or losses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From April 2015, 
[normal]capital gains tax will apply on future gains made by non-residents who sell residential property in the UK[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is in line with the approach 
[normal]taken by many other countries. A p
[normal]otential problem area is that in the UK a person can do their own 
[normal]conveyancing
[normal] with
[normal]out using a solicitor or notary
[normal]. 
[normal]We may need a
[normal] system 
[normal]to ensure that
[normal] CGT can be calculated and 
[normal]paid. In some countries part of the sale proceeds are withheld before they are paid to the vendor. This may require changes to the way UK property is 
[normal]conveyanced
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Real Time Information[bold]. [bold]Employers must report to HMRC details of gross, PAYE and NIC deducted ‘on or before’ the time they pay employees
[normal]. This applies to every cash payment made to employees
[normal].
[normal] [bold]This rule is currently relaxed to allow month end reporting instead for employers with 9 or fewer employees.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The relaxation was due to end in April 2014, but
[normal] for micro-employers it
[normal] is now extended until 
[normal]April 2016 to allow them
[normal] time to change their systems. This is a welcome and sensible change although it should be made permanent. We 
[normal]remain concerned that
[normal] employers who are already unpaid tax collectors 
[normal]may
[normal] be forced to make 
[normal]substantial 
[normal]changes to their 
[normal]systems, imposing considerable extra admin burdens and costs for little obvious benefit.
