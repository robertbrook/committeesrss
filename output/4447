default Following the 2013 Autumn Statement, ICAEW has assessed how this year’s new tax policy matches up to the committee’s six principles of tax policy.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultBusiness Rates: defaultRate increases capped at 2% increase from April 2014 (to match inflation).
default defaultExtension of small business rate relief for another year from April 2014.
default defaultReoccupation relief: defaultFor
default the
default next two years, every retail premises in England with a rateable value of up to £50,000 will get up to £1000 discount on their business rates
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe’re pleased the Chancellor met our call for an extension in small business rate relief until 2015.
defaultThe rates discount (up to £50K)
default and allowing businesses to pay
default business rates in 12
default rather than 10
default monthly instalments will both help business cash flow – the most vital factor for their survival.

default&#xa0;
defaultThe National Insurance (NI)
default cut for small businesses may well help small businesses take on young people. ICAEW research found a quarter of SMEs would consider taking on young people if offered a tax break. The scheme needs to be easy to administer though, and not add to the red tape companies already encounter.
default Problems 
defaultpossible with what happens when someone reaches 21 years of age. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMarriage Tax Allowancedefault or ‘transferable tax allowance’: From 2015; married couples and civil partners can transfer £1,000 of their income tax personal allowance to their spouse. Worth £200 a year to four million couples from 2015, at a cost of £700 million. Will be 
defaultuprated
default in future along with personal allowance.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTransferring the allowance will mean the couple’s take-home pay will rise. This is could affect their benefits entitlement, and their 
defaultuniversal credit could go down as a result
default.
default This is symptomatic of still-separate tax and benefits systems, and means in practice that particularly for lower-paid couples, the government is giving with one hand while taking with the other.
default 
defaultThis creates practical difficulties because it mixes a cap, a transfer and a taper. This will make for a complex system, running counter to the government’s com
defaultmitment to tax simplification.
defaultIt puts a
default new burden on an already-stretched HMRC, whose budget will be cut by a further 5% in 2015/16.
defaultTougher rules to limit use of 
defaultpersonal service companiesdefault 
default(PSCs) 
defaultto disguise employment as false self-employment to avoid NI (from April 2014).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPSC legislation is already complex. This latest change introduces further anti avoidance legislation. The workers affected 
defaultare likely to
default be either unaware of their tax position or 
defaultpossibly 
defaultpowerless to do anything about it. 
defaultThis measure is a yet another sticking plaster to address the wider problems in this immensely difficult area. A
default complete review and overhaul
default is needed.
defaultA new, limited power 
defaultrequiring people to pay upfront their taxes where the scheme they used has already been struck down by the courts in an defaultavoidance casedefault, with effect from July 2014. At the moment, taxpayers can hold onto disputed tax while it’s investigated. Some are using this for cash flow benefit.

defaultIt w

default&#xa0;

defaultetailed record keeping 
defaulton what members do for the club 
defaultwill place a greater burden on many volunteer club treasurers. HMRC must adopt an 
defaulteducational

default,
default rather than penalising them.
defaultLoss of business rates relief will be a serious financial blow to clubs affected.
default&#xa0;
defaultUniversal credit default(UC) defaultDWP announced that the roll-out will miss its 2017 deadline
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis was always a challenging deadline. In our view, UC for the self-employed is still in need of radical rethink. In its present form it imposes an unrealistic reporting burden on businesses and is
default 
defaultpotentially unfair
default on those whose businesses with low income or losses.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom April 2015, 
defaultcapital gains tax will apply on future gains made by non-residents who sell residential property in the UKdefault.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is in line with the approach 
defaulttaken by many other countries. A p
defaultotential problem area is that in the UK a person can do their own 
defaultconveyancing
default with
defaultout using a solicitor or notary
default. 
defaultWe may need a
default system 
defaultto ensure that
default CGT can be calculated and 
defaultpaid. In some countries part of the sale proceeds are withheld before they are paid to the vendor. This may require changes to the way UK property is 
defaultconveyanced
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultReal Time Informationdefault. defaultEmployers must report to HMRC details of gross, PAYE and NIC deducted ‘on or before’ the time they pay employees
default. This applies to every cash payment made to employees
default.
default defaultThis rule is currently relaxed to allow month end reporting instead for employers with 9 or fewer employees.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe relaxation was due to end in April 2014, but
default for micro-employers it
default is now extended until 
defaultApril 2016 to allow them
default time to change their systems. This is a welcome and sensible change although it should be made permanent. We 
defaultremain concerned that
default employers who are already unpaid tax collectors 
defaultmay
default be forced to make 
defaultsubstantial 
defaultchanges to their 
defaultsystems, imposing considerable extra admin burdens and costs for little obvious benefit.
