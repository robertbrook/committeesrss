[normal]Written evidence submitted by[bold] [bold]Charity Finance Group[bold] [CT [bold]12[bold]][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary[bold](
[normal]i
[normal]) This submission will outline how counter-terrorism legislation (specifically counter-terrorist financing legislation and sanctions regimes) has made it increasingly challenging for UK charities to transfer funds through formal banking channels to support operations abroad. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii) Messaging from policy makers identifying charities as organisations vulnerable to abuse by terrorists. This messaging combined with a growing risk-averse approach from banks in light of enhanced AML/CTF legislation, and the fact that many charities operate in ‘high risk’ regions, has resulted in growing barriers to transferring funds overseas. Problems reported include delayed payments, an inability to transfer to certain countries and the closure of MSB services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](iii) This problem is escalating despite efforts from the charity sector to mitigate its impact. Enhanced sanctions regimes and counter-terrorism legislation mean that banks are becoming increasingly risk averse. Additionally, there is no economic incentive for banks to support charities by transferring funds – the cost of mistakes is too high. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](iv) It is therefore essential that Government takes action by supporting banks to apply proportionate risk management approaches, and working with overseas governments and regulators (including the EU, US and FATF) to ensure their activities do not hinder vital aid efforts. We would like to see Government lobby globally for an international version of the US OFAC licence, which charities could quote to allow ‘safe passage’ of funds for humanitarian purposes anywhere in the world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](v) If action is not taken this problem risks destabilising wider counter-terrorism efforts: if charities are unable to use formal banking channels they will increasingly turn to untraceable, informal means to transfer funds (e.g. by transferring large amounts of cash over borders) – making them more vulnerable to abuse by terrorists. Additionally, by providing humanitarian aid and help with infrastructure building, charities have a key role in contributing to the stability of a region and thus preventing the growth and spread of terrorism abroad. There is a clear incentive for government to support this work and an imperative not to undermine the influence that humanitarian organisations can have in preventing terrorism. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Introduction [bold]1.1. Charity Finance Group; inspiring the development of a financially confident, dynamic and trustworthy charity sector. Charity Finance Group works with finance managers to enable them to give the essential leadership on finance strategy and management that their charities need; promoting best practice in charity finance, driving up standards, campaigning for a better operating environment and ensuring every pound given to charity works harder - it’s essential to maintain the trust of charity donors. CFG has more than 2,200 members, all senior finance professionals working in the sector and collectively our members are responsible for the management of over £19bn in charitable funds. This response was developed with input from member charities and CFG’s Treasury Special Interest Group, whose membership comprises of treasurers from a number of major international charities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2. Part of the stated remit of this inquiry is to ‘
[normal]re-examine how effective the Government is in stopping terrorist attacks
[normal]’. This response is framed around the effectiveness of Government counter-terrorism policy in the context of its impact on the UK charity sector. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3. In the past decade global policy-makers have increasingly identified charities as organisations which are vulnerable to abuse by terrorists. Public awareness of this fact, combined with an increasingly risk-averse approach from banks (in light of enhanced anti-money laundering (AML)/counter-terrorist financing (CTF) legislation and sanctions regimes), and the fact that many international charities operate in fragile and/or conflict ridden states, has meant that charities are finding it increasingly challenging to send money to certain countries through formal banking channels. This problem has been particularly acute amongst Muslim charities, who have more frequently reported having bank accounts closed or donations blocked. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4. These problems are likely to worsen unless Government addresses them. The recent withdrawal by Barclays of banking facilities from MSBs servicing Somalia, and the inability to transfer funds into Syria are recent examples of how delays and difficulties with sending funds can disrupt important work abroad. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5. CFG recognises that the issues raised in this submission are not solely the responsibility of the UK Government. Complex global finance structures implicate other international institutions and countries (e.g. US, EU, FATF, IMF). Banks’ interpretations of the – rather than the regulations themselves – are often misguided; both charities and government charities ought to work to improve practices and engage with banks on following the regulation in a manner that doesn’t undermine charitable objects. However, Government needs to take the lead in addressing these issues and the wider negative effects of CTF legislation or, we believe, the UK international charity sector and the vital work it carries about abroad (including activities which can undermine terrorist efforts) will suffer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6. A number of charities and umbrella bodies have been exploring these issues; in February 2013 CFG held a roundtable meeting with these organisations to discuss some of the problems experienced as a result of the global CFT regime. CFG has also met with the British Bankers’ Association, Charity Commission and members of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to discuss processing payments to Syria. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. International charities as ‘high risk’ customers [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1. Many international charities have operations that provide humanitarian assistance, healthcare, outreach and infrastructure building – all of these activities support and the stabilising and development of regions, which in turn contributes to restricting the growth of terrorist activity 
[normal]abroad. Civil society plays a key – albeit secondary - role in supporting counter-terrorism efforts and this consideration should be the starting point when developing policy to prevent the abuse of charities by terrorist organisations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2. In recent years there have been several high-profile incidents where charities have been used as a vehicle to enable or fund terrorist or extremist activity. This has resulted in increased public awareness of the ways in which charities can be used by terrorist organisations. While such cases are an abhorrent abuse of the charity sector and the trust it receives, it is important to remember that they are rare and affect only a tiny proportion of charities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3. Efforts by the Charity Commission to detect and prevent such abuses are underway and the regulator is, rightly, an important contributor to the UK’s counter terrorism infrastructure. However, this is only one of its many functions.. Greater care around messaging which has recently demonstrated a misleading constant linkage between charities and potential terrorist abuse, distorts perceptions of the sector. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Problems reported by charities [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1. Cases of terrorist abuse and messaging from government and regulators and charities’ presence in high risk regions have led global policy-makers to identify charities as high risk banking customers. This in turn shapes banks’ risk management processes, and increasingly they are taking a particularly broad-brush approach to regulations – resulting in charities (particularly Muslim charities) experiencing problems with: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Delayed payments; 
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Transferring funds to sanctioned or high risk countries; 
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Opening and keeping open bank accounts; and 
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Receiving funds from certain regions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n addition to these common problems, some Muslim charities have also reported that their donors have been warned against donating by their bank. These worrying reports, that banks are taking on regulatory functions and presenting an obstacle to charities’ donor support, need to be taken seriously. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DELAYED PAYMENTS [bold]3.2. An over-cautious approach by banks can often result in delays, sometimes of months, when processing charity payments to certain areas. For example, one charity reported that any USD payment to South Sudan is likely to be delayed due to the word ‘Sudan’ appearing in the payment instruction. There are no sanctions on South Sudan yet it is caught because of the sanctions on North Sudan. This is an example of a relatively simple mistake having a significant impact. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3. Even for large charities, with dedicated and experienced treasury teams, it can take a week or more for international transfers to reach their destination. For smaller charities, without such resources, often the delays are longer and payments simply returned. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]TRANSFERRING FUNDS TO SANCTIONED OR HIGH RISK COUNTRIES [bold]3.4. Many international charities carry out vital work in high-risk countries (that typically lack sophisticated infrastructure and regulation) ; they have a need to transfer funds to the region – either to partners carrying out work or to regional offices, in order to 
[normal]fulfill
[normal] their charitable objects. There is a clear recognition, and acceptance, amongst charities that these payments will be subject 
[normal]to enhanced scrutiny which may take longer than usual to process. They become particularly frustrated, however, when payments are blocked, without caution or reason, due to broad-sweeping risk policies, that do not take into account the charities unique status. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5. Sanctions regimes have exemptions in place for humanitarian payments; however these offer little security for banks who are keen to mitigate their exposure to risk, often resulting in them withdrawing their services with little or no notice. Recent cases raised by charities include: 
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Sudan: [bold]One charity said: ‘[
[normal]When sending funds] to Sudan we can’t buy SDG, so send EUR (or other non-dollar currencies). In the past this has worked but recently these payments are not going through with the excuse of ‘sanctions’ coming from the currency trader intermediary banks…
[normal]’ 
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]North Korea: [bold]A number of charities are implementing programmes on behalf of the EU in North Korea, and are forced by the North Korean government to use the Foreign Trade Bank of DPRK (FTB). Earlier in 2013 the UN tightened sanctions, and the US named FTB as a sanctioned entity (due to alleged links to North Korea’s nuclear programme). Since then it has been practically impossible for charities to move cash into North Korea through normal banking channels. So, despite the EU’s commitment to encouraging this humanitarian work to continue, the counter-terrorism sanctions present barriers to its implementation. 
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Syria: [bold]Here there is huge demand for humanitarian assistance – 6.8m people within Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance according to DEC statistics. Yet it is near-impossible to transfer funds into the country using formal banking channels. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]OPENING AND RETAINING BANK ACCOUNTS [bold]3.6. A number of Muslim charities have reported having a request to open a bank account refused, or their existing account closed – often without explanation. In 2012 Islamic Relief reported how the only explanation offered for a major bank suddenly closing down an account
[normal] 
[normal]was that the bank was acting in line with its policy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CLOSURE OF MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES (MSBs) [bold]3.7. The recent decision of Barclays to withdraw banking facilities from MSBs servicing Somalia is one ne of the most significant developments resulting from banks’ concerns around sanctions and terrorist financing. The UK remittance market provides a valuable channel - supplementing mainstream banking routes - for individuals and charities to send money abroad, particularly to regions where infrastructure is lacking. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8. Until Barclays’ decision many major international charities used an organisation called Dahabashiil to support programming in Somalia. 40 per cent of Somalis rely on remittances (predominantly from Somali diaspora but also from charities) and no other money transfer service has anywhere near the reach of Dahab
[normal]a
[normal]shiil into the rural (i.e. poorest) parts of the country. There could be a devastating economic and social impact from closing this funding channel on the poorest and hardest to reach in Somalia. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9. We are aware that a review of the UK remittance market is currently being undertaken on behalf of 
[normal]DfID
[normal]. We would urge the committee to review and take into account the content of the DIFD report once published. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. The impact of banking challenges on the UK charity sector [bold]4.1. The delays and difficulties associated with transferring funds affect charities’ cash flow and have a direct impact on their ability to carry out vital humanitarian work. Ultimately not having access to adequate funds lead to delays to projects or prevents work being carried out. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2. Irrespective of whether payments are eventually made successfully, the amount of time spent trying to understand and solve these problems, and the associated administrative cost is excessively burdensome. When payments are delayed or blocked it is not always immediately apparent why it has happened, causing difficulties for the charity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3. Charities are compelled to explore and adopt creative ways of transferring payments, when formal banking channels are closed to them. This is often convoluted and expensive .For example, one charity reported overcoming some of the difficulties by paying their partners’ parent entity or head office, usually based in the US or Europe, relying on internal arrangements the partner had in place for sending these funds out. Additional administration and steps in the payment ‘chain’ come at a cost; this does not sit well with the public (who are, rightly, increasing their scrutiny of charitable accounting) out of concern that charities optimise value for their donations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4. The closure of MSBs and heavily delayed or blocked bank payments, has narrowed charities’ ability to access legitimate corridors to send money internationally. This means that charities, determined to reach their beneficiaries, will increasingly turn to insecure or even illegal means to get cash to where it is needed e.g. by taking large amounts of cash over borders. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5. As a general rule, charities should be supported to use formal banking channels wherever possible. Alternatives are both less traceable and less accountable and, therefore, far more likely to be open to abuse by terrorists. Although we recognise that some, particularly smaller charities, have structures better suited to transferring money using more informal networks. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Contributing factors [bold]5.1. As a result of complex interplay between different international bodies, regulatory regimes, and financial institutions, the problems faced by charities with payments to aid humanitarian work abroad cannot be reduced to ‘poor counter-terrorist financing legislation.’ . However, in discussions with charities and banks a number of problems with the legislation have been identified, which are outlined in paragraphs 5.2 to 5.9. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]MESSAGING FROM GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORS [bold]5.2. Governments and regulators have increasingly adopted a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to potentially terrorist activity; a vital strategy to cutting off their activity is to disrupt and prevent their use of the financial system. This has meant that. Banks are particularly cautious after seeing the potential penalties for non-compliance; they have taken heed of the government’s message, broadly conceived, and adopted tight policies when dealing with what they consider to be ‘high risk’ customers. For example, Standard Chartered received a £340m fine imposed by the US for breaching sanctions on Iran; consequently banks are incredibly nervous about associating themselves with any activities that could be misinterpreted as something similar to their alleged offences. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT [bold]5. UK CFT legislation cannot be viewed in isolation. The majority of banks have global reach and consequently are affected by the approach and activities of the US, UN, EU, FATF (special recommendation 8 relating to non-profits is frequently cited as a problem), IMF and others. For example, all USD payments clear through the United States so any USD payment initiated outside the US, to a destination other than the US, will still be cleared through the US banking system and thus regulated in accordance with US sanctions. Similarly, banks with operations in the US have to declare and explain (to the US Securities and Exchange Commission) all transactions that they release to sanctioned entities, regardless of currency, originating or destination country. Moreover, with the majority of UK banks having operations in the US, they do not wish to upset US regulators, even if they are a UK bank remitting GBP to a US sanctioned country. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3. As a result of this of this interconnectivity any solution would have to be a 
[normal]globalforce
[normal], since UK based charities acting in complete compliance with all sanctions and regulations are impacted either directly or indirectly by sanctions regimes in place elsewhere – not only in the US and Europe. 
[normal]Ideally, we would like to see the UK Government lobby globally for an international version of the US OFAC licence, which charities could quote to allow ‘safe passage’ of funds anywhere in the world – with the originating bank being responsible for ‘vetting’ the transfer (through its KYC procedures). [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]AMBIGUITY AROUND SANCTION REGIMES [bold]5.4. We understand that sanction regimes are constantly evolving and so if a particular aspect is problematic, it can normally be addressed. Humanitarian payments are generally exempt from sanctions therefore, legitimate payments by charities should not be stopped in theory. Yet, in reality, banks simply aren’t comfortable with the humanitarian exemption; where there are grey areas they will err on the side of caution. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5. An example of this caution is evidenced when charities finance materials which fall into the ‘dual use’ sanctions category. For example, large scale water sanitisation, which involves procuring materials which could be deemed as dual use (e.g. drilling equipment which could also be used for oil). Pipes and pumps have also been reported as problematic as they can also be used for military purposes or in sanctioned economic activities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LACK OF A JOINED UP APPROACH WITHIN GOVERNMENT [bold]5.6. We know that Government departments (HM Treasury, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development in particular) are aware of the problems faced by charities and efforts are currently underway to examine how they can be addressed. However, this is a relatively new development and there remains an inherent tension between Government priorities. For example, 
[normal]DfID
[normal] is currently funding DEC charities to support operations in Syria; however, for other departments the counter-terrorist financing agenda inevitably takes priority. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7. This is also true from an international perspective. See North Korea example in paragraph 3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. The need for Government to address these issues [bold]6.1. Discussions with banks and regulators indicate that future trends will reinforce this risk aversion. In Syria, one of the most pressing humanitarian situations, the sanctions regime is likely to get more complex. From a charity perspective, it is expected that the problems experienced with international payments will worsen. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2. Charities and sector bodies are starting to engage with banks and other decision makers on these issues however, at present these discussions too often, run into stalemate. The banks’ priority is, understandably, to ensure that they do not fall foul of sanctions and legal obligations. Advice from lawyers suggests that there is nothing explicit in sanctions legislation to prevent legitimate charity payments from being processed. Government echo this sentiment, suggesting that decisions around processing payments are commercial choices that the bank must make and therefore outside their scope of influence. The government are therefore, the most capable party of alleviating this tension. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3. At present there is simply no economic incentive for banks to invest time and effort into checking and processing ‘high risk’ humanitarian payments. The fees they earn from charity transfers are dwarfed by the possibility of significant penalties and reputational damage if mistakes are made. It is somewhat inevitable that banks do not want to take ‘risks’ with charity payments and a reasonable reaction for banks to have in the current regulatory environment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4. CFG, the BBA and others have been looking at individual ‘problem’ countries and issues such as those covered in Section 4. However, these issues also need to be addressed by Government – who are able to engage and influence global stakeholders such as FATF, US, EU – in order to find a long-term, sustainable solution that ensures that legitimate humanitarian payments are able to get to the areas where they are needed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5. We recognise that this is only one small aspect of counter-terrorism efforts. However, the need for a proportionate and risk-based approach should characterise the Government’s strategy as a whole. If counter-terrorism efforts threaten humanitarian work that responds to pressing human needs and even contributes to eradicating terrorism – then they are simply not effective and undermine the role that international charities play in forming strong and stable societies.
