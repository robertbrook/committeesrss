[normal]&#xa0;[bold]EU action to tackle youth unemployment[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Submission by Professor Sue Maguire, Centre for Education and Industry (CEI), University of Warwick[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Questions [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The EU should provide Member States with funding to tackle youth unemployment for two reasons. Firstly, given the 
[normal]scale
[normal] of youth unemployment across the EU (and worldwide), this is an EU issue, as well as a country-specific problem.  Secondly, in many member states, austerity measures have resulted in: cuts to programmes; withdrawal of funding to support initiatives targeted at reducing youth unemployment; and, crucially, the curtailment of policy development to tackle often growing levels of youth unemployment/disaffection in many Member States.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]EU action does appear to respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs. For example, with regard to youth unemployment, ESF funding is designed to complement interventions that are being delivered at national and regional level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The obvious answer to this question is to say that the EU should offer more funding and introduce programmes such as the Youth Guarantee, to support the efforts of Member States to ‘stem the flow’ of youth unemployment at a time when many countries are experiencing austerity measures. However, the EU could play another crucial role through appraising the policy development and interventions of individual states, in order to encourage much greater cross-fertilisation of policy and practice. The key questions here would be: what works best, for 
[normal]who
[normal], and why? There are numerous examples of Member States ‘reinventing the wheel’, rather than drawing on the experiences and results of interventions/pilot policies which have already been developed, and either implemented or rejected by other countries. This often creates duplication of effort and is not an effective use of experience or resources.

[normal]While the terms youth unemployment and NEET are used interchangeably to quantify levels of disengagement and inactivity among young people, it is important to remember the context in which the terms were derived and the difference between 
[normal]the two ‘counts’. The term ‘NEET’ was coined in the UK in the late 1990s as an identifier of a group which had originally emerged as a result of changes to unemployment benefit entitlement regulations that had been implemented in 1988. Essentially, these changes had removed young people under the age of 18 years from the unemployment statistics. ‘NEET’ is now widely applied across EU states and OECD countries and covers a broader age spectrum, typically 15 – 24-year olds. In contrast, the youth unemployment rate is a narrower definition, being a percentage of all young people (those aged 15 to 24) who are unemployed compared to the total labour force in that age group
[normal]. It does not take into account: a) those who are studying or who are training; b) who may or may not be seeking employment; or c) those 
[normal]who
[normal] are not registered in the unemployment statistics. 
[normal]An analysis of data in the UK produced 
[normal]by the ONS
[normal] on the NEET population among 16-24 year olds for the period 
[normal]April to June 2013
[normal] shows that there were:
[normal]Economic inactivity measures people not in employment who have not been seeking work within the last four weeks and/or are unable to start work within the next two weeks. There are two issues here:
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why are nearly half of 16-24 year olds NEET inactive in the UK?; and, crucially,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why is the number of young women who are NEET inactive significantly higher (more than twice as many) than the number of young men who are NEET inactive?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It may be both opportune and productive to question whether ‘NEET’, as currently defined and applied, is appropriate. Is it now applied too casually, with the result that it masks rising and unacceptable levels of inactivity among young people?  If so, do we need to re-appraise the phenomena and issues we are seeking to address, and then re-think our definitions and, crucially, our policy responses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have no expertise in the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures, although my experience in conducting evaluation of UK government policy interventions would suggest that, at an early stage, too much emphasis is placed on 
[normal]trying to ‘prove’ that the policy works, in terms of securing hard outcomes i.e. placements into education, employment and training provision. For many young people, especially those with the greatest barriers to participation, policy success needs to be measured, in the first instance, in terms of achieving ‘soft’ outcomes such as encouraging participation or building self-confidence, before hard outcomes can be achieved. Otherwise, the policy intervention and its recipients, i.e. young people, are too quickly labelled as failures. Also, the criteria for payments to training providers, such as payment-by-results delivery models, can create perverse incentives and encourage them to recruit young people who are easy to reach/easy to help, rather than identifying and supporting the hardest to help/hardest to reach to achieve success outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A ‘one-size fits all’ approach to policy intervention to tackle the NEET ‘problem’ is inappropriate, and doomed to failure due to the lack of homogeneity in the NEET population.  Rather, there needs to be a greater depth of understanding of its segmented nature, particularly among the over 18 group, and a tailored suite of policy intervention. Consequently, accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures need to be adapted accordingly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There could be more emphasis on sharing good practice between projects/initiatives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am not aware of the level of engagement that young people currently have in decision-making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It should be borne in mind that, for the majority of young people who become NEET, in particular among younger groups with limited qualification attainment and low socio-economic status, the structure of opportunities available to them is defined by their local environment. The majority will remain locked into their local labour market, reliant on family support and lacking the resources and independence to move elsewhere. Therefore, youth migration is a largely subsidiary issue when discussing measures to tackle youth unemployment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young people’s attachment to, familiarity with, and extensive use of social media and its attendant technology can be exploited, initially to engage, and subsequently to 
[normal]inform their aspirations and decision-making.
[normal]  However, research evidence from a longitudinal study of an intervention which offered targeted support, tailored learning and financial assistance found that identifying and securing the support of some groups of young people was hampered by their lack of engagement with support agencies and their confinement to their home environment. This was closely linked to their attachment to social media as the only form of interaction with the outside world.  Indeed, cases of agoraphobia were commonplace and, in some areas of England, this posed the greatest challenge to the engagement of some young people.
