[[[Cycling Tynedale]]]

[[[ (CYS0012)]]]&#xa0;There are already good guidelines promoting increased cycling and walking for both economic, health and welfare benefits. e.g. NICE guidelines PH8 and 41 are directed towards planners, highways agencies, etc. But in our area, Northumberland, the individuals in power are either not aware of best practise or ignore it.  Finances are a commonly held barrier to implementation of change, yet we have examples of considerable Highways spend where no consideration whatsoever was made to opportunistic inclusion of changes to improve cycling. &#xa0;

[[[Recommendations]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; e.g. widespread recognition of need for safe, off road cycle route along Tyne Valley, yet when A695, which follows this route, was resurfaced this year, no consideration of possible improvements for cyclists or pedestrians was made. This information was obtained under FOI. If improvements had been considered but rejected for particular reasons this would have been more understandable, so when the default response from local councilors is ‘no money’, that improvements were not even considered is immensely frustrating.
