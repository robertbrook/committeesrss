"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by National Physical Laboratory (NPL) (WSC043)Executive Summary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBackground\nThe National Physical Laboratory (NPL) welcomes the opportunity to make an input\n into this Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry into women in STEM careers.\n \nAs a Research Technology Organisation (RTO) NPL is part of the research infrastructure in the UK and has been a highly regarded \nn\national \nl\naboratory\n, undertaking \npublicly-funded research, for over a century.\n \nOur role is to act as the UK’s \nN\national \nM\neasurement \nI\nnstitute (NMI).\n \nWe sit at the intersection between scientific discovery and real world application, working as a bridge between academia, business and govern\nment.\n \nOur expertise and original research have underpinned quality of life, innovation and competitiveness for UK citizens and business since the opening of \nthe laboratory over 100 years ago\n.\nKey facts:\n&#xa0;\nNPL’\ns \nperformance and \nreputation relies on the first\n-\nclass\n people and \nparticularly the \nexceptional scientists who work at the \nlaboratory\n.\n \nAs a non-academic organisation NPL welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the inquiry and provide \nour\n view about what women value i\nn a scientific career outside\n academia.\nWhy do numbers of women in STE\nM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? \nIn all three years, once a fema\nle got to the promotion panel there was a 100% success rate.\n \nThis is not the case for male candidates and might suggest that \nwomen\n wait until they feel \ncompletely \nready before applying for promotion.\n&#xa0;\nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors? \n&#xa0;&#xa0;What\n should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;\nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
