[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from the Criminal Cases Review Commission[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1
[normal]              
[normal]The Criminal Case Review Commission is the statutory body created in 1997 to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and refer appropriate cases 
[normal]to the appeal courts
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]It has so far reviewed over 15,000 case
[normal]s
[normal] and referred more than 540 for appeal. The majority of those referrals 
[normal]were in
[normal] 
[normal]relation to the most serious crimes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Thanks to determined efforts to make ourselves accessible to 
[normal]all who might need us, 
[normal]applications to the Commission have
[normal] risen by more than 50% sin
[normal]ce 2012. In spite of the increased workload, we have 
[normal]kept
[normal] performance at or around 2012 levels. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]Our
[normal] real terms
[normal] funding shrank by almost 23% between 2008/9 and 2012/13. As a result there were redundancies and other cost saving measures. In 2013/14, in response to increased application rates, we received a small funding increase and recruited to cope with 
[normal]the 
[normal]increased workload.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission 
[normal]long
[normal] argued 
[normal]that 
[normal]its powers to obtain information should cover the private as well as 
[normal]the 
[normal]public sector
[normal], as in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal]. 
[normal]The issue becomes more pressing as more functions transfer f
[normal]rom
[normal] the public to the private sector, but progress remains painfully slow.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]Between April and November 2013
[normal], 
[normal]we
[normal] referred 24 case
[normal]s. This looks set to return the
[normal] referral rate to around 3.5% (the long term average) after two years when 
[normal]it
[normal] dropped below 3%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]We have
[normal] 
[normal]been concerned about a new series 
[normal]of cases involving 
[normal]the wrongful conviction of people arriving
[normal] in
[normal] the 
[normal]UK
[normal] as refugees and asylum seekers
[normal], or as victims of human trafficking
[normal]. These have become
[normal] a significant feature of our work.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]In 2012 the Ministry of Justice 
[normal](MoJ) 
[normal]conducted its first Triennial Review of the Commission and
[normal] passed 
[normal]it 
[normal]with flying colours.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]9
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Criminal Cases Review Commission 
[normal]is 
[normal]the 
[normal]statutory body 
[normal]responsible for investigating
[normal] alleged miscarriages of 
[normal]justice
[normal] and 
[normal]refer
[normal]ring appropriate
[normal] 
[normal]convictions
[normal] 
[normal]and/or
[normal] sentences
[normal] to the appeal courts
[normal]. 
[normal]It was established on 1 
[normal]January
[normal] 1997 by the Criminal Appeal 
[normal]Act
[normal] 1995. 
[normal]It was 
[normal]the first
[normal] body of its kind in the world.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]To date
[normal], the Commission has reviewed more than 15,000 cases and has referred 
[normal]540
[normal] 
[normal]for appeal
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The overwhelming majority of
[normal] cases dealt with 
[normal]are of the most serious 
[normal]type 
[normal]– murder, rape, terrorism
[normal], drugs
[normal] and 
[normal]robbery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]              
[normal]Given the scope of its role, the volume and range of its casework, and its concern with 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole process from investigation
[normal] and 
[normal]prosecution
[normal] to 
[normal]conviction and sentencing, the Commission is uniquely 
[normal]placed to
[normal] comment on all aspects of the criminal justice system and 
[normal]can offer unparalleled 
[normal]insight into 
[normal]the 
[normal]causes of 
[normal]wrongful convictions as well as into t
[normal]he ingredients which make for safe, successful convictions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he Commission c
[normal]an assist others, not only 
[normal]in terms of 
[normal]the
[normal] prevention of unsafe convictions
[normal], but also in 
[normal]improving the system’s ability to build successful c
[normal]ases and ensure safe convictions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]              
[normal]It is 
[normal]essential that the Commission is
[normal] independent of 
[normal]the 
[normal]executive and the judiciary because prosecutions are brought by the state, because a Commission 
[normal]referral
[normal] compels the appeal courts to hear the case and because it is sometimes the courts that are at fault.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14
[normal]              
[normal]Only if we are truly independent can we promote public confidence in the judicial system.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]              
[normal]In addition to reviewing possible miscarriages of justice, the Commission can
[normal] also
[normal] be 
[normal]asked
[normal] by the Court of Appeal 
[normal]Criminal Division 
[normal]to investigate and report on matters 
[normal]relating to live proceedings
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]              
[normal]Commissioners and staff are drawn from a 
[normal]diversity
[normal] of 
[normal]backgrounds including the legal profession
[normal], 
[normal]forensic 
[normal]scien
[normal]ces
[normal], 
[normal]law enforcement
[normal], journal
[normal]ism
[normal], acade
[normal]mia
[normal] and 
[normal]others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]              
[normal]As of 2
[normal] 
[normal]January 2014, there are 
[normal]eleven
[normal] 
[normal]Commissioners appointed by the Queen on the recomm
[normal]endation of the Prime Minister and 
[normal]94
[normal] 
[normal]staff (
[normal]87.57
[normal] 
[normal]full 
[normal]time equivalent) based at offices in 
[normal]Birmingham
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Commission
[normal] is 
[normal]operating
[normal] with a 
[normal]fiscal 
[normal]DEL
[normal] budget of 
[normal]£5,178,000
[normal] funded through grant in aid from the 
[normal]MoJ
[normal].
[normal]Performance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]19
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he Commission has taken innovative steps to 
[normal]make itself accessible to all 
[normal](see 
[normal]Accessibility
[normal] 
[normal]below)
[normal]. As a result, 
[normal]we have
[normal] 
[normal]seen 
[normal]a substantial and sustained 
[normal]i
[normal]ncrease
[normal] in application
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Between 199
[normal]7 and 2011
[normal] t
[normal]he Commission 
[normal]typically 
[normal]receive
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]around 900 
[normal]applications
[normal] per year
[normal]. In 
[normal]the business year 2011/12 we received 1,040 applications
[normal]; 
[normal]in
[normal] 2012/13
[normal] that rose to 1
[normal],
[normal]625.
[normal] 
[normal]We expect 
[normal]case intake to remain at 
[normal]around 
[normal]this level
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]              
[normal]Notwithstanding the increase
[normal]d caseload
[normal], in 
[normal]the 
[normal]year ending March 
[normal]2013, we 
[normal]kept
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]average 
[normal]time taken to begin a review 
[normal]to just under six-and-a-
[normal]half months for custody cases and nine months for liberty cases
[normal]. In the current year to 
[normal]December
[normal], those figures are 
[normal]seven 
[normal]months for custody cases and 
[normal]nine-and-a-half
[normal] months for liberty cases
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]              
[normal]We measure the average time 
[normal]taken to review two types
[normal] of cases.
[normal] 
[normal]For 
[normal] 
[normal]cases which have not gone through the normal 
[normal]appeals
[normal] process
[normal] and
[normal] therefore do not usually receive a full review
[normal] it 
[normal]currently
[normal] takes an average of 19 weeks to reach an
[normal] initial decision. For 
[normal]those
[normal] other
[normal] case
[normal]s
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]do 
[normal]go on to receive a full review, it takes a
[normal]n average
[normal] of
[normal] 21 weeks
[normal] to reach initial decision stage
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Accessibility [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]23
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission 
[normal]became
[normal] concerned about the accessibility of its services 
[normal]when research showed that 
[normal]particular
[normal] groups were under
[normal]-
[normal]represented in 
[normal]our case intake.
[normal] 
[normal]These
[normal] groups include
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]pe
[normal]o
[normal]ple with learning disabilities and/or 
[normal]difficulties
[normal], 
[normal]young people, women in custody, asylum seeker
[normal]s
[normal]/refugees and victims of human trafficking. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24
[normal]              
[normal]In 
[normal]January 2012 
[normal]w
[normal]e 
[normal]designed 
[normal]an 
[normal]Easy Read application form 
[normal]to assist 
[normal]people with learning disabilities
[normal]. The Easy Read format uses simple words and images to help people 
[normal]who struggle with the written word
[normal]; there is
[normal] 
[normal]evidence that 
[normal]other groups, including
[normal] young people and foreign nationals
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]prefer
[normal] Easy R
[normal]ead form
[normal]s 
[normal]to 
[normal]conventional one
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25
[normal]              
[normal]We have extended the Easy Read principle to other
[normal] Commission
[normal] documents
[normal] and 
[normal]have worked throughout this process with 
[normal]the 
[normal]charity 
[normal]Keyring
[normal]’s 
[normal]Working for Justice Group
[normal]. T
[normal]he MoJ has been 
[normal]s
[normal]upportive 
[normal]of 
[normal]these improvements
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Financial Backdrop[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]26
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission has, like most govern
[normal]ment organisations, experienced
[normal] budget reductions in recent years. In the five years 
[normal]to
[normal] 2012/13, our
[normal] 
[normal]normal cash budget
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]fiscal 
[normal]DEL
[normal] budget
[normal]) has reduced by more than 13.5
[normal]%.  Compensating for inflation, the reduction is almost 23%.  However, 
[normal]we are pleased to report that 
[normal]our
[normal] 2013/14 
[normal]budget
[normal] 
[normal]increased slightly
[normal]. A
[normal]fter taking out one-off costs incurred in 2012/13
[normal],
[normal] and factoring in additional savings made, this
[normal] allow
[normal]ed
[normal] us to recruit 
[normal]staff
[normal] to
[normal] help
[normal] deal with
[normal] rising business volumes
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]The budget reductions in the previous five years amou
[normal]nted to £0.8m in money terms
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]£1.5m expres
[normal]sed in 
[normal]today’s money
[normal])
[normal].  
[normal]To
[normal] 
[normal]cope with these cuts 
[normal]we 
[normal]implemented e
[normal]fficiencies and cost savings.  As staff costs account for 
[normal]more than 
[normal]85% of our budget, significant savings had to come from reducing staff costs. A combination of a recruitment freeze and 
[normal]redundancies
[normal] 
[normal]reduced our case
[normal]working staff over this period from 56.5 FTE
[normal] to 46.9 FTE (a 17% reduction).
[normal] Our current year
[normal] budget
[normal] has enabled us to increase our casework staff complement back to 53.9 FTE average for the year to date.  The use of additional short contract staff 
[normal]should bring the
[normal] total up to about 60 FTE for the whole year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Legislation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]28
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission
[normal]’s 
[normal]power
[normal] under section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 to secure material from public bodies
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] a key investigative tool.
[normal] 
[normal]There is
[normal] no corresponding power in respect of private bodies or persons
[normal] and
[normal] the absence of such a power 
[normal]i
[normal]nhibit
[normal]s
[normal] our work. A
[normal]t best, the protracted negotiations to obtain 
[normal]private sector 
[normal]material can delay a review by months, 
[normal]and at worst 
[normal]our inability to obtain information could
[normal] mean a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]issue
[normal] remains unresolved and a miscarriage of justice 
[normal]perpetuated
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29
[normal]              
[normal]The problem is becoming more acute as 
[normal]responsibility for material once held by public bodies is
[normal] increasingly e
[normal]ntrusted to private sector bodies.
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30
[normal]              
[normal]In 2006 a
[normal]n inter
[normal]-
[normal]departmental working party 
[normal]concluded
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] should have the ability, under judicial oversight, to require 
[normal]the disclosure of material by private bodies and individuals
[normal] as is the case with the Scottish CCRC
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Disappointingly, 
[normal]a
[normal]lthough action has been supported 
[normal]in principle 
[normal]by Ministers
[normal], and 
[normal]in spite
[normal] of the fact that there
[normal] 
[normal]have
[normal] been some twenty pieces of criminal justice 
[normal]related legislation since then, no 
[normal]appropriate 
[normal]statutory
[normal] vehicle has apparently presented itself to remedy this 
[normal]defect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Directions for [bold]Investigation[bold] by the Court of Appeal[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]31
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission can be directed by the Court of Appeal to investigate and report on matters 
[normal]in relation to live appeal
[normal]s
[normal] (and applications for permission to appeal)
[normal]. Since 1997 we have 
[normal]receive
[normal]d an
[normal] average
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]four
[normal] such directions 
[normal]a year
[normal] (
[normal]eight
[normal] per year since 2006/07).
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]uch
[normal] cases can involve lengthy, complex investigations; because they
[normal] relate to live proceedings 
[normal]they
[normal] necessarily take priority ove
[normal]r cases 
[normal]awaiting review
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32
[normal]              
[normal]Three 
[normal]of the cases that we have completed since our last Select Committee 
[normal]report 
[normal]have required very significant amount
[normal]s
[normal] of work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33
[normal]              
[normal]Allegations of 
[normal]jury contamination or bias 
[normal]through the 
[normal]inapp
[normal]ropriate
[normal] internet
[normal] use has been
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]notable
[normal] 
[normal]theme
[normal] of recent 
[normal]enquiries
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Referrals[bold]&#xa0;[bold]34
[normal]              
[normal]Between April and
[normal] 
[normal]November
[normal] 2013, 
[normal]we 
[normal]received 
[normal]949
[normal] applications and referred
[normal] 24
[normal] cases 
[normal]to the
[normal] appellate courts. In 2009/10 the rate of referrals as a percentage of all cases closed was 3.48% (31 referrals out of 892 cases). In 2010/11, that 
[normal]fell
[normal] to 2.3% (22 out of 947 cases), but in 2011/12, it 
[normal]rose t
[normal]o 3.5% again (31 
[normal]out of 887 cases).

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Northern Ireland[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]36
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission continues to receive a steady flow of cases from 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] the 
[normal]majority of
[normal] which 
[normal]are Troubles
[normal] related.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission has so far 
[normal]received 367 
[normal]applications
[normal] from 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Of
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]316
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]cases now closed,
[normal] 39
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]cases have
[normal] been referred 
[normal]for appeal. Of the 
[normal]34 cases 
[normal]decided
[normal] by the Nor
[normal]thern Ireland Court of Appeal, 
[normal]30
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]have
[normal] resulted in convictions being quashed or 
[normal]sentences reduced while c
[normal]onvictions were upheld in 
[normal]four
[normal] cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One summary conviction was quashed by the County Court.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]38
[normal]              
[normal]On 23 May 2012, the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal handed down the judgment in
[normal] the cases of
[normal] 
[normal]R v Brown, Wright, McDonald and McCaul
[normal] [
[normal]2012] NICA 14.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] These 
[normal]cases, 
[normal]referred 
[normal]by us 
[normal]in
[normal] 2009
[normal], 
[normal]concern
[normal]ed
[normal] admissions made by defendants who were 15 or 16 years old at the time of their arrest and interview in the 1970s. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]None of the applicants had access to a solicitor during 
[normal]d
[normal]etention before making admissions and none was accompanied by a parent or independent person during interview. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Co
[normal]urt
[normal] quashed the convictions of 
[normal]Messrs
[normal] McDonald and McCaul but upheld those of 
[normal]Messrs
[normal] Brown and Wright. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following the judgment, the Commission was able to progress 
[normal]a number of
[normal] other
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]youth confession
[normal]”
[normal] cases which could not be reviewed until the outcome of 
[normal]those cases was known
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In all but 
[normal]two
[normal] 
[normal]of those cases a decision 
[normal]was
[normal] made not to refer
[normal]; the 
[normal]two
[normal] 
[normal]cases remain under review.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]40
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission is required by statute to have a Commissioner with particular knowledge of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland and a new Northern Ireland Commissioner is about to be appointed. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Casework themes[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]41
[normal]              
[normal]We have recently seen some new strains of miscarriage of justice arising alongside the disappointingly familiar ones such as those caused by the non-disclosure of material that could have been useful to the defence, investigative tunnel vision, failure to make adequate background checks on witness
[normal]es and complainants 
[normal]and changes in the medical or scientific understanding of evidence. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42
[normal]              
[normal]The most significant new strain of cases has involved refugees or asylum seekers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Case[bold]s[bold] involving immigration-type offences[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]43
[normal]              
[normal]Over the last few years, 
[normal]we have
[normal] identified a series of cases where refugees or asylum seekers have been prosecuted for offences relating to their entry into the 
[normal]UK
[normal], such as having a false passport, having no passport or attempting to obtain services by deception.
[normal] The Commission is concerned about 
[normal]those 
[normal]cases 
[normal]where the
[normal]re ha
[normal]s
[normal] been a failure to deploy available
[normal] defences
[normal] 
[normal]which are designed to prote
[normal]ct people escaping persecution.
[normal] In a number of cases individuals have been prosecuted and advised to plead guilty when a statutory defence was available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]44
[normal]              
[normal]We have raise
[normal]d
[normal] awareness of the issues with charities and other
[normal] organisations
[normal] 
[normal]working
[normal] 
[normal]with 
[normal]people
[normal] who may be wrongly convicted
[normal] in this way
[normal]. We have also
[normal] raised
[normal] awareness with the
[normal] judiciary, the
[normal] defence
[normal] and the prosecution 
[normal]to 
[normal]seek to
[normal] minimize the risk of
[normal] further wrongful convictions
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]45
[normal]              
[normal]Nevertheless, w
[normal]e continue to receive applications from people convicted in these circumstances, some quite recently. 
[normal]Between November 2011 and
[normal] November 2013
[normal], we received 
[normal]approximately 80 applications 
[normal]of this type.
[normal] S
[normal]ince our las
[normal]t report to 
[normal]this
[normal] Committee, 
[normal]we have referred 
[normal]f
[normal]ourteen 
[normal]such
[normal] cases
[normal]; 
[normal]twelve 
[normal]convictions have been 
[normal]quashed;
[normal] 
[normal]one
[normal] person abandoned the
[normal]ir
[normal] appeal 
[normal]and one case remains to be heard.
[normal] 
[normal]There is likely to be a significant further stock of such cases 
[normal]from people who are unaware that
[normal] their conviction is unsafe. We are working with Crown Prosecution Service to identify these.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Another 
[normal]new 
[normal]type of case that concern us are 
[normal]those involving
[normal] victims of human trafficking 
[normal]who may have been compelled to commit 
[normal]the
[normal] crime
[normal] for which they are convicted and, thus, have a defence. Those convicted are often children or young adults.

[normal]Courts Martial cases[bold]&#xa0;[bold]47
[normal]              
[normal]In 2009 the C
[normal]ommission’s 
[normal]jurisdiction was extended to cover convictions and sentences arising from the Court Martial or 
[normal]Service Civilian Court
[normal] after 31 October 2009.
[normal] [bold]As 
[normal]anticipated
[normal], 
[normal]the impact of this 
[normal]has been slight with 
[normal]only 
[normal]three
[normal] applications 
[normal]received to date.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Triennial Review of the Commission[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]48
[normal]              
[normal]During 2012/13 a triennial review of the Commission took place; the final report 
[normal]was
[normal] published 
[normal]in
[normal] June 2013. We are delighted with the positive endorsement of our work and the support for our continued existence. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]49
[normal]              
[normal]The report 
[normal]recommended 
[normal]strengthen
[normal]ing
[normal] the role of Chair and
[normal] changing 
[normal]governance structures.
[normal] 
[normal]There have been preliminary discus
[normal]sions within the Commission and 
[normal]proposals on the role of the Chair are agreed.  As regards governance more generally, it was not considered
[normal] 
[normal]appropriate to 
[normal]reach
[normal] a settled view when the
[normal] MoJ’s
[normal] process to advertise the post of Chair and make an appointment was 
[normal]ongoing
[normal].  The Chair was re-appointed 
[normal]in
[normal] November 2013 and the matter will now be 
[normal]discussed
[normal] at the next Commission Board meeting on 28 January.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]50
[normal]              
[normal]The triennial review reinforces the need for the Commission’s independence and the requirement for a separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary. Whilst that is welcome, the Commission remains concerned about what may be perceived as an erosion of its independence 
[normal]arising from pressures on 
[normal]it
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]on 
[normal]other Arms’ Length Bodies
[normal],
[normal] to 
[normal]conform to centralised control
[normal]s 
[normal]applied
[normal] in way
[normal]s
[normal] that, in our view, fail to give due consideration to 
[normal]the 
[normal]essential differences
[normal] between central government and independen
[normal]t
[normal] public bodies
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]For th
[normal]ose
[normal] reasons, the Commission remains concerned about 
[normal]the loss of 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]own 
[normal]website. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Website and branding [bold]&#xa0;[bold]51
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission was disappointed to have been required by the Government’s 2010 website 
[normal]rationalisation
[normal] programme to close its own dedicated website
[normal]. 
[normal]We pursued every available avenue to oppose the loss of our site
[normal] and made what we considered to be a strong business case based on the 
[normal]premise
[normal] that having our own site was 
[normal]an
[normal] important demonstration of our independence
[normal] 
[normal]and a 
[normal]vital to
[normal]ol for
[normal] 
[normal]e
[normal]nsuring that
[normal] 
[normal]potential 
[normal]applicants
[normal] and other interested parties had reasonable access to us.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]52
[normal]              
[normal]Since 
[normal]2011 we
[normal] have rel
[normal]ied, unhappily, 
[normal]on the justice.gov.uk site.
[normal] 
[normal]It is with considerable trepidation that we 
[normal]face the prospect of the 
[normal]move later this year to the .gov.uk site. We view that as a further step along a road to which we were, 
[normal]as explained
[normal] above, fundamentally opposed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]53
[normal]              
[normal]The nub of this is that potential victims of miscarriages of justice
[normal] often
[normal] see themselves as victi
[normal]ms of the State as prosecutor. 
[normal]To say that to seek redress they can go to a body
[normal] supposedly
[normal] independent of the executive, but one whose website has the word “State” over the doorway, is to risk the appearance of absurdity if not worse.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]54
[normal]              
[normal]There have 
[normal]also been
[normal] moves to 
[normal]rationalise branding for public bodies including NDPBs such as the Commission. This proposal, under which the Commission would 
[normal]be
[normal] required to adopt the same logo and other branding elements as a 
[normal]range
[normal] of other public bodies, caused us considerable concern. Again, we argued that being required to adopt the coat of arms-based branding used by various bodies, including central government departments, would seriously compromise perception of our independence
[normal],
[normal] undermine 
[normal]confidence in 
[normal]us
[normal] and 
[normal]confuse
[normal] actual and potential applicants
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Towards the end of 2012 we received the welcome news that 
[normal]we will
[normal] be exempted from tho
[normal]se proposals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Stakeholder[bold] Activity[bold]&#xa0;[bold]55
[normal]              
[normal]Our aim has been to promote public understanding of our role and to raise informed awareness about the Commission with specific groups such 
[normal]as
[normal] potential applicants, campaigners, the judiciary and the legal profession.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]56
[normal]              
[normal]The main events of our stakeholder 
[normal]a
[normal]ctivity over the last four years have been the successful stakeholder conferences held in 2010 and 2012. We attracted excellent speakers and panellists and a wide range of attendees to both events
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]57
[normal]              
[normal]We have made specific efforts to engage with innocence projects and other university-based 
[normal]pro bono
[normal] projects interested in 
[normal]wrongful convictions 
[normal]and aiming 
[normal]to make
[normal] applications to the Commission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]58
[normal]              
[normal]We
[normal] have recently made available an advice 
[normal]line so that 
[normal]pro bono
[normal] units can benefit from advice provided by 
[normal]casework s
[normal]taff. In 2012 we ran our first work experience placements for university students. The principal aim of our engagement with university projects is to encourage them to make timely and good quality applications in relation to appropriate cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]59
[normal]              
[normal]In June 2013 we worked wit
[normal]h 
[normal]Warwick
[normal] 
[normal]University
[normal] to provide
[normal] 
[normal]Commission 
[normal]specific training for solicitors and barristers
[normal]. We expect that this will 
[normal]have
[normal] increased understanding of the Commission and helped to improve the quality of applications to us. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Academic research [bold]&#xa0;[bold]60
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission has, 
[normal]with appropriate safeguards in place, allowed controlled access to a number of 
[normal]academic 
[normal]research projects exploring various aspects of 
[normal]our
[normal] work. The research phase of two projects is complete and we expect to see publication of the results in 2014. Two further projects are still in the research phase and another has yet to begin. These projects are in addition to several published 
[normal]works 
[normal]based on access to Commission material.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]IT[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]61
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]Until 2012/13 the Commission’s IT service was outsourced to a
[normal] private
[normal] company, but the decision was made to bring the service in-house.  
[normal]We also conducted a
[normal] review of our third party support contracts.  The resultant changes generated substantial savings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]62
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission has invested 
[normal]in secure remote workin
[normal]g facilities for some Commissioners and staff
[normal]. 
[normal]This has enabled more 
[normal]flexible working and 
[normal]has
[normal], together with 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]“hot-desking”,
[normal] 
[normal]helped
[normal] 
[normal]to accommodate the recent
[normal]ly
[normal] increase
[normal]d
[normal] staff numbers
[normal] in the much smaller premises to which the Commission move
[normal]d
[normal], for financial reasons, in May 2010.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]63
[normal]              
[normal]Other 
[normal]current
[normal] 
[normal]IT 
[normal]projects 
[normal]include the crucial 
[normal]replacement 
[normal]of 
[normal]our ageing and now 
[normal]unsupported case management system
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]64
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission 
[normal]has proved its value in the criminal justice system over the last 16 years
[normal]. While 
[normal]we 
[normal]are grateful for the modest funding 
[normal]increase in 2013/14, 
[normal]particularly in light of the current economic climate, 
[normal]we are acutely aware that 
[normal]maintain
[normal]in
[normal]g 
[normal]at least the same 
[normal]level of fundi
[normal]n
[normal]g
[normal] for
[normal] 
[normal]next year will be 
[normal]cr
[normal]ucial to 
[normal]our ability 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]deal 
[normal]properly 
[normal]with
[normal] the sustained increase in applications
[normal]. Only an increase in funding would allow us to reduce queues to more reasonable levels. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]65
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that our casework function and its support services are as lean as they can be and our ability to investigate cases and reach the appropria
[normal]te decision in each is as good now as it has ever been.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]66
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]We are proud of and committed to our efforts to ensure that we 
[normal]remain independent and
[normal] accessible to all who need us. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]67
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]We aim to continue building relationships with individuals and organisations that will help us 
[normal]to 
[normal]fulfil our functions, to reach potential a
[normal]pplicants and
[normal] raise informed awareness of our role
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]help us feed
[normal] 
[normal]back our findings 
[normal]to the criminal justice system at large.
