[[[) (AMR0027)]]]Combined responses from bacteriology (HCAI and AMRS Programme Board; also submitted directly), virology (David Brown, Tamyo Mbisa, Angie Lackenby), mycology (Liz Johnson), parasitology and malaria (Peter Chiodini and Colin Sutherland).1.              How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?BacteriaNotable successes have included the halt, and subsequent reversal, of the rise in bacteraemias caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the decline in infections caused by resistant pneumococci strains of serotypes covered by available vaccines. However, these declines have been offset by a significant rise in infections caused by increasingly resistant Gram-negative bacteria, for example carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Such resistant strains have come to epitomize the resistance threat, with few licensed antibiotics offering effective treatment options.Viruses Resistance to one of the two licensed classes of influenza antiviral drug (adamantanes) has become widespread since 2003. All currently circulating strains are adamantine-resistant, including the A(H7N9) virus currently causing outbreaks in China. This leaves two neuraminidase inhibitors as the only effective licensed anti-influenza drugs. However, resistance to Tamiflu emerged in one subtype of influenza virus in 2007-8, and within a year had become the first incidence of global neuraminidase inhibitor resistance. There are fears that resistance could develop and spread as rapidly in the pandemic strain; a surprising number of patients infected in China with the avian A(H7N9) virus have developed Tamiflu-resistant virus, leading to concerns that resistance may develop more readily in this strain. Neuraminidase resistance in highly pathogenic potential pandemic strains is a challenge for pandemic planning, antiviral stockpiling and outbreak management.Fungi There is evidence of both emerging and innate resistance to different groups of antifungal drugs amongst common yeast isolates. In recent years multidrug-resistant isolates have emerged, although numbers are still quite low. In countries such as the Netherlands and surrounding areas there is concern about the spread of one or more azole-resistant clades of&#xa0;the mould Aspergillus fumigatus, which is responsible for about 80% of invasive mould infections. The resistance appears to be due to mutations, which were probably selected by the use of agricultural azoles, and could severely limit the use of the first-line agent voriconazole as well as other azole drugs&#xa0;in treatment of infections due to this mould. Some other mould species that cause deep infections have only limited susceptibility to current agents, while others are resistant to all currently available agents.Development of resistance during long-term therapy is a problem for both refractory yeast and chronic Aspergillus infections.Parasites/MalariaThere has been further spread of drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum and now P. vivax malaria; drug-resistant Fasciola hepatica has been detected in UK livestock; Leishmania donovani showing significant resistance to antimonial drugs has become established in India; and cases of Giardia infection clinically resistant to the nitroimidazoles (e.g. metronidazole) are increasingly recognised.2. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?BacteriaOne major uncertainty, despite the agreed need for antimicrobial stewardship to prevent and slow resistance, is exactly what good stewardship looks like. There is a tendency in the UK to equate stewardship with simply minimising use of antibiotics such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Consequently, there have been major increases in the use of a very narrow range of alternative antibiotics, especially an antibiotic called piperacillin-tazobactam. This can be equated to 'squeezing the balloon' by potentially creating a resistance problem elsewhere. Rather than ‘swinging the pendulum’ away from use of what might be the most effective antibiotic for the patient (e.g. use of cephalosporins), improving knowledge about appropriate prescribing is required.VirusesInfluenza: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV):Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV):FungiParasites/Malariaa)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Molecular determinants of slow parasite clearance after artemisinin treatment in SE Asia, considered by some to be the early signs of emergence of true resistance, are still unknown although some candidates have been identified but not yet validated; thus markers may be available for surveillance in the UK within 12 months b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Malaria Reference Laboratory is currently validating new markers associated with ACT treatment failure in the context of African Plasmodium falciparum malaria - this appears to be a different phenomenon.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Almost all UK cases of falciparum malaria are of African origin, which should inform our surveillance and treatment policy for imported malaria cases. The role of asymptomatic cases in endemic countries as reservoirs of drug-insensitive parasites is becoming an important topic but needs more concerted attention to inform our practice in the UK.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Treatment failure with the current best practice-preferred combination regimen (artemether-lumefantrine) is extremely rare – we have had only one well-documented case since this regimen entered widespread use, and this responded to rescue treatment (atovaquone-proguanil).e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The European Medicines Authority (EMA) has recently licensed two further artemisinin-based antimalarial combinations (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine; artesunate-pyronaridine) and these are likely to be very effective second-line regimens in rare cases of artemether-lumefantrine failure. f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UK malaria drugs policy and surveillance for antimalarial resistance must maintain cross-talk between thorough monitoring of our imported malaria burden, and the most recent data from the field in the endemic areas from which the bulk of our cases originate – Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and other anglophone sub-Saharan nations. 3. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?BacteriaWith a limited scope for public funding, addressing the critical need to increase the range of alternative antibiotics is a huge challenge in the work to combat rises in infections caused by resistant bacteria. There is a need to identify why the costs of research are so high and seek to reduce them. An alternative approach to public funding would be to work to attract private investment. The GAIN Act in the US is a useful model, effectively extending patent life. More generally, barriers to entry could be reduced. High costs mean that that only a few large companies can run Phase III trials. In relation to other treatments and methods, there is a need for stronger research programmes into non-antibiotic treatments for infection such as biologicals, monoclonal antibodies, and new vehicles for rapid vaccine development. VirusesInfluenza: There are several antivirals in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, both influenza-specific or more broadly acting, largely funded by industry or in some cases US governmental departments. Further drugs are licenced in other countries (Japan, Korea), but not widely available elsewhere. Strategies to make industry investment in alternative target antivirals may be worthwhile.  Increase repertoire of drugs available for treatment of severe influenza. HCV: Research and investment on new treatments (DAAs targeting different viral-specific functions) is increasing and the number of anti-HCV agents is expected to rival those available for HIV in the next few years.HIV: There has been a decline in research and investment because there are a lot of anti-retrovirals on the market (including cheaper generic forms).  However, unlike anti-HCV agents, anti-retrovirals do not eradicate HIV from the body. Therefore, infected individuals have to remain on therapy for life at a cost of ~£16,000 per year. Thus, more research funding is required for eradication or transmission prevention strategies.Fungi There are currently no antifungal agents with novel mechanisms of action in the development pipeline. There is also a need for development of better diagnostic tests to reduce the unnecessary use of empirical therapy.Parasites/MalariaThe main problem with parasitic diseases of humans is reliance on only one drug or reliance on old, toxic agents.  In the case of tropical parasites this is very largely due to lack of investment in new drug research and development.The following parasites give rise to particular concern:MalariaOne approach to support this could be DfID and RCUK specific calls for project proposals in the twin areas of malaria resistance monitoring in endemic areas AND drug discovery projects at all phases of the pipeline. Trichomonas vaginalis: Nitroimidazoles (metronidazole or tinidazole) are the only oral agents available to treat this very common condition. Fasciola hepatica: Triclabendazole-resistant Fasciola is found in UK livestock and is present globally.  We have no second line drug for use in humans if triclabendazole fails.Schistosomiasis; Praziquantel is the only drug available for the treatment of human schistosomiasis.Trypanosoma cruzi: The only drugs available, benznidazole and nifurtimox, are very toxic (significant side-effects in 50% of cases).Trypanosoma brucei spp.: Some drugs are toxic and very old. Eg melarsoprol, an arsenical compound (sic), is still in use.Hydatid disease: Benzimidazoles (albendazole, with the less-effective mebendazole as alternative) are the mainstay of medical treatment. There is no good alternative to these agents. Cryptosporidium: There is only one effective drug (nitazoxanide).4. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens? Bacteria Spread of resistant bacteria is complicated and can occur in many different ways. Infection control measures, including behavioural changes (such as those relating to hand hygiene), have proved to be effective in preventing spread of some types of resistant bacteria - an example would be the success in reducing MRSA bacteraemias acquired in hospital settings. In these situations, spread from the environment or another person are major factors. However, it is less clear whether this approach will work when resistance is spread directly between bacteria. Ongoing improvements to surveillance and diagnostics (such as the adoption of whole genome sequencing) have been and will play a central role in control of all pathogens, resistant or otherwise.Primary infection prevention is key to reducing the need for antibiotics in the first place. Much work is still required to identify the most effective measures to effect behaviour change in both the public and professionals in a less transient way. The focus and scrutiny afforded to MRSA and C. difficile infections should be expanded to include the current and emerging threats such as multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, so that effective interventions can be developed. VirusesInfluenza: Few measures have been taken to control the potential spread of influenza virus resistant to drugs. Adamantane resistance was widespread before significant investment was made into surveillance for resistance. The Tamiflu-resistant A(H1N1) strain spread globally in 2008,. Experience from the 2009 pandemic showed that immune-compromised individuals are at higher risk of developing resistant virus as a result of treatment, and therefore some countries, including the UK PHE, made amendments to treatment guidance given to clinicians to manage this Future pandemic planning may avoid the use of post exposure prophylaxis in order to preserve limited repertoire of drugs. FungiTransmission of resistant yeast isolates from person to person is a rare occurrence. However, if resistant clades of an opportunistic pathogenic mould appear in the environment, as has been seen in the Netherlands, then only air filtration can prevent at-risk patients from inhaling spores. Greater legislation on the use and availability of agricultural azoles may limit the selective pressure for resistance.Parasites/MalariaPublic health measures (good sanitation; good animal husbandry; vector control) are the mainstay of control of parasitic diseases. Controlling the spread of resistant parasites is aided by case-finding and adequate treatment.5. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?BacteriaGreater international collaboration is required on surveillance of resistance, particularly in countries where resistance is extremely prevalent and with which the UK has major population flows, for example the Indian sub-continent. The UK may wish to offer greater support for constructive initiatives, such as the Chennai Declaration in India, and an increased focus on newly prosperous developing countries where resistance is most prevalent. Consideration needs to be given to the management of risks relating to spread of resistance resulting from UK acceptance of patients from countries in conflict, such as the Middle East and North Africa. The UK should consider co-operating within the EU for example, on improving licensing regulation (which is handled via EMA) and on legislation akin to the GAIN act, creating 'Pull' incentives.VirusesInfluenza: The WHO has implemented a working group, comprised of experts in the field from around the world (including PHE staff) to monitor the global situation, develop guidance for surveillance and ensure that the risks and consequences of influenza antiviral resistance are understood. Funding for these working groups however is scarce.PHE is part of the coordination group of the European Reference Laboratory Network for influenza (ERLI-Net), which provides training and external quality assurance panels to ensure that European laboratories are equipped to perform thorough antiviral susceptibility surveillance. There is a paucity of antiviral susceptibility surveillance data from several global areas, South America and Africa in particular. PHE initiated a two-year capacity-building project in 2010 with six countries in South America to address this gap. The lack of continued funding has made it difficult to maintain the capacity, or to test sufficient virus numbers to yield comprehensive data for the region. &#xa0;HCV: Use of DAAs is in early stages and no global coordination initiatives are being undertaken yet.  A full understanding of resistance is first required to inform whether global initiatives will be required.HIV: A WHO Global HIV Drug Resistance Surveillance Network consisting of a network of countries and affiliated institutions was established few years ago to implement the WHO HIV drug resistance strategy to which the UK contributes. However, activities are limited due to WHO funding cut backs.FungiBetter surveillance networks and some routine environmental surveillance may be helpful. There are no working parties formed specifically to address this issue.&#xa0;&#xa0;Parasites/MalariaFor parasitology, the UK has good liaison between the medical and veterinary professions in respect of zoonoses. Cross-border collaboration is strong for malaria and the UK plays its part in global surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance:6. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?The challenge of antimicrobial resistance is of such magnitude that, inevitably, no single national strategy can sufficiently address all of the issues. The UK Five-Year AMR Strategy 2013-2018 sets a good foundation and provides a good start for national and international discussions on actions to address antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, it may prove that our actions, as set out in the strategy, will not stem the tide of antibacterial resistance and that more far-reaching societal actions to conserve and develop new antibiotics will be required. The Strategy focuses almost entirely on bacterial resistance and future versions should consider also the increasing burden posed by resistance to antivirals, antifungals and anti-parasitics. For these, too, greater support is needed for new drug development and for education in rational drug therapy to avoid unnecessary drug usage in tackling drug resistance.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;

[[[How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?]]]PHE has analysed trends in AMR by collecting data on the resistance of bacteria causing blood stream infections. This is done by collecting local data from hospital microbiology laboratories and also by hospital laboratories sending bacteria to the national reference laboratories for testing. There are many types of bacteria that can cause infection and many antibiotics available for use, hence the number of “drug/bug” combinations that must be studied to get the complete picture is immense. Examples of resistance in two common pathogens causing important infections include:(1) 

[[[E. coli]]]: Resistance to ciprofloxacin increased year-on-year from ~5% in 2000 to nearly 25% in 2006-2007, while resistance to third-generation cephalosporins increased from 2% to 12% over the same period, with resistance to both agents been commonly see. Although rates of resistance to both drugs showed a slight decline thereafter, rates have plateaued at about 20% and 10% respectively. There is now concern about increases in resistance to the alternative drugs piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem. Although resistance to meropenem is still relatively uncommon in blood stream isolates of E. coli, there appears to be increasing evidence of widespread gut carriage, while may be subsequently reflected in resistance in invasive infections. This is a major concern as meropenem is a “drug of last resort”.(2) 

[[[Neisseria]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[gonorrhoeae]]]: Ciprofloxacin was the recommended treatment for gonorrhoea but increases in resistance in gonococci since 2000, have led to a change in the national guidance with a switch from ciprofloxacin to the third-generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone. However, reports of reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins are now starting to emerge. If this becomes a significant problem, there is no obvious next antibiotic to recommend for first-line treatment. 

[[[What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance (AMR)?]]]The Department of Health and Public Health England are working together to assess the existing evidence base around antimicrobial resistance and highlight gaps in our knowledge.  This work is ongoing.  To date, the following areas have been considered:Mobile genetic elements are a type of DNA that can move within the genome and transfer genetic information between microorganisms.  It is understood that these can cause the transfer of resistance between different infections, but the scale of transfer and the resulting impact is not well understood.  Further understanding of the significance of different mobile genetic elements to the transfer of resistance would also be beneficial.Patients who are admitted to hospital with an infection or who develop an infection while in hospital will be investigated microbiologically (i.e. clinical specimens such as sputum, urine or blood are sent to the laboratory for analysis) as part of their treatment. This means that the cause of the infection will be diagnosed and the antibiotic susceptibility of the causative bacteria will be investigated. By collecting this information on infections in hospitals we have developed a good understanding of antibiotic resistance within hospitals. In contrast, patients treated in the community by GPs are usually not investigated microbiologically. Rather the GP assesses the likely cause of infection on clinical grounds alone and decides what antibiotic to use empirically. Thus information on rates of AMR among bacteria causing common infections in the community, such as urinary tract, skin or respiratory infections are not routinely available. As 70-80% of antibiotics prescribed to patients are prescribed in the community, lack of knowledge on rates of resistance is a significant knowledge gap. GPs do sometimes send specimens to the microbiology laboratory for investigation, but these are usually from patients who have failed treatment or have complicated infections, and hence comprise a biased sample of specimens, which are highly likely to over represent resistance (which is a likely cause of treatment failure).  Thus the transmission (or carriage) of resistant infections within primary healthcare and the wider community is less well understood compared to hospitals.  There are also specific aspects of AMR in the community that we need to know more about. These include AMR in nursing homes which could act as an interface between the hospital and the “true” community. Also, there are some preliminary data that suggest that carriage rates for resistant E. coli may vary according to ethnicity. This is a potentially important area where further data are needed.Antibiotics are used in both human and veterinary medicine. Hence resistance may developed in humans and spread from person to person.  It may also develop in animals or the environment and be passed to humans (or vice versa). Understanding the relative importance of resistance in humans and animals and their inter-relationship is an area where more research is needed in order to provide a rational basis for developing potentials intervention strategies.The growing capacity for genome sequencing in the UK will provide an opportunity to study in detail the genetic makeup of resistant infections, and by sequencing across a range of sources trace their origin.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The use of antimicrobials is a known driver for resistance.  However while data for total usage in the community are readily available, data on antibiotic usage in hospitals is much more limited. To gain a better understanding of the volume and type of antimicrobials in use and their relationship to the development of AMR, Public Health England (PHE) have established the English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR).  Further information can be found in the article: Ashiru-Oredope, D and Hopkins, S on behalf of the English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilization and Resistance Oversight Group.
