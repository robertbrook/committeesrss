default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the opportunity
default to respond to the Committee’s i
defaultnquiry
default, which 
defaultw
defaulte regard as
default an
default important contributio
defaultn to the debate about the BBC.
default 
defaultIt will be for the Government to start Charter Review before 2016 and in this submission we have therefore been mindful of the danger of pre-j
defaultudging that 
defaultprocess.
default 
defaultOur submission 
defaulttherefore 
defaultfocuses on 
defaultour 
defaultrece
defaultnt 
defaultand current 
defaultperformance
default 
defaultand 
defaulton 
defaultour strategy to 201
default6, as well as answers
default the Committee’s specific questions. 
defaultIt is accompanied by a comprehensive audience research pack and two recently 
defaultpublished papers on the value of Public Service Broadcasting (PSB).
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur starting-point is that t
defaulthe BBC exists to have a positive impact on society by bringing the best 
defaultin 
defaultmedia content to 
defaulteveryone. Our mission is to 
defaultinform, educate and entertain; provide 
defaultvalue to all audiences not just some; introduce audiences to things they love but otherwise might not have discovered; and focus on the quality and depth of impact, not just the quantity of consumption. While the primary purpose of the BBC is to serve audi
defaultences and society, 
defaultwe are also 
defaultan important 
defaultpart of
default Britain’s creative economy
default at home and globally
default, supporting innovation,
default 
defaultgrowth and jobs
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe background to this inquiry includes the mistakes that the BBC has made over Savile, DMI and severance pay.  We
default acknowledge that these have raised questions about how the BBC is run and governed, which we look forward to discussing with the Committee.  In the meantime, we have put plans in place to learn the appropriate lessons, including through our review of gove
defaultrnance with the Trust and the cap on severance payments of £150,000.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite those mistakes, the BBC is in the middle of a period of genuine creative success, from the Olympics to Dr Who. That creative health reflects the underlying strength of the BBC’s 
defaultmodel, 
defaultbased
default on the principles of universal access, shared investme
defaultnt and ownership by the public – 
defaultprinciples that are 
defaultshared with many other public services. 
defaultThe end result is the widespread availability of better, cheaper 
defaultmedia 
defaultservices for the public t
defaulthan could be achieved by the market alone. This is important because 
defaultPSB 
defaultis 
defaulta 
defaultsocial 
default‘primary good’ (like health and 
defaulteducation) which everyone has a right to access in order to participate fully in society. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat model also delivers value for money
default.
default 
defaultOver 
defaultthe past 20 years, the BBC has worked hard to deliver more without costi
defaultng more. Twenty years ago, the Licence F
defaultee was over £147 
defaultin today’s money.
default We 
defaulthad two TV stations, five national radio stations, and local and Nations radio. Today, we deliver four times more television channels, twice as many national radio stations, 
defaultonline 
defaultservices and the 
defaultiPlayer
default.
default 
defaultAudience perceptions of BBC value for money have 
defaultincreased during this Charter period.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTh
defaulte BBC’s mission feels as relevant as ever 
defaultbut 
defaultwill need to be 
defaultdelivered 
defaultin new
default 
defaultand 
defaultdifferent ways
default as technologies, markets and audience expectations evolve. In recent years the number of content providers, formats and platforms has grown rapidly; on-demand usage is rising; and audiences have come to 
defaultexpect greater
default control, personalisation and particip
defaultation in media services. The 
defaultscale of the BBC in today’s media market 
defaultshould 
defaultbe kept in perspective. Twenty years ago, the BBC accounted for around 40% of 
defaulttotal 
defaultbroadcast revenues. Today, we account for around 
default25%. 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst these changes bolster the value 
defaultof 
defaultPSB
default, such as in producing and curating high-quality content, they make delivering this value more 
defaultchallenging
default. For example, growth in the number of gated platforms threatens the prominence of public service output, and globalisation of content market
defaults
default a
defaultllows highly-funded international
default players
default to compete with suppliers of UK
default 
defaultoriginated content. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe BBC’s strategy to 2016default&#xa0;default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC 
defaulthas developed a 
defaultstrategy to respond to these changes and to 
defaultcontinue 
defaultdelive
defaultr
defaulting
default its public service mission. 
defaultTh
defaulte
default strategy was set out in a speech by the BBC Director General in 
defaultOctober
default this year
default. 
defaultIn summary, w
defaulte 
defaultplan to
default: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe strategy is about 
defaultre-inventing the BBC and 
defaultmaximising the value 
defaultwe 
defaultdeliver
default to audiences,
default within 
defaultour current
default 
defaultbudgetary
default c
defaultonstraints
default.
default 
defaultThe 2
default010 Licence Fee settlement saw 
defaultfunding frozen in nominal terms and the addition of fu
defaultrther 
defaultobl
defaultigations
default to be funded from core revenue
defaults
default. In response
default,
default the B
defaultBC has set out plans to cut our 
defaultexpenditure 
defaultby 16% by 2016/17 plus 4% for re-investments.
default 
defaultTo deliver the new strategic plans
default,
default set out 
defaultbelow
default,
default an additional £100m annum will 
defaultbe required by 2016/17
default. 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese
default savings will be funded 
defaultthrough 
defaulta combination of efficiencies and scope reductions. 
defaultWe are 
defaultplanning to 
defaultdeliver efficiency savings at 3%-4% per year to 2016/17
default.
default 
defaultTherefore, tough choices in content and services will be necessary in the years ahead. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn 
defaultimportant aspect
default of the new strategy
default is BBC 
defaultiPlayer
default,
default 
defaultwhich will 
defaultprovi
defaultde not just “TV, online” but increasingly
default “online TV” with 
defaultthe 
defaultcontent formats and modes of curation and consumption this allows. A key strand is the content proposition, where we will ex
defaulttend
default the catch-up window for public service content to 30 days; offer opportu
defaultnities to purchase material t
defaulth
defaultat
default is outside this window; and 
defaultdevelop new ways in which online content and delivery can improve the way the BBC delivers its public service mission.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTo further the Reithian mission
default,
default we will 
defaultimprove a number of 
defaultkey content genres
default.
default News will benefit from more long-term investigations, a refreshed online offer (including an emphasis on mobile delivery), and a target to double our global audience. Our arts coverage will be confident, with new commissions for television
default and
default 
defaultregular bro
defaultadcast performances from significant artistic events and institutions
default.
default We will re
default-
defaultlaunch our partnership with Arts Council England – the Space – to pioneer the discovery of new kinds of digital art and talent. We 
defaultplan to 
defaultbring landmark arts and music serie
defaults and 
defaultevents to peak-time television 
defaultand establish a public service position in digital music through 
defaultPlaylister
default, a partnership with online music websites. 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBBC One will 
defaultfocus on
default distinctive drama and entertainment, as wel
defaultl as public service events that
default 
defaults
defaultupport and widen the 
defaultnational conversations. BBC Four will return to its role as a multi-genre channel tasked with finding the most innovative, high-quality material. BBC Two will have additional factual entertainment, comedy and features and will continue
default to bring distinctive content to a broad audience. BBC Two and BBC Four will work more effectively together as the BBC’s core channels for the arts, music and current affairs.  
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOverall, the BBC 
defaultwould like to 
defaultchange its 
defaultrelationship with audiences – 
defaultto 
defaultevolve from an organisation that speaks to everyone at the same time, to one that also has direct relationships with individual licence fee payers.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe want to create a public service that is both universal and personal
default.
default The BBC is far f
defaultrom unique in this r
defaultespect: many other 
defaultpublic services are looking to personalise and be
defaultcome more responsive to users.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe will 
defaultus
defaulte
default new technologies to enable 
defaultall 
defaultlicence fee payers to get 
defaultmore
default out of BBC services and the 
defaulttime they already spend with us: m

defaultBBC’s support for the defaultBritish defaultcreative defaulteconomy default&#xa0;default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultUK 
defaulthas one of the strongest creative sectors in the world.
default 
defaultThe sector 
defaultbenefits from a 
default‘virtuous circle’ 
defaultof creativity, world-class talent and a digita
defaultlly savvy, active consumer base. 
defaultIt is characterised by ‘competition for quality’ 
default(not funding) 
defaultbetw

defaultstron
defaultg public institutions 
defaultlike the BBC 
defaultand a strong commercial sector
default, resulting in better programmes 
defaultand greater innovation
default from all parties
default. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC occupies a ‘hub’ position at the heart of the complex network of 
defaulttechnology, arts, design, music and broadc
defaultast sub
default-
defaultsectors that comprise the UK creative industries.  The evidence 
defaultwould appear to suggest
default that
default 
defaultwe 
defaultstimulate
default private sector investment
default rather than 
defaultcrowd it out
default.

default ways
default,
default including
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultResponses to specific questions from the Committeedefault&#xa0;
defaultQ1) What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting? default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the UK
default,
default there is strong and long-standing consensus in favour of public service broadcasting as a means of 
defaultpromoting social
default 
defaultand cultural 
defaultgoals
default that go beyond 
defaultcorrecting ‘market failures’
default.
default 
defaultThese goals
default include: reflecting and shaping the nation’s culture and value
defaults through a breadth of UK-originated content; securing plurality of high-quality new
defaults
default and information to help the public engage in the democratic process; and ensuring that content is universally available, easy to find, and free at the point of use
default. In o
defaultur view
default, PSB 
defaultalso complement
defaults
default and underpin
defaults
default the editorial standards and risk-taking capacity of the rest of the market.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC is the cornerstone of 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default’s
default 
defaultPSB 
defaultsystem
default.
default 
defaultOur mission is to inform, educate and entertain all audiences
default with great programmes and services
default. 
defaultFor us, serving the audience is an end in itself rather than 
defaulta 
defaultmeans to revenue maximisation.
default The BBC’s contribution to British culture and society is captured in its Charter-defined public purposes.
default 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn summary, the B
defaultBC exists:
default 
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe success of the BBC is not an accident. Our mission and the economics 
defaultbehind this 
defaultgo hand in hand. Because the public share the cost of the BBC, each licence fee payer benefits from one another’s investment.
default This means that there is universal access to better, cheaper programmes than would otherwise be the case. 
default&#xa0;defaultQ2) How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes? Are the public purposes in the defaultcurrent Charter the right ones? How might they change?default 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC has a strong track record of delivery over the current Charter period.
default 
defaultWe have modernised our service portfolio to keep pace with audience demands, 
defaultlaunching the iPlayer and new HD channels. 
defaultWe have done this at a time when the BBC’s core funding
default up to 2012
default 
default(excluding 
defaultthe 
defaultTV switchover allocation) broadly rose in line with inflation. 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOver the Charter period, t
defaulthe BBC’s reach has remained near-universal, with 
default96% of UK adults using one or more
default of our services each week
default.
default The BBC is 
defaultone of 
defaultthe most used public service
defaults
default in the UK
default, being chosen by the public around 200
default million
default times every day
default. 
defaultBBC One and 
defaultRadio 2 
defaultare 
defaultthe 
defaultUK TV and radio services with the highest figures; and BBC Online 
defaultthe only 
defaultUK-owned website in the top ten most-used websites in the UK
default. We also deliver a substantial 19
default 
defaulthours
default of time-spent per user per week on average
default, factors which reflect the quality and diversity of our output and are crucial to our success in bringing the 
defaultnation together.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC also excels on quality, with more UK viewers reporting that BBC One and BBC Two show well-made, h
defaultigh-quality programmes than 
defaultthe other UK PSBs
default. We outperform all international rivals too, with BBC One rated highest on quality out
default of 66 major TV channels examined globally and BBC Two in third place
default. 
defaultThis year, the BBC has received the highest number of nominations of any broadcaster in the world at the Golden Globes.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPublic trust in the BBC is crucial to our mission and an area 
defaultwhere we strive to do better. Whilst the BBC’s rating is showing signs of recovery following Savile, and has been rising on a long term basis over the last decade, it is still someway short of pre-Savile levels
default. However, 
defaultas scores have been rising over th
defaulte longer term, 
defaulttrust scores are still higher than 
defaultin 
default20
default0
default9
default. The BBC is identified by
default 
default58% of the public as their most trusted source of news in the UK, by 
default58% as the most accurate and by 49% as the most impartial – far ahead of the nearest alternative, 
defaultITV, 
defaulton 14%, 13% and 14%
default. 
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC has made substantial efficiency savings in
default this Charter period 
defaultand now costs only 4.3 pence per user-hour of content consumed
default, small in relation to the value of the
default 
defaultoutput 
defaultproduced. Similarly,
default willingness to pay for the BBC is 
defaulthigh
default.
default We perform 
defaultwell by industry standards, costing only 40 pence per household 
defaultcompared, for example, with Sky’s average revenue per user of £1.53 per day.
default 
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC Trust’s submission summarises its assessment of the
default 
defaultBBC’s performance 
defaultagainst the 
defaultCharter-defined 
defaultpublic purposes
default, noting our satisfactory or strong performance in each of: education and learning; sustaining citizenship and civil society
default; bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK; and delivering
default the benefit to the public of emerging communications, technologies and services. 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultUnder ‘creativity the cultural excellence’ they acknowledge the wide 
defaultrange of 
defaulthigh quality 
default content we provide but that further progress is necessary on distinctiveness and the freshness of our ideas. These are key objectives for the BBC and areas which we will particularly target as we move to bolster the BBC’s linear channels 
defaultand
default key genres su
defaultch as 
defaultarts, 
defaultmusic and drama. Indeed we have ma
defaultde
default progress already, with the percentage of BBC TV programmes rated by audiences as ‘fresh and new’ up to 71% in 2012/13 from 68% in 2010/11
default.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder 
defaultthe 
default‘nations, regions and communities’ 
defaultpurpose 
defaultthe BBC has 
defaulta
defaultcted as the anchor tenant for new 
default‘creative clusters’ in 
defaultSalford, 
defaultGlasgow and Cardiff, has ambitious plans for the Midlands, 
defaultand 
defaultis
default 
defaultmaking many more TV programmes outside 
defaultLondon –  having
default already met its Network Supply targets for 
defaultTV
default and due to exceed 
defaultthese
default by the end of the Charter. 
defaultWe are also
default working to ensure that all demographic groups and areas of the UK are
default 
defaultcatered for
default, innovating
default online 
defaultto
default appeal more 
defaultfully 
defaultto younger audience
defaults
default and targeting underserved audiences in
default our plans to bolster the BBC’
defaults linear channels. The BBC’s Nations
default and local
default services are 
defaultvalued by Licence Fee payers and remain crucial in allowing us to meet 
defaultthis 
defaultpublic purpose, 
defaultincluding
default through their focus on significant events, such as the
default 
defaultreferendum
default on Scotland’s constitutional future
default, and by holding local decision makers to account, for example through local radio journalism. We are making progress on the representativeness of our output, with the BBC’s share of TV viewing in the North West 
defaultnow 
defaultclos
defaulter to the UK average and 
defaultthe proportion
default of people
default there who 
defaultfeel
default the BBC fairly portrays 
defaulttheir region 
defaultnow representative of the UK average
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3) What scope, defaultscale and remitdefault should the BBC have?default defaultShould the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default BBC
default’s remit
default 
defaultrequires us to provide something of value for everyone and 
defaultto 
defaultprovide
default a wide range of programme
defaults
default and services
default in order to do so
default.
default 
defaultAu
defaultdiences 
defaultsupport this 
defaultremit
default, scoring 12 out of 14 genres as important areas for the BBC to 
defaultserve when asked to consider the good of society as a whole
default. 
defaultResearch consisten
defaulttly shows that the British public want a BBC that extends choice and brings them 
defaultbreadth, discovery, depth and enjoyment
default. A ‘market failure’
default BBC would not meet audience 
defaultexpectations or have the 
defaultcultural 
defaultimpact that our mission requires.
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, 
defaultPSB is arguably at its most effective when it not only delivers high quality content 
defaultbut also 
defaultencourages 
defaultthe market to do the same. 
defaultWhilst it has occasionally been argued that 
defaultthe BBC 
defaultcrowds
default-
defaultout commercial investment, this misunderstands the 
defaultsignificant impact 
defaultthat 
defaultPSBs can have on 
defaultaudience expectations
default of quality
default, 
defaultcreating
default a 
default‘
defaultvirtuous 
defaultcircle
default’
default of competition
default 
defaultbetween providers 
defaultthat
default deliver
defaults
default innovation and better programming f
defaultor
default all.
default 
defaultN
defaultations with well-funded PSBs investing in high-quality, diverse new content tend 
defaultalso 
defaultto have revenue-strong commercial markets investing in these ways
default, 
defaulta
defaultnd the UK is a 
defaultprime 
defaultexample of this. 
defaultThere is a strong argument that a ‘market failure’
default BBC would cause 
defaultthe market to fail.
default 
default&#xa0;
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to see the BBC’s scale in perspective. Over the last twenty years, the BBC has declined 
defaultfrom c40% of all broadcas
defaultt revenues to c25%, with the growth of pay-TV and advertising markets.
default Moreover, audiences are benefiting as new companies offer them content and services which compete with traditional broadcasting. 
default 
defaultIn turn, that means that the BBC is by no means the bi
defaultggest player in these converged markets, with a licence fee income of £3.6 billion compar
defaulted
default to the revenues of companies such as BSkyB and BT at home (with revenues of £7.2 billion and £18 billion respectively in 2012/13), as well as 
defaulthighly-funded US rival
defaults such as Netflix, Lovefilm (owned by Amazon) and Google (£35.7 billion in 2012/13). 
default&#xa0;
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe the BBC’s scope should be to: provide linear and on-demand services (allowing creative and cost synergies between the two and providing for different usage pa
defaulttterns); on a wide range of platforms and devices by IP and broadcast means (catering for offline groups and those, particularly the young, for whom IP delivery is the most natural approach); serve as publisher and broadcaster (integrating the best of in-h
defaultouse and third-party content in a single experi
defaultence). The BBC’s competitors operate
default 
defaultacross the value chain 
defaultand the BBC 
defaultshould be able to 
defaultdo 
defaultso too in order to deliver 
defaultits public mission
default and serve audience
defaults
default effectively
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultB) What balance should be struck defaultin what the BBC pdefaultrdefaultoduces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?default&#xa0;
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe right balance in the BBC’s supply base between in-house and external production 
defaultshould 
defaultbe determined by audience and public interest objectives. 
defaultThe UK 
defaultproduction sector is strong, second only to the US on 
defaultoverseas
default content sales
default. It is
default based on a mixed 
defaultand competitive 
defaulte
defaultcology
default 
defaultof
default 
defaulti
defaultndependent producers
default, 
defaultin-house 
defaultproduction arms (
defaulte.g. 
defaultBBC) and broadcaster-owned production arms supplying various parties (e.g.
default ITV).
default Each element brings a complementary set of strengths to the mix.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultOur goal is to ensure the best programmes for audiences and the creation of IP that promotes British creativity abroad. We believe that a 
defaultstrong in-house production base is 
defaultnecessary
default to meet these goals. 
defaultBBC in-house production promotes a focus on quality and public service values; guarantees the cost-effective supply of a wide range of genres; 
defaultcreates
default creative clusters across the UK
default; 
defaultand provides the BBC with vital IP, facilitating 
defaultexports, the launch of new services like iPlayer and operation at scale o
defaultverseas through BBC Worldwide
default. 
defaultUK licence fee payers effectively own the pool of BBC IP created through fully-owned works. 
defaultGiven the growing importance of IP in the media value chain,
default a scale position is essential if we are to build strong global brands and deliver an economic return to the UK creative economy. 
default&#xa0;
default36.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK independent sector promotes competition
default, 
defaultnew ideas and content formats, and has seen revenues grow from £120m in 1982
default to a substantial £2.3 billion in 2010
default – 25% 
defaultof this 
defaultfrom overseas commissions and sales. 
defaultThe BBC benefits from a strong independent sector.
default&#xa0;
default37.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default Window of Creative Competition is effective in allowing the BBC to find the best ideas from in-house and 
defaultindependent
default producers
default, and r
defaultights holders will 
defaultalso 
defaultsoon benefit from the permanent download-to-own window planned for BBC
default commissioned
default 
defaultcontent. The BBC consistently meets its target of 25% external spend for 
defaultBBC Online, and through its plans for iPlayer and Online to 2016/17 will likely increase this figure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4) defaultHow have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return defaultfor licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?default&#xa0;
default38.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDespite limited access to capital BBC Worldwide has delivered a

default&#xa0; 
defaultAs outlined earlier, the BBC has 
defaultcommissioned 
defaultnew research among business leaders in key trading countries to assess
default&#xa0;
defaultthe eff
defaultect of culture on commerce. The research shows that the UK is regarded as one of the most attractive places to do business 
defaultand that business leaders’ perceptions of UK culture, and of the BBC in particular, 
defaulthelp 
defaultshape these attitudes and behaviours
default.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultOctober 2013 BBC Worldwide launched a strategy to drive long-term success by building the BBC’s reputation for premium content delivered th
defaultrough global brands. It outlined
default plans for BBC Worldwide to increase content investment, 
defaultbecoming the principal 
defaultco-production partner of the BBC’s Natural History Unit
default; launch three new core consumer brands propositions, including BBC Earth
default;
default and deliver a greater focus on digital innovation to extend the company’s reach and routes to market. A global approach will 
defaultenable the BBC to approach or match the budgets of leading global media companies, attract and retain talent, and secure distribution. The BBC’s objective is to double its global audience to 500m, partly funded through commercial income to manage the cost 
defaultto licence fee payers. 
default&#xa0;defaultQ5default) defaultWhat role should the defaultBBC play in developing defaulttechnologydefault and new ways of distributing content?default&#xa0;
default42.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC’s role is to innovate 
defaulton behalf of audiences and ensure that the benefits of new 
defaultdigital 
defaulttechnologies are available to all. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default43.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSet up by pioneers of the wireless in 1922
default,
default the BBC has 
defaulta strong track record in 
defaulttechnology
default innovation
default, 
defaultincluding 
defaultFM radio, DAB, colour TV, NICAM sound, Ceefax, and interactive TV and driving international standards and hardware designs for 
defaultdigital terre
defaultstrial television
default (DTT)
default. 
defaultThis has been made possible by 
defaulta combination of 
defaultour R&amp;D expertise, long-term perspective and access to stable funding. 
defaultWe can be an early-mover where commercial risks may be too high
default for others
default, and can help in coordinating the ind
defaultustry to achieve collaborative initiatives and open standards – as, for example, our pan-industry work developing standards with groups such as the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) and our incubation of YouView (based on open standards and licensed
default to third parties). 
default&#xa0;
default44.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBack in 2002, DTT was in crisis. 
defaultA coalition, led by the BBC, re-built the platform. 
defaultToday, Freeview is the most popular TV platform in the UK, used in three-quarters of TV households
default, providing more choice for viewers, and a 
defaultplatform for dozens of new commercial digital channels.
default The BBC often works through joint ventures and partnerships
default 
defaultto make synergies across the industry, and in regional hubs to promote economic development across the UK
default 
default. 
default&#xa0;
default45.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC has a market leadersh
defaultip role to play in launching new services based on new technologies.  We can take the lead even where business models are unclear, thus helping commercial players to enter new markets when the opportunities become 
defaultclearer.

defaultnow 
defaulthas a leading position.
default 
default&#xa0;
default46.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultfinal 
defaultpart of the BBC’s role is to ensure t
defaulthat the
default benefits of digital technologies are available to all not just ‘early adopters’. We

defaulty
default to 
defaultinspire confidence, 
defaultpresent 
defaultthe benefits of 
defaultnew technologies
default,

defaultand signpost assistance
default. 
defaultFrom 2015, we will play a similar role for digital creativity, launching a major project to promote coding and programming, just as we did for basic computing and software in the 1980s through BBC Micro. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6) How should the BBC be defaultfundeddefault beyond 2016? default              default47.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis is an issue that
default will be considered at Charter R
defaulteview and the BBC will make its case as part of this process. Based on the evidence today, w
defaulte believe 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Licence Fee 
defaultis very likely to 
defaultremain the most effective way to fund the BBC
default beyond 2016
default and we look forward to discussing this with the Committee
default. 
defaultAt its simplest, 
defaultt
defaulthe Licence Fee is a form of shared or pooled investment to fund a public service that everyone can 
defaultand does 
defaultuse
default. The 
defaultadvantages of the licence fee include:
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default48.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Licence Fee works in practice too, 
defaultwith 47% of the UK adults now backing it as the most ap
defaultpropriate way to fund the BBC, 
defaultaround 
defaultdouble the figures for s
defaultubscri
defaultption or advertising 
defaultand up from 31% only a decade ago

default. 
default&#xa0;
default50.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSome have raised 
defaultthe impact 
defaultof increased on-demand consump
defaulttion on the Licence Fee.
default The Licence Fee definition remains robust
default, with 
defaultwell under 2%
default 
defaultof households consum
defaulting
default 
defaultexclusively
default on-demand content
default and so not requiring a Licence Fee.
default However, the definition could start to create perverse incentives, with a 
defaultfee 
defaultpayable for some ways of consuming BBC TV but not others. 
defaultWe would welcome discussing this issue with the Committee to consider whether and when the Licence Fee should be modern
defaultised again. 
default&#xa0;
default51.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAlternative methods of funding the BBC 
defaultwould appear to 
defaulthave significant drawbacks. Subscription would turn the BBC into a commercial operator with an incentive to provide services that maximise revenues and/or profits. The evidence suggests t
defaulthat a subscription model would be likely to reduce the payment base, increasing costs for consumers who remain and exclud
defaulting
default many in society who could not afford to pay
default. 
default&#xa0;
default52.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIf the objective of the BBC were to maximise advertising revenues, the BBC would shape its programming to maximise the benefits to advertisers rather than to audiences. 
defaultIt is notable that audiences report the lack of advertising on our services as a key ch
defaultaracteristic they value about the BBC
default. 
defaultAn advertiser-funded BBC would 
defaultalso 
defaulthave significant consequences for commercial broadcasters and the revenue available for investment in content.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7) defaultIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC? default 
default&#xa0;
default53.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs argued above, the UK’s successful broadcasting model is characterised by competition for quality, not funding, between the BBC and commercial broadcasters
default. The unitary receipt of the Licence Fee by the BBC serves a number of public interest objectives:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default54.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe current Licence Fee settlement imposed a number of new obligations on the BBC that will be funded from core income. The financial cost is around £235
default.5
default million per annum from 2
default013/14 to 2016/17
default (excluding the World Serv
defaultice)
default, or 6
default% of Licence Fee income
default. As a result, we will have to make reductions to BBC content and services. 
default&#xa0;
default55.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere will
default, of course,
default be further debate on this subject at Charter Review. It is important that funding models are properly tested to ensure value for money, 
defaultincluding
default against the following criteria:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8) What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? default&#xa0;
default56.
default&#xa0; 
defaultInternationally
default,
default PSB is at a crossroads, with
default&#xa0;
defaultsome PSBs in rude health and successfully adapting their services and funding to a converged environment and others facing considerable difficulties. Furthermore, the overall trend is that where PSBs are well-funded and strong
default – investing in original content, diverse schedules and quality and thereby driving ‘competition for quality’ – so too are commercial broadcasters.
default&#xa0;
default This is true, for example, in the UK, which has 
defaulta 
defaultparticularly rich PSB and commercial ecosystem. It is in
default stark contrast to countries
default, such as Portugal
default,
default 
defaultwhere PSB has faced major funding cuts and threats of privatisation, or Greece which witnessed the forcible closure of a PSB
default.
default 
defaultSuch challenges to PSB suggest there is a 
defaulttipping-point
default 
defaultfrom which it is hard to r
defaultecover.
default 
default&#xa0;
default57.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOther key lessons from international comparison include: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9default) How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016? defaultIn a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutionadefaultl framework for the BBC?default 
default&#xa0;
default58.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC’s governance model beyond 2016 will be considered as part of Charter Review and we do not wish to pre
default-
defaultjudge that process. 
defaultOur priority is to make the existing model work as effectively as possible, within the constraints 
defaultof the current Charter. 
default&#xa0;
default59.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn September
default 2013
default, 
defaultthe Trust and Executive 
defaultannounced 
defaulta joint 
defaultreview 
defaultof 
defaultthe BBC’s internal governance systems and structures, and the culture that surrounds them. We did this in response to a number of events that prompted legitimate questions about the effectiveness of the BBC’s system of governance, both within and between t
defaulthe Trust and Executive. 
default&#xa0;
default60.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultoutcome of the 
defaultreview, announced on 11
defaultth
default December
default, is that the respective responsibilities of the Trust and Executive Board will be clarified, within the terms of the Charter. The Trust will focus on its oversight and regulat
defaultory role, ensuring we are answerable to licence fee payers.
default&#xa0;
default The Executive will be responsible for running the organisation. 
default&#xa0;
default61.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe role of the Executive Board will be strengthened.
default&#xa0;
default It will be responsible for all aspects of management and operations and th
defaulte main decision-making forum for the 
defaultBBC.
default&#xa0;
default The role and number of non-executive directors on the 
defaultExecutive Board 
defaultwill increase, starting with the appointment of Sir Howard Stringer, previously CEO and chairman of Sony, from January 2014. We will also reduc
defaulte the number of pan-BBC boards by more than 60%. 
default&#xa0;
default62.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese changes are designe
defaultd to deliver simpler 
defaultstructures, bet
defaultter decision-making and proper 
defaultaccountability.
default&#xa0;
default They 
defaultshould 
defaultensure everyone in
defaultside and outside the BBC is 
defaultclear about who is responsible for 
defaultmajor decisions and projects. The BBC should also be able to make faster decisions and reduce the time senior managers spend in meetings and increase the time spent making output for audiences.
default&#xa0;
default63.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs with governance, the most appropriate constitutional model 
defaultfor the BBC will be the
default subject of debate at Charter review
default. 
defaultOur starting-point is that 
defaulta Charter and Agreement model safeguard the BBC’s independence and provide stability for long-term investm
defaultent.
default 
default&#xa0;
default64.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Charter model underpins the BBC’s unique governance structure and funding model, explicitly committing the Government of the day to respect the editorial and operational independence of the BBC. Charter terms are subject to extensive political d
defaulteba
defaultte at the time of Charter review
default, ensuring appropriate parliamentary and public scrutiny, but 
defaultwith a 
defaultrelatively fixed period to provide room for the BBC to deliver on its commitments. The ten-year 
defaultterm gives the BBC a sufficient horizon over which to pl
defaultan investment and helps to keep decisions on the BBC’s remit out-of-step with the electoral cycle. The Charter also has a symbolic value, we believe, emphasising for the UK public and stakeholders the special role and responsibilities which the BBC has as 
defaultan independent broadcaster and trusted national institution.
default&#xa0;
default65.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFurthermore, the model 
defaultfits with 
defaultan evolving communications environment, 
defaultproviding flexibility for the BBC to develop in line with new technologies and audience tastes.
