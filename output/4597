[normal]Written evidence submitted by the BBC [FBB0097][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The BBC’s mission and [bold]value for money [bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome the opportunity
[normal] to respond to the Committee’s i
[normal]nquiry
[normal], which 
[normal]w
[normal]e regard as
[normal] an
[normal] important contributio
[normal]n to the debate about the BBC.
[normal] 
[normal]It will be for the Government to start Charter Review before 2016 and in this submission we have therefore been mindful of the danger of pre-j
[normal]udging that 
[normal]process.
[normal] 
[normal]Our submission 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]focuses on 
[normal]our 
[normal]rece
[normal]nt 
[normal]and current 
[normal]performance
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]on 
[normal]our strategy to 201
[normal]6, as well as answers
[normal] the Committee’s specific questions. 
[normal]It is accompanied by a comprehensive audience research pack and two recently 
[normal]published papers on the value of Public Service Broadcasting (PSB).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our starting-point is that t
[normal]he BBC exists to have a positive impact on society by bringing the best 
[normal]in 
[normal]media content to 
[normal]everyone. Our mission is to 
[normal]inform, educate and entertain; provide 
[normal]value to all audiences not just some; introduce audiences to things they love but otherwise might not have discovered; and focus on the quality and depth of impact, not just the quantity of consumption. While the primary purpose of the BBC is to serve audi
[normal]ences and society, 
[normal]we are also 
[normal]an important 
[normal]part of
[normal] Britain’s creative economy
[normal] at home and globally
[normal], supporting innovation,
[normal] 
[normal]growth and jobs
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The background to this inquiry includes the mistakes that the BBC has made over Savile, DMI and severance pay.  We
[normal] acknowledge that these have raised questions about how the BBC is run and governed, which we look forward to discussing with the Committee.  In the meantime, we have put plans in place to learn the appropriate lessons, including through our review of gove
[normal]rnance with the Trust and the cap on severance payments of £150,000.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite those mistakes, the BBC is in the middle of a period of genuine creative success, from the Olympics to Dr Who. That creative health reflects the underlying strength of the BBC’s 
[normal]model, 
[normal]based
[normal] on the principles of universal access, shared investme
[normal]nt and ownership by the public – 
[normal]principles that are 
[normal]shared with many other public services. 
[normal]The end result is the widespread availability of better, cheaper 
[normal]media 
[normal]services for the public t
[normal]han could be achieved by the market alone. This is important because 
[normal]PSB 
[normal]is 
[normal]a 
[normal]social 
[normal]‘primary good’ (like health and 
[normal]education) which everyone has a right to access in order to participate fully in society. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That model also delivers value for money
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Over 
[normal]the past 20 years, the BBC has worked hard to deliver more without costi
[normal]ng more. Twenty years ago, the Licence F
[normal]ee was over £147 
[normal]in today’s money.
[normal] We 
[normal]had two TV stations, five national radio stations, and local and Nations radio. Today, we deliver four times more television channels, twice as many national radio stations, 
[normal]online 
[normal]services and the 
[normal]iPlayer
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Audience perceptions of BBC value for money have 
[normal]increased during this Charter period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Th
[normal]e BBC’s mission feels as relevant as ever 
[normal]but 
[normal]will need to be 
[normal]delivered 
[normal]in new
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]different ways
[normal] as technologies, markets and audience expectations evolve. In recent years the number of content providers, formats and platforms has grown rapidly; on-demand usage is rising; and audiences have come to 
[normal]expect greater
[normal] control, personalisation and particip
[normal]ation in media services. The 
[normal]scale of the BBC in today’s media market 
[normal]should 
[normal]be kept in perspective. Twenty years ago, the BBC accounted for around 40% of 
[normal]total 
[normal]broadcast revenues. Today, we account for around 
[normal]25%. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst these changes bolster the value 
[normal]of 
[normal]PSB
[normal], such as in producing and curating high-quality content, they make delivering this value more 
[normal]challenging
[normal]. For example, growth in the number of gated platforms threatens the prominence of public service output, and globalisation of content market
[normal]s
[normal] a
[normal]llows highly-funded international
[normal] players
[normal] to compete with suppliers of UK
[normal] 
[normal]originated content. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The BBC’s strategy to 2016[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC 
[normal]has developed a 
[normal]strategy to respond to these changes and to 
[normal]continue 
[normal]delive
[normal]r
[normal]ing
[normal] its public service mission. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] strategy was set out in a speech by the BBC Director General in 
[normal]October
[normal] this year
[normal]. 
[normal]In summary, w
[normal]e 
[normal]plan to
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The strategy is about 
[normal]re-inventing the BBC and 
[normal]maximising the value 
[normal]we 
[normal]deliver
[normal] to audiences,
[normal] within 
[normal]our current
[normal] 
[normal]budgetary
[normal] c
[normal]onstraints
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The 2
[normal]010 Licence Fee settlement saw 
[normal]funding frozen in nominal terms and the addition of fu
[normal]rther 
[normal]obl
[normal]igations
[normal] to be funded from core revenue
[normal]s
[normal]. In response
[normal],
[normal] the B
[normal]BC has set out plans to cut our 
[normal]expenditure 
[normal]by 16% by 2016/17 plus 4% for re-investments.
[normal] 
[normal]To deliver the new strategic plans
[normal],
[normal] set out 
[normal]below
[normal],
[normal] an additional £100m annum will 
[normal]be required by 2016/17
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]These
[normal] savings will be funded 
[normal]through 
[normal]a combination of efficiencies and scope reductions. 
[normal]We are 
[normal]planning to 
[normal]deliver efficiency savings at 3%-4% per year to 2016/17
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Therefore, tough choices in content and services will be necessary in the years ahead. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]An 
[normal]important aspect
[normal] of the new strategy
[normal] is BBC 
[normal]iPlayer
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which will 
[normal]provi
[normal]de not just “TV, online” but increasingly
[normal] “online TV” with 
[normal]the 
[normal]content formats and modes of curation and consumption this allows. A key strand is the content proposition, where we will ex
[normal]tend
[normal] the catch-up window for public service content to 30 days; offer opportu
[normal]nities to purchase material t
[normal]h
[normal]at
[normal] is outside this window; and 
[normal]develop new ways in which online content and delivery can improve the way the BBC delivers its public service mission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]To further the Reithian mission
[normal],
[normal] we will 
[normal]improve a number of 
[normal]key content genres
[normal].
[normal] News will benefit from more long-term investigations, a refreshed online offer (including an emphasis on mobile delivery), and a target to double our global audience. Our arts coverage will be confident, with new commissions for television
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]regular bro
[normal]adcast performances from significant artistic events and institutions
[normal].
[normal] We will re
[normal]-
[normal]launch our partnership with Arts Council England – the Space – to pioneer the discovery of new kinds of digital art and talent. We 
[normal]plan to 
[normal]bring landmark arts and music serie
[normal]s and 
[normal]events to peak-time television 
[normal]and establish a public service position in digital music through 
[normal]Playlister
[normal], a partnership with online music websites. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]BBC One will 
[normal]focus on
[normal] distinctive drama and entertainment, as wel
[normal]l as public service events that
[normal] 
[normal]s
[normal]upport and widen the 
[normal]national conversations. BBC Four will return to its role as a multi-genre channel tasked with finding the most innovative, high-quality material. BBC Two will have additional factual entertainment, comedy and features and will continue
[normal] to bring distinctive content to a broad audience. BBC Two and BBC Four will work more effectively together as the BBC’s core channels for the arts, music and current affairs.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Overall, the BBC 
[normal]would like to 
[normal]change its 
[normal]relationship with audiences – 
[normal]to 
[normal]evolve from an organisation that speaks to everyone at the same time, to one that also has direct relationships with individual licence fee payers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We want to create a public service that is both universal and personal
[normal].
[normal] The BBC is far f
[normal]rom unique in this r
[normal]espect: many other 
[normal]public services are looking to personalise and be
[normal]come more responsive to users.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We will 
[normal]us
[normal]e
[normal] new technologies to enable 
[normal]all 
[normal]licence fee payers to get 
[normal]more
[normal] out of BBC services and the 
[normal]time they already spend with us: m
[normal]ore co
[normal]ntent they lov
[normal]e, easier to find
[normal] through, for example, recommendations
[normal]; t
[normal]he di
[normal]scovery of new things they did no
[normal]t know they liked
[normal]; and
[normal] 
[normal]g
[normal]reater audience interactivity 
[normal]and participation in programmes and services.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC’s support for the [bold]British [bold]creative [bold]economy [bold]&#xa0;[bold]16.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]has one of the strongest creative sectors in the world.
[normal] 
[normal]The sector 
[normal]benefits from a 
[normal]‘virtuous circle’ 
[normal]of creativity, world-class talent and a digita
[normal]lly savvy, active consumer base. 
[normal]It is characterised by ‘competition for quality’ 
[normal](not funding) 
[normal]betw
[normal]een 
[normal]stron
[normal]g public institutions 
[normal]like the BBC 
[normal]and a strong commercial sector
[normal], resulting in better programmes 
[normal]and greater innovation
[normal] from all parties
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC occupies a ‘hub’ position at the heart of the complex network of 
[normal]technology, arts, design, music and broadc
[normal]ast sub
[normal]-
[normal]sectors that comprise the UK creative industries.  The evidence 
[normal]would appear to suggest
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]we 
[normal]stimulate
[normal] private sector investment
[normal] rather than 
[normal]crowd it out
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Licence F
[normal]ee 
[normal]and BBC have
[normal] positive supply and demand-side effects 
[normal]across 
[normal]the creative economy, 
[normal]helping to 
[normal]creat
[normal]e
[normal] the conditions for 
[normal]growth in a range of
[normal] ways
[normal],
[normal] including
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Responses to specific questions from the Committee[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1) What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In the UK
[normal],
[normal] there is strong and long-standing consensus in favour of public service broadcasting as a means of 
[normal]promoting social
[normal] 
[normal]and cultural 
[normal]goals
[normal] that go beyond 
[normal]correcting ‘market failures’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]These goals
[normal] include: reflecting and shaping the nation’s culture and value
[normal]s through a breadth of UK-originated content; securing plurality of high-quality new
[normal]s
[normal] and information to help the public engage in the democratic process; and ensuring that content is universally available, easy to find, and free at the point of use
[normal]. In o
[normal]ur view
[normal], PSB 
[normal]also complement
[normal]s
[normal] and underpin
[normal]s
[normal] the editorial standards and risk-taking capacity of the rest of the market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC is the cornerstone of 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]PSB 
[normal]system
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Our mission is to inform, educate and entertain all audiences
[normal] with great programmes and services
[normal]. 
[normal]For us, serving the audience is an end in itself rather than 
[normal]a 
[normal]means to revenue maximisation.
[normal] The BBC’s contribution to British culture and society is captured in its Charter-defined public purposes.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In summary, the B
[normal]BC exists:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The success of the BBC is not an accident. Our mission and the economics 
[normal]behind this 
[normal]go hand in hand. Because the public share the cost of the BBC, each licence fee payer benefits from one another’s investment.
[normal] This means that there is universal access to better, cheaper programmes than would otherwise be the case. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q2) How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes? Are the public purposes in the [bold]current Charter the right ones? How might they change?[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC has a strong track record of delivery over the current Charter period.
[normal] 
[normal]We have modernised our service portfolio to keep pace with audience demands, 
[normal]launching the iPlayer and new HD channels. 
[normal]We have done this at a time when the BBC’s core funding
[normal] up to 2012
[normal] 
[normal](excluding 
[normal]the 
[normal]TV switchover allocation) broadly rose in line with inflation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Over the Charter period, t
[normal]he BBC’s reach has remained near-universal, with 
[normal]96% of UK adults using one or more
[normal] of our services each week
[normal].
[normal] The BBC is 
[normal]one of 
[normal]the most used public service
[normal]s
[normal] in the UK
[normal], being chosen by the public around 200
[normal] million
[normal] times every day
[normal]. 
[normal]BBC One and 
[normal]Radio 2 
[normal]are 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK TV and radio services with the highest figures; and BBC Online 
[normal]the only 
[normal]UK-owned website in the top ten most-used websites in the UK
[normal]. We also deliver a substantial 19
[normal] 
[normal]hours
[normal] of time-spent per user per week on average
[normal], factors which reflect the quality and diversity of our output and are crucial to our success in bringing the 
[normal]nation together.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC also excels on quality, with more UK viewers reporting that BBC One and BBC Two show well-made, h
[normal]igh-quality programmes than 
[normal]the other UK PSBs
[normal]. We outperform all international rivals too, with BBC One rated highest on quality out
[normal] of 66 major TV channels examined globally and BBC Two in third place
[normal]. 
[normal]This year, the BBC has received the highest number of nominations of any broadcaster in the world at the Golden Globes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Public trust in the BBC is crucial to our mission and an area 
[normal]where we strive to do better. Whilst the BBC’s rating is showing signs of recovery following Savile, and has been rising on a long term basis over the last decade, it is still someway short of pre-Savile levels
[normal]. However, 
[normal]as scores have been rising over th
[normal]e longer term, 
[normal]trust scores are still higher than 
[normal]in 
[normal]20
[normal]0
[normal]9
[normal]. The BBC is identified by
[normal] 
[normal]58% of the public as their most trusted source of news in the UK, by 
[normal]58% as the most accurate and by 49% as the most impartial – far ahead of the nearest alternative, 
[normal]ITV, 
[normal]on 14%, 13% and 14%
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC has made substantial efficiency savings in
[normal] this Charter period 
[normal]and now costs only 4.3 pence per user-hour of content consumed
[normal], small in relation to the value of the
[normal] 
[normal]output 
[normal]produced. Similarly,
[normal] willingness to pay for the BBC is 
[normal]high
[normal].
[normal] We perform 
[normal]well by industry standards, costing only 40 pence per household 
[normal]compared, for example, with Sky’s average revenue per user of £1.53 per day.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC Trust’s submission summarises its assessment of the
[normal] 
[normal]BBC’s performance 
[normal]against the 
[normal]Charter-defined 
[normal]public purposes
[normal], noting our satisfactory or strong performance in each of: education and learning; sustaining citizenship and civil society
[normal]; bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK; and delivering
[normal] the benefit to the public of emerging communications, technologies and services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Under ‘creativity the cultural excellence’ they acknowledge the wide 
[normal]range of 
[normal]high quality 
[normal] content we provide but that further progress is necessary on distinctiveness and the freshness of our ideas. These are key objectives for the BBC and areas which we will particularly target as we move to bolster the BBC’s linear channels 
[normal]and
[normal] key genres su
[normal]ch as 
[normal]arts, 
[normal]music and drama. Indeed we have ma
[normal]de
[normal] progress already, with the percentage of BBC TV programmes rated by audiences as ‘fresh and new’ up to 71% in 2012/13 from 68% in 2010/11
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Under 
[normal]the 
[normal]‘nations, regions and communities’ 
[normal]purpose 
[normal]the BBC has 
[normal]a
[normal]cted as the anchor tenant for new 
[normal]‘creative clusters’ in 
[normal]Salford, 
[normal]Glasgow and Cardiff, has ambitious plans for the Midlands, 
[normal]and 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]making many more TV programmes outside 
[normal]London –  having
[normal] already met its Network Supply targets for 
[normal]TV
[normal] and due to exceed 
[normal]these
[normal] by the end of the Charter. 
[normal]We are also
[normal] working to ensure that all demographic groups and areas of the UK are
[normal] 
[normal]catered for
[normal], innovating
[normal] online 
[normal]to
[normal] appeal more 
[normal]fully 
[normal]to younger audience
[normal]s
[normal] and targeting underserved audiences in
[normal] our plans to bolster the BBC’
[normal]s linear channels. The BBC’s Nations
[normal] and local
[normal] services are 
[normal]valued by Licence Fee payers and remain crucial in allowing us to meet 
[normal]this 
[normal]public purpose, 
[normal]including
[normal] through their focus on significant events, such as the
[normal] 
[normal]referendum
[normal] on Scotland’s constitutional future
[normal], and by holding local decision makers to account, for example through local radio journalism. We are making progress on the representativeness of our output, with the BBC’s share of TV viewing in the North West 
[normal]now 
[normal]clos
[normal]er to the UK average and 
[normal]the proportion
[normal] of people
[normal] there who 
[normal]feel
[normal] the BBC fairly portrays 
[normal]their region 
[normal]now representative of the UK average
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3) What scope, [bold]scale and remit[bold] should the BBC have?[bold] [bold]Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] BBC
[normal]’s remit
[normal] 
[normal]requires us to provide something of value for everyone and 
[normal]to 
[normal]provide
[normal] a wide range of programme
[normal]s
[normal] and services
[normal] in order to do so
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Au
[normal]diences 
[normal]support this 
[normal]remit
[normal], scoring 12 out of 14 genres as important areas for the BBC to 
[normal]serve when asked to consider the good of society as a whole
[normal]. 
[normal]Research consisten
[normal]tly shows that the British public want a BBC that extends choice and brings them 
[normal]breadth, discovery, depth and enjoyment
[normal]. A ‘market failure’
[normal] BBC would not meet audience 
[normal]expectations or have the 
[normal]cultural 
[normal]impact that our mission requires.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]PSB is arguably at its most effective when it not only delivers high quality content 
[normal]but also 
[normal]encourages 
[normal]the market to do the same. 
[normal]Whilst it has occasionally been argued that 
[normal]the BBC 
[normal]crowds
[normal]-
[normal]out commercial investment, this misunderstands the 
[normal]significant impact 
[normal]that 
[normal]PSBs can have on 
[normal]audience expectations
[normal] of quality
[normal], 
[normal]creating
[normal] a 
[normal]‘
[normal]virtuous 
[normal]circle
[normal]’
[normal] of competition
[normal] 
[normal]between providers 
[normal]that
[normal] deliver
[normal]s
[normal] innovation and better programming f
[normal]or
[normal] all.
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]ations with well-funded PSBs investing in high-quality, diverse new content tend 
[normal]also 
[normal]to have revenue-strong commercial markets investing in these ways
[normal], 
[normal]a
[normal]nd the UK is a 
[normal]prime 
[normal]example of this. 
[normal]There is a strong argument that a ‘market failure’
[normal] BBC would cause 
[normal]the market to fail.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important to see the BBC’s scale in perspective. Over the last twenty years, the BBC has declined 
[normal]from c40% of all broadcas
[normal]t revenues to c25%, with the growth of pay-TV and advertising markets.
[normal] Moreover, audiences are benefiting as new companies offer them content and services which compete with traditional broadcasting. 
[normal] 
[normal]In turn, that means that the BBC is by no means the bi
[normal]ggest player in these converged markets, with a licence fee income of £3.6 billion compar
[normal]ed
[normal] to the revenues of companies such as BSkyB and BT at home (with revenues of £7.2 billion and £18 billion respectively in 2012/13), as well as 
[normal]highly-funded US rival
[normal]s such as Netflix, Lovefilm (owned by Amazon) and Google (£35.7 billion in 2012/13). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe the BBC’s scope should be to: provide linear and on-demand services (allowing creative and cost synergies between the two and providing for different usage pa
[normal]tterns); on a wide range of platforms and devices by IP and broadcast means (catering for offline groups and those, particularly the young, for whom IP delivery is the most natural approach); serve as publisher and broadcaster (integrating the best of in-h
[normal]ouse and third-party content in a single experi
[normal]ence). The BBC’s competitors operate
[normal] 
[normal]across the value chain 
[normal]and the BBC 
[normal]should be able to 
[normal]do 
[normal]so too in order to deliver 
[normal]its public mission
[normal] and serve audience
[normal]s
[normal] effectively
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B) What balance should be struck [bold]in what the BBC p[bold]r[bold]oduces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]34.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The right balance in the BBC’s supply base between in-house and external production 
[normal]should 
[normal]be determined by audience and public interest objectives. 
[normal]The UK 
[normal]production sector is strong, second only to the US on 
[normal]overseas
[normal] content sales
[normal]. It is
[normal] based on a mixed 
[normal]and competitive 
[normal]e
[normal]cology
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]ndependent producers
[normal], 
[normal]in-house 
[normal]production arms (
[normal]e.g. 
[normal]BBC) and broadcaster-owned production arms supplying various parties (e.g.
[normal] ITV).
[normal] Each element brings a complementary set of strengths to the mix.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Our goal is to ensure the best programmes for audiences and the creation of IP that promotes British creativity abroad. We believe that a 
[normal]strong in-house production base is 
[normal]necessary
[normal] to meet these goals. 
[normal]BBC in-house production promotes a focus on quality and public service values; guarantees the cost-effective supply of a wide range of genres; 
[normal]creates
[normal] creative clusters across the UK
[normal]; 
[normal]and provides the BBC with vital IP, facilitating 
[normal]exports, the launch of new services like iPlayer and operation at scale o
[normal]verseas through BBC Worldwide
[normal]. 
[normal]UK licence fee payers effectively own the pool of BBC IP created through fully-owned works. 
[normal]Given the growing importance of IP in the media value chain,
[normal] a scale position is essential if we are to build strong global brands and deliver an economic return to the UK creative economy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]36.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK independent sector promotes competition
[normal], 
[normal]new ideas and content formats, and has seen revenues grow from £120m in 1982
[normal] to a substantial £2.3 billion in 2010
[normal] – 25% 
[normal]of this 
[normal]from overseas commissions and sales. 
[normal]The BBC benefits from a strong independent sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] Window of Creative Competition is effective in allowing the BBC to find the best ideas from in-house and 
[normal]independent
[normal] producers
[normal], and r
[normal]ights holders will 
[normal]also 
[normal]soon benefit from the permanent download-to-own window planned for BBC
[normal] commissioned
[normal] 
[normal]content. The BBC consistently meets its target of 25% external spend for 
[normal]BBC Online, and through its plans for iPlayer and Online to 2016/17 will likely increase this figure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4) [bold]How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return [bold]for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]38.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite limited access to capital BBC Worldwide has delivered a 
[normal]strong
[normal] financial performance, r
[normal]eturning
[normal] over £1bn to the BBC since 2007
[normal], 
[normal]including
[normal] £400m in dividend payments and £
[normal]562m of content investment
[normal]. It now
[normal] 
[normal]provides
[normal] 
[normal]up to 75% o

[normal]programmes

[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]BBC Global News
[normal] and BBC Worldwide 
[normal]contribute to the UK’s reputation and 
[normal]the 
[normal]comparative
[normal] advantage 
[normal]of 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]creative sector 
[normal]overseas, contributing in particular to the following public purposes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]40.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As outlined earlier, the BBC has 
[normal]commissioned 
[normal]new research among business leaders in key trading countries to assess
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the eff
[normal]ect of culture on commerce. The research shows that the UK is regarded as one of the most attractive places to do business 
[normal]and that business leaders’ perceptions of UK culture, and of the BBC in particular, 
[normal]help 
[normal]shape these attitudes and behaviours
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]41.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In 
[normal]October 2013 BBC Worldwide launched a strategy to drive long-term success by building the BBC’s reputation for premium content delivered th
[normal]rough global brands. It outlined
[normal] plans for BBC Worldwide to increase content investment, 
[normal]becoming the principal 
[normal]co-production partner of the BBC’s Natural History Unit
[normal]; launch three new core consumer brands propositions, including BBC Earth
[normal];
[normal] and deliver a greater focus on digital innovation to extend the company’s reach and routes to market. A global approach will 
[normal]enable the BBC to approach or match the budgets of leading global media companies, attract and retain talent, and secure distribution. The BBC’s objective is to double its global audience to 500m, partly funded through commercial income to manage the cost 
[normal]to licence fee payers. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q5[bold]) [bold]What role should the [bold]BBC play in developing [bold]technology[bold] and new ways of distributing content?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]42.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC’s role is to innovate 
[normal]on behalf of audiences and ensure that the benefits of new 
[normal]digital 
[normal]technologies are available to all. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]43.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Set up by pioneers of the wireless in 1922
[normal],
[normal] the BBC has 
[normal]a strong track record in 
[normal]technology
[normal] innovation
[normal], 
[normal]including 
[normal]FM radio, DAB, colour TV, NICAM sound, Ceefax, and interactive TV and driving international standards and hardware designs for 
[normal]digital terre
[normal]strial television
[normal] (DTT)
[normal]. 
[normal]This has been made possible by 
[normal]a combination of 
[normal]our R&amp;D expertise, long-term perspective and access to stable funding. 
[normal]We can be an early-mover where commercial risks may be too high
[normal] for others
[normal], and can help in coordinating the ind
[normal]ustry to achieve collaborative initiatives and open standards – as, for example, our pan-industry work developing standards with groups such as the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) and our incubation of YouView (based on open standards and licensed
[normal] to third parties). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]44.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Back in 2002, DTT was in crisis. 
[normal]A coalition, led by the BBC, re-built the platform. 
[normal]Today, Freeview is the most popular TV platform in the UK, used in three-quarters of TV households
[normal], providing more choice for viewers, and a 
[normal]platform for dozens of new commercial digital channels.
[normal] The BBC often works through joint ventures and partnerships
[normal] 
[normal]to make synergies across the industry, and in regional hubs to promote economic development across the UK
[normal] 
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]45.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC has a market leadersh
[normal]ip role to play in launching new services based on new technologies.  We can take the lead even where business models are unclear, thus helping commercial players to enter new markets when the opportunities become 
[normal]clearer. 
[normal]BBC Online 
[normal](launched in 1997) 
[normal]was
[normal] a 
[normal]‘pull’
[normal] factor
[normal] for early adopters of the internet
[normal] and 
[normal]BBC 
[normal]iPlayer
[normal] (launched in 2007) 
[normal]stimulated demand for on-demand TV, where the UK 
[normal]now 
[normal]has a leading position.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]46.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]final 
[normal]part of the BBC’s role is to ensure t
[normal]hat the
[normal] benefits of digital technologies are available to all not just ‘early adopters’. We 
[normal]use our trusted brand and marketing capabilit
[normal]y
[normal] to 
[normal]inspire confidence, 
[normal]present 
[normal]the benefits of 
[normal]new technologies
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and signpost assistance
[normal]. 
[normal]From 2015, we will play a similar role for digital creativity, launching a major project to promote coding and programming, just as we did for basic computing and software in the 1980s through BBC Micro. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6) How should the BBC be [bold]funded[bold] beyond 2016? [bold]              [bold]47.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This is an issue that
[normal] will be considered at Charter R
[normal]eview and the BBC will make its case as part of this process. Based on the evidence today, w
[normal]e believe 
[normal]that 
[normal]the Licence Fee 
[normal]is very likely to 
[normal]remain the most effective way to fund the BBC
[normal] beyond 2016
[normal] and we look forward to discussing this with the Committee
[normal]. 
[normal]At its simplest, 
[normal]t
[normal]he Licence Fee is a form of shared or pooled investment to fund a public service that everyone can 
[normal]and does 
[normal]use
[normal]. The 
[normal]advantages of the licence fee include:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]48.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Licence Fee works in practice too, 
[normal]with 47% of the UK adults now backing it as the most ap
[normal]propriate way to fund the BBC, 
[normal]around 
[normal]double the figures for s
[normal]ubscri
[normal]ption or advertising 
[normal]and up from 31% only a decade ago
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]E
[normal]vasion 
[normal]and collection costs 
[normal]are 
[normal]also 
[normal]stable
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]at
[normal] 5
[normal].5
[normal]%
[normal] and 3.
[normal]0
[normal]% of income
[normal] respectively
[normal], 
[normal]relatively low by international standards
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]illingness to pay
[normal] 
[normal]for the BBC is high
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]49.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Licence
[normal] Fee has 
[normal]always 
[normal]adapted
[normal] flexibl
[normal]y
[normal] to technology change
[normal] over time
[normal], 
[normal]including
[normal] through a 
[normal]relatively simple change to 
[normal]the 
[normal]regulat
[normal]ions
[normal] 
[normal]in 2004 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]capture 
[normal]households watching
[normal] linear 
[normal]TV
[normal] over the interne
[normal]t
[normal] – a change which is now well understood
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]50.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Some have raised 
[normal]the impact 
[normal]of increased on-demand consump
[normal]tion on the Licence Fee.
[normal] The Licence Fee definition remains robust
[normal], with 
[normal]well under 2%
[normal] 
[normal]of households consum
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]exclusively
[normal] on-demand content
[normal] and so not requiring a Licence Fee.
[normal] However, the definition could start to create perverse incentives, with a 
[normal]fee 
[normal]payable for some ways of consuming BBC TV but not others. 
[normal]We would welcome discussing this issue with the Committee to consider whether and when the Licence Fee should be modern
[normal]ised again. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]51.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Alternative methods of funding the BBC 
[normal]would appear to 
[normal]have significant drawbacks. Subscription would turn the BBC into a commercial operator with an incentive to provide services that maximise revenues and/or profits. The evidence suggests t
[normal]hat a subscription model would be likely to reduce the payment base, increasing costs for consumers who remain and exclud
[normal]ing
[normal] many in society who could not afford to pay
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]52.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]If the objective of the BBC were to maximise advertising revenues, the BBC would shape its programming to maximise the benefits to advertisers rather than to audiences. 
[normal]It is notable that audiences report the lack of advertising on our services as a key ch
[normal]aracteristic they value about the BBC
[normal]. 
[normal]An advertiser-funded BBC would 
[normal]also 
[normal]have significant consequences for commercial broadcasters and the revenue available for investment in content.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7) [bold]Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC? [bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]53.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As argued above, the UK’s successful broadcasting model is characterised by competition for quality, not funding, between the BBC and commercial broadcasters
[normal]. The unitary receipt of the Licence Fee by the BBC serves a number of public interest objectives:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]54.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The current Licence Fee settlement imposed a number of new obligations on the BBC that will be funded from core income. The financial cost is around £235
[normal].5
[normal] million per annum from 2
[normal]013/14 to 2016/17
[normal] (excluding the World Serv
[normal]ice)
[normal], or 6
[normal]% of Licence Fee income
[normal]. As a result, we will have to make reductions to BBC content and services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]55.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There will
[normal], of course,
[normal] be further debate on this subject at Charter Review. It is important that funding models are properly tested to ensure value for money, 
[normal]including
[normal] against the following criteria:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q8) What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]56.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Internationally
[normal],
[normal] PSB is at a crossroads, with
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]some PSBs in rude health and successfully adapting their services and funding to a converged environment and others facing considerable difficulties. Furthermore, the overall trend is that where PSBs are well-funded and strong
[normal] – investing in original content, diverse schedules and quality and thereby driving ‘competition for quality’ – so too are commercial broadcasters.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is true, for example, in the UK, which has 
[normal]a 
[normal]particularly rich PSB and commercial ecosystem. It is in
[normal] stark contrast to countries
[normal], such as Portugal
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]where PSB has faced major funding cuts and threats of privatisation, or Greece which witnessed the forcible closure of a PSB
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Such challenges to PSB suggest there is a 
[normal]tipping-point
[normal] 
[normal]from which it is hard to r
[normal]ecover.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]57.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Other key lessons from international comparison include: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q9[bold]) How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016? [bold]In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutiona[bold]l framework for the BBC?[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]58.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC’s governance model beyond 2016 will be considered as part of Charter Review and we do not wish to pre
[normal]-
[normal]judge that process. 
[normal]Our priority is to make the existing model work as effectively as possible, within the constraints 
[normal]of the current Charter. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]59.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In September
[normal] 2013
[normal], 
[normal]the Trust and Executive 
[normal]announced 
[normal]a joint 
[normal]review 
[normal]of 
[normal]the BBC’s internal governance systems and structures, and the culture that surrounds them. We did this in response to a number of events that prompted legitimate questions about the effectiveness of the BBC’s system of governance, both within and between t
[normal]he Trust and Executive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]60.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]outcome of the 
[normal]review, announced on 11
[normal]th
[normal] December
[normal], is that the respective responsibilities of the Trust and Executive Board will be clarified, within the terms of the Charter. The Trust will focus on its oversight and regulat
[normal]ory role, ensuring we are answerable to licence fee payers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The Executive will be responsible for running the organisation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]61.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of the Executive Board will be strengthened.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It will be responsible for all aspects of management and operations and th
[normal]e main decision-making forum for the 
[normal]BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The role and number of non-executive directors on the 
[normal]Executive Board 
[normal]will increase, starting with the appointment of Sir Howard Stringer, previously CEO and chairman of Sony, from January 2014. We will also reduc
[normal]e the number of pan-BBC boards by more than 60%. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]62.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]These changes are designe
[normal]d to deliver simpler 
[normal]structures, bet
[normal]ter decision-making and proper 
[normal]accountability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They 
[normal]should 
[normal]ensure everyone in
[normal]side and outside the BBC is 
[normal]clear about who is responsible for 
[normal]major decisions and projects. The BBC should also be able to make faster decisions and reduce the time senior managers spend in meetings and increase the time spent making output for audiences.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]63.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As with governance, the most appropriate constitutional model 
[normal]for the BBC will be the
[normal] subject of debate at Charter review
[normal]. 
[normal]Our starting-point is that 
[normal]a Charter and Agreement model safeguard the BBC’s independence and provide stability for long-term investm
[normal]ent.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]64.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Charter model underpins the BBC’s unique governance structure and funding model, explicitly committing the Government of the day to respect the editorial and operational independence of the BBC. Charter terms are subject to extensive political d
[normal]eba
[normal]te at the time of Charter review
[normal], ensuring appropriate parliamentary and public scrutiny, but 
[normal]with a 
[normal]relatively fixed period to provide room for the BBC to deliver on its commitments. The ten-year 
[normal]term gives the BBC a sufficient horizon over which to pl
[normal]an investment and helps to keep decisions on the BBC’s remit out-of-step with the electoral cycle. The Charter also has a symbolic value, we believe, emphasising for the UK public and stakeholders the special role and responsibilities which the BBC has as 
[normal]an independent broadcaster and trusted national institution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]65.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, the model 
[normal]fits with 
[normal]an evolving communications environment, 
[normal]providing flexibility for the BBC to develop in line with new technologies and audience tastes.
