"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Gemma Sweeney (WSC063)Position: Daphne Jackson Fellow, University of Huddersfield, Queensgate, Huddersfield, HD1 3DH\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nAfter a significant career break to bring up three children I anticipated that it would be unlikely I could secure a new position\n wit\nhin the chemical industry which would be both flexible enough to fit with my family, but also at \na similar level\n to that\n which\n I had previously achieved. However, whilst considering my options I became aware of the \nDaphne Jackson Trust, which aims to help \nscientists return to their careers following a break, at an appropriate level, and with flexible part-time working.\n2.\n              \nAfter investigating this enormously valuable opportunity more fully, I approached Huddersfield University as a potential host, and submit\nted a full application. After submitting a peer reviewed proposal and interview,   I was delighted to be appointed a Daphne Jackson Research Fellow earlier this year. The Trust secured funding on my behalf, partly from the University of Hu\nddersfield, and p\nartly from\n the\n EPS\nRC.\n3.\n              \nI would like to submit evidence to this Government \ninquiry into women in STEM careers because I want to emphasise how valuable the Daphne Jackson Trust has been to me. Without this opportunity, it would have been highly unlikely I \nwould have returned to a career i\nn s\ncience, partly because of the decline in the Pharmaceutical Industry of late\n (and thus the number of positions for chemists has reduced significantly)\n, and partly because after such a long career break I would not be con\nfident of applying for a position for which I am qualified. In addition, the flexibility in working and part time hours\n \nmeans that I can fit my career around my personal life. Fellows are given support in their return to work, in the form of (re)- training\n courses, and by being given a mentor. The position is for two years and I am confident that on completion of the Fellowship I will be in a position to return to my STEM career.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
