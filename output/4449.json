"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Slater and Gordon (CMI0017)Executive SummaryWe do not accepted that Britain has a so-called ‘compensation culture’. We believe this is a myth propagated by the insurance industry to protect their reputation and ultimately their profits. \nInsurance \nc\nompany profits from motor vehicle insurance remain \nhealthy (market leader Direct Line, saw profits from car insurance rise \nin 2012 by £262m from £255m in 2011 or 2.7%\n, Admiral had a 19% profit in the corresponding period\n). Even though \nin 2013 \ncompanies are repor\nting tougher conditions \n– believed to be due \nto a more competitive market – only last month Direct Line reported operating profits of £418m in the first three quarters. That is a spike of more than 20%. \nIt is important that through \nthis\n process of reform the initial goal of lowering insurance premiu\nms is not forgotten. There must be clear, independent oversight of any measures seeking to reduce the financial burden to the motorist. The historically huge rise in premiums is now as much a cost of living issue as energy prices. \nMotorists\n are required by\n law to have insurance\n and\n there\nfore\n \nGovernment must\n focus on the way the industry calculates premiums. There must also be assurances \nthat\n savings \nare pass\ned\n on to motorists and not simply\n achieved to\n improv\ne\n shareholder return. This should be addressed through legislation. \nThe industry cites insurance fraud as a key driver of premium cost and the Government has responded by recommending that medical experts be accredited to improve the quality of reporting a\nnd reduce the incidence of fraud. Done correctly, Slater &amp; Gordon support the accreditation of medical experts.  To succeed, a scheme must be completely independent and impartial from influence from interested parties. \nIf fraud does exist at a level which\n is \ncausing premium pressure, all stakeholders \nmust do everything\n within\n thei\nr power to limit \nthese \nopportunities.\nKey initiative\ns would include:\n&#xa0;Medical accreditation&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPre-medical offers&#xa0;\nThird party capture&#xa0;\nData sharing&#xa0;\nSmall claims limitDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPage | \n2\n \n&#xa0;\n"
