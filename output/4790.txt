[[[What, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Only one target has been set for the police force for 2013/14, and that is around reducing the risk of domestic burglary. The target is for performance to be better than similar forces and partnerships. Only one target area was chosen to reflect the significance of the problem faced by the communities of West Yorkshire in terms of the volume of domestic burglaries. A number of other performance indicators are being tracked for change over time and in agreement with the Chief Constable some challenging internal police force ambitions have been agreed across a range of indicators.&#xa0;In the past there have been issues where setting targets has become a perverse incentive. As an example the old Police Authority set a target to increase the sanction detection rate for domestic violence cases. There was concern that this incentivised police officers to proceed with cases despite poor quality evidence. Therefore the impact – either intentional or unintentional – of any targets set needs to be carefully considered.

[[[How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crim]]]

[[[e statistics for your area?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Primarily external inspections by bodies such as the Audit Commission or HMIC have been relied upon to provide reassurance that recorded crime figures are correct. However since recent HMIC inspections that have raised concerns over some aspects of crime recording I have instructed my Internal Audit function to undertake an audit into crime recording, and have been briefed on issues identified internally, changes needed and improvements made to crime recording by the Chief Constable via the various mechanisms that I use to hold him to account. I am interested to see the results from the current HMIC crime recording inspection – which I fully expect to show some areas for improvement – but feel that West Yorkshire Police is well on its way to improving its crime recording practices. This will remain a key focus for both myself and the Chief Constable.&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
