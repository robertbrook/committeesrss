[[[)]]]&#xa0;Public Health England (PHE) has the statutory responsibility for the&#xa0; protection of the public's health in England, and some health protection&#xa0; functions in devolved administrations, on behalf of the Secretary of State.&#xa0; The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has the statutory responsibility across the UK for the protection of public health in relation to food and the protection of consumers’ other interests in relation to food. These two responsibilities have clear synergies, and enable shared objectives and priorities to be identified and progressed across the two organisations. PHE and FSA have established a joint oversight group to ensure effective and timely liaison and collaboration between the two organisations in relation to food safety and health protection, with the overall aim of ensuring the protection of public health in England through effective collaboration between PHE and the FSA in all matters relating to food safety and health protection.&#xa0; &#xa0;The oversight group leads on the following activity across the two organisations:a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To identify joint strategic priorities in relation to food safety and health protection, and to ensure that appropriate working arrangements are in place to deliver those joint priorities.&#xa0; Early priorities include action to reduce the prevalence of campylobacter contamination in poultry and its impact on human health, and the prevalence of norovirus infection.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To ensure that risks, incidents and outbreaks of all infectious disease and chemical or radiological contamination of food are handled appropriately between PHE and FSA, with clarity of roles and responsibilities, and that epidemiological and food chain investigations are undertaken in an effective and timely manner.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To ensure clear understanding between PHE and FSA of the methodologies&#xa0; used by each organisation in relation to epidemiological investigations and investigation of the food chain, and the evidence to support action, to enable effective joint working when addressing incidents and outbreaks.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To develop a joint system of review and learning from incidents and outbreaks that will result in the positive learning of lessons for future joint investigations.&#xa0; This to include identifying and learning from good practice. Initial issues to be considered are horse meat and cryptosporidiume)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Collaboration on science, such as the Global Microbial Identifier Initiative, in order to share knowledge and inputs.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mapping of communication routes between the two organisations, recognising that both are complex organisations and that we need to identify the best way of ensuring communication between the organisations and with local authorities is effective.g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To agree protocols for the effective sharing of information between organisations, including routine surveillance information, and alerts on food safety and on health protection issues.h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To develop and maintain a memorandum of understanding between the organisations to reflect the above.i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To consider potential formalised joint working arrangements such as secondments of staff between the FSA and PHE.j)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To plan and execute joint engagement with Directors of Public Health in England on matters of common interest.k)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To plan and execute joint engagement with public health bodies in the other nations of the UK on matters of common interest.&#xa0;&#xa0;The FSA’s reflection on the first few months of operation of these arrangements, and the effective collaboration that has developed between the two organisations for example in the management of food-related outbreaks of illness, is extremely positive.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
