[[[The Wildlife Trusts]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There are 37 individual Wildlife Trusts in England.  They are actively engaged in the planning system, promoting opportunities to improve the natural environment and reviewing more than 70,000 planning applications last year.  The Wildlife Trusts have more than 740,000 members in England including members of our junior branch Wildlife Watch.&#xa0; Our vision is to create A Living Landscape and secure Living Seas.&#xa0; Each Wildlife Trust is working within its local communities to inspire people about the future of their area: their own Living Landscapes and Living Seas.&#xa0; &#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0; At present the majority of local planning authorities have no system in place to secure off-site compensation with long-term management commitments and this has proved in some instances to be detrimental to biodiversity and a barrier to achieving meaningful mitigation and compensation. Biodiversity offsetting could provide a positive alternative to the existing approaches, providing: 1.2&#xa0; The development of such a system needs to be informed by resilient evidence. It is therefore disappointing that the Green Paper has been issued before the completion of the offsetting pilots in April 2014. It will be vital to consider the findings of these pilots and assess whether they achieved the required outcomes. Failure to do so, will risk missing important opportunities and lessons that should inform the potential for, and design of, a future approach.2.1&#xa0; Biodiversity offsetting needs to have a clear purpose, set within a framework for delivering ecological networks. The Wildlife Trusts suggest that Government needs to set out a vision to create a National Ecological Network for England, which should be informed by ecological network strategies produced by Local Nature Partnerships (LNPs). Within these strategies, ecological network maps would show the existing natural assets (our statutory and non-statutory sites and priority habitats) and important areas for re-establishing strategic footholds for nature eg. buffers around protected sites and Nature Improvement Areas across the length and breadth of England.2.2&#xa0; In order to make this vision a reality, the Natural Environment White Paper, Forestry Panel Report and Biodiversity Offsetting Green Paper could all be followed through and joined up by a land-mark piece of nature legislation. All this could connect to the Natural Capital agenda to create a substantive new framework Bill.  Specifically, for example, the Bill would set the context for biodiversity offsetting which would then have the purpose of helping achieve a coherent ecological network and the restoration of ecosystems.  In this way it could make a positive contribution towards meeting the need to rebuild our natural capital, resulting in a positive change in the country’s natural asset balance sheet.3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Wildlife Trusts welcome Government’s intentions that a biodiversity offsetting system should achieve a net gain for biodiversity and that it will not be appropriate to use in all circumstances ‘in view of the importance of the biodiversity that will be affected or the difficulty of creating similar habitat’.  We have significant doubts however, about the delivery of these objectives in practice, if the objective is to make provision for biodiversity impacts ‘quicker and cheaper for developers’. 3.2&#xa0; The assertion that biodiversity offsetting will be ‘cheaper’ and ‘quicker’ does not appear to be underpinned by any evidence. Evidence gathered from local Wildlife Trusts  about the biodiversity offsetting pilots shows that there has been a lack of uptake by developers This could indicate that the potential schemes were too expensive and therefore not signed up to by developers.  For developers which already deliver with regards to biodiversity, then offsetting may not introduce additional costs, but if the system is to achieve net gains for biodiversity (as it should do in line with the NPPF), some developers are likely to have to pay more than they do currently. In addition, the assumption that compensatory habitat can be provided on less-expensive land may not always be the case, particularly as offsetting could push the price of some land up.3.3&#xa0; Currently, the tone of the Green Paper is weighted and focused more in favour of the benefits of biodiversity offsetting to the developer rather than the natural environment. It also fails to adequately recognise the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services to society. biodiversity offsetting is a complex issue and it is therefore vital that the development of a new system is not rushed or simplified at the expense of delivering positive outcomes for the natural environment and society as a whole. Mitigation hierarchy3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Biodiversity offsetting should only be used as a mechanism for compensating residual harm and should only be applied if there is evidence that the significant impacts of a development cannot be avoided, reduced or mitigated.  The system needs to be mindful of assumptions in applying or interpreting the mitigation hierarchy – it has to be clear, that the application of biodiversity offsetting must not weaken existing protection for important sites, habitats and the population status of species of conservation concern. 3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Currently, the planning system fails the natural environment, with most developments resulting in a net loss of biodiversity. There is an opportunity to design a system that addresses this, but if this is to work properly, there needs to be appropriate constraints and clear guidance, along with standards for avoiding and mitigating loss which should be applied rigorously.Net Gain/ Net Loss3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The objective of a biodiversity offsetting system should be to achieve no net loss, and a net gain for biodiversity through the planning system. While we support the objective to enhance ecological networks and improve connectivity, this should not be at the expense of those species and habitats that need to be conserved in situ. If in-situ conservation is the best option to prevent a long term negative impact on a protected habitat or species, then biodiversity offsetting will not ensure compliance with legislation. 3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The concept that achieving a ‘net gain’ for biodiversity by relocation of biodiversity assets ‘in a way that enhances ecological networks’ might be true of some habitats, but is inherently dangerous to apply to others. For example, offsetting a small isolated ancient woodland by planting a larger new woodland in a strategic biodiversity area to achieve the same credit scoring, will not create a net gain in biodiversity, particularly as the current methodology doesn’t include any calculation for loss of connectivity in generating the credits. 3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Furthermore, for high value and distinctive habitats in particular, finding and agreeing an appropriate offset project may not be that easy.3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A net biodiversity gain is only achieved if a project goes above and beyond the 'no net loss' threshold.   It is also unclear, at what geographical scale ‘no net loss’ is being considered in the Green Paper, or how this is being measured. Our view is that both ‘no net loss’ and ‘net gain’ should be judged at a sub-regional/county scale and to avoid biodiversity in one part of the country being lost in exchange for gains in another.Mandatory for all developments3.10 If biodiversity offsetting is to be introduced, it should be plan-led and mandatory across the board for all developments with new land take, regardless of size. Feedback from Wildlife Trusts in the pilot areas has already indicated that a voluntary scheme does not work.  A mandatory and well regulated scheme will:3.11 Habitats and species of importance may occur at any scale, for example, bat roosts and the only known breeding site for Jennings’ Proboscis-worm (which has no statutory protection) occur at very small scale. The number of houses is not necessarily related or comparable to the ecological impact, because a well located major development may have few impacts yet a small speculative development on a wildlife rich site could be disastrous for wildlife but below the threshold. If developers are not required to offset residual loss of biodiversity, on developments below a certain threshold, adequate compensation for small developments and the cumulative impacts of these developments will be lost.&#xa0;4.1              The pilot metric appears to be based on some good principles and could provide a starting point from which to develop a robust metric.  It will be important to evaluate the experience and lessons of the pilots in considering revisions to the metric and its broader application. These findings could usefully be considered alongside:&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the complexities of ecosystems it will be vital that any future metric addresses a range of issues to ensure biodiversity offsetting does not result in lots of land of mediocre value, colonised only by a relatively small number of generalist species that cannot support the diversity of species and habitats that have been lost. There are many issues that must be considered and addressed when developing and applying a biodiversity offsetting metric. Some of TWTs key concerns and risks are set out in paragraphs 4.3 – 4.8.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Availability of like-for-like physical conditions for compensation The value of many existing sites is in their long-term stability, history and physical characteristics, enabling them to support specialist species. The metric and associated cost of delivery of compensation land need to take into account the full biodiversity of a site. The quality and functionality of ecosystems depend on the interaction dynamics of diversity and fragile species. An offsetting approach will fail to deliver if it ultimately results in land of a generalised and species-impoverished nature, in relation to land lost.4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Temporary Ecological deficit There will be a temporary ecological deficit during the establishment of the offsetting site (which nationally could be substantial). This will persist unless and until offset habitats have reached equivalent quality, quantity and functionality locally and within the wider national ecological network. In some cases, because of the highly fragmented state of our countryside, the site to be damaged/destroyed can be the only local reservoir of many specialist species. If local compensation is proposed and it hasn’t been put in place (and matured enough to support specialist species) before the existing site is destroyed, there will be a complete local extinction of those species. The compensation land will then never support the same full range of species because there will be nowhere for them to colonise from. The only way to resolve this issue is to ensure that habitats are created before they are required as compensation. This needs exploring and taking into account in a completed metric approach. In relation to this it will also be vital that investment is made upfront into a secure fund before the development takes place.4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Time required to recreate habitat and re-establish ecosystems Consideration should be given to the issue that while it may be possible to quickly and successfully translocate individuals of some species (e.g. Great Crested Newts) and some assemblages of species, to suitable newly established habitat, it is nearly impossible to accurately recreate the detail, much of which, may not be well known. Re-establishment of microbial ecosystems, relationships between micro-fauna and flora of meadow soils, peat-based wetland communities and others will need a lot of time (decades to centuries) and/or a lot of very detailed research and management to deliver. There is little published and accessible casework on how quickly, or slowly, such complexity re-establishes itself in various habitats and habitat mosaics, over long timescales.4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Character of the receptor site It is not clear from Government proposals how risks are taken into account in terms of the character of a receptor site. Further consideration will need to be given to this in developing the metric. For example, it would be considered lower risk to restore a humid heath from a conifer plantation on heathland than from a maize field. The first is quite straight forward and could be achieved within a reasonable time scale, the second is much riskier with less certainty as to what habitats will emerge. While after many decades, the ex-maize field may be the most interesting, this does not really help planning with certainty.4.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Survey of impacts We are concerned that a standard framework to assess impacts, may limit the level of survey and/or analysis of individual impacts and in-combination effects occurring with other developments, in the surrounding area.  All sites are different and survey and evaluation needs to consider distinctiveness and quality of habitat if there are to be true gains for biodiversity. If biodiversity offsetting becomes a permit to undertake a twenty minute survey, the biodiversity value of the site is unlikely to be assessed appropriately, with habitats and species missed, either due to the time of year or the lack of survey time and effort. The value of grassland and woodland cannot be assessed in twenty minutes.

[[[5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Local Variation ]]]5.1&#xa0; While a national framework of common standards could usefully provide consistency of approach, a system for biodiversity offsetting must provide scope for local variation and flexibility which should be set out within local plans. Local variation is important because habitat which is valuable or distinctive in one area may not be considered valuable or distinctive elsewhere. Unless the metric and offsetting system are sufficiently rigorous to cover all eventualities and retain ecological functionality, it is unlikely that one size will fit all.  Without local flexibility, the calculation may end up locally meaningless and won’t result in an equal or fair trade. It could also lead to the loss of small areas of semi-natural habitat, of relatively low ecological value, but highly valued by the local community.5.2&#xa0; Significant harm is also an issue which needs to be placed in the context of the local area, the identified impacts and the feature to be lost. What is considered significant harm in one area might be considered less so in another. The balance to be placed on this is an integral part of the planning officer’s role when considering and applying local and national planning policy and should, as with other planning issues be informed by local ecological expertise.

[[[Strategic l]]]

[[[ocation of offsets]]]6.1&#xa0; For offsetting to be reasonable, there must be a meaningful ecological and social relationship between the development site and the compensatory scheme. This should be as close to the development as possible, ideally within the same district or county, but at the very least within the same sub regional level. The Wildlife Trusts do not accept that offsetting should be evenly distributed across the country - where development pressures are lower, the requirement for offsets will also be lower. Nor would we support offsets on land:6.2&#xa0; Location is a big consideration in addressing risk, for example, provision of new ‘quite interesting’ habitats adjacent to a matrix of ‘very interesting’ habitats may have greater ecological advantage than an equivalent area of isolated but ’very interesting’ habitat. The offset system and planning generally, should take a strategic approach to establish connective and permeable biodiversity networks everywhere, based on the principles set out in Making Space for Nature of bigger, better and more joined up. Guided by this, LNPs (in collaboration with other partnerships such as Nature Improvement Area groups and Catchment Initiative Groups) should develop ecological network and NIA visions and maps. These should be based on up to date data and information on statutory and non-statutory sites, priority habitats, geology, Natural Character Areas and opportunity areas and will require LPAs to cooperate across boundaries at a county/sub-regional level to inform the strategy and agree the offsetting approach.6.3&#xa0; These visions and maps should be embedded within local policy and the opportunities identified within them should be used to inform location priorities for targeting offsets.  Identification of land for biodiversity offsetting would enable the quantum of habitat required to be assessed at a strategic level, taking into account: direct habitat loss; and the in-combination and indirect pressures. It would also ensure that the offset is in a geographical area that will enable colonisation by populations displaced by development, or expansion by populations within an existing habitat adjacent to the offset. 6.4&#xa0; A further consideration that will need to be taken into account when locating offsets is the degree of local community interest in the site that will be partially or wholly destroyed by the development.6.5&#xa0; Over the last decade, much work has been achieved through habitat opportunity mapping. These maps have provided local authorities and partners with vital information to support a robust, climate-proof, long-term landscape-scale vision for the benefit of the natural environment, society and the economy. This work has taken place in partnership across most English regions, where maps have been produced to identify biodiversity opportunity areas critical for restoration, based on agreed methodology. The opportunity maps provide clear and consistent information on sites of known value, they capture most or all of the resource which meet the agreed criteria, and take a landscape scale approach. As a result, they can provide a clear spatial framework for a local ecological network and support the effective targeting of local biodiversity offsets.&#xa0; Some of the Biodiversity Opportunity Areas identified through this process have been used to identify Nature Improvement Areas. We believe that all areas should be covered by a robust evidence base and informed by identifying and mapping such areas.

[[[Constraints ]]]

[[[and restrictions]]]7.1&#xa0; Biodiversity offsetting should not provide a mechanism to develop protected sites. There are very few projects that would justify direct harm to the national and international sites. A housing development or local infrastructure should not be considered to outweigh the need to protect these sites. In relation to a project of national importance there may be certain circumstances in which damage cannot be avoided. In these cases, we would advocate that offsetting should occur immediately adjacent to the site to provide replacement habitat within the SAC or Ramsar complex, or for the species for which the Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites are designated.

[[[ ]]]7.2&#xa0; Offsetting needs to be controlled. There should be no ‘down trading’ on habitats or bias towards habitats which are cheaper to create. So a high distinctiveness habitat should be offset with a high distinctiveness habitat. Where there are specific connectivity requirements within an area which require certain habitat types in certain locations, changes of habitat type (from like-for-like), should be clearly justified and locally negotiated to meet the broader objectives of local biodiversity strategies and strategically defined requirements set by LNPs.7.3&#xa0; We would be concerned with any approach that permitted an environmental gain (that might otherwise be lost) to be counted as an offset. This would risk: discontinuation of other sources of public spending on biodiversity; introducing a ‘what-if' option into a framework which is striving to be solid, quantified and certain; and a resultant net biodiversity loss.

[[[assessments ]]]8.1&#xa0; Necessary judgements on using the metric and making assessments should be made by experienced ecologists, based on up to date survey data and information. Planning authorities will therefore need to have access to ecological expertise (either in-house or provided under contract/service level agreement). Many local authorities are choosing to cut their ecological expertise and support for data providers - currently only a third of local authorities have an in-house ecologist and local record centres are severely under–resourced. This must be addressed along with the inevitable increase in burden on already, overstretched local authorities as they set up, operate and learn about the new system. 8.2&#xa0; Assessments should be guided by the expertise of a number of local organisations/partnerships. For example: the LNP; Local Records Centre; Biodiversity Partnerships; and nature conservation organisations such as The Wildlife Trusts. Collectively, with the LPA and Natural England, they can offer a range of ecological and planning expertise, grounded in local knowledge and an understanding of the strategically defined requirements for protecting and restoring the natural environment. 8.3&#xa0; The Core Strategy should clearly set out for developers whether and where offsetting is appropriate in the local area, so that it is clearly and democratically defined in local policy. This should explain the local context to the metric, the broad scope of what the LPA will require in terms of offset habitat decisions and offset placement areas of the authority, based on the vision and strategy for ecological networks within the area.

[[[Long term management]]]

[[[ ]]]9.1&#xa0; The loss of area and quality of habitat to development will remain as an overall impact for a considerable time, if not in real perpetuity. Therefore we need to replace as much as we can for as long as possible. In order to secure no net loss to biodiversity, offsets should recreate/restore an area of habitat which is larger than is lost, be secured in perpetuity and agreed within conservation covenants, so the land doesn’t become neglected or damaged.9.2&#xa0; Long term management is absolutely key to the success of offsetting projects and there should be a requirement for an agreed management plan to be produced and implemented. We would expect all agreements to include a monitoring and review programme, to ensure that the regime continues to be effective and meet the objectives set.  It has to be recognised that habitats (and species composition) may change naturally over time, including in response to climate change.  Some flexibility, or requirement to review management objectives will be important. It will also be vital that the partners responsible have: clear protocols and resources to certify and enforce management agreements; secure, long term financial support for management of the offset site, secured in advance of the development commencing; and adequate ecological skills and expertise. &#xa0;17 October 2013&#xa0;                             Local Wildlife Trusts in pilot areas (2013): Verbal and written updates on progress with pilots.
