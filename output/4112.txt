[[[the  House]]]

[[[ of Commons Select Committee Considering the Future for the BBC]]]FromJoseph Mallory Wober  PhDRetired; previously Deputy Head of (Audience) Research,  Independent Television Commission&#xa0;

[[[Principal Purpose]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ of Proposals]]]to identify the value developed within the BBC’s life and to help it to continueto establish a structure which will help the population identify (more than hitherto andcurrently) with the merits of Public Service Broadcastingto furnish some detailed suggestions which will strengthen the first two items above&#xa0;Preamble – 2013 for 2016&#xa0;We have a BRITISH Broadcasting Corporation for which we are asked to plan a future at a time when we do not know what the future meaning of British will be, in 2016.&#xa0;If the Scottish Referendum opts for continued Union this simplifies the task of saying what British should carry on to mean. It should reflect on the contributions made by Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England to the life and achievements of the United Kingdom.&#xa0;If the Scottish Referendum opts for movement away from the Union, the proposals below still hold that the history of the UK has been of a great net value to all the current population, and should continue to resound in the culture and progress of the devolving entities for the present and foreseeable future. There will be a Monarchy in common, most likely a common currency, certainly a language in common (albeit with differences to conserve and celebrate) and there will continue to be a huge Scottish presence and influence in the rest of the UK.&#xa0;

[[[P1]]]  I propose therefore that the British Broadcasting Corporation should continue to be named, thus – even if the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation (likely based in Glasgow) continues under that name. The SBC would continue to make and share a great deal of the programming made on both sides of the border.&#xa0;

[[[P2  There]]]

[[[ should be a Public Service Broadcasting Trust]]]This would have two Divisions –

[[[ a ]]]

[[[Cor]]]

[[[(]]]poration

[[[) Division and a Com(]]]mercial

[[[) Division*]]]The PSBT would look to the public, its audience and encourage Reithian ideals ofBroadcasting.  This ‘outward facing’ stance would serve to:help the population to realize that the whole effort is in “their” ie OUR interest;reduce the number of people now before the courts as licence payment defaulters;The PSBT CorDiv would attend to matters at the BBC.The PSBT ComDiv would attend to all content made and offered on all other “platforms”.The PSBT should be financed by a first slice off the Licence Revenue – thusthe regulation of BOTH BBC AND COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING would bepaid for directly by the public and rendered answerable to the public.The PSBT should have 

[[[a strong and published Audience Research function]]] – measuringSatisfaction, and assessing allegations of harms and other negative functions*this would replace Ofcom’s activities in the regulation of broadcasting; necessarylegislation would have to be enacted.&#xa0;The PSBT (especially CorDiv) would 

[[[draw back from dramatizing the ‘emotional]]]

[[[p]]]

[[[enumbra]]]

[[[’ ]]]

[[[of sports]]] – footballers post goal antics, spraying of (mock?) “champagne”over winning

[[[ ]]]teams – such behaviour simply not being broadcast. Managers and sportspeople would presently learn to reserve their energies for sport, and not apparentlycontribute to “lad culture” activities.&#xa0;The PSBT would 

[[[continue to assess fairness]]] in the coverage of politics, with specialassessment drawn from small sectors of the public identified by test as being already wellinformed on matters in focus.&#xa0;The PSBT would undertake and publish the results of 

[[[rigorous assessment of new]]]

[[[ventures]]] such as the introduction of broadcasting from court proceedings.&#xa0;The PSBT would encourage a return to the use of 

[[[“educated English” in diction]]] and in

[[[deployment]]]

[[[ of syntax]]].  For announcers of news particularly  but also in documentarypresentation  this would entail current best practice including speakers with “Perthshire”Scottish and “educated Welsh and Northern Ireland” delivery.  It would discourage“estuarisation” (see footnote for observed examples). There should be an internal

[[[consultant]]]

[[[ on pronunciation of foreign words]]] (preferably as foreign speakers say them –thus “arf-gharn-is-tarn” rather than aff-gann-is-tann, and hybrid variants incorporatingsome long and some short vowels).&#xa0;The PSBT should encourage the 

[[[reduction of “gristle”]]] (as in ‘connective tissue’ in the body)manifest in continuity and cross channel announcements on BBC and risked at the possiblecost in audience sizes on commercial channels; it should also discourage the foible ofshowing newsrooms behind the newsreader – the news is NOT about who collects andpresents it – but about the world outside.&#xa0;The PSBT should discourage the practice of assuming that 100% of the audience has accessto the internet and will use it. The ONS estimates that several million households do not haveinternet access and several million individuals do not have or use telephone access to theinternet. Thus broadcast invitations to audience members to respond should not, as now,point to internet access but should point out to people that they can write or telephoneand in the latter case that there will be a human being there to answer calls. This is to

[[[make]]]

[[[ response access more fairly available to all]]].&#xa0;The PSBT should 

[[[assess (and publish]]]

[[[) responses from people with handicaps]]] of hearingand of vision as to the quality of attempts to help them – thus speech on radio (and in TVdrama and documentary) should not be overly encumbered by “atmospheric” music whichin reality provides camouflage, and the subtitling services, while often helpful, equallyoften are very poor and frustrating. Subtitles in white on a white background are almostuseless and white text should be shown on a dark background rectangle.&#xa0;

[[[P3   Punishments]]]Both Divisions of the PSBT should have the power to FINE broadcasters for transgressionsof the regulations.  For the BBC to forfeit licence revenue would be dysfunctional unlessbehaviour was improved – to encourage this it should be considered to cut salaries of headsof departments taken to task.  The money collected would go to the World Service arm.&#xa0;

[[[P4   World Service]]]It was not a good idea to have the World Service financed by the Foreign Office and nor isit a good idea to have it paid for by licence payers many thousands of whom are not able toafford it for domestic broadcasting.  The occasion of a new charter and licence review shouldbe used to arrange to have the 

[[[World Service paid for from the DFID budget]]]

[[[ ]]]for the mostpart, bolstered by ‘as-and-when’ additions from fines for contravention of regulations.&#xa0;

[[[P5    Volumes of Advertising]]]ComDiv should retrieve the responsibility for advertising control, relinquished so swiftly byOfcom when it was established – and ComDiv should consider whether the amount ofadvertising broadcast for its own services by the BBC should fall within reasonable limitsset by what research shows the viewers consider tolerable.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It has been estimated that there are (in 2011) approximately three quarters of a million of people born in Scotland who live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, which represents 15 per cent of the population living in Scotland; a smaller though similar number of people born in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, live in Scotland.  It is sometimes said that the era of BROADCASTING has ended and with it, the supremacy of the BBC. Neither of these notions is true. Very recent audience measurements by BARB show that some sort of television or download facility is switched on in a household for over 25 hours a week and the BBC’s two main channels gather over a quarter of “viewing” time.   See: http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-total-viewing-summary&#xa0; Eg: A misogynist culture has recently been reported in British Universities and,, while this is not a direct outcome of ‘the culture of the airwaves’ it should be established that the broadcasting world, in its quest for “youth audiences” is NOT abetting any such hostilities. See:http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/university-for-women-your-chance-to-spend-thousands-to-be-bullied-and-intimidated-by-your-fellow-students-8973696.html a BBC news report said that there was a “statement 

[[[TO]]] the (house of Commons)” when it should have written that there was a statement 

[[[AT]]] the Commons – reporters should know what a preposition is, and use each one precisely; misuse can mean significant misrepresentation.  See: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25155188&#xa0; Very recent examples from broadcasts heard include “beeth” said for booth, “Cheeder” for Tudor, “Cheeb” for    Tube, “dath” for death and “teem(b)” for tomb. http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-access---households-and-individuals/2013/stb-ia-2013.html
