[normal]The 
[normal]Additional 
[normal]Written Evidence is a 
[normal]S
[normal]ubmission by the author in 
[normal]persona
[normal]l capacity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] ai
[normal]m of the S
[normal]ubm
[normal]ission is to inform the decision making process of the Chair and Members of Transport Select Committee by 
[normal]drawing their attention to 
[normal]review and analyse 
[normal]the 
[normal]tragic 
[normal]event of a 
[normal]cyclist death at Motts Lane level crossing, Witham, Essex on 24 Jan 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The in
[normal]put data for the review and analysis is gained from the RAIB Investigation Report dated 01/2014
[normal] and other freely available public data and the System for Investigation of Railway Interfaces (SIRI) Framework. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author requests the staff assisting the Trans
[normal]p
[normal]ort Select Committee to map
[normal] the concerns expressed in this paper onto the questions raised by the Transport Select Committee. Author thanks the staff for their mapping effort
[normal] as the Framework used by the author cannot be subjectively mapped onto the quest
[normal]ionnaire. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The number of 
[normal]US 
[normal]d
[normal]ollar billionaire
[normal]s
[normal] in the UK 
[normal]as per Forbes magazine 2012 data 
[normal]is approximately 
[normal]is 37
[normal]. The population of the UK is around 63.23 million. The probability of a finding dollar bil
[normal]lionaire is roughly five parts by million. In a more precise and accurate terms, the figure is worked out to 
[normal]5.85165E-06
[normal].  The probability of a cyclist killed at level crossing is (assuming the only cyclist killed at a level crossing is =1/63.23 million or
[normal] 
[normal]roughly one part per ten million. The probability of cyclist being killed at a 
[normal]train 
[normal]level crossing is more unlikely than the probability of a 
[normal]US 
[normal]dollar billionaire
[normal] in the UK
[normal]. 
[normal]The probability of cyclist being killed on London Street and the probability of
[normal] a US dollar billionaire are of similar magnitude of probabilities. 
[normal]However, this feature of similarity 
[normal]of probabilities 
[normal]does not induce similar intuitions. 
[normal]The difference in intuitions 
[normal]arising from consideration of these scenarios and their role on 
[normal]behavi
[normal]our is discussed later in the text. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now, 
[normal]following the work of 
[normal]p
[normal]sychologists like Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahnem
[normal]a
[normal]n
[normal] and Amos Tversky and Prospect Theory they advance
[normal], author
[normal] judges 
[normal]the situations as
[normal] reflecting gambling tendency 
[normal]in both
[normal] situations
[normal]. Because 
[normal]activities
[normal] involving writing bestselling novels or crossing level crossing when train is coming 
[normal] 
[normal]involve risk taking
[normal] involving very low probabilities of success
[normal](pp317)
[normal] 
[normal](Kahneman, 2011)
[normal]. 
[normal]Jonathan Haidt, a psychologist cited by 
[normal]Daniel Kahnemen expressed this tendency by the following saying, “emotional tail wags the rational dog”
[normal]. This
[normal] 
[normal]type of think
[normal]ing about situations involving emotions that affect risk is 
[normal]summarised 
[normal]by author 
[normal]as perceptions
[normal] of harm being 
[normal]more important than act
[normal]ual harm. 
[normal]This type of thinking is not new. Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) counselled that perceptions of harm are more dangerous. Because whatever choices we 
[normal]make Nature is divine and headed in a certain direction is
[normal] the core idea
[normal] at the hear
[normal]t of the Stoic philosophy
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now, Let us consider
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]hypothetical 
[normal]scenario: s
[normal]uppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he
[normal] 
[normal]hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewellery store with a brok
[normal]en window. Then
[normal] 
[normal]a gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which
[normal] 
[normal]turns out to be full of expensive jewellery. The policeman doesn't hesitate at all in deciding that this
[normal] 
[normal]gentleman is dishonest. But by what 
[normal]reasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion
[normal]?
[normal] What is the probability that this policeman is in error? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The idea of a US dollar billionaire in the UK conjures up image of one who is working very hard
[normal] by being enterprising
[normal], striving to help the eco
[normal]nomy by employing lot of people and being a useful member of society.  However, UK billionaire 
[normal]writer is a different
[normal] individual from this description 
[normal]and 
[normal]is told as rags-to riches story
[normal]. 
[normal]But,
[normal] the idea of a cyclist dodging a train at a level crossing
[normal]  inv
[normal]okes 
[normal]a different kind of feeling
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Members of the British Transport Police are 
[normal]reportedly 
[normal]hunting for the lone woman cy
[normal]clist who jumped red lights but 
[normal]narrowly escaped death. Author wishes to thank God for the miraculous save.  Whereas members of the Brit
[normal]ish Transport 
[normal]Police, author speculates, 
[normal]may admire imagination of the writer 
[normal]of Harry Potter Book 
[normal]when watching the Harry Potter film
[normal] on the TV or at a theatre
[normal]. 
[normal]Author speculates that members of the British Transport Police do not comprehend the idea of A
[normal]ristotelian
[normal] (intuitive) physics in the theatre
[normal] 
[normal]scenario 
[normal] 
[normal](Penrose, 2004)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal](Reason, 1990)
[normal]. 
[normal]The idea of criminalising the activity of jumping red lights may be
[normal] a
[normal] good option for policing activity at
[normal] junctions where likelihood of traffic conflicts may arise 
[normal]and 
[normal]but 
[normal]escaping the conflicts 
[normal]by jumping 
[normal]may be good option 
[normal]for the cycling activity 
[normal]as som
[normal]e of the Submissions attest to. Whereas criminalising 
[normal]the 
[normal]stealing of jewellery is reasonable policing ac
[normal]t
[normal]ivity
[normal].   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When thinking about 
[normal]such tragic cases involving death
[normal], 
[normal]it is not normally recognised that 
[normal]the idea of 
[normal]T
[normal]ime is 
[normal]associated with the changes of states
[normal] and focal attention
[normal] of a living being. 
[normal] 
[normal]This association of Time and human experience is known 
[normal]as Entropy
[normal]. Expressed in an informal manner, entropy is a physically perceptible process when a
[normal] rubber band is stretched, a
[normal]n egg is dropped onto a floor, a car crashes into a lamp post or a cyclist is struck by a train or another
[normal] road vehicle
[normal]. 
[normal]These one w
[normal]ay processes
[normal] 
[normal]are studied in physics as involving
[normal] a quantity known as Entropy. The resulting dis-order can never be decreased
[normal] or is 
[normal]ir-
[normal]reversible
[normal]. 
[normal]In other words, 
[normal]author argues that 
[normal]entropy and unsafety are identical concepts and are state properties
[normal] like s
[normal]weetness is of sugar
[normal] and does not belong to its constituents
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal](Walker, 2008)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal](Ashby, 1957)
[normal]. 
[normal]In other words, an individual alone cannot be considered 
[normal]in the explanation but must involve 
[normal]whole 
[normal]social
[normal]-technical
[normal] 
[normal]system.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A cyclist, car driver, train driver, 
[normal]pilot may bring about harm to themselves and others because they may lack skills in riding a by-cycle, driving a car or 
[normal]driving 
[normal]a train or piloting an aircraft
[normal]. B
[normal]ut under the conditions of modern 
[normal]21
[normal]st
[normal] century society, it is a rarity that people learn to do things by themselves without aid or help from
[normal] others. Even learning from others 
[normal]involves in these circumstances engaging with a manufactured (or programmed) object.  Production of these objects r
[normal]equire making plans, 
[normal]carrying out the 
[normal]activities
[normal] to 
[normal]produce, assemble , market and utilise them. Rules and regulations regulating the activity of individuals, on the job-training, type of school education and family influence are some of the factors shapin
[normal]g the behaviour of the individual. Therefore, when thinking about such tragic situations, we employ what is known as Systems Thinking to prevent re-occurrence of tragic situations by learning about 
[normal]the 
[normal]root causal factors
[normal] and acting upon them
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Travel be
[normal]haviour of cyclists was discussed in a latest academic publication
[normal]. 
[normal]However, there is another
[normal] academic research 
[normal]that has been useful to the author can be accessed from here
[normal]. 
[normal] From these documents, 
[normal]author has learnt 
[normal]there is no linear relationship that can be inferred between cycling activity and exposure to hazard at the level crossing that can be used as an indicator of safety. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author agrees to the two proposition(s) advanced by 
[normal]Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman
[normal] 
[normal](Kahneman, 2011)
[normal]. First, 
[normal]domain experts are hostages to emotional, cognitive and social factors
[normal] 
[normal]and failure to acknowledge their ignorance is encouraged by their clients.  Second, certain occupations need high resilience in the wak
[normal]e of high failure rates. 
[normal]In conclusion, economists who believe in the rational model of behaviour have driven out rational engineers from system safety management practice area and allowed their place to be taken by safety assurance providers. 
[normal]The system 
[normal]approach to safety assurance does not delve into root causes nor is able to apply laws of probability correctly
[normal] 
[normal](A.G.Hessami, 2012)
[normal]. 
[normal]This leads to a dis-benefit to the society is that it pays the costs of harm directly.

[normal]The Table 1 shows that human (latent failures) committed by various stakeholder(s) organisations dominate the rare and bad event of a cyclist
[normal]’s
[normal] accidental death.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From the partial HAZOP 
[normal]study it can be inferred that accelerating train relative to the cyclist is an occupational hazard. Because in a relative (from Albert Einstein’s perspective) universe, inertial path is greater than accelerated path or in geometric terms, the diagonal of a
[normal] triangle is more than sum of it sides is shown by Sir Roger Penrose
[normal] 
[normal](Penrose, 2004)
[normal]. These findings are counter –intuitive to 
[normal]ancient Greek (Pythagoras theorem) and 17
[normal]th
[normal] Century (Newtonian dynamics) physics
[normal] 
[normal](Reason, 1990)
[normal].  
[normal]The HAZOP Study can be applied to all other interfaces requiring a study. Similar detailed studies were performed by author and published

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Having established 
[normal]the fact that the Train Regulating and Controlling 
[normal]System can induce errors and contribute a collision hazard,
[normal] it is necessary to pay attention to the barriers that can prevent and protect the cyclist from this occupation hazard

[normal]as directed by EU Saf

[normal]is self –evident from the careful reading of the information listed on their website.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On the question of 
[normal]safety budget for eliminating risk from level crossings, Nobel
[normal] Laureate Daniel Kahneman hypothetical argument 
[normal]against precautionary principle 
[normal]is difficult to sustain as the budget of £9 billion is insignificant in comparison to other amounts of £80 billion

[normal]The Management Oversight and Risk Tree Work sheet is not applied in this Case Study as author earlier submission to the Transport Committee on the theme of Cycling Safety and Safety at Level Crossings have addressed the method already. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Application of Management Oversight and Risk Tree Worksheet as part of SIRI Framework to the Case Studies of Challenger Accident, Japanese Nuclear Accident, and Herefordshire Level Crossing Accidents show that dependability type of approach applied by auto
[normal]mation engineers and managers are not useful for identifying hazards and their elimination. 
[normal]The combination of latent failures in understanding has been listed in this accident case study as well. By correcting these level of safety may improve.
