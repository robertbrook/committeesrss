[[[Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance – Written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]](A)  All unsealed  Byways Open To All Traffic, and all unsealed ways on the List of Streets that are not part of ‘the ordinary roads network’, should be re-classified as Restricted Byways. &#xa0;(B) The public should have a right of appeal against local authorities who refuse to impose traffic regulation orders on particular routes.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[YDGLA   ]]]The Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) was set up in 2002 in response to widespread public concerns about the damage and nuisance that were being inflicted on the green lanes of the Yorkshire Dales. (‘Green lane’ is a term that has no legal significance but it is irreplaceable as a term to signify the ancient, unsealed tracks that thread through the rural landscape.)  Our membership includes farmers, grouse moor owners, local residents, equestrians, mountain bikers, walkers, parish councils and various amenity groups.  Our website, ydgla.co.uk, sets out our programme in detail.&#xa0;

[[[The purpose of our submission   ]]]We make this submission because we believe that the Deregulation Bill presents a golden opportunity for Parliament to complete the valuable work started by the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (NERC) 2006.  NERC set severe limits on the expansion of the network of green lanes open to recreational motorists, and it gave national parks the powers to impose traffic regulation orders (TROs) that suspend rights for recreational motor vehicles on green lanes where the presence of such vehicles (chiefly 4x4s and motorbikes) is causing damage and environmental nuisance.&#xa0;2.1  However, NERC made no provision for the extensive network of green lanes, entered on local authorities’ List of Streets, and known as ‘Unclassified County Roads’ (UCRs), or sometimes as Unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UUCRs). The county of North Yorkshire supplies an indication of just how many green lanes remain beyond the reach of NERC: the county has 470 miles (750 kms) of green lane UCRs.  How many of North Yorkshire’s UCRs, and UCRs nationally, have rights for motor vehicles is unknown, but in the absence of clarity, UCRs are routinely driven on by recreational vehicle users.&#xa0;2.2  Furthermore, NERC did nothing to make the imposition of TROs more straightforward, speedier, fairer, and less expensive.  We therefore submit recommendations that, if enacted, would simplify the management of green lanes, would save authorities a lot of money, and, above all, would bring an end to the blight that recreational vehicles inflict on the countryside.  None of our recommendations affects farmers and occupiers who use vehicles on the green lanes that lead to their properties, nor other vehicle users who obviously need them – eg the emergency services, the Royal Mail.&#xa0;2.3   We set out below our recommendations, followed by three brief case studies that illustrate the absurdities, waste of money, and administrative difficulties of the present laws.  These case studies show both the perversity of the present classification of unsealed BOATs and UCRs, and the extraordinary rigmarole, requiring huge expenditure of time and money, that authorities have to perform in order to impose traffic regulation orders on them.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Our recommendations]]]&#xa0;3.1  A sharp distinction needs to be made between unsealed and sealed  ways, using the definition set out in the Road Traffic Regulation Act (1984).  The Act defines an unsealed way as a way whose ‘surface, or most of whose surface, does not consist of concrete, tarmacadam, coated roadstone or other prescribed material.’ ( s22BB (1)(b)(ii).)  This definition comes in the section of the Act relating to national parks, but this legal definition could easily be extended to apply to ways beyond national parks.  Most importantly, it provides the basis for the development of a vital distinction between green lanes and ‘the ordinary roads network’.&#xa0;3.2   ‘The ordinary roads network.’  This phrase comes from DEFRA’s guidelines on the operation of NERC (para 21. The quotation marks are DEFRA’s.)  The quotation marks perhaps indicate that DEFRA’s definition is somewhat tentative.   But it is plain that the paragraph in which the phrase appears, and the subsequent paragraph, are attempting to make a distinction between, on one hand, those tarmacadamed roads upon which the use of motors is essential, uncontentious, and taken-for-granted, and, on the other, those unsealed tracks we know as green lanes.  Our recommendations are directed at green lanes – unsealed rural tracks that are not part of the ‘ordinary roads network’.&#xa0;3.3   First, we recommend that all unsealed rural Byways Open To All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed tracks on local authorities’ Lists of Streets (ie UCRs, UUCRs) be reclassified as Restricted Byways.  This would, at a stroke, eliminate the uncertainty that hovers over the status of UCRs, and would protect from vehicular nuisance and damage those BOATs that survived NERC.  The status ‘restricted byway’ would, if our recommendation is enacted, apply to all unsealed BOATs and UCRs and would preserve the rights of pedestrians, horse-riders, drivers of horse-drawn carriages, pedal cyclists, disabled people using invalid carriages, and motor vehicle users who need access to their properties.  But it would remove the rights of recreational motor-vehicle users.&#xa0;3.4   Secondly, we recommend changes to the way in which the imposition of traffic regulation orders are considered.  At present, if a local authority declines to do anything about a green lane that is wrecked by the activities of 4x4 and motorbike users, and on which the presence of 4x4s and motorbikes compromises the amenity of non-motorised users of the lane, the public have no right of appeal.  We recommend that there should be put in place an appeal process, supervised by an independent inspector, or the Secretary of State, that establishes the merits of cases for and against the imposition of TROs. (Possibly, the appeal could be heard by magistrates.)  Note, however, that the need for TROs would be reduced almost to zero if our first recommendation were to be enacted: if all green lanes were re-classified as Restricted Byways, recreational motor vehicles would, by definition, have no right to use them. &#xa0;3.5  Our recommendations are presented here in summary form.  Other organisations, such as the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), The Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), and the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) are making much more detailed submissions, showing how their proposals fit in with the purposes of the Deregulation Bill.  For the sake of brevity, we have kept our own submission short, but we fully support GLEAM’s, GLPG’s, and PDGLA’s submissions.  For details of the practicalities of the recommendations in our own submission, we refer the Parliamentary Committee to these submissions.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4    Case studies.]]]  One of the studies comes from the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The other two come from the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).  We have selected these cases, from dozens, in order to show: (a) the general difficulties that attend the management of green lanes, (b) the differences between the approaches, and the powers, of National Park Authorities and County Council Authorities – which administer AONBs, (c) the absurdities of the present classification of BOATs and UCRs, and (d) the present unwieldy and costly system of imposing TROs.  &#xa0;4.1  Gorbeck Road.  This is a green lane in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.  It runs for 4 miles between Ribblesdale and Malhamdale through an area of the highest landscape value.  It has never been surfaced from end to end, although at one end, a sealed surface enabling farmers to get to their pastures has been laid for a distance of a few hundred yards. Gorbeck Road has been designated as a substantial part of the ‘Settle Loop’ of the Pennine Bridleway.  Its status is that of a Byway Open To All Traffic – ie a route that has, inter alia, public rights for motor vehicles. The track is subject to very limited, but essential use by farm vehicles in the central section.  The track was extensively used by recreational vehicles.  These vehicles effectively destroyed the track’s central, moorland sections. (See illustration 1.)&#xa0;Illustration 1:  Gorbeck Road, central section, before the eventual imposition of the TRO.&#xa0;Eventually, 4x4s could not get through at all, although determined motor cyclists could.  The track was impassable to cyclists and equestrians for much of its length, and difficult both for walkers and for the farmers who needed infrequent, but necessary access to their pastures.  The National Park Authority takes its statutory duty to preserve the landscapes in its charge – including the duty to preserve such special qualities as peace and tranquillity - very seriously.  It therefore put out to public consultation a proposal to impose a traffic regulation order on the route.  The public’s response was overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal.  Vehicle user groups were vehemently opposed.  A lengthy legal battle ensued.  This included the testing in the High Court of the Park Authority’s use of its new TRO-making powers, conferred on it by NERC. &#xa0;&#xa0;1 Not published here.Eventually, a TRO was successfully imposed, but it took 6 years, and, excluding both the substantial cost of the authority’s staff-time, and the equally substantial cost of the repairs that had to be made, it cost £10,700 in legal fees, public notices, research and consultancy and other matters2.  If Gorbeck Road had been a restricted byway in the first place, none of this would have been necessary.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.2  Deadman’s Hill.  This superb track runs for 6.5 miles from Middlesmoor in Nidderdale, over to Arkleside, in Coverdale.  For most of its length it is a UCR: for part of the way, it is a BOAT. It runs, chiefly, within the Nidderdale AONB: its management, therefore, falls to North Yorkshire County Council.  For many years the noise of 4x4s and motorbikes revving their way over the steepest sections of the route has reverberated around the magnificent head of Nidderdale.  Unsurprisingly, the route’s surface was devastated.  (See illustration 2.)&#xa0;Illustration 2:   Deadman’s Hill, June 2009, before the repairs&#xa0;Despite intensive lobbying by local residents and amenity groups, North Yorkshire Council refused to impose a permanent TRO on the route.  Under pressure, the most that they would accede to was a temporary TRO on just one section of the route, imposed on the ground that this section was out of repair – and that the necessary repairs would be undertaken.  The disruption to peace and tranquillity caused by motors was not considered. The order was imposed for eighteen months, and renewed for a further eighteen.  During the final year of the TRO, repairs, costing approximately £20,000 were made.  The Authority’s plan is to re-open the route to recreational motors in August this year (2013).  Whether the repairs will withstand the hammering that they will be subjected to when 4x4s and motorbikes return, is doubtful.  If the &#xa0;&#xa0;2 Spreadsheet supplied by Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority.  Available on request.Deadman’s Hill route had been classified as a restricted byway, none of the damage and noise could have been produced, and £20,000 of public money would have been saved.  &#xa0;4.3   New Bridge, Birstwith, Nidderdale.  New Bridge is a narrow pack-horse bridge, built in 1820, to cross the River Nidd. (see illustrations 3 &amp; 4.)  &#xa0;&#xa0;Illustration 3:   New Bridge, Nidderdale&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Illustration 4:   New Bridge, Nidderdale&#xa0;The track that crosses the bridge is a mile long.  It is a UCR.  The handsome bridge is too narrow for most 4x4s, but is wide enough for motorbikes, and is regularly used by them, to the dismay of pedestrians, cyclists and horse-riders on this narrow track.  North Yorkshire County Council has no plans to impose a TRO on the route, and it is unlikely that the Council will ever have the resources to undertake the research that will be necessary to determine what rights of way subsist on the route - although it is a fair guess that the route was once used by narrow horse-drawn carts, and is therefore, given the absurdities of highway law, open to modern motor vehicles.  The prospect, therefore, is that this otherwise quiet and beautiful track will indefinitely remain vulnerable to motorbikes, and maybe even to narrow 4x4s.    Again, the re-classification of this route as a restricted byway would save it from the damage and nuisance inflicted by recreational motor vehicles. &#xa0;26 August 2013&#xa0;
