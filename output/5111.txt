[[[Written Evidence Submitted by Asaf Romirowsky, Ph.D. ]]]&#xa0;How oHoe HUNRWA prevents and prevented Reintegration Executive SummaryThe idea of resettlement of refugees in Arab counties was firmly understood to be the only viable approach from 1949 through the early 1950s. This is in spite of countless public pronouncements regarding a balanced approach that would include repatriation, resettlement, and ‘rehabilitation’ or ‘reintegration.’&#xa0;This testimony reviews how the term “reintegration” had been used only once by the United Nations, in September 1948, in connection to the refugees. In the coming years it would become one of the linchpins for the United Nations and other NGO’s who dealt with the Palestinian refugees.&#xa0;Asaf Romirowsky is an historian. He has written extensively about the modern Middle East. His most recent book is Religion, Politics and the Origins of Palestine Refugee Relief (with Alexander H. Joffe, New York: Palgrave, 2013) at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1137378166/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller= . &#xa0;

[[[stion of ‘Reintegration’ and its implications]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948, the reintegration of the refugees into the economic life of the Near East, either by repatriation or resettlement, is essential in preparation for the time when international assistance is no longer available, and for the realization of conditions of peace and stability in the area.
