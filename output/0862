Written evidence from [bold]The Association of British Neurologists[bold] (LTC 86)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Association of British Neurologists and the Royal College of Physicians Joint Clinical Neurosciences Committee, working with the Neurological Alliance has Long Term Neurological Conditions as a high priority given the failure of the DoH to implement the NSF for LTNC and the negative reports last year from the National Audit Office and Public Accounts Committee.

[normal]Our concerns remain high given the on-going uncertainty regarding the commissioning of neurological services. We note that the Commonâ€™s Select Committee intends to concentrate on Diabetes. The overlap with neurological conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain and spinal injury, motor neurone disease and migraine is relatively small.
