[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Zurich
[normal] welcomed the Committee’s Fourth Report on “Cost of Motor Insurance: Whiplash” released on 31
[normal]st
[normal] July 2013. Whilst there were some points upon which we disagreed, we saw the overall response as both balanced and pragmatic. We have also seen Mrs 
[normal]Ellman’s
[normal] letter of 29
[normal]th
[normal] October to the Secretary of State for Justice. We concur that
[normal],
[normal] whilst the Governmen
[normal]t’s own response to the whiplash issue should be broadly welcomed, 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]response 
[normal]did not 
[normal]confirm 
[normal]detailed
[normal] proposals
[normal] and timeframes
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]certain
[normal] key points raised were not mentioned
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We will deal with what we consider to be the key outstanding points in turn
[normal]:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome the 
[normal]TSC
[normal]’s continued engagement and scrutiny in this important polic
[normal]y area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have articulated our concerns and would welcome the chance to discuss these further with members of the 
[normal]TSC
[normal]. We would also express an over-arching 
[normal]concern in terms of timeframes.

[normal]intend to work
