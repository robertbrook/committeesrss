[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[About Scope]]]We all want to live in a world of opportunity – to be able to live our own life, play our part and be valued for the person we are. At Scope we’re passionate about possibility. It inspires us every day and means we never set limits on people’s potential.&#xa0;We work with disabled people and their families at every stage of their lives. From offering day to day support and information, to challenging assumptions about disability and influencing decision makers – everything we do is about creating real and lasting change.&#xa0;We believe that a world where all disabled people have the same opportunities as everyone else would be a pretty incredible place for all of us. Together we can make it happen. &#xa0;Scope welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to this Inquiry. &#xa0;
