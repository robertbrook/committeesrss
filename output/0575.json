"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Space Action \nNework\n (SPAN) comprises university group and institute heads across the fields of Earth Observation, Space Engineering and Space Science. Our joint response to the above consultation is as follows:\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ESA \nprogramme\n is generally very successful with excellent underpinning technological development. It is implemented in such a way as to provide continuity and commitment.  Following a thorough assessment and selection process space missions generally \ngo on to provide a world class in-space capability\n. This continuity is in contrast to that of NASA where political interference and changes of high level policy cause much disruption\n, delay and cost increase\n. Moreover, the selection process involves significant community participation and balances science value with technical/programmatic risk and opportunity.\n A weakness of this assessment and selectio\nn process is that it is slow and \nelaborate with much nugatory work taking place at the expense of the nations.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe mechanism of \nJuste\n retour, in which individual nations receive a large return of their subscription in terms of industrial contracts has been generally effective. While it can sometime lead to an element of compromise,\n or lack of optimization,\n it ensures continued support from participating nations. \nThe increasing size of ESA places additional pressures on the \nJuste\n retour mechanism.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA is technically highly competent and so makes an intelligent customer for the prime contractors and is able to make informed decisions regarding strategic technological developments.\n However, ESA’s \nprogramme\n is small compared with the overall European space \nprogramme\n which gives prime contractors a great deal of power. As a result ESA often defers to the primes position at the expense of nationally funded instrument providers to avoid contract cost increases.\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA’s policy to cover all technical aspects associated with space has led to the creation of its ‘\nCentres’\n (ESOC, ESRIN, ESTEC, ESAC, \n‘Harwell’,\n…). While these are effective they provide services to space missions in a non-competitive environment and so are perceived to be expensive and elaborate. \n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt will be important to align ESA’s space \nprogramme\n with that of the EU, especially in terms of technology and capability development (rather than \nmajor \nspace missions\n which should remain the province of ESA\n). It would be very detrimental in further politicize ESA and \nso \nto introduce to it many of NASA’s weaknesses. However, better cooperation in terms of technological development would avoid duplication \nand funding gaps.\n Non-EU nations (Switzerland and Norway in particular) play an important role in ESA and might be excluded were there to be common governance.  \n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe EU has probably much more to learn from ESA in terms of the implementation of a European space \nprogramme\n than ESA has to learn from the EU.\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA has the best perspective on the needs of the space sector. An independently EU strategy makes little sense – see 2 above. Nevertheless, the EU does provide useful support in this area\n especially with the more focused ERC schemes. However, EU funding is to\n bureaucratically managed.  \n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKSA’s awareness of the particular needs and constraints of the space sector in general and ESA in particular are evident in a more nimble and informed decision making process (e.g. compared with STFC). It only weakly supports early technological development (i.e. non-mission specific) which is currently the responsibility of other research councils (STFC, EPSRC and NERC).   It’s relationship with these bodies will need to evolve so that a more joined-up approach can be established. \nIt should be noted that because of EPSRC’s reluctance to fund space engineering, UK universities are forced to turn to ESA and the EU for support\n in this area\n.\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSo far UKSA has been a success.  \n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK science community benefits very significantly from the ESA space \nprogramme\n.\n It’s missions have made a great contribution to our understanding of processes that shape our Earth and the Universe. European space technology is world class. \n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpace debris and solar activity represent a real threat to the UK’s space-based infrastructure. While the probability of a major incident is low, its potential impact is very high and could be very expensive. The UK should have a clear strategy for reduction and mitigation of these risks and should engage with ESA, the EU and others to maximize the benefits of its \nnational \ncontribution in this area.\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
