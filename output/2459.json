"Written evidence submitted by the Terence Higgins Trust (LAI 0042)&#xa0;\n1. Introduction\n&#xa0;\n1.1 \n              \nTerrence Higgins Trust is the UK’s largest HIV and sexual health charity, with 32 service centres across the UK. We are a campaigning and membership organisation which advocates on behalf of people living with or affected by HIV or poor sexual health.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nWe provide services for people living with HIV to manage their condition and access emotional and practical support. These include one-to-one counselling, peer support groups, health trainers and information and advice covering benefits, housing, fin\nances, employment and immigration. We also deliver community based clinical services, such as \nchlamydia\n screening and rapid HIV testing, and health promotion campaigns and initiatives which target populations most at risk of HIV and poor sexual health. \n&#xa0;\n1\n.3\n              \nTerrence Higgins Trust welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation on Legal Aid. We would urge the government to consider the long term implications of the proposed cuts and seek alternative solutions that will not have such a drastic impac\nt on access to justice. \n&#xa0;\n2. Key recommendations \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Questions\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n \nTerrence Higgins Trust firmly disagrees with th\ne proposal to remove legal aid from prisoners. \nThe treatment of prisoners should be given the same recourse to legal aid and justice as any other citizen\n. Removing access to le\ngal aid and independent review will place individuals at high risk of neglect, potentially reverting precedence through case law in recent years. \n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nCurrent cases often reach court following an attempt to resolve the issue through the prison complaints\n system. If the prison complaints system is unable to resolve a problem there must still be access to the judicial system. Prisoners with HIV, blood borne viruses, STIs or any other health issue need to have access to legal advice and support to ensure tha\nt any mistreatment is raised and dealt with appropriately. \nEqually provision of access to safer sex materials is an ongoing issue in prisons and in a recent response to the Commission on Sex in Prison we have evidence\nd\n the continuing problems in prison wit\nh limited access to safer sex materials. \n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nCases of prisoners requiring legal advice for health related matters are low in number but nonetheless must have recourse to legal aid. \nWe do not believe that an internal prisons complaints system will have \nth\ne robust independent structure that the legal system has and \ni\nnstitutions such as prisons should not be excluded from \nthe checks and balances that the legal system provides. \nIn addition, as prison healthcare is provided by NHS England it would not be appro\npriate for matters to be \ndealt with internally within the prison system when an external organisation is responsible. \nThe NHS should not be\n \nexcluded from the law by \nvirtue\n of the setting\n in which the service is provided\n. \nThe example below explains the \nimportance of legal aid for prisoners and the link with the health care services.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSam was a long term prisoner in a high security prison. \nC\nondoms were in theory accessible on all other wings if prisoners were prepared to line up and ask f\nor one at a time\n from the nurse. However,\n Sam’s wing was separately medically managed from the rest of the prison, by the local Mental Health Trust. Their senior nurse decided that patients on that wing would not be supplied with condoms because he would not condone sexua\nl conduct between what he saw as “vulnerable” prisoners. THT’s arguments that unprotected sexual activity was already happening and in itself leaving people vulnerable to HIV and other STIs did not work until Sam used legal aid to bring a case against the \nprison. Without legal aid, condoms would not have been made available to all prisoners and they would continue to be at risk of poor sexual health and life-threatening diseases.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4) Introducing a residence test\n4.\n1 \nTerrence Higgins Trust strongly \ndisagrees with the proposals to introduce a residence test. Legal Aid is a valuable resource for people in the UK to be able challenge the state and defend their rights. This\n residency test wou\nl\nd\n isolate vulnerab\nle individuals with \na \nvalid need to access t\nhe judicial system.\n For example, individuals who have been refused permanent leave to remain who have a health condition such as HIV and who would wish to challenge the decision on the basis of their ongoing health and wellbeing would no longer be\n able to \naccess legal aid.\n4.2 \nThe needs of asylum seekers should not be \noverlooked;\n whilst it is an improvement to apply the residency test from the date the asylum application is submitted it is still too restrictive and only applies to successful applicants. Given asylum seekers are normally unable to work it would not be representativ\ne of a fair society if they were unable to defend themselves with the relevant legal expertise. It is important to provide legal support \nto people when they need it. \nIndividuals establishing a new life should have the same access to\n fair and equal judgment\n with\n legal support as any other resident in the UK\n. I\nt is entirely unacceptable to provide Legal Aid to someone who has not lived in the UK for decades and to ignore the needs of someone living in the UK and contributing to society.  \n4.3 \nA\nnyone \ngiven \nper\nmission to rem\nain for a specific time period, for example\n until they turn\n18\n,\n would not be able to seek the right to remain permanently as they have not been a reside\nnt for 12 months based on the specifications and requirements of the proposed structure. An\ny child living with HIV who has built a life in the UK should be able to access the support that they need to challenge decisions about their ongoing residency. \n4.4 \nFrom a practical perspective placing the responsibility on the solicitor to establish an i\nndividual’s resid\nency status is also problematic. Proving legal status is often a complex issue and will require specific expertise and additional time and resource. There is a great risk that individuals could be incorrectly prohibited from legal aid if t\nhe provider is unable to gain proof. \n4.5 \nIndividuals will not always have relevant paperwork and there is a risk that discrimination of individuals due to government bodies and agencies mistakes or failure to provide paperwork. There will also be situatio\nns where vulnerable individuals may have had to leave their residence without being able to find papers and evidence of their residency status. \n5. \nAccess to topic experts\n5.1 \nH\naving a solicitor\n who specialises in the\n \nrelevant area of law who\n is able to exper\ntly represent \nthe individual \nto achieve the best possible outcome is essential. The current proposals mean that an individual \nwould not necessarily be able to \nseek out t\nhe best candidate for their case\n. \nIt is in both the state’s and the \nin\ndividual’s\n best\n interest\n to \nbe able to \nchoose\n the most qualified legal aid provider\n. T\nhese proposals wil\nl undermine that and will risk miscarriages of justice in specialised cases\n.\n \n5.2 \nAn example of specialist knowledge would be in a case prosecuting against an individual for the transmission of \nHIV. These cases are rare and \ncomplex;\n they require expert knowledge and understanding of previous cases. \nThere are very few legal aid providers\n with this expertise and access to them should be available across the country. It is essential that there are not geographical limitations. \nProviding an ind\nividual with a\n local legal aid provider would risk a miscarriage of justice. An alternative system \nallowing legal aid providers to register particular expertise at a local and national level would enable individuals to access the most qualified representative. \n5.3 \nIt is unreasonable to expect solicitors to be ex\nperts in all areas of law. \nThe proposals \nrisk wasting public funds if a case is not comprehensively made by the most appropriate solicitor\n,\n with expert knowledge. \nThe proposed approach risks poor representation\n of\n cases and an unjust use of the legal system and its practitioners. \n5.4 \nT\nhere is\n also\n the added risk that individuals will choose to represent themselves. This is highly likely if they do not have confidence in their assigned solicitor’s ability or trust them. For any person living with HIV disclosure is difficult and for this to happ\nen there needs to be a relationship of trust. If an individual’s HIV status is relevant to the case and they do not trust or have confidence in the legal aid provider this will severely jeopardise their case in court. \n5.5 \nThese proposals risk \ncre\nating\n a t\nwo tiered legal system preventing some of the most vulnerable members\n of society to achieve justice.\n&#xa0;\nDavid worked for a major supermarket chain and had done for several years. When he was diagnosed with HIV he was told he needed to go onto treatment immed\niately. He disclosed to his line manager, who gave him three months “gardening leave” to get used to the treatments and his diagnosis. However, at the end of the 3 months, his employer told him not to return as senior managers had decided that his HIV migh\nt deter customers from shopping there, were it publicly known. They went so far as to put this in writing. Despite this being an obvious breach of equality law, the employer fought the case all the way to the day of the tribunal and only settled with David\n that morning. Without legal aid, David would have been unable to pursue the case and without good legal advice he would \nnot have known that the employer was likely to cave on the morning of the trial, having only held out that long in hopes that David wou\nld fear the publicity of a tribunal appearance more than they would.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n6\n To allocate cases according \nto an arbitrary process will not provide a robust and credible legal aid system. With certain cases such as the criminalisation of HIV transmission it requires a particular set of expertise. The cases are incredibly rare and it would be far more credible t\no allocate them on a case by case basis to the most qualified and experienced provider, regardless of location. \n&#xa0;\n5.7\n \nCase allocation should be a combination of provider expertise and client choice. Anything less would risk resulting in cases breaking down\n and miscarriages of justice and grave consequences. One such example is explained below.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTHT was contacted by a man with HIV who, on the advice of his generalist criminal law defender, had pleaded guilty to reckless GBH by sexual transmission. On reviewing the case, it was immediately obvious to us that the requirement for scientific proof of \ntransmission had not been met to the agreed standard. It transpired that his defence had simply asked the prosecution whether the CPS medical report was proof of transmission and they had asserted that it was (when in fact it was not, and has repeatedly be\nen shown in other cases to be insufficient). \n&#xa0;\nAlthough we contacted a specialist lawyer who was willing to represent him in a request to change his plea, the judge refused leave, resulting in the defendant fleeing the country and being sentenced in absent\nia. The defendant later died as a result of lack of access to specialist treatment while on the run. THT also knows of at least two other cases where a defendant was allowed to belatedly change their plea after they were initially gravely misadvised by a g\neneralist criminal solicitor provided by the police.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n Paying for permission work in judicial review cases\n. \nDo you agree with the proposal that providers should only be paid for work carried out on an application for judicial review, including a request for reconsideration of the application at a hearing, the renewal hearing, or an onward permission appeal to th\ne Court of Appeal, if permission is granted by the Court (but that reasonable disbursements should be payable in any event)? Please give reasons. \n6\n.1 \nThis proposal will inevitably prompt cautious behaviour and in turn prevent applications for judicial reviews. \nIt is essential that all individuals, groups and public bodies are equal before the law and answerable to it. \nGovernment bodies and agencies shou\nld be held accountable to the law and \nforced \nto review decisions where\n illogical decisions have been made\n; \nthese proposals\n will stop thi\ns from happening. \n6\n.2 \nWithout \nguaranteed \naccess to legal aid for judicial review it will result in reduced access only \nfor individuals or organisations prepared to take a risk and pay for the cost \no\nf judicial review application is granted. Access to justice should not be based on the ability to pay. Such a system would ostracise the vulnerable in society and result in furt\nher neglect.\n \n7\n.\n Civil merits test – removing legal aid for borderline cases \n7\n.\n1 \nIt is not always clear from the outset what the prospects of a case are and there are examples where whilst the prospects might be low or borderline the public interest and \nconsequence is of high importan\nce. To ignore these cases based \non an initial judgement that they are not likely to succeed is\n \nunacceptable. \nThis is particularly the case of those which just miss the 50 per cent cut off. \n&#xa0;\n7\n.2 There is a lack of clarity on \nhow the likely success of a case will be decided. \nAdditional evidence often comes to light\n through questioning that changes the expected outcome. Making a decision regarding funding prior to a hearing will inevitably prevent some individuals from achieving\n justice simply because they appeared unlikely to succeed.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
