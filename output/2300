EIS 23
[normal]Written evidence submitted by Christian Aid[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1 [bold]Introduction [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1[bold] Christian Aid is a Christian organisation that insists the world can and must be swiftly changed to one where everyone can live a full life, free from poverty. We work globally in 45 countries for profound change that erad
[normal]icates the causes of poverty, striving to achieve equality, dignity and freedom for all, regardless of faith or nationality. We are part of a wider movement for social justice. We provide urgent, practical and effective assistance where need is great, tack
[normal]ling the effects of poverty as well as its root causes.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold]2[bold] 
[normal]This submission sets out Christian Aid’s priority recommendations for the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee to consider in its inquiry into the extractives industry 
[normal]sector.  
[normal]While the terms of reference of this inquiry focus on the impact of the UK extractives industry on the UK economy, we believe that as UK extractive industry companies operate in many countries, including many developing countries, their impact outside the 
[normal]UK should be addressed. There is also a clear moral obligation on the UK as the authority responsible for many of the ultimate parent companies to ensure that companies based in the UK are well regulated and transparent in every country where they operate.
[normal]  Given that the UK is increasingly seeking multinational companies to headquarter in the UK there is a greater force behind this obligation
[normal] and
[normal] we have a duty to other countries to ensure the best possible regulation of these companies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3[bold] 
[normal]In this submi
[normal]ssion the term ‘UK extractives industry’ refers to extractives companies that are listed on the London Stock Exchange, are headquartered in UK or have significant operations within the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4[bold] Christian Aid welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to this inquiry and would be happy to provide follow up written and verbal evidence by request through our Senior UK Political Advisor, Barry Johnston
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. The [bold]contribution of the UK extractives sector to the UK economy and economies in developing countries. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1[bold] 
[normal]The UK’s extractive industr
[normal]y 
[normal]sector as percentage of GDP is among the largest of all developed
[normal] countries, and among the most significant in the EU
[normal].
[normal] In a European context the UK is the E
[normal]uropean 
[normal]U
[normal]nion
[normal]’s largest oil producer and the second largest producer of natural gas
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In 
[normal]2012, 
[normal]there 
[normal]were
[normal] an estimated
[normal] 329 extractive companies listed on the London Stock 
[normal]Exchange
[normal], with a total value 
[normal]of
[normal] £915bn, almost two thirds of Britain’s GDP.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2[bold] 
[normal]The significance of extractive industries in resource rich developing countries is 
[normal]also 
[normal]clear, and indeed increasing. 
[normal]The IMF classifies about twenty
[normal] A
[normal]frican countries as resource rich, as well as being export 
[normal]or fiscally dependant 
[normal]on resource extraction
[normal].
[normal] These countries comprise 56% of Africa’s population and 79.6% of its GDP.
[normal] 
[normal]Resource taxes accounted for an average of
[normal] 40% of total tax collected 2008-11 compared with 35% 2000-2004
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold] 
[normal]The challenges of ensuring revenues from these industries are collected, and then well spent, is similarly clear, and detailed extensively in the 2013 Africa Progress Panel 
[normal]report. 
[normal]The
[normal] report demonstrates that there 
[normal]is no automatic relationship between the extraction of 
[normal]natural resources 
[normal]and 
[normal]equitable growth.
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]ine 
[normal]out 
[normal]of the twelve African countries ranking lowest on the Human Development Index are mineral rich
[normal]. 
[normal]The Prime Minister has
[normal] made it 
[normal]clear that tackling these problems ‘
[normal]needs political will from the developed world too.  We have the tools in our hands to tackle these problems’
[normal]. Given the number of extractives companies listed on the London Stock 
[normal]Exchange
[normal], and therefore subject
[normal] to UK regulation, the UK has a substantial degree of influence 
[normal]in
[normal] regulating the extractives industry worldwide
[normal] and ensuring the population of developing countries benefit from their mineral wealth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]The case for financial transparency and accountab[bold]ility - t[bold]he UK as a centre of excellence for best practice in corporate Governance.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.[bold] [bold]At the G8 Leaders Summit in June the Prime Minister recognised the need for increased transparency and accountably for extractives companies stating that 
[normal]“
[normal]… oil, gas 
[normal]and mining companies should report what they pay to governments, and that governments should publish what they receive, so that natural resources are a blessing and not a curse.”
[normal] 
[normal]There are several tools that the UK, both unilaterally, and as part of inter
[normal]national coalitions, should seek to use to ensure that UK extractive industries are part of the solution to creating thriving, sustainable societies wherever they operate, and not part of the problem.
[normal] 
[normal]The key areas where UK regulation can support developin
[normal]g countries are through transparency and accountability.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] 
[normal]The UK, through support for the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives, has played a key role in new laws that will increase the transparency of payments made by extractive industries to go
[normal]vernments in every country.  This will help citizens in many countries hold their governments to account and begin to tackle some of the problems of corruption in and around extractives projects and developments.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold] 
[normal]This does not go far enough however.
[normal]  Without further information beyond details of payments, it is impossible to place the information on payments in context and go beyond the simple question of what governments are doing with the money they receive, to being able to hold both governments a
[normal]nd companies accountable for the terms under which 
[normal]such 
[normal]revenues are received, to ensure they are both correct and a good deal for citizens. 
[normal]It is increasingly accepted that 
[normal]one sided
[normal] contracts
[normal],
[normal] invariably favouring extractives companies, sharp practices s
[normal]uch as transfer mispricing and the use of tax havens, notably Switzerland in commodity trading, are causing developing countries to lose out on the benefits of the resource boom of the last 20 years
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Country by Country Reporting 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4[bold] 
[normal]That greater 
[normal]transparency is part of the solution is also increasingly accepted.  The International Development Committee and the European Parliament have both endorsed 
[normal]the need for full, public, country by country reporting by multinational companies
[normal].
[normal]  The G8 in Loug
[normal]h Erne also committed to developing a form 
[normal]of country by country reporting,
[normal] however the G8 did not recommend this information be placed in the public domain
[normal].
[normal] There is a clear need for this information to be made public
[normal]. C
[normal]ountry by country reporting will e
[normal]nable citizens to be able to see the full picture of what extractive industries are contributing (or not) to their societies and be able to demand accountability either from governments for poor contract negotiation, or companies for sharp practice.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5[bold] 
[normal]While the G8 has accepted that governments around the world will benefit from country by country reporting, without making such reporting public there does not appear to be any mechanism to ensure that all governments would be able to access such informat
[normal]ion, without either every country making a legislative change to require such information, or through a substantial revision to existing bilateral and multilateral information exchange agreements.  In light of the fact that the G8 has committed to requirin
[normal]g companies to providing country by country reporting, the additional costs of making such reporting public will be minimal. This could result in a win-win for both business and society, and companies could point to this practice to enhance their reputatio
[normal]n. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Beneficial Ownership Transparency 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6[bold] Alongside country-
[normal]by
[normal]-
[normal]country reporting there is also a need for increased transparency of those who really own extractive industry companies.  As highlighted by both the G8 and the Africa Progress Panel the lack of public transparency over who owns extractive industry companie
[normal]s is a serious problem.  In the Democratic Republic of Congo 
[normal](DRC) 
[normal]five mining contracts were awarded to anonymous companies in the British Virgin Islands 
[normal](BVI) 
[normal]at a vastly under market rate and then sold on at market rate to major extractives companies, i
[normal]ncluding some listed on UK exchanges; the estimated cost to the DRC was $1.35bn or twice the health and education budget.  The 
[normal]identities
[normal] of those who owned, and benefitted from the BVI based company remain unknown
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]8[bold] 
[normal]Public registries of the real, beneficial owners would address this problem and not only provide a way to identify those profiting and hold them to account, but also to deter such practices form ever happening.  The UK made improving 
[normal]information about 
[normal]comp
[normal]any ownership a key part of the G8, with the Prime Minister making it clear he publicly supports public registries
[normal],
[normal] which
[normal] the Department of Business Innovation and Skills 
[normal]is now consulting on.  At the Open for Growth summit in London before the G8 some ex
[normal]tractive industries also supported public registries
[normal], this has since been followed by
[normal] t
[normal]he Institute of Directors, the 
[normal]head of the 
[normal]British Banking Association
[normal], the 
[normal]head of tax for the 
[normal]Confederation of British Industry
[normal] and the World Economic Forum
[normal] Council on Organized Crime, all of whom
[normal] 
[normal]have come on in support of pu
[normal]blic registries
[normal], as well as Rio Tinto and the International Council on Mining and Meta
[normal]ls
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Public registries could confer clear benefits on the extractives industry, 
[normal]particularly in the c
[normal]ase of joint ventures where it is becoming increasingly easy for companies to identify who is behind prospective partners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9[bold] 
[normal]Public opinion 
[normal]also 
[normal]favours actio
[normal]n to make MNCs more transparent. 
[normal]A recent Christian Aid poll shows that almost nine out of ten 
[normal]people, 87 per cent - up from 84 per cent in a previous poll believe that multinationals’ accounts should be more transparent and publicly available.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4 Greater Transparency and Accountability: UK a global leader [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1[bold] The 
[normal]government has an obligation to
[normal] set standards and
[normal] enact
[normal] legislation for extractive companies operating in its’ jurisdiction, it must ensure their corporate practices abide by applicable laws and human rights standards and address the capacity of this sector to ‘do harm’. This obligation has been recognised by 
[normal]the Prime Minster who has spoken about the 
[normal]‘duty’
[normal] we have to 
[normal]ensure
[normal] that resource wealth does not fuel conflict
[normal], 
[normal]corruption and crime but 
[normal]is 
[normal]instead a 
[normal]‘blessing’
[normal] to developing countries
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2[bold] The UK must preserve its reputation on upholding high standards
[normal] and must continue to seek to introduce legislation which complements 
[normal]existing
[normal] support for global processes
[normal], 
[normal]including the United Nations Guiding Principle on Business and Human Rights
[normal] (UNGPs)
[normal].   
[normal]With 
[normal]leadership already shown in the extension of the Briber
[normal]y Act 2010, policymakers now need to 
[normal]ensure
[normal] government procurement, investment support and export credit guarantees to UK extractive companies 
[normal]are
[normal] based on high standard
[normal]s
[normal] in business practice and
[normal] a respect for
[normal] human rights 
[normal]standards 
[normal]overseas.  
[normal]Furthermore
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]key 
[normal]new
[normal] legislation nee
[normal]ds to provide access to the UK j
[normal]ustice system for poor and affected communities wh
[normal]en high standards are not met. 
[normal]4.3[bold] Ethical reporting on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) needs to be improved. There is a heavy weighting of extractiv
[normal]e companies on the LSE, however achievements to address their ability to ‘do harm’ has been slow.  It is important therefore to ensure that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is able to hol
[normal]d
[normal] companies to account for their behaviour. Other 
[normal]s
[normal]tock exchange
[normal]s, like the Hong Kong Exchange
[normal],
[normal] already have higher reporting requirements for the environment and human rights. The adoption of similar reporting requirement to that of the Hong Kong Exchange would certainly improve the capacity of the FCA to implement du
[normal]e diligence.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.4[bold] The recently launched government action plan, 
[normal]Good Business Implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Right
[normal] states that the government will continue to help develop, and monitor implementation of OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas.
[normal] 
[normal]Given the poor record of the extractives sector on hu
[normal]man rights, UK companies seeking government support (
[normal]either through financing, insurance  or 
[normal] ‘soft’ support from 
[normal]UK Trade &amp; 
[normal]I
[normal]nvestment
[normal]) for extractives projects should be
[normal] required
[normal] to carry out human rights due dil
[normal]igence as outlined 
[normal]in the UNGPs.
[normal] 
[normal]There mu
[normal]st be a consistent approach across government on business and human rights in relation to the extractives sector
[normal].
[normal] In particular, UK Trade &amp; Investment 
[normal]must be transparent about its promotion of potential extractive projects and should not promote projects
[normal] which pose risks to human rights, where it is not clear how the company concerned proposes to mitigate those risks. 
[normal]4.[bold]5[bold] 
[normal]Finally
[normal],
[normal] we urge the UK government to support and encourage the passage of the new European regulation in two key areas which will imp
[normal]rove corporate transparency and accountability. The first is the Non-Financial Reporting for companies on their supply chains and human rights
[normal],
[normal] and the second is for companies and individuals using natural resources
[normal] to conduct risk-based supply chain due 
[normal]diligence that meets international standards endorsed
[normal] by the United Nations
[normal] and by the OECD. The aim of such legislation would be to ensure that European companies source commodities responsibly and avoid funding conflict and instability or contributing to
[normal] the commission of grave human rights abuses through their purchases.

[normal]We use the term ‘natural resources’ to refer to any raw materials which, through production or trade, may fund or fuel conflict, instability or human rights violations. We consider that the obligations 
[normal]contained within a European regulation (and any particular articles thereof) should apply to any undertaking or natural person, whether or not resident or otherwise present in the European Union, initially placing the covered raw materials, or any product 
[normal]containing such materials, onto the market of any member state. Without prejudice to the generality of the term ‘placing’ in the preceding sentence, this term includes: supply, sale or distribution.
