default1.1default Christian Aid is a Christian organisation that insists the world can and must be swiftly changed to one where everyone can live a full life, free from poverty. We work globally in 45 countries for profound change that erad
defaulticates the causes of poverty, striving to achieve equality, dignity and freedom for all, regardless of faith or nationality. We are part of a wider movement for social justice. We provide urgent, practical and effective assistance where need is great, tack
defaultling the effects of poverty as well as its root causes.

default1.default2default 
defaultThis submission sets out Christian Aid’s priority recommendations for the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee to consider in its inquiry into the extractives industry 
defaultsector.  
defaultWhile the terms of reference of this inquiry focus on the impact of the UK extractives industry on the UK economy, we believe that as UK extractive industry companies operate in many countries, including many developing countries, their impact outside the 
defaultUK should be addressed. There is also a clear moral obligation on the UK as the authority responsible for many of the ultimate parent companies to ensure that companies based in the UK are well regulated and transparent in every country where they operate.
default  Given that the UK is increasingly seeking multinational companies to headquarter in the UK there is a greater force behind this obligation
default and
default we have a duty to other countries to ensure the best possible regulation of these companies.
default&#xa0;
default1.3default 
defaultIn this submi
defaultssion the term ‘UK extractives industry’ refers to extractives companies that are listed on the London Stock Exchange, are headquartered in UK or have significant operations within the UK. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4default Christian Aid welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to this inquiry and would be happy to provide follow up written and verbal evidence by request through our Senior UK Political Advisor, Barry Johnston

default2. The defaultcontribution of the UK extractives sector to the UK economy and economies in developing countries. default&#xa0;default2.1default 
defaultThe UK’s extractive industr
defaulty 
defaultsector as percentage of GDP is among the largest of all developed
default countries, and among the most significant in the EU
default.
default In a European context the UK is the E
defaulturopean 
defaultU
defaultnion
default’s largest oil producer and the second largest producer of natural gas
default.
default 
defaultIn 
default2012, 
defaultthere 
defaultwere
default an estimated
default 329 extractive companies listed on the London Stock 
defaultExchange
default, with a total value 
defaultof
default £915bn, almost two thirds of Britain’s GDP.
default 
default&#xa0;default2.2default 
defaultThe significance of extractive industries in resource rich developing countries is 
defaultalso 
defaultclear, and indeed increasing. 
defaultThe IMF classifies about twenty
default A
defaultfrican countries as resource rich, as well as being export 
defaultor fiscally dependant 
defaulton resource extraction
default.
default These countries comprise 56% of Africa’s population and 79.6% of its GDP.
default 
defaultResource taxes accounted for an average of
default 40% of total tax collected 2008-11 compared with 35% 2000-2004
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3default 
defaultThe challenges of ensuring revenues from these industries are collected, and then well spent, is similarly clear, and detailed extensively in the 2013 Africa Progress Panel 
defaultreport. 
defaultThe
default report demonstrates that there 
defaultis no automatic relationship between the extraction of 
defaultnatural resources 
defaultand 
defaultequitable growth.
default 
defaultN
defaultine 
defaultout 
defaultof the twelve African countries ranking lowest on the Human Development Index are mineral rich
default. 
defaultThe Prime Minister has
default made it 
defaultclear that tackling these problems ‘
defaultneeds political will from the developed world too.  We have the tools in our hands to tackle these problems’
default. Given the number of extractives companies listed on the London Stock 
defaultExchange
default, and therefore subject
default to UK regulation, the UK has a substantial degree of influence 
defaultin
default regulating the extractives industry worldwide
default and ensuring the population of developing countries benefit from their mineral wealth. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultThe case for financial transparency and accountabdefaultility - tdefaulthe UK as a centre of excellence for best practice in corporate Governance.default&#xa0;default3.1.default defaultAt the G8 Leaders Summit in June the Prime Minister recognised the need for increased transparency and accountably for extractives companies stating that 
default“
default… oil, gas 
defaultand mining companies should report what they pay to governments, and that governments should publish what they receive, so that natural resources are a blessing and not a curse.”
default 
defaultThere are several tools that the UK, both unilaterally, and as part of inter
defaultnational coalitions, should seek to use to ensure that UK extractive industries are part of the solution to creating thriving, sustainable societies wherever they operate, and not part of the problem.
default 
defaultThe key areas where UK regulation can support developin
defaultg countries are through transparency and accountability.  
default&#xa0;
default3.2default 
defaultThe UK, through support for the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives, has played a key role in new laws that will increase the transparency of payments made by extractive industries to go
defaultvernments in every country.  This will help citizens in many countries hold their governments to account and begin to tackle some of the problems of corruption in and around extractives projects and developments.  
default&#xa0;
default3.3default 
defaultThis does not go far enough however.
default  Without further information beyond details of payments, it is impossible to place the information on payments in context and go beyond the simple question of what governments are doing with the money they receive, to being able to hold both governments a
defaultnd companies accountable for the terms under which 
defaultsuch 
defaultrevenues are received, to ensure they are both correct and a good deal for citizens. 
defaultIt is increasingly accepted that 
defaultone sided
default contracts
default,
default invariably favouring extractives companies, sharp practices s
defaultuch as transfer mispricing and the use of tax havens, notably Switzerland in commodity trading, are causing developing countries to lose out on the benefits of the resource boom of the last 20 years
default.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultCountry by Country Reporting 
default&#xa0;
default3.4default 
defaultThat greater 
defaulttransparency is part of the solution is also increasingly accepted.  The International Development Committee and the European Parliament have both endorsed 
defaultthe need for full, public, country by country reporting by multinational companies
default.
default  The G8 in Loug
defaulth Erne also committed to developing a form 
defaultof country by country reporting,
default however the G8 did not recommend this information be placed in the public domain
default.
default There is a clear need for this information to be made public
default. C
defaultountry by country reporting will e
defaultnable citizens to be able to see the full picture of what extractive industries are contributing (or not) to their societies and be able to demand accountability either from governments for poor contract negotiation, or companies for sharp practice.  
default&#xa0;
default3.5default 
defaultWhile the G8 has accepted that governments around the world will benefit from country by country reporting, without making such reporting public there does not appear to be any mechanism to ensure that all governments would be able to access such informat
defaultion, without either every country making a legislative change to require such information, or through a substantial revision to existing bilateral and multilateral information exchange agreements.  In light of the fact that the G8 has committed to requirin
defaultg companies to providing country by country reporting, the additional costs of making such reporting public will be minimal. This could result in a win-win for both business and society, and companies could point to this practice to enhance their reputatio
defaultn. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBeneficial Ownership Transparency 
default&#xa0;
default3.6default Alongside country-
defaultby
default-
defaultcountry reporting there is also a need for increased transparency of those who really own extractive industry companies.  As highlighted by both the G8 and the Africa Progress Panel the lack of public transparency over who owns extractive industry companie
defaults is a serious problem.  In the Democratic Republic of Congo 
default(DRC) 
defaultfive mining contracts were awarded to anonymous companies in the British Virgin Islands 
default(BVI) 
defaultat a vastly under market rate and then sold on at market rate to major extractives companies, i
defaultncluding some listed on UK exchanges; the estimated cost to the DRC was $1.35bn or twice the health and education budget.  The 
defaultidentities
default of those who owned, and benefitted from the BVI based company remain unknown
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.default8default 
defaultPublic registries of the real, beneficial owners would address this problem and not only provide a way to identify those profiting and hold them to account, but also to deter such practices form ever happening.  The UK made improving 
defaultinformation about 
defaultcomp
defaultany ownership a key part of the G8, with the Prime Minister making it clear he publicly supports public registries
default,
default which
default the Department of Business Innovation and Skills 
defaultis now consulting on.  At the Open for Growth summit in London before the G8 some ex
defaulttractive industries also supported public registries
default, this has since been followed by
default t
defaulthe Institute of Directors, the 
defaulthead of the 
defaultBritish Banking Association
default, the 
defaulthead of tax for the 
defaultConfederation of British Industry
default and the World Economic Forum
default Council on Organized Crime, all of whom
default 
defaulthave come on in support of pu
defaultblic registries
default, as well as Rio Tinto and the International Council on Mining and Meta
defaultls
default.
default 
defaultPublic registries could confer clear benefits on the extractives industry, 
defaultparticularly in the c
defaultase of joint ventures where it is becoming increasingly easy for companies to identify who is behind prospective partners.
default&#xa0;
default3.9default 
defaultPublic opinion 
defaultalso 
defaultfavours actio
defaultn to make MNCs more transparent. 
defaultA recent Christian Aid poll shows that almost nine out of ten 
defaultpeople, 87 per cent - up from 84 per cent in a previous poll believe that multinationals’ accounts should be more transparent and publicly available.

default&#xa0;
default4 Greater Transparency and Accountability: UK a global leader default&#xa0;
default4.1default The 
defaultgovernment has an obligation to
default set standards and
default enact
default legislation for extractive companies operating in its’ jurisdiction, it must ensure their corporate practices abide by applicable laws and human rights standards and address the capacity of this sector to ‘do harm’. This obligation has been recognised by 
defaultthe Prime Minster who has spoken about the 
default‘duty’
default we have to 
defaultensure
default that resource wealth does not fuel conflict
default, 
defaultcorruption and crime but 
defaultis 
defaultinstead a 
default‘blessing’
default to developing countries
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.2default The UK must preserve its reputation on upholding high standards
default and must continue to seek to introduce legislation which complements 
defaultexisting
default support for global processes
default, 
defaultincluding the United Nations Guiding Principle on Business and Human Rights
default (UNGPs)
default.   
defaultWith 
defaultleadership already shown in the extension of the Briber
defaulty Act 2010, policymakers now need to 
defaultensure
default government procurement, investment support and export credit guarantees to UK extractive companies 
defaultare
default based on high standard
defaults
default in business practice and
default a respect for
default human rights 
defaultstandards 
defaultoverseas.  
defaultFurthermore
default,
default 
defaultkey 
defaultnew
default legislation nee
defaultds to provide access to the UK j
defaultustice system for poor and affected communities wh
defaulten high standards are not met. 
default4.3default Ethical reporting on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) needs to be improved. There is a heavy weighting of extractiv
defaulte companies on the LSE, however achievements to address their ability to ‘do harm’ has been slow.  It is important therefore to ensure that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is able to hol
defaultd
default companies to account for their behaviour. Other 
defaults
defaulttock exchange
defaults, like the Hong Kong Exchange
default,
default already have higher reporting requirements for the environment and human rights. The adoption of similar reporting requirement to that of the Hong Kong Exchange would certainly improve the capacity of the FCA to implement du
defaulte diligence.
default&#xa0;default4.4default The recently launched government action plan, 
defaultGood Business Implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Right
default states that the government will continue to help develop, and monitor implementation of OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas.
default 
defaultGiven the poor record of the extractives sector on hu
defaultman rights, UK companies seeking government support (
defaulteither through financing, insurance  or 
default ‘soft’ support from 
defaultUK Trade &amp; 
defaultI
defaultnvestment
default) for extractives projects should be
default required
default to carry out human rights due dil
defaultigence as outlined 
defaultin the UNGPs.
default 
defaultThere mu
defaultst be a consistent approach across government on business and human rights in relation to the extractives sector
default.
default In particular, UK Trade &amp; Investment 
defaultmust be transparent about its promotion of potential extractive projects and should not promote projects
default which pose risks to human rights, where it is not clear how the company concerned proposes to mitigate those risks. 
default4.default5default 
defaultFinally
default,
default we urge the UK government to support and encourage the passage of the new European regulation in two key areas which will imp
defaultrove corporate transparency and accountability. The first is the Non-Financial Reporting for companies on their supply chains and human rights
default,
default and the second is for companies and individuals using natural resources
default to conduct risk-based supply chain due 
defaultdiligence that meets international standards endorsed
default by the United Nations
default and by the OECD. The aim of such legislation would be to ensure that European companies source commodities responsibly and avoid funding conflict and instability or contributing to
default the commission of grave human rights abuses through their purchases.

defaultWe use the term ‘natural resources’ to refer to any raw materials which, through production or trade, may fund or fuel conflict, instability or human rights violations. We consider that the obligations 
defaultcontained within a European regulation (and any particular articles thereof) should apply to any undertaking or natural person, whether or not resident or otherwise present in the European Union, initially placing the covered raw materials, or any product 
defaultcontaining such materials, onto the market of any member state. Without prejudice to the generality of the term ‘placing’ in the preceding sentence, this term includes: supply, sale or distribution.
