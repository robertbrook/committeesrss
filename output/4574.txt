[[[Executive Summary]]]This report shows that, despite individual successes, academies overall have done little to narrow the gap for disadvantaged pupils. i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to look at the impact on attainment of reduced numbers of disadvantaged pupils;ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to question assumptions that GNVQ Intermediate, and subsequently BTEC, is worth four C grades at GCSE. Consequently it would be misleading to assume that academy status provides a solution for low achieving primary schools. Rather, these schools should be assisted to improve professional understanding and practice, develop meaningful curriculum, enrich children’s experience, raise confidence and self-esteem, and relate more to parents and communities.

[[[ommissioned research]]]1)Official evaluations were conducted annually by PwC (published 2004-8, based on the previous summer’s exams). Even when the exploitation of alternatives to GCSE had become a public scandal, PwC reports continued to take ‘equivalence’ at face value. Moveover, whilst recognizing that the proportion of disadvantaged pupils had reduced, these reports failed to factor this into calculations on attainment and improvement. Even so, the later reports raised some serious doubts, concluding that ‘rather than a simple uniform Academy effect, there has been a more complex and varied process of change.’ The final (2008) report recommended that academies should report attainment for sub-groups of pupils such as FSM or EAL. 2) Comparisons with the predecessor school in the month before closure, often affected by demoralisation, also exaggered improvement claims; comparisons with earlier years would have been more valid. 3) The 2007 National Audit Office report had similar flaws. Nevertheless, hidden behind the positive style and presentation, it conceded that academy status had had less impact than other programmes such as Excellence in Cities. One chart showed that academies had improved no faster than the predecessor schools had in the three years before closure. 4) The 2010 National Audit Office report admitted an inability to identify which features of academies might be causing improvement (p20), simply wide variations (p18). Improved attainment had not come from academies’ disadvantaged pupils  (pp27-8);  in fact the gap had risen (p6). The apparent success of academies depended largely on alternative qualifications (pp21-2). 5) The most recent official report (Rutt and Styles, NFER, 2013) also acknowledged that academies’ success depends substantially on ‘equivalents’. It concluded that, for GCSE-only data without ‘equivalents’, academy pupils made less progress between KS2 and KS4..    6) Most of the commissioned research has been flawed because it failed to take into account the exceptionally high use of alternative qualifications (‘equivalents’) or the reduction in disadvantage.  ‘Equivalents’ 7) In order to encourage vocational qualifications in a target-driven school system, they had to be matched with GCSE grades. In the process, considerable distortion was created by declaring that GNVQ Intermediate equated in quality to a C grade, and, in quantity, that one GNVQ was worth

[[[ as much]]] as a GCSE. (From now, I use GNVQ as shorthand for GNVQ Intermediate. GNVQ has since been replaced but the problem repeated with BTECs.)8) Given that ‘five or more A*-C grades’ was the key performance indicator, this enabled schools to substitute one GCSE plus one GNVQ for five GCSEs. Academies have exploited this far more than other schools. Even when it was decided that this should include English and Maths, schools were able to count English, Maths and one GNVQ as five GCSEs. GNVQs were eventually phased out but the 1=4 problem continued with BTEC. 9) The problem was evident from the start. Many pupils in the earliest academies were categorised as ‘five A*-Cs’ on the basis of a GNVQ in computing plus a grade C in art or PE, for example. This would not count as successful secondary education in other European countries. Although the inclusion of English and Maths made the indicator more reliable, pupils with English, Maths and one other subject continued to classify as successfully educated. Academies in particular expanded the teaching time for English and Maths and narrowed the curriculum.10) Enquiries revealed that even Ofsted had made no attempt to ascertain whether the ‘equivalence’ was well founded, in terms of quality (C equivalence) or quantity (1=4). My investigation showed that half of pupils passing GNVQ Science, supposedly worth C or above at GCSE, only obtained D or E grades in GCSE Maths; by comparison, over 90% of pupils with a C or above in GCSE Science achieved a C or above in GCSE Maths. The result was similar when GNVQ Computing was compared with GCSE Maths. 11) Substituting spuriously ‘equivalent’ qualifications is damaging to pupils for various reasons. They probably have less ‘street value’ than GCSEs, both in terms of employment and continuing education, and provide a poorer foundation for A-level.  Changing pupil populations12) Whatever the reasons, it is statistically irrefutable that poverty is associated with lower academic achievement. One imperfect but convenient measure of poverty is free school meal entitlement (FSM). The statistics show that FSM pupils are only half as likely to achieve five or more A*-Cs or equivalent with English and Maths. (In 2011, the official measure of disadvantage was expanded to include looked-after children, though statistically these are few of these compared to FSM.)13) Some of the early academies vigorously removed pupils who seemed unlikely to achieve five A*-Cs, even with equivalents. Some academies excluded large numbers of pupils, or p encouraged parents to take their children elsewhere to avoid exclusion. In other cases, expensive school uniform drove poorer families away. One of the first 12 academies reduced its FSM pupils from 51% to 11%; the sports equipment alone cost £130 and families were told that computers with broadband were required.  Though this was an extreme case, many academies substantially reduced the proportion of FSM pupils. 14) In other cases, the change in pupil population was achieved through expansion: the academy was able to attract new pupils from outside its traditional catchment, partly as a result of impressive new buildings. Parents who deliberately change their child’s school are likely to be supportive and aspirational. This is impossible to register statistically. However, when additional pupils are non-FSM, one can reasonably expect them to be as successful as non-FSM pupils nationally: it is inappropriate to continue comparing the academy’s results with those of the predecessor schools as if the pupil population were unchanged. 15) Official evaluations, while recording the fall in FSM pupils, have failed to factor this into their evaluations of attainment, i.e. they have not compared like with like, falsely attributing improved performance to academy governance. 16) It should also be noted that, by around 2007, more schools with modest levels of disadvantage were becoming academies, and the prior (KS2) attainment of academy entrants was rising towards the national average.

[[[: emerging problems]]]17) Drawing on official data, my research has scrutinised attainment figures regularly from 2006 to 2012. Like PwC, I consistently excluded academies in their first year of operation, as one can scarcely ascribe GCSE results sat in June to the fact that the pupils’ school has been an academy for 10 months. Unlike PwC and most other officially commissioned evaluations, I have attempted to take into account the impact of Academies’ heavy use of alternative qualifications. In one study I estimated how much of an academy’s apparent improvement results from having fewer disadvantaged pupils than its predecessor school.  18) Since GCSE results across England have increased annually, I have adjusted the raw data for academies and non-academies alike in order to measure real improvement. (This is rather like an economist explaining what £100 in 1990 is worth ‘in today’s money’.) 19) My research began with the June 2005 results, i.e. the 12 academies which opened in September 2002 or 2003. It was already apparent that official claims were misleading: the dramatic increase in five A*-Cs ‘or equivalent’ was almost entirely due to non-GCSE certificates. One indicator was how many pupils actually had C or ‘equivalent’ qualifications in five or more subjects. 2002 predecessor schools: 24% shown as 5 or more A*-Cs ‘or equivalent’ whilst 20% qualified in five or more subjects.               2005 academies: 37% shown as 5 or more A*-Cs ‘or equivalent’ whilst only 22% qualified in five or more subjects.                                                           In other words, very little real improvement (20% to 22%). Emphasis was beginning to be placed on the inclusion of English and Maths, but this also showed very little improvement - from 14% in 2002 to 15% in 2005.Academies did considerably better at English and Maths in the 2006 results, reflecting a concerted drive, but reliance on ‘equivalents’ remained high. 20) Close analysis showed that even the higher achieving pupils in academies tended to have a narrow curriculum. For example, looking at their most successful 42 percent of pupils (i.e. those gaining five or more A*-Cs or equivalent): This loss of breadth appears much greater than in most other schools. 21) Academies entered 13 times as many pupils for GNVQ as their predecessor schools: on average 1.3 entries per pupil compared with 0.1 per pupil. Some pupils were entered for the notional equivalent of 20 different subjects.  22) Based on the 2007 results, I scrutinised the changing pupil populations. Reduced numbers of FSM pupils were factored into the analysis. Alternatively, where academies had attracted more non-FSM pupils than their predecessor schools – the consequence of new buildings, recruitment drives in surrounding areas, etc. -  an assumption was made that these pupils should be as successful as non-FSM pupils nationally, since there was no good reason to judge their performance in terms of the pupils who had attended the predecessor schools. 23) This produced a more accurate evaluation of gains linked to academy status – ‘academy effect’. In the most extreme case, an apparent improvement of 22 percentage points was entirely accounted for by factoring in the change in pupil population. Adjusted improvement statistics ranged from +19 percentage points to -27, averaging at 0. It should be noted that this was a separate calculation and did not take into account the impact of replacing GCSEs with GNVQs. &#xa0;

[[[The current situation]]]24) As noted above, recent NFER research based on 2012 results has recently confirmed that academies rely substantially for their apparent improvement on ‘equivalent’ qualifications. Improved DfE statistical presentation had already enabled me to do so based on the 2011 examination entry. The DfE now provide GCSE-only figures and also discrete data for disadvantaged pupils. 184 academies were open by September 2009 i.e. long enough for a cohort of pupils to have completed Key Stage 4 while at the academy before taking GCSEs in June 2011. Unless otherwise stated, the following analysis is based on these 184 academies. (This date also means, of course, that Coalition academies, with different characteristics, are not included.)Academies, failing schools and disadvantage25) First of all, it is important to question the stereotype that pre-Coalition academies generally replaced low achieving schools in disadvantaged areas. The earliest  and most disadvantaged, 44 opened by September 2006, have an average 33% of pupils with FSM entitlement - well above national average but average for major conurbations such as Manchester, Birmingham or inner London. Of all pre-Coalition academies (open by September 2010), only half can claim to replace ‘failing schools’, according to the predecessor schools’ results a year before closure and on the ‘floor target’ criterion; around a third do not fit the disadvantage stereotype, due to a selective intake or few FSM pupils. GCSE and ‘equivalent’ qualifications26) In 2011, 48% of academy pupils (i.e. academies open by Sept 2009) gained five or more A*-C grades or equivalents including English and Maths, but only 35% based on GCSEs only - a difference of 13 percentage points. In mainstream maintained schools across England, the comparative figures are 59% ‘with equivalents’, 53% by GCSEs alone, a difference of 6 percentage points. In other words, academies rely twice as much on alternative qualifications. The difference between ‘with equivalents’ and ‘GCSEs only’ in individual academies spreads evenly from 0 to 45 percent points (even 70 in one case). The difference is more than 20 percentage points in a fifth of academies. 27) The current Secretary of State has loudly denounced ‘gaming’ (i.e. exploitation of alternative qualifications) to inflate exam success. It seems ironic that academies are the worst offenders. 28) It is evident that ‘equivalent’ qualifications do not equate with good GCSE grades. Many academy pupils with E-G grades in GCSE Science or Maths are deemed to have obtained the ‘equivalent’ of A*-C via an alternative qualification. Although some awards (e.g. Engineering) do signify a wider vocational curriculum, most are easier versions of popular GCSE subjects (Science and ICT are the most frequent, followed by Business.)   Disadvantaged pupils29) DfE statistics from summer 2011 analyse attainment specifically for disadvantaged pupils. These are almost all FSM-entitled pupils but also include looked-after children. 34% of  disadvantaged pupils in academies obtained five or more A*-C grades or equivalent with English and Maths – the same proportion as in non-academy schools. 30) However academies are less successful on GCSEs-only (24%, compared with national average 28.6%.) Although academies tend to have more disadvantaged pupils than other schools, disadvantaged pupils gain little from attending an academy.  31) Only in the oldest academies (open five years or more) is GCSE-only attainment better than national average, but marginally (30% as opposed to 28.6%, i.e. a benefit to only 1 disadvantaged pupil in 100). There is also enormous variation among these older academies (a third score less than 20%). Pupils with low prior attainment32) A separate analysis looks at pupils entering secondary school with KS2 attainment below level 4 (the bottom fifth by prior attainment). Even with ‘equivalents’, only 6.9% of them reach 5 A*-C nationally, 7.6% in academies. This suggests that attending an academy helps only 1 in 100 pupils with low prior attainment to catch up. Data for pupils with Level 4 KS2, and those with above Level 4, are slightly worse in academies than elsewhere. In other words, achievement at age 16 relates almost entirely to achievement at age 11, regardless of the type of school. Chains33) Major sponsors do not appear to be any more effective. Firstly there is considerable variation, between major sponsors and within each chain. Secondly, although disadvantaged pupils tend to do slightly better under major sponsors than in other academies, their attainment is still lower than in non-academies. Thirdly, the reliance on ‘equivalents’ is high, and very high in some chains and academies. In half the chain academies,  20% or fewer disadvantage pupils achieved five or more A*-Cs with English and Maths by GCSE only. The floor target34) An arbitrary figure, the ‘floor target’ (now being raised annually), has been used to signal potential closure and academisation. On this criterion, one out of seven existing academies should be considered for closure. This is also true among longer established academies. Furthermore, many other academies would only escape because of their heavy reliance on ‘equivalents’.  Without this, more than 1 in 3 academies might be a candidate for closure. Do academy pupils receive a rounded education?35) Over-reliance on ‘equivalents’ is limiting the curriculum. Of a smaller sample chosen for close scrutiny, only 12% sat History or Geography (cf 57% in other schools). Only half as many pupils as elsewhere took a creative arts subject. Only a third as many as elsewhere took a language (14% cf 40%). Only 10% took a Design and Technology option. In order to meet English and Maths targets, these academies were entering most of their pupils twice each year starting in Year 9.  36) Using the newly announced Ebac as a criterion (albeit problematic), only 8% of academy pupils passed this, half as many as in non-academies. In a third of academies nobody achieved Ebac in 2011.  Is the situation improving? 37) Three in five academies appeared to have improved more than other schools; a fifth showed no trend and another fifth a decline. However in most of these cases the apparent improvement was due to ‘equivalents’, or was already occurring in the years before academy conversion. Consequently only one in five academies could attribute improvement to being an academy – the elusive ‘academies effect’.
