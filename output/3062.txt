[[[ Oliver ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]

[[[ MP]]], Minister for Government Policy&#xa0;Questions 402-466&#xa0;

[[[Q402]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] I welcome the Minister for Government Policy for the Cabinet Office to this session on complaints handling in Government, and the role of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  We are undertaking a dual inquiry; we may or may not produce two separate reports about those two topics.  I particularly thank you, Minister, for joining us today, because we struggled to find a Minister in the Government who would take responsibility for complaint handling across Government.  You have gamely stepped up to the crease, but perhaps for more of an exploratory discussion about future policy; we are not going to hold you personally responsible for the way complaints are conducted across Government, because that is not your role.  Can I ask you to identify yourself for the record, please?  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, Oliver Letwin, Minister for Government Policy.&#xa0;

[[[Q403]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Could I start by asking you, now you have given it some thought, what you think about the effectiveness of leadership across Government on the question of complaints handling?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: The first thing I should say is I welcome the fact you are investigating this issue.  My impression is that there are processes and procedures for handling elaborate and serious complaints, which certainly lead to the resolution of individual complaints in an orderly fashion in the great majority of cases.  However, until very recently, there had not for many decades been any very serious attention paid to the question of how we use complaints to improve service delivery.  I think that is the main issue.  The Francis report brings that out pretty clearly in relation to the health service, under rather extraordinary circumstances.  Your work and the work that Ann Clwyd and her colleagues have been doing on the Health Service and the Law Commission Board, and the consideration that the Parliamentary Ombudsman herself has been giving to all this, converge with my own thinking on it.  My impression is that we have an opportunity here over the next little while to take a new direction and try to get the public services as a whole, not just the Government but right across the public sector, to take complaints as a huge potential mine of information and feedback about service delivery, and to find ways of actually using that information effectively to improve service delivery.  I am intending to drive that forward myself.

[[[Chair:]]] I bring in Mr Halfon at this point, because unfortunately he has to leave for another commitment.&#xa0;

[[[Q404]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Robert Halfon:]]] Do you think there are too many ombudsmen?  There is a Housing Ombudsman, a Health Ombudsman, a Local Government Ombudsman, and a Parliamentary Ombudsman.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I should preface this, as almost everything else I am going to say, by saying that Government is a collegiate process.  The final decision the Government makes about these things has to go through the process of Cabinet Committees, agreements, clearances and so on.  My personal view is that there is a great deal of merit in trying to thin down what is described in one of the reports that has been done as “a complaints maze”.  Part of that is to take very seriously the recommendation of the Parliamentary Ombudsman herself—that there should be some amalgamation of ombudsmen.  We will have to think through that all very carefully and consult an awful lot of people.  This is not the sort of change one should contemplate making in a matter of minutes as a sheer administrative fiat.  Evidentially, there is a lot of work to be done, but I am certainly attracted by the idea.  &#xa0;

[[[Q405]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Robert Halfon:]]] If you had one single body that citizens could approach directly when they believed that the various agencies of the state had not performed, do you think that would be feasible?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: We need to look very closely at whether it is feasible at a minimum.  If we do not do that, we need to find a way in which the citizen does not have to navigate the landscape but can just can go to one place, one website, or one part of one website, and make their complaint in a straightforward way, rather than having to work out whom they should be making this complaint to.  &#xa0;

[[[Q406]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Robert Halfon:]]] Do you think role of the MP would change if, for example, there was a failure of the CSA?  The citizen, instead of going to the MP to act as a broker, would go directly to a Government Department, who would then try to resolve the problem.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: In the whole of this, we are going to have to have quite serious discussions with colleagues across the House about questions of how this affects Parliament and its relation to Government, and MPs and their relations to constituents.  These are serious things that need to be thought through.  My sense is that we live in a world in which people are going to approach their MPs pretty much regardless of whatever else we do.&#xa0;

[[[Q407]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Robert Halfon:]]] Isn’t one of the reasons for that that the existing complaint mechanisms are currently not performing?  The reason why they go to the MP is because they know that it will be looked at properly.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I think there is probably a certain amount of that, yes.  However, if we get to the point that I hope we can get to, where it is much simpler and clearer for the citizen to complain about something directly to the public services, we should not delude ourselves that that will mean people will be less inclined to approach MPs.  I think they will still approach MPs, and it is right that they should be able to, and it is inevitable that, if MPs take things up, those things will be taken even more seriously than if they do not, which is as it should be.  The fact that people can approach MPs, though, should not allow us to neglect the fact that at the moment we do not have a fully satisfactory system for people to approach directly.  I certainly think it is the case that, if we had a system that was more responsive and easier to access, there would be fewer cases in which people had a legitimate grievance to take to their MP.   &#xa0;

[[[Q408]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Robert Halfon:]]] If there were a single complaints body, whether it was a Government Department or semi-independent, do you think it should be a body of last resort or first resort?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Now I see what you are saying.  This takes me to the fundamental point.  I would like to find a way—and as a result of the Committee having drawn my attention to this, I am proposing to conduct a review with this in mind—to find a way of getting to the point where public services, both the local end of them and the regional and national apparatus, regard complaints not as nuisance to be dealt with or a problem for an individual to be resolved, though it obviously will continue to be that, but as a massive source of information.  If used intelligently, that information would inform how to improve the service either locally, if patterns are developing locally, or systemically, if patterns are being observed across the system.  I would like to ensure the norm is that, if someone finds that something is not working in a sensible way, they can go somewhere very easy to get to and register it, and if the point they are making is sensible and corroborated by others who are making similar points, the particular service, or part of the service, takes that up, does something about it, and changes it.  They do not need to go anywhere near the Ombudsman or MPs or whatever.  That is where I would like to get to. &#xa0;

[[[Q409]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Robert Halfon:]]] So, if they had a complaint about their hospital, you are saying that the hospital should first deal with the complaint properly. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: If somebody has an individual complaint against a hospital, it is much the best thing that the hospital deals with it properly.  The individual feels it has been dealt with properly, and that is the end of that.  If it is part of a pattern, the hospital should observe that, understand what pattern it is revealing, and address the problem so that later people do not complain about it because it no longer exists as a problem; that is surely what we want to achieve.  

[[[Chair:]]] Can I just interrupt for a second?  We are going to come on to improving public services through complaints later on, if you are happy to leave it there.  I will just bring in Mr Hopkins.&#xa0;

[[[Q410]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] It would be wonderful if MPs did not have to deal with all these problems and they went directly to public services, national or local.  Our case workload would drop and we would have nicer lives.  Certainly in my constituency, though, my role is actually as a village scribe for people who are not very effective at representing themselves.  They come to us because they get a professional service.  They are not just sorting out their thoughts and putting them in a logical order and making a good case.  Also, the weight of the MP being involved makes a difference to the response.  Isn’t that inevitable?  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.  I do not think we should delude ourselves that whatever we do will be enough to mean that nobody will ever want to complain to their MP.  People will want to go to an MP for all sorts of reasons.  One of them is indeed that kind of help, which all of us I suspect give to our constituents.  It is indeed also the case that, if you have a very serious problem and people have not been addressing it, you hope, and I hope you would be right to hope, that the MP involving themselves will get it even more seriously looked at than it would be otherwise. However, I would like to get to the point where things can actually be simply explained to the service in question by the person who is not getting whatever it is that they have a right to expect.  It is simply explained to them with a minimum of fuss and bother for the complainant, taken seriously and addressed, so that the number of cases in which you need to go through a more formal process of whatever kind it might be, MP, ombudsman or whatever, reduces.   &#xa0;

[[[Q411]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] Just as a supplementary to that: if one has a problem with one’s local hospital’s orthopaedics department, for example, and you get three, four or five complaints about that department, the MP can then raise it with the chief executive or the hospital board or whatever as a problem with their department.  If individuals are complaining, only the hospital itself would know rather than some outside organisation knowing that there are a lot of complaints about a particular department.  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I agree.  I have certainly had the experience as a constituency MP, as I am sure you have, that at a certain point, when you have received three, four or five similar complaints about the same thing, alarm bells begin to ring and you arrange a meeting with the chief executive or whatever, exactly as you say.  That is a very useful function, but there is something very wrong with the state of affairs if a pattern like that is building up.  If the chief executive is not being made aware by the orthopaedics department that it is building up, and there is no system for doing that, no action is therefore taken to investigate and cure the problem.  My concern as a member of a Government that is trying to make the public services better—get more for less—is to make sure we change the culture so the fact that five people have complained to the orthopaedics department is not regarded as a bore but, on the contrary, as a vital indication that there is something that needs putting right, and as an incredibly useful piece of information about what needs putting right that then gets acted on.  That is a really fundamental change of culture.  I am at the foothills of this, because I need to bring people in from around the world and quiz them about this, but as I understand it, the leading-edge firms in dealing with customers have discovered ways of mining complaints as an incredibly useful form of customer feedback.  Indeed, I think there is a good deal of evidence from the papers I have been reading in preparation for this that those companies that do that have better performances get higher market shares and greater growth, because they are more attractive to customers.  The public services need to be like that too.  We need to ensure that we are using that information so we improve quality.  If we are doing that, then we would not get to the point where the MP had to be the person who spotted the pattern; the public service itself would have spotted it before the MP ever got to it.  I would like to get to the point where, if I wrote to the public service and said, “I have had five constituents who complained about that,” they wrote back and said, “Yes, we know that.  We have been looking at it for weeks.  We have already made the following changes to make sure you do not get a sixth.”

[[[Chair:]]] Minister, like me, once you get this point, one becomes messianic about it.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, I am afraid I am slightly messianic.&#xa0;

[[[Q412]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] I fully sympathise and am very glad to hear what you are saying, but this suggests that you certainly see your role as looking very seriously at the whole question of complaint handling across Government as a policy question.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, I am afraid you have had the effect of stirring me into action on this.

[[[Chair:]]] Excellent.  To what extent do you think the Cabinet Office currently sees itself responsible for ensuring good complaint handling across Government?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: We have to take responsibility for doing just that.  Let me make it clear that I do not at all think that the Cabinet Office or anyone else at the centre of Government can possibly manage whole systems.  In fact, that would defeat my entire purpose.  I want to create a culture within which, through services, and ideally right at the ground level, complaints are welcomed and used so that they do not have to be run from somewhere on top.  However, whatever system, or systems, we set up for doing that then has to be invigilated and monitored to see whether it is working, where it is and is not working, and that is the role I envisage for me and the Cabinet Office.     &#xa0;

[[[Q413]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] As the Ombudsman told us, this is a “classic ministerial job”.  She said, “There are quite a few Ministers in the Cabinet Office these days, and one of them should be responsible for looking across Whitehall at how data from complaints could be aggregated and collected more systematically and acted on more efficiently, and how consumers—our customers and clients—should be able better to report complaints.”

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Correct.  I spoke to the Ombudsman a few weeks ago, and I spoke to her again yesterday, and I assured her that I intended to take on exactly that role.&#xa0;

[[[Q414]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Will this change the relationship between the Cabinet Office and the Government Department to a degree?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I do not think it will change it.  I do not think there is one at the moment. 

[[[Chair:]]] What an admission.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: My impression is that for decades complaints have been handled according to systems that have evolved.  I do not believe there has been a serious effort at cross-Government level to try to make sure that we change the culture of the public sector in such a way that it sees complaints as useful.

[[[Chair:]]] This is really good progress, because we are coming from a blank sheet of paper.  The Cabinet Office declined to submit any evidence to this inquiry because it did not feel it had any responsibility.  That was the institutional response, I think.  However, what you are saying is already heralding certainly a change in attitude, which may lead to a change in policy, accepting that you have not today changed policy.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q415]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] Can I just ask you to highlight what the essential features of this new culture would be—this change in culture?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: What happens at the moment broadly is what the Francis report brought out very clearly: while there are certainly systems for dealing with complaints, and they are undoubtedly proper and serious, they just deal with the complaint.  They do not use the information that you could glean from that and other complaints to lead people who are actually responsible for delivering service x in place p to make the improvements that you would make if you used those complaints properly.  That is the change in culture I would like to make.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] And this should permeate the system.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]

[[[:]]] Yes.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] It should not be just at top level.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Absolutely not, no.  Incidentally, and I suspect this is true of Governments across the world—I doubt we are unique in this—one of the reasons why this is quite complicated and has never been on the agenda is that there are many different kinds of complaints that ought to be dealt with at many different levels.  If there is, as you were suggesting, a problem in the orthopaedics department of a particular hospital, the right place to deal with that is in the orthopaedics department of that hospital.  The chief executive of that hospital should be dealing with it.  It should not be something that someone in London has to deal with.  If there are problems in orthopaedics departments all over our system, however, or indeed while we are at it, in every Job Centre, and they are of the same sort, then that suggests there is a systemic problem.  We need a system that means that, where those pieces of information are disaggregated, they get properly aggregated.  Someone sitting in the relevant place in Whitehall says, “Oh, my goodness, there is something going on here that is going on across the system, which indicates we have got a problem with policy or regulation or some other system-wide problem that cannot actually be dealt with by the individual services, and therefore we must make a system change.”  We need both of those. 

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] It is very helpful in highlighting personal responsibility.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q416]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Before you carry on with your line of questioning, can I just press you on this, Minister?  When you make a complaint to BT, you can complain to the chief executive.  The chief executive’s office is in fact a very large office—in fact, it is a call centre dealing with complaints.  Isn’t there a case for a Government Department or a single Government Agency?  When somebody has a complaint, it starts in such a call centre.  You get a named individual who then looks after, monitors and collects data on your complaint.  Obviously, it has to be dealt with at hospital level and departmental level, but if you do not ultimately get satisfaction, you finish up with that same person, who will tell you whether they have done all they can.  The complaints process needs to be independent.  At the moment, if you complain to a hospital, you have to go to something called PALS.  I do not think patients believe that their PALS services are particularly independent.  As we learned from Mid Staffs, they are not, and that needs to be looked at.  Isn’t there a case for some kind of central call centre facility that would give the citizen, first, a very easily navigable system and, secondly, something that would give them a good service for their complaint?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I absolutely agree with you, as I was saying to Mr Halfon a moment ago, that this needs to be easily navigable for the citizen.  I also absolutely agree that the citizen should not have to go chasing for the place where they are meant to make the complaint.  There should be some easy way of getting into the system and making a complaint.  We live in an age of enormous technological advance, in which I doubt that you need to have some great warehouse with thousands of people in it to enable this to happen.  The wonders of the internet can allow the thing to be virtual, and yet to be single from the point of view of the complaint.  I completely agree with you, however, that the net result of all that, however we structure and design it, should be that, when Mrs Jones rings up because she has a problem because her hip has been incorrectly dealt with, or somebody is applying for Jobseeker’s Allowance and has not been appropriately dealt with, they have the opportunity to register that complaint with a human being.  They can work with the human being to get that complaint resolved.  I think if we get this right, the human being who has been helping on that makes sure that the complaint is used properly by the system to create change that prevents it happening again.  I am sure we can achieve all that without creating new Government Departments or new warehouses or anything, because the wonders of technology should enable us to do that.&#xa0;

[[[Q417]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] Can you just summarise for us what information the Cabinet Office garners in relation to complaints, and how you use the information?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I do not think we do, and that is what we need to do.  At the moment there is the complaints forum under the aegis of the Permanent Secretary of the DWP.  It meets several times a year, and there is a process for making sure that complaints have been looked at in a timely fashion.  There is, of course, the Ombudsman and reports to Parliament and so on, but I do not think that anybody across the system as a whole is looking to see whether complaints are being used properly to achieve improvements.  I think that is what we need to invent a system for doing.    &#xa0;

[[[Q418]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] To whom is that forum accountable just now?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: The forum is accountable to the Permanent Secretary of the DWP.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] Dame Julie Mellor said the forum was necessary but insufficient.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, I agree with her.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] So, your relationship with the forum is minimal.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I should explain that I have had absolutely no relationship with this subject whatsoever until your Committee stirred my interest in it.  It has not been a matter of policy, as far as I know, for any Government in recent recorded history.

[[[Chair:]]] The previous Select Committee did make some recommendations to Government, which I think resulted in the forum, but it clearly has not had the cultural change. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: It has not achieved the cultural change that I am talking about; let me testify to that.  What you have interested me in is whether we can achieve that kind of cultural change.  I think we ought to be able to.&#xa0;

[[[Q419]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] Complaints, therefore, are focused at Department level, and they are asked to account for the complaints handling that they have proceeded with.  Is there anything more they can do to increase transparency and openness in complaints data?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I would be very interested to see what the Committee recommends about that.  We will take whatever recommendations there are very seriously.  I think it is very important that we do not get submerged in a bureaucratic process response to this issue where we make some minor adjustments to the way in which something is published.  I am trying to engineer a fundamental culture change about complaints.  At the moment, you can improve the processes all you like, but there is very little sense across the public sector that complaints are incredibly useful.  That is not how they are seen at the moment.&#xa0;

[[[Q420]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] Your objective is a simple and straightforward system to get rid of the complexity and bureaucracy.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] Very laudable.

[[[Chair:]]] Please can it start with a single email address and phone number?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.  It has got to be something where the citizen somehow can get into the system without having to search for lots of different places to find out whom to complain to.  They can then get that registered and can get hold of a human being who will take it seriously from then on.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] We wish you well on your quest.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: After three years of dealing with Whitehall and the public services, I am not so naïve as to assume that this is an easy thing to do.  This is a difficult thing to do.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] A challenge.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, it is.  At the same time, it seems to me thoroughly achievable because, as the Chairman was pointing out, there are lots of large, complicated companies that regard this as mission critical, and have learned how to do it better than we do it.  I am sure that as we think through it we will find not only challenges and difficulties but also some things are fairly straightforward to mend.&#xa0;

[[[Q421]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] So you are looking at the private sector and the practice there?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Exactly.  We will have to ask people around the world who are best at doing this—maybe other Governments, if there are some, other public sectors or private companies—how they do it.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel; we can learn from them.  Incidentally, let me just bring to the Committee’s attention that, in the course of all of this, I have been working with the behavioural insights team.  They have brought to my attention something called Resolver, which is a website that customers can get hold of and will then do things on their behalf.  It is beautifully simple, and indicates the sort of thing that we could do.  As the Committee will be aware, Francis Maude has been hugely active in getting gov.uk into a completely different space where people can actually get hold of it and can get things from it.  If we put these two things together somehow, we can certainly find a way where something customer friendly is sitting there that you can get hold of, and that will keep track of what has happened to your complaint and the response to it.  One thing I am sure of is, however we deal with this, the only way the culture change will occur is if there is sufficient transparency of result so that the people inside the system know that people outside the system will know whether they are actually changing the system when they need to change it to prevent complaints going on about a particular subject.   &#xa0;

[[[Q422]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] Are you aware of any excellent practice in a Government Department already that can be rolled out?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I am not, but one of the things I need to review is not only what lessons we can learn from outside the Government and public services, but also what lessons we can learn from within, because I bet there is some group of heroes somewhere who are trying to do something.

[[[Lindsay Roy:]]] I am sure there will be.

[[[Chair:]]] We must move on.  &#xa0;

[[[Q423]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] A very quick example: the last Government went to great lengths to abolish community health councils.  It was fairly obvious that it was the private sector coming to the health service that did not want this independent body complaining about them.  That is what it was about.  PALS was then substituted in its place.  I am deeply suspicious of the drift of Government over the last decade and more in these matters.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I suspect that, if there was a drift, it was because of the mistaken idea that complaints are somehow a danger.  They are something to be used and are a real value.

[[[Chair:]]] We want more complaints.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Ultimately, we want no complaints, because we want a perfect service.  However, where there is imperfection, we want to know about it, and we want to make sure that knowledge reaches people who can do something about it.  We want it to be sufficiently transparent left, right and centre so that people then do something about it.  That then reduces the need for complaints.

[[[Chair:]]] Excellent.&#xa0;

[[[Q424]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Alun Cairns:]]] I think the Minister has answered exactly where we need to get to, but how we get there is part of the question.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, which is not at all easy, I agree.  Incidentally, I know that the majesty of Parliament and so on is all very formal.  You are going to produce a report; I will review and so on.  I hope we might be able to institute some kind of more ready dialectic as we go forward.  I am confident that as we proceed I am going to have a whole series of issues arising, both about re-engineering complaints handling and about ombudsmen, that require some interaction with Parliament.

[[[Chair:]]] I have just told my clerk that you are going to help us draft our report, and her hair is now standing on end.  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]

[[[:]]]  I am sure I am not allowed to do that.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]]  I am sure that we will find a way of making sure that we produce a report that is helpful.  Usually when I say we are going to produce a helpful report, I say that with some trepidation.  Genuinely, this time, though, I think we are going to be able to produce something that we think is helpful and you might think is helpful. &#xa0;

[[[Q425]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Alun Cairns:]]] For the record, community health councils still exist in Wales, in one part of the UK, and maybe the system is not as you might have hoped.  I am not suggesting for a second that the system is perfect, where CHCs exist.  &#xa0;Mr Letwin, you mentioned to Mr Roy a little bit earlier the need for a cultural change.  What analysis have you done of staff attitude when a complaint has been raised?  It strikes me that the complainant has to approach a monopoly organisation.  Firstly, there is the organisation itself that is responsible for the failure of the service and, secondly, they have to approach that same organisation, as I suggested as a monopoly, in order to pursue it.  Therefore, staff attitude, because it is a monopoly organisation, is often under question.  What analysis have you made of that?   

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: That is one of the things we need to look at very carefully in our review.  It is not the case now, mercifully, that by any means all public services are monopoly organisations.  This has been one of the main thrusts of the present Government.  Many of them are now competing to attract patients, pupils or whatever it may be, as I think is highly desirable, or indeed are competing to retain or renew franchises for payment-by-results services or other services in Government.  Therefore, it is very much in their interest, if we get things right, that they pay attention to the complaints and use them to improve their services, because that will attract patients, customers, pupils or whatever it may be.  It will also enable them to demonstrate a better service if they are seeking a renewal of a contract or a franchise.  I hope we can get these incentives aligned so that, rather than treating the complaint as something that someone who has to come to you has registered, it is instead treated as a useful piece of information about how to attract that person to come back again.  I accept that there are parts of the public service that are, and inevitably will remain, monopolies.  We are not going to have competing police forces.  If you are complaining about the activities of parts of the public service that are a monopoly, we have a particular issue.  That is, we have to find ways of giving the individuals who are dealing with the complaint the same kind of incentive that they ought already to have in those parts of the public service that are competitive.  I accept that is a particular challenge.   &#xa0;

[[[Q426]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Alun Cairns:]]] How radical would you consider being in that situation then?  In those organisations we have talked about, which I described as monopolies, would you consider outsourcing the complaint system so it is not the same people dealing with it?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Interestingly, both through the ombudsmen and through the Independent Police Complaints Commission and other such bodies, previous Governments have indeed done that to some degree or other.  Typically they have done it with very serious complaints that have reached a certain level.  I am saying something here very close to what the Chairman was talking about a little while ago: I think we ought to be able to come up with some arrangement that means that, right from the beginning—the very first time you complain—you have someone helping you with that complaint who is not bound into the system so much that they are defensive.  On the contrary, it is somebody who is there to help you get the complaint dealt with, and indeed to learn the lessons of it. &#xa0;

[[[Q427]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Alun Cairns:]]] Finally, very briefly, would you say something about training and culture?  You talked earlier, in response to Mr Roy, about the need to change the culture, and of course training will be a key element of that.  What activities have taken place up to now, or what plans are there to try to improve that experience for the complainant?   

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: We will also need to look at that, but my experience in the last three years has been there is a dreadful tendency in Whitehall—it is maybe true of all large organisations—to imagine that the way you change the culture is that you have more training seminars.  Unless the system creates the right incentives and the right processes, the training itself will not solve the problem.  Once we have the right system in place, I quite agree that making sure people know how to use them properly is useful and important.  &#xa0;

[[[Q428]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Can I just press you on that last point?  It is very relevant to the report we produced on the Civil Service in September.  Leaving aside the main recommendation, which the Prime Minister has already said he disagrees with, our report was very much about attitudes and behaviours in the Civil Service and in Whitehall generally.  A great deal of system change is implemented without even talking about the behaviour and attitudes that lead the existing system to be less functional than it should be.  Unless we talk about behaviour and attitudes, and indeed culture, very often system changes do not actually achieve anything, because everybody carries on behaving in the same way.  What is your reaction to that?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: What I am talking about here is entirely a matter of trying to get people to change their behaviour.&#xa0;

[[[Q429]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] How can you change people’s behaviour unless you have means of challenging attitudes and behaviours, or surfacing or talking about behaviours and attitudes?  Training is quite an important way of doing that in any large organisation.  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, but my view, and indeed the Government’s view, is that you can change attitudes if you change the arrangements of the way in which a particular service is conducted so that the people who are performing that service have a different set of incentives.  Part of the point of our school reform, for example, is to change the attitude—the culture—inside a school by arranging things so that the people who are running that school and those teaching in it have certain kinds of incentives and are exposed to certain kinds of public scrutiny, competition and so on.&#xa0;

[[[Q430]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] How important is the leadership in that process?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Crucial.  

[[[Chair:]]] So, you are bringing in a different kind of leadership.  Isn’t that correct?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: The headteacher of a school, or the chief executive of a hospital or the captain of ship or whatever, is absolutely crucial.  That is leadership.  If that person is not endowed with the power to make change, they cannot lead.  If they do not have the appropriate incentives, they will not lead in the right way. 

[[[Chair:]]] What you are saying is institutional change is about enabling and empowering the right kind of leadership.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, but it goes beyond that.  In this instance, for example, going back to what you were raising earlier, we are talking about whether we can create a set of arrangements in which pretty automatically, when a complaint comes in, somebody is dealing with it who actually wants to get an answer, and get the right kind of answer.  Of course, that person might have to be trained, but unless there is somebody who is in that position in the first place and the system is arranged so that there is, the complaint will continue to be handled with the current behaviour and attitude, which is: “This is a complaint; I must handle it properly and deal with it,” but not, “Here is a very useful piece of information.  I must use it to create a service improvement.”  &#xa0;

[[[Q431]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Don’t you think there are some organisations that implement new complaint systems, but, because the leadership of those organisations is still not really interested in the complaints, there is no cultural change in that organisation that leads to a better complaints culture?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Absolutely.

[[[Chair:]]] So, in fact you have to tackle the leadership of Government Departments on this question of complaints, haven’t you?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, but we have got to create an arrangement in which there is an incentive for people right from the top to the bottom to take these things seriously and to use them properly.&#xa0;

[[[Q432]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] What kind of leadership do we have in Government Departments that has been so uninterested in this question for so long—that has brushed off all the various recommendations by the Law Commission and the now defunct Administrative Tribunals Council or from Which? or from the predecessor Committee in the last Parliament?  Why do you think the leadership has been so resistant to all these very positive suggestions that you are now very much welcoming?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I suspect that the system as a whole is being bombarded with complaints, and complaints are something that have to be dealt with.  So much attention has been paid to dealing with them in a proper way, registering how they have been dealt with and how long it has taken to deal with them, and whether the proper process has been gone through, that nobody has stepped back and asked themselves whether this is the right attitude.  &#xa0;

[[[Q433]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] But how easy is it for a relatively junior official being besieged by complaints to take bad news up the system and say, “We have got a real problem here”?  How easy do think that is in our present system?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I do not know yet, because I have not investigated it yet.  My hunch, which I suspect is also your hunch, is it is not easy at all at the moment.  We need to change that.

[[[Chair:]]] Is that not a cultural, leadership and attitude problem, not a systems problem?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I suspect both.&#xa0;

[[[Q434]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] I think we will tempt you onto the right territory in the end, but I think this is a very interesting conversation.  Incidentally, have you had a chance to read our report about the future of the Civil Service and how to reform it?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, I have.

[[[Chair:]]] Are you allowed to give us your reaction to it?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: No.

[[[Chair:]]] Right.  Moving on to the MP filter.&#xa0;

[[[Q435]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] There has been a lot of debate about the MP filter over a long period, and quite a lot of pressure for getting rid of it, but it has been retained so far.  What is your view of the MP filter?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: This is not something that I can decide personally for Government; it is obviously a very serious issue that we will have to discuss in Government and come up with a collective view about.  Also, however, I think this is something that the House will probably want to take a view about in some way.  I do not think it is something the Government would want to change without a consensus in the House.  Therefore the Committee may also have a profound influence on what happens.  

[[[Chair:]]] We have a consensus in this Committee.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I am delighted to hear that.  My personal view is, given that the Ombudsman herself does not think, as I understand it, that this is a necessary feature on the scene, and given that the Law Commission has recommended that we should not have it, we have to take those things very seriously.  My personal impression is that all too often the MP signature is a cipher, so that MPs are now very regularly signing off on these things.  Therefore, whatever utility it may have been judged to have had some way back I suspect is now much diminished.&#xa0;

[[[Q436]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] Would one solution be to perhaps have a tick-box, so that when people are making complaints to the Ombudsman, they can tick “I want the MP involved” or not?  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: That is a very interesting proposal.  What the Committee proposes about this will be taken very seriously. 

[[[Kelvin ]]]

[[[Hopkins]]]

[[[:]]] Some people want the MP to be involved because it adds weight to the complaint.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.

[[[Kelvin ]]]

[[[Hopkins]]]

[[[:]]] Rather than the MP acting as a filter and a restraining force on complaints, they could actually reinforce and support the complaint. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, I completely see that.  That is a very different relationship.  There is no doubt that our 600-plus colleagues will have views about this, and they need to be listened to.&#xa0;

[[[Q437]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] Personally, I would like to see it.  On another issue, I am really concerned about this independence.  I heard on the Today programme this morning a strong case by a Police Commissioner from Yorkshire for having police complaints dealt with by a completely independent body, and no doubt others heard it as well.  With what is going on at the moment, there seems to be a very strong case indeed for independence.  What prospects do you think there are for a single complaints portal, particularly in Government?  It strikes me that, over the last 16 years, some Government Departments have been much better than others at dealing with complaints, responding to letters and so on.  If there is a single complaints portal, they can actually make comparisons and approach Permanent Secretaries and say, “Your Department is not up to the mark on these matters.  What about improving?”

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.  I think we absolutely have to have some single portal.  That is what I meant by a virtual place.  &#xa0;

[[[Q438]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] With a degree of independence; it would not just be part of, say, your Department, and a case of not putting too many complaints in “because we do not want to upset the Civil Service” or “we think the citizens are complaining too much”.  It needs a degree of independence so that it is genuinely representing the citizens rather than just bouncing the citizens away to protect the Civil Service. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.  I think we have to find some means of ensuring that, first of all, there is one place you go to—one portal, in your terms.  Secondly, when you get there, we need to ensure there is a human being at the other end who is your friend, so to speak, in trying to get your complaint through the system and out the other end, both with a resolution for you and the ability to take the lesson of that complaint, when allied to other complaints, to the level required to get effective action to remedy the problem that pattern of complaints has revealed.  I see this portal and the people associated with it, however we design that, as people who are trying to get the most out of the complaint for you and for the service.&#xa0;

[[[Q4]]]

[[[39]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] The portal of the people leads to the Big Society, does it?  I am trying to see this picture that you building up.  The portal of the people is an exciting phrase that sets my pulses racing.  We are seeing a vision of the portal of the people that leads us on to the sunlit uplands of the Big Society.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I am a profound advocate of the Big Society, but I am talking here about public services specifically.  I hope this portal leads to the citizen actually being able not only to get quick, effective remedies but also to make sure that the information conveyed by that is conveyed in an intelligent way back into the public services and used to improve things.&#xa0;

[[[Q440]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] Fine, yes.  I am just trying to get the imagery right.  It is a bit Marxist at the moment, I think.  You are involved with China, I know.  I am sure they have a portal of the people.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I do not think there is anything Marxist about it.  If I were running an enterprise that is trying to serve 60 million people, I would want to make sure that I learned as much as possible from the thousands of them who complain each year.  That does not seem to me either Marxist or capitalist or any other ist-ism; it is just plain common sense.

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] We will see how far you have succeeded in your three and a half years possibly at a later stage.  Sorry for interrupting.

[[[Chair:]]] Have you finished, Mr Hopkins?

[[[Kelvin ]]]

[[[Hopkins]]]

[[[:]]] Yes, but I may come back later.&#xa0;

[[[Q44]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Before we leave the MP filter, it seems that, overarching the ombudsmen and complaint systems throughout Whitehall, we could establish a set of principles on how complaints should be handled and how complaints bodies should operate.  One of those should be surely that a complaints body should be able to investigate or instigate an inquiry without necessarily receiving a complaint.  This is something the Ombudsman complains that she does not have.  You should also be able to receive complaints from people within the organisation as well as from clients of that organisation.  The IPCC cannot receive a complaint from a police officer, which seems a little odd.  The IPCC cannot investigate, for example, the Plebgate problem because nobody has complained to the IPCC about Plebgate.  That seems to be an absurd system of complaint handling, doesn’t it?  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: We certainly need to look at that.  I am currently proposing to run two parallel reviews.  One, on the question of how we handle complaints.

[[[Chair:]]] You are making an announcement.  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Am I?  Fine.

[[[Chair:]]] Yes.  You are announcing two reviews.  Carry on.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, I am.  This is not very big news; it is just little old me sitting in the Cabinet Office doing some work.  One, to look into the question of how we make better use of complaints and use them to achieve both redress for the citizen and improvement in service delivery; the other, to look at this question of the ombudsmen landscape.  Clearly one of the recommendations that has been made by various parties in relation to the ombudsmen landscape is this question of whether the Ombudsman should have the power to instigate a process, even if nobody has approached the Ombudsman and asked them to do so.  We will have to look at that very carefully, its consequences, and how we handle those consequences.    &#xa0;

[[[Q442]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Finally on the filter question, how consistent is it that the Ombudsman herself can receive complaints directly from people complaining about the Health Service but not the rest of the Government Service?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: We need to look at all those questions together.  I intend that we should look at what this Committee recommends and what the Law Commission and the Ombudsman herself has recommended.&#xa0;

[[[Q443]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] It is frequently said that the Ombudsman will be overwhelmed with complaints if they were not filtered by the MPs.  The MPs do not filter the health complaints, however, and the Ombudsman is not overwhelmed with complaints.  How compelling an argument would you regard that to be?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I think it is a very serious argument and one that, as I understand it, the Ombudsman herself has made.&#xa0;

[[[Q444]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Alun Cairns:]]] Can I just pursue the single portal, and ask about the risks of whether we believe that to be the obvious solution? Managing expectations would be something of a challenge, whereby if there was a single portal for every service, it would simply lead to, in the early stages at least, a very unmanageable situation where tens of thousands of complaints were being made.  The immediate reaction would be a feeling of being let down because the resources were not available to pursue them individually. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I do not see why that needs to be the result at all.  Obviously, we have to think this through very carefully, but, as I said right at the beginning, we are in a completely different age from that in which our current systems were designed.  In the old world, in order to have one place that you went to, you had literally to establish a very large place.  Then you had to have people who wrote physical letters that were delivered by the postal system to this place.  Then you had people sitting in this place.  It was a very elaborate thing.  Nowadays, it does not work like that.  It is perfectly possible to have people widely distributed around the system, but all of whom can be approached by the citizen user of the public service by going into one place in the internet and saying, “Here am I, and I have this problem.”  The whole trend of the work that Francis and the Government Digital Service and so on have been doing is towards enabling citizens to go onto one thing, gov.uk, and obtain all possible Government services and make all possible Government transactions with the maximum of ease.  They are making enormous progress.  We are still well behind where we would like to be and there is a lot of work to do, but it is an enormously fast moving scene.  We need to re-engineer the complaints process so that it matches those, just as it is now going to be much easier to get a passport or to apply for Universal Credit or whatever.  We need also to make it much easier to make a complaint and get it taken seriously.  That is perfectly doable.  Obviously, we do not want to create new layers of bureaucracy and machinery.  We just want to use the power of technology to get to a sensible position.  

[[[Alun ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]

[[[:]]] Thank you.

[[[Chair:]]] Ministerial correspondence is the way MPs complain to the Government about Government.&#xa0;

[[[Q445]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] Your Department has set a target, or it was the previous Government’s target—you had a bonfire of targets, of course—of replying to MPs’ written correspondence within 20 days.  How is that going after the bonfire?  Has something emerged from the ashes that is even better than 20 days?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I am not responsible for ministerial correspondence rules in the Cabinet Office.  You would really need to talk to Francis Maude about that, as the Minister for the Cabinet Office.&#xa0;

[[[Q446]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] We have actually done a bit of job creation for you, because I think we have discovered many tasks that you did not have.  There was a great trawl through the whole of Government to find out who was responsible, and you were the one that came forward.  So, if you check again, do you think perhaps someone else will be responsible for it?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: No, ministerial correspondence, as I understand it, is the responsibility of the head of each ministerial Department.  

[[[Chair:]]] But you are Minister for Policy.  We might invite you to include the policy on ministerial correspondence in your review of complaints handling, because it is absolutely key to the way MPs make complaints about their constituents—on behalf of their constituents.  Sometimes we complain about our constituents, but I mean on behalf of our constituents.   &#xa0;

[[[Q447]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] The Cabinet Office in the old dark days of the previous Government that you always blame for everything used to report annually on the handling of Members’ correspondence by Ministers.  It does not happen now.  How is that an improvement?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: As I say, I am not responsible for that Department policy, so to speak—that part of policy.  If the Committee is asking me to take an interest in the question of whether we should have a different policy on handling ministerial correspondence, and that is what the Committee reports, I will take that perfectly seriously.  It seems to me that that is separate from the question of individual service complaints.  To the extent that it interlocks with it, if an MP is trying to raise a particular complaint on behalf of a particular constituent about the operation of a particular public service in relation to that constituent, then I think it reconnects with what I am talking about, and the review that I am talking about will certainly need to look at that—definitely.  If you are talking about the very great range of correspondence from MPs to Ministers about many different subjects, that is quite a different subject.  &#xa0;

[[[Q448]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] Would it be part of your duty to advise your fellow Ministers if they are about to be interviewed by the police to conceal a tape recorder so that the event can be recorded?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: No, that is not part of my duties.&#xa0;

[[[Q449]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] The Big Society you mentioned; how is that going?  A triumph, or has it died of embarrassment?

[[[Chair:]]]  You can have one question on this.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I think the Big Society, which has incidentally been a feature of our nation’s life, thank goodness, for as long as this nation has been alive, is alive and well and flourishing. 

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] No, further than that.  It goes back to Jesus Christ, we were told by the Prime Minister. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: It does indeed.  

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] You are understating the case so far.  It goes back 2,000 years at least.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: At least.  The Big Society is about individuals coming together to support one another and to advance one another’s wellbeing, and in so doing to advance their own interests as well.

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] And it has reached a glorious climax in the last three years in some way that perhaps is not entirely obvious.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I am delighted that you feel that way.

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] No, I am just asking.  There was a question mark at the end of that.  Has it?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: My view is that we have done many things to help the Big Society to flourish in Britain.  For example, we have created a whole new world of finance for Big Society initiatives of various kinds, with Big Society Capital and many other elements of financing.  &#xa0;

[[[Q450]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] For big projects we have to go to China, because people will not invest in big projects here.  Is this part of the Big Society—including the Communist regimes in things?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: The Big Society is about trying to enable communities to act together in their own interests.  We have taken a whole series of steps, not just in relation to the financing of those initiatives but also in relation to giving communities more powers to take action on their own behalf.  For example, neighbourhood planning; the community right to bid and to own.  We have taken a whole series of steps to try to promote the ability of local communities to come together and act in their own interests and on behalf of all those who are part of it.  

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] Can I ask—

[[[Chair:]]] Last question, Mr Flynn.  This is an indulgence.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]

[[[:]]] I do not believe this is anything whatsoever to do with the question of complaint handling.  &#xa0;

[[[Q45]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] Could you compare what you were saying with the debate in Parliament last night, which referred to the devolution deniers in Departments?  Wales has had the first power since the year 940; Hywel Dda introduced some very good, progressive laws, which I commended to the Big Society.  This is the first time that Wales has had the power to introduce laws, and about a half a dozen have been introduced, and every one of them has been obstructed by your centralised Government.  Two of them were taken to the High Court and failed.  

[[[Chair:]]] What is your question, Mr Flynn?

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] The question is: aren’t you really acting in reverse of the Big Society and becoming a more centralised Government, and society is still becoming as polarised as it was before, with the rich becoming richer and more powerful, and poor becoming less powerful?

[[[Chair:]]] Yes or no?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: No.&#xa0;

[[[Q452]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Before we leave the question of ministerial correspondence, can I just point out that a lot of letters to Ministers are about individual service complaints.  For example, letters to Ministers about the failures of treatment at Mid Staffordshire.  You may or not be aware that local Members of Parliament in that respect are very concerned that somehow Ministers’ officers did not pick up what was going through Ministers’ offices.  Isn’t that a good case for including ministerial correspondence in your inquiries about how complaints are handled at departmental level?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: As I was saying, where the correspondence is about specific service failure, yes, abundantly, we certainly need to do that.  I am distinguishing between that and the vast mass of political and other correspondence between Members of Parliament and Ministers, which is quite a different thing.

[[[Chair:]]] I quite agree.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I absolutely agree, of course.  Where there is a pattern of complaints that, among other things probably, has reached the point where MPs are writing to Ministers about them, in the scope of what I am talking about, we clearly need to pick that up and use that information as well.  &#xa0;

[[[Q453]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] I know there is a little bit of politics around this subject—about what correspondence went through Ministers’ offices with regard to Mid Staffs.  Would it not be a good investigation to do a lessons-learned exercise, because even if it was the Secretary of State or the Minister’s fault, it would certainly be officials’ faults as well that this was not picked up.  There was obviously a systemic or cultural issue, or a perception about where accountability lies, which led to missing this question.  Will you investigate this as part of your inquiry?  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes, I think we should look at that.  We should also look at other examples of patterns that are missed or picked up and try to identify what we can do to make sure they are picked up rather than missed.&#xa0;

[[[Q454]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] I am grateful, and we look forward to the outcome of that.  The ability to learn from failure in a dispassionate way is a quality that tends to be lacking in our Whitehall and Westminster hothouse.  

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Yes.  I think we need to learn in this arena both from the failures and successes.&#xa0;

[[[Q455]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Yes.  Moving on to the Ombudsman and Parliament, we have already dealt with the MP-filter question, but we have a rather odd relationship with the Ombudsman.  We supervise and want to work with the Ombudsman, but the Ombudsman actually has little direct engagement with the work of this Committee or with the work of MPs, even though under legislation the Ombudsman is to be treated as an Officer of the House, and therefore is a servant of this House.  The Ombudsman herself says that she wants to develop this relationship further.  The more we think about it, we would like to develop it as well.  Can I ask, therefore, whether you have yet given any thought to how this relationship could be enhanced?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: First of all, I have not.  Secondly, I think it would be rather presumptuous for us to do that.  As you say, the Ombudsman is an Officer of the House, and therefore, on its behalf, the Committee needs to think through that.  If the Committee takes the view that Government needs to take some action in order to facilitate the Committee having a better relationship with the Ombudsman, the Committee needs to let us know in its report what it would like us to do.  &#xa0;

[[[Q456]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] The kinds of changes would require legislative change, for example, to deal with the filter question and to give the Ombudsman the right of initiative to do investigations into generic complaints or types of complaints, rather than individual complaints.  We would require the Government to have a policy on this. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Sorry.  I thought you were talking about the relationship between the Committee and the Ombudsman.  If you are going back to the question of things like the right to initiative, the MP filter and so on—

[[[Chair:]]] But these are things that govern the relationship.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: —I will certainly have to look at all of those recommendations.&#xa0;

[[[Q457]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] There is another conundrum, which is that the Public Accounts Committee has a much better relationship with the NAO because they are not responsible for scrutinising the performance of the NAO.  We are responsible for scrutinising the performance of the Ombudsman.  This creates a complication in our relationship, when I would like the Ombudsman sitting beside me helping us with our inquiries.  That would be regarded as an improper relationship, though, if we are meant to be supervising and scrutinising her performance as well.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I think we need to distinguish.  There are questions about the legislation governing the Ombudsman, which are clearly questions that need to be considered as part of all of this, about which I am sure the Committee will make recommendations, the Law Commission and the Ombudsman herself have made recommendations, and so forth.  At the end of all that, in some instances, if changes to be made have to be legislated, it would fall to the Government to decide as a matter of policy whether to bring forward that legislation.  We need to go through a collective process to determine that.  There is a separate set of questions, connected but separate, about how the House wishes to arrange the relationship between an Officer of the House, the Ombudsman, and a Committee of the House—this Committee.  That is a matter that is up to the House, and not for the Government to interfere with.&#xa0;

[[[Q45]]]

[[[8]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Except in reality we know that the House is controlled by the Government, and to change arrangements that require changes to Standing Order Committees, or changes to the legislative arrangements or scrutiny arrangements, requires the support of the Government, and therefore the Government needs to take a view on these matters.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: You would need to talk to the Leader of the House about those matters.  As you are extremely aware, there is a very strict convention that we do not adopt Government Policy about matters to do with the House of Commons.  That is a House of Commons matter that needs to be dealt with in the usual way.

[[[Chair:]]] Your reticence is laudable, but we might require your help. &#xa0;

[[[Q459]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Greg Mulholland:]]] One specific thing from previous Committee reports along those lines, Oliver, was that where serious injustice had not been remedied, that should automatically trigger a three-hour debate in Parliament using Standing Orders, and that was not acted on then.  Do you think there would be an appetite for that now?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I certainly think that is well worth addressing with the Leader of the House.  The action that the House takes to echo what I am talking about internally within the public services is an important dimension of all this.  It is not one I can in any way influence, but I welcome the Committee’s attention to it.  As I say, I would hope that you would raise all those issues with the Leader of the House.&#xa0;

[[[Q460]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Greg Mulholland:]]] I will ask, if I may, the next question of you as a long-standing, committed and passionate Parliamentarian.  How do you think we collectively, all Members, and indeed both Houses, can rectify the situation that is clearly there?  This is supposed to be the Parliamentary Ombudsman, but there is not a sense that this is actually someone there working for and on behalf of Parliament.  It is often seen—not to us but to other MPs—as a distant and faceless last stage of the complaints process.  That is not really what the Ombudsman was supposed to be.  How do you think we might be able to rectify that and ensure that all Parliamentarians again see the Ombudsman as representing Parliament and enabling us to do our work as Parliamentarians?   

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I do not know the answer to that question, and I am not sure that as a Minister it is appropriate for me to take a view on that.  You are right to suggest that there is a difference in perception at the moment between the way we all see the NAO and PAC relationship, and the way we all see the relationship of this Committee to the Ombudsman; I think that is true.  It is well worthwhile for the Committee to investigate what might be done about it.  If you are trying to move down a line where the Ombudsman is seen more as connected with Parliament, it would be counterproductive to that to have Ministers start intervening.  I accept, of course, the Leader of the House is relevant here, but Ministers definitely need to concern themselves with Government and the management of public services and complaints handling there, and leave to Parliament the matter of how Parliament gets into a closer conjunction with the Ombudsman if that is what Parliament desires to do, which incidentally I would welcome.  I do not resist your line of thinking at all, but I do not think I, or any other Government apparatus, should start trying to answer those questions.  It is very much for the Committee and the House to do so.  &#xa0;

[[[Q46]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Greg Mulholland:]]] We get a small but significant number of complaints about the Ombudsman Service from people all over the country who feel that they have not had satisfaction from that complaint.  I think some of it is misunderstanding, but there is a sense that there is no adequately clear system of accountability for the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman’s office and through which to look at decisions where perhaps they have been for one reason or another flawed.  Do you think we need to look at having a body clearly to scrutinise that?  Whether it would be this Committee, and we would have to then separate that from our sponsorship role, or do you think there should be another body, an equivalent perhaps of the Public Accounts Commission, to actually hold the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman’s work to account?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: There is always a danger here of infinite redress.  You could invent infinite layers of people checking on what other people have done.  The Ombudsman is there to be independent.  As far as I am aware, nobody has ever suggested that any of our national ombudsmen are anything other than independent; therefore, they have no axe to grind.  The only question you are asking therefore is whether they are doing their job efficiently and effectively.  I think it is very appropriate that this Committee should consider that question and take a view about it.  If you are asking for my instinct, it is that creating more entities is probably not the solution.  The solution probably lies more nearly in the Committee satisfying itself that the ombudsmen are acting effectively and efficiently.  From my own personal experience, speaking as a constituency MP, the Ombudsman is pretty good at the job.  Mostly when people are dissatisfied with the outcome of the Ombudsman’s investigations, it is because they do not like the outcome rather than because the Ombudsman has not done their work properly.  I have yet to come across a case in the last 17 years where having read the Ombudsman’s report, I have felt that the Ombudsman had not done a thorough job.  Of course, I do not know whether they have always got the right solution, because I have not done the investigation myself, but it seems to me on the whole pretty professional.      &#xa0;

[[[Q462]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Greg Mulholland:]]] I do not think the Committee would disagree with your last point, but I do think it is important to say that this Committee finds itself in an invidious position.  We are here to scrutinise the overall performance, costs and so on of the Ombudsman, quite rightly, but we do have people writing to us and accusing this Committee of being toothless and failing in its duty to hold the Ombudsman to account.  Whilst I agree we do not want another layer of the complaints process, nevertheless as a public body and working on behalf of Parliament and parliamentarians, all of us in public service should be accountable and able to have our decisions scrutinised to assess if we are doing the job.  Very largely, I think that will be the case, but I do think there is a gap in accountability, and that feeling has certainly led to anger amongst a lot of people.  I do not think we have cracked it.  Whether we will as a Committee with the recommendations, I do not know, but certainly the current situation is not satisfactory. 

[[[Chair:]]] If I can just add to that, it inhibits our relationship with the Ombudsman because we get concerned about working too closely with the Ombudsman and being seen as too cosy, captured by the Ombudsman, and therefore incapable of providing that dispassionate scrutiny.  That conflict does not afflict the Public Accounts Committee because they do not scrutinise the performance of the National Audit Office.  That is done by the Public Accounts Commission.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I see, yes.

[[[Chair:]]] That was a recommendation made by a previous Committee under Tony Wright.  I cannot remember what the Government response was, but they did not do anything about it.  Something needs to be done about this.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: That is very interesting.  You have clearly given this some considerable thought, and I think the Committee needs to think what it wants to recommend about this.  I do see the point you are making—that if you are trying to get into closer conjunction with the Ombudsman, on the side of the Ombudsman, so to speak, in pursuing complaints and getting them properly handled, which I welcome, it makes it difficult if you are also the Ombudsman’s scrutineer. &#xa0;

[[[Q46]]]

[[[3]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you for saying that; we will quote it.  Finally, just briefly, we have 650 hon. and right hon. Members in this House, who are all dealing with and pursuing complaints on behalf of their constituents.  We have a Parliamentary Ombudsman who deals with complaints referred to her by Members of Parliament.  Could this relationship be improved?  I understand your reluctance to give a view about this, but I am really asking you as a fellow Member of Parliament.  There is inevitably a very variable performance across Members of Parliament, who have a very diverse collection of personal staffs, who have very varied experiences and, in very many cases, very little training, although more training is available.  We are not allowed to refer individual cases to the Library.  We are not allowed to refer cases to the Ombudsman until all other avenues have been exhausted.  Isn’t there a case for the Ombudsman being able to handle certain types of complaint, such as asylum seekers or tax credit cases, so that these cases are handled much more consistently and with much more expertise than an individual office can possibly muster, where the Ombudsman is providing a service to the MP for the handling of that complaint?  Wouldn’t that be an interesting avenue for us to explore with the Ombudsman?  That would again need legislation to allow her to do that.   

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Obviously, I will study whatever the Committee recommends about that.  You said that you were asking my view as a parliamentarian.  As such, my view is that actually it is incredibly useful, notwithstanding all the imperfections involved in it, that I should have to spend a certain proportion of my time, as I do—I suspect in common with every other Member—individually pursuing individual cases.  It is not my staff pursuing them; it is me.  I do not mean I do so without the help of my staff, but I actually attend to them personally.  This is a considerable strain on time.  I live a reasonably busy life as a Minister, but I get up early in the morning and I attend to my constituency correspondence.  On Fridays I sit down with constituents in surgery after surgery.  The fact that I am compelled to do this, because that is the way the system works, means that rather than being disjoined from the life of my constituents, I am forced to attend to it.  I think that is incredibly and extraordinarily valuable.  I frequently discover things about Britain and Government that I would never discover by sitting in Whitehall as a result of being a constituency MP, and I suspect that is a very common experience.  We would lose a great deal of that if, any time Mrs Jones writes to me about a problem she has, I find some set of world-class experts and shove the problem off to them to deal with.  I accept it is inevitable that, if you have a very large number of people all doing that for their own constituents, you are going to have different styles and degrees of attention to different things and so on.  However, I think the gain to British democracy of having MPs quite directly and personally, whatever positions they may hold, involved in these individual cases is huge.&#xa0;

[[[Q464]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Kelvin Hopkins:]]] I agree very strongly with what the Minister has just said.  There is a particular concern I have, as I have mentioned before and I want to get it on the record now, that a proportion of our population are not the literate middle class. There are people whose language may be foreign. Some 20% of our population are functionally illiterate and are not used to dealing with bureaucracies.  We have to act as advocates for them frequently.  If they do not have the MP involved and have to do it directly with people who are not advocating for them, their redress will not be as good as it would be with the MP involved.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: I suspect that is very often true.  I sit for a marginal constituency and have always done so.  I am pretty conscious that every time I am dealing with a complaint or a problem, it is something that might end up in the local newspaper and cause trouble for me, if I do not handle it very conscientiously.  That lurking feeling in the back of my mind keeps me endlessly attentive to things that otherwise one might be inclined to ignore.  That is very good, both for democracy and me, and I think also quite useful for my constituents.   

[[[Kelvin ]]]

[[[Hopkins]]]

[[[:]]] Yes, absolutely.&#xa0;

[[[Q465]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Paul Flynn:]]] Do you still read your correspondence in the park in the morning and discard it in waste bins?

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: No, I now read my correspondence outside the park, and I shred it afterwards.  What I read is copies of my correspondence, because it is copied across to me.  The original, of course, is sitting in the filing system.  Yes, I have learned to shred.  The important point is that I read it, and I suspect that is true with all our colleagues—that we have a direct relationship with our constituents, and I think that is invaluable.  &#xa0;

[[[Q466]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Minister, you have been very generous with your time, and indeed have engaged enthusiastically with the subject of complaints.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: Thank you.

[[[Chair:]]] We are grateful for that, and we look forward to giving you some helpful recommendations in our report. 

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: May I just ask when you are intending to report?  It will influence my own timetable.

[[[Chair:]]] Probably after Christmas.

[[[Mr ]]]

[[[Letwin]]]: In that case we will limber up, but probably begin our investigations in the New Year.&#xa0;

[[[Chair:]]] Minister, thank you very much.  You have been very informative and helpful.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              Oral evidence: Complaints: do they make a difference?, HC 229                            2
