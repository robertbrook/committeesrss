"&#xa0;\nAFS0054&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Henry Stewart, Local Schools Network&#xa0;The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes;It is unclear whether academisation is effective in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged students. \nThe massive release of data by the Department for Education (over 200 pieces of data on each of over 5,000 secondary schools) makes possible a thorough analysis of how well different types of school have performed. \n(\nThe \nanalysis\n her\ne is based on the 2012\n e\nxam \ndata, as the \n2013 \ndata will not be released until\n January 2014.\nO\nverall \nthere is \nfigures \nshow the difference\n in achievement between \nacademies\n and maintained schools,\n for the key measure of % achieving 5 A-Cs at GCSE including English and Maths:\nSponsored Academies: 49%\nNon-academies: 58\n%\nThe difference is greater for \nthe % achieving 5 A-Cs including English and Maths but without counting non-GCSE qualifications like Btecs\n (which will be mainly excluded from 2014):\n \nSponsored Academies: 35%\nNon-ac\nademies:  51\n%\n(Note: The data here is for Sponsored academies. Converter academies are school that were already principally rated Good or Outstanding and will therefore, by definition, have higher results. This also means that the non-academy sample is wei\nghted towards those schools not previously Good or Outstanding, but still achieves far better results than for sponsored academies.)\nSponsored Academies v Non-academies by Deprivation in SchoolThe gap is huge but this \ncould be said to be\n an unfair compari\nson. We\n know that the raw % pass rate \nis closely related to the ability of the students at entry. We know that schools in disadvantaged areas tend to achieve lower % for 5 A-Cs and we know that the early academies were more likely to be in disadvantaged ar\neas. So does this explain the discrepancy?\nThe answer \nis no. To analyse this, \nthe data \nis split \ninto \nsix\n comparison groups according to the % of students \nin the school that \non free school meals. The first group, the most advantaged, is of schools where \nless than 10% are on FSM and so on up to the most d\nisadvantaged where more than 5\n0% are on FSM. Academies \ndo better in the 2 least disadvantaged bands but worse in the others.\nTaking the figures without GCSE equivalents, sponsored academies perform worse\n for all except the least privileged (and there are only 5 academies in this band).\n&#xa0;\nThe message is clear. When academies are compared to \nmaintained \ncomprehensives with the same level of disadvantage, their results are worse.\n It may be that the further \nsteps that are needed are to learn from the best schools – whether academies or maintained.\nDo students in academies take more academic qualifications?The DfE is keen to see students taking less GCSE “equivalents” like BTECs and more academic \nqualifications – like languages and humanities. Are disadvantaged students benefitting from such opportunities in academies?\nThe answer is no. Students in academies are more likely to do equivalent qualifications, and less likely to take a humanity or a \nla\nnguage\n GCSE.\nUse of Equivalents“Equivalent qualifications” are qualifications like BTECs that can currently count as equivalent to GCSEs and are generally regarded as used to game the system. It was the Daily Telegraph that first spotted\n, for the 2011 res\nults,\n that\n&#xa0;\n“Academy schools ‘inflate results with easy qualifications’”\n, finding that 11.8% of academy results were \ndown to equivalents, compared to 6% for non-academies. The gap actually widened in 2012:\n2012 Results\n5 ACEM\nGCSE only\nDifference\nAcademies\n49.3%\n34.6%\n14.7%\nNon-academies\n58.0%\n50.8%\n7.2%\nNote: “5 ACEM” refers to % achieving 5 GCSEs including English \nand Maths.\nBut this is perhaps an unfair comparison. Sponsored academies are more likely to have started with lower results and schools with lower results are more likely to use equivalents. Do academies make more use of easier equivalents when compared to\n similar schools? \nTo compare similar schools the DfE data \nhas been split\n into ranges according to their 2011 GCSE results, 0-20%, 20-40% and so on. There are only 3 schools in the 0-20% range so the key range for looking at schools in need of improvement \nis the 20-40% range:\nUse of Equivalents\n2012 5ACEM\n2012 GCSE only\nDifference\nAcademies, 20-40% band\n41.2%\n23.9%\n17.3%\nNon-academies, 20-40% band\n42.1%\n30.2%\n11.9%\n&#xa0;\nFor similar schools, academies are still much more likely to achieve their league table \nGCSE results through equivalents. The 2013 set of exams represent the last year when equivalents can be used in this way. From\n&#xa0;\n2014 very few non-GCSEs\n&#xa0;\nwill be counted as equivalent, and then only as equivalent to one GCSE. Will we see a dramatic fall in GCSE results in many schools, especially academies, in 2014?\nStudents in academies are less likely to take history or geography GCSE:Michael Gove has expressed his concern at \nthe lack of history teaching in British schools. Yet the schools in which students are least likely to study history or geography are the sponsored academies – even when compared to similar schools,\n in the same results band.\nHumanities\nAll schools\n20-40% Range\nAcademies\n34.8%\n25.2%\nNon-academies\n48.7%\n35.3%\nStudents in academies are less likely to take a language GCSE:The same is true of languages.

As an analogy, \ntake \njob interviews: However thorough, the wrong person is sometimes appointed. What is vital is that\n there is a proper process after appointment to support and challenge that person and ultimately deal with any problems that arise.\nSome organisation, and the local education authority is ideally placed, needs to be actively involved in the early days of a\n new school to help ensure its success. \nAnd i\nn some areas the local parents may prefer a maintained school. Why is this not an option? Why is parental choice only allowed as long\n \nas they want to choose an academy or free school?\nProposal&#xa0;•&#xa0;The functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level;A well run and effective local education authority will have good knowledge of its local schools – based \non contact with parents and young people and, in the case of maintained schools, the active role of a school improvement partner.\nExamples of such authorities are Tower Hamlets and Hackney, both of whom have transformed their schools from being at or near \nthe bottom of the league tables \n(10 years ago) \nto, despite high levels of deprivation, being in the top half. Tower Hamlets has done so almost entirely without academies. Hackney built four new academies and most of the secular secondary schools are now ac\nademies. (A mark of \nit\ns success is that the only schools that are \nnot now oversubscribed are the faith schools in the borough.)\nHowever Hackney has played an active role even in its academies. It administers all admissions (though different schools have di\nfferent banding rules and some have faith requirements), ensuring that pupils only have to take one banding test. All schools work together, whether Academies or maintained, and the LEA seeks to provide support and challenge to all \nit\ns schools.\nThat is key\n. Local authorities have found that, when they express concern to the DfE about an academy, the DfE is only actively involved if the school is below the national floor targets. A good local authority will be aware, for instance, if a school is above floor \ntargets but coasting. \nA local authority is not doing its job if it first finds out that a school is under-performing after an Ofsted inspection. \nThere will always be many good and outstanding schools, whether they are academies or maint\nained schools. The \nissue is which body \nis there to step in i\nf a school starts to weaken, which body\n is best able to spot it and who can best intervene to help.\nThe need for a “middle tier” is widely recognised and the DfE has responded by creating a new layer, with Commissio\nners. It is unclear how effective this will be, how well one individual in a region will be able to know their local schools.\nProposal&#xa0; •&#xa0;What role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements;&#xa0;It is not clear who, if anybody, academy chains are accountable to. Some are performing well. But, inevitably, some are not performing so well. Who will hold them to \naccount?\nExample: Financial ReportingOn the issue of whether schools, are accountable \nwe can \ntake \nthe example of \nfinances. \nDavid Cameron told the \nHouse of Commons\n Liaison Committee in March 2012\n \n“People can increasingly see the funding per pupil that goes into the school and if we are successful in introducing a more national funding formula for schools that will be even clearer. The parent/teacher /local community knows how much follows the pupil into the school and can then see the results. We need to see how much money going into the schools and the results coming out. This will produce results for very transparent amounts of money that are going in.”This transparency would be welcome but\n, 18 mo\nn\nths later,\n does not exist. \nBelow are example \nstatements\n of\n financial information for a maintained school and an academy:\nSource: \nhttp://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/\nMaintained School: Detailed Financial InformationExample: Stoke Newington School&#xa0;\nSchool\nLA Median\nLondon LAs Median\nNational Median\nGrant funding\n8108\n8400\n6632\n5433\nSelf generated income\n281\n202\n142\n153\nTotal income\n8389860268725620Teaching staff\n4135\n4528\n3813\n3091\nSupply Staff\n-85\n133\n117\n87\nEducation support staff\n1006\n791\n664\n556\nLearning resources (not ICT equipment)\n400\n410\n273\n224\nICT learning resources\n224\n219\n97\n69\nBought in professional services - curriculum\n105\n53\n75\n58\nBack office (incl.

Though difficult for the non-financial person to read, it does at least give some\n detailed financial inform\nation for individual academies – though it is not comparable to the above information for a maintained school.\nFor Burlington Danes, the audited accounts are for the ARK chain as a whole and give o\nnly one overall expenditure figur\ne\n for the school.\nThis year the Public Accounts Committee concluded:\n “the Department must insist that every Academy Trust provides it with data showing school level expenditure, including per-pupil costs, and with a level of detail comparable to that available for maintained schools. The Department must then publish this data so that proper judgements and comparisons can be made by Parliament and the public.”Tory MP Richard Bacon described the lack of financial information as “mind-blowing.”\nThe data \noutlined by \nthe Public Accounts Committee is still not available, as the above comparison shows.\n&#xa0;\nThe financial question is only one aspect of chains, but illustrates th\ne lack of accountability. A local authority is \nsubject to inspection by Of\nsted and the DfE has stepped in, in several authorities, \nto ensure improved provision. \nC\nhains cannot be inspected by Ofsted and it is unclear what level of underperformance will lead to action by the DfE, and of what type. \nProposal: &#xa0;•&#xa0;What alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools.If the local authority is supportive, \ncould \n“failing” primary schools access support from the local authority and be able to improve within the community of maintained schools.\nExample: Snaresbrook school in East London was threatened with forced academisa\ntion after an Ofsted visit in June 2013. \nIn\n the meantime the local authority, Conservative-controlled Redbridge Council, had intervened, brought in a new head, provided an estimated £50k of support and, by all accounts\n,\n \nturned the \nschool round.\nThe vocal \nopposition of parents to academisation was supported by Redbridge Council, including all its Conservative members. The DfE responded by stating that the parents could get their wish and the school would remain in the maintained sector.\nThe school had been \noffered the chance to join an academy chain of two schools. It is hard to see how a newly established, and small, academy chain could be of greater benefit than a well-resourced local authority, with several dozen schools and the resources to second an exp\nerienced headteacher into the school. \nIs this an isolated example? Analysis of the school-by-school data released by the DFE in December 2013 reveals:\nhttp://bit.ly/1bE3L09http://bit.ly/1hXllEIThere is no evidence base for conversion of primary schools to academies. It is an experiment and there is, so far, no data in the public domain to detail\n whether it is a success or not.\n \nIn contrast there is substantial evidence of the improvement that maintained primary schools are capable of. An underperforming primary can draw on the substantial resources and experience of the local authority.\nProposal: \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
