defaultThe National Travel Survey, an annual household survey of 
defaultsome

default15
default,000 
defaultto 18,000 
defaultpeople, provides data on the number of journeys per year made using different types of transport by residents of different types of area.  Figure 1 sh
defaultows the numbers of journeys for people of all ages.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 1  Jour
defaultneys per year by different means of transport and different types of area (National Travel Survey
default, 2003-05)
defaultThe total number of journeys increases slightly as the size of an urban area reduces, but is 
defaultsimilar
default for
default large urban areas (population over 250,000) to
default rural areas
default (settlements with 
defaultpopulations of less than 3,000)
default.  The number of car driver journeys increa
defaultses with reducing urban size
default and is particularly large in rural areas.  Walk journeys are similar in number across all urban areas, but fewer in rural areas.  Bus journeys are most frequent in London and the metropolitan conurbations, and very few in rural
default areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough the data in Figures 1 and 2 are for 2003-05, the situation has not changed greatly since that date.  Data corresponding to Figure 1 for 2011-12 is similar, with a small reduction in total trip numbers, a significant reduction in car use a
defaultnd increase in bus use in London, and a reduction in walking in the larger urban areas, but not in the smaller urban and rural areas.
default  In 2011-12, the total number of journeys in rural areas was fewer than in urban areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 2 shows similar data for 
defaultpeople in different age groups.
default  Figure 2a shows data for those aged 25 to 49, Figure 2b for those aged 65 to 69 and Figure 2c for those aged 80 and over.
default  These show, for those aged 25 to 49, the importance of driving a car outside of London, and particul
defaultarly in rural areas, and the relatively little use of buses outside London and the metropolitan conurbations.  For those aged 65 to 69, driving a car is still important, but fewer journeys are as a car driver; bus use in urban (population 25,000 to 250,000
default) and small urban areas increases relative to that by middle-aged people.  For those aged 80 and over, the total number of journeys has reduced considerably
default, and car driving in particular. 
default 
defaultJourneys as a car driver are still more in rural than urban areas,
default as are journeys as a car passenger.  Bus use has increased, relative to that by those aged 65 to 69.

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe proportion of older people in isolated communitiesdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe ONS publication ‘Regional Trends’ publishes data on the proportion of people of retirement age 
defaultin individual local authority areas.  This makes it possible to determine the relationship between population density and the percentage of the population of
default retirement age.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 
default3
default shows this relationship for all local authorities in Great Britain in 
default2008.
default  The percentage ranges from almost 35% in some low density areas to under 10% in the hi
defaultghest density areas of
default Inner London.
default  The curve is similar, but le
defaultss extreme, for Wales on its own, and the range is even smaller for Scotland on its own.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese data show that older people are disproportionately located in low density areas, where it is difficult and expensive to provide public transport and other servi
defaultces, and where people depend on cars to reach the services and facilities that they require.

defaultDriving licence holding by defaultolder peopledefault&#xa0;
defaultThe percentage of adults holding car driving licences has been increasing, particularly for older people and most r
defaultapidly for older women (Figure 4

defaultFor men aged 40 to 70, licence holding h

default at around 70%  For older women it is still increasing
default rapidly
default, though from relatively low levels, while for younger women it has fallen but is now rather steady.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe National Travel Survey can provide data on the proportion of driving licence holders 
defaultwho cease to hold a licence at different ages, by following cohorts from the start of reliable NTS data in 1972.  Both men and women start to reduce licence holding after age 70, probably by failing to renew licences rather than by actively surrendering th
defaultem.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 5 shows the percentages of men and women of various ages who held a car driving licence ten years earlier but have now relinquished it.  Both men and women start to relinquish licences at around age 70.  By age 80, about 15% of women and 10% of
default men who held a licence at age 70, no longer do so.  By age 90, over 40% of women and 20% of men who held licences at age 80, no longer do so.  Thus by age 90, about 60% of women and 35% of men who had held car driving licences at age 70 no longer do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultEven before relinquishing a driving licence, most older drivers reduce the amount they drive as they age, and progressively avoid stressful driving (night-time, motorways, peak times and busy town centres).
default  This limits the activities that they are able to
default reach by car.
default&#xa0;
defaultA significant proportion of older people who live in car-dependent areas will stop driving before they are 90 years old.  Those who do will then be dependent on other means of getting about, which may be family and friends, taxis, community
default transport or possibly local bus services.

default&#xa0;
defaultImplicationsdefault&#xa0;
defaultBuses are little used in rural areas and small urban areas (populations 25,000 to 3,000).  Most journeys are made by car, either as driver or passenger, or on foot.  In 2011-12, 87% of all journeys 
defaultin rural areas 
defaultwere made by car or on foot.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe increasin
defaultg number of older drivers living in low density areas where they have to depend on their car to reach the services and facilities they need for daily life pose
defaults
default a large potential problem.  Many will have to stop driving 
defaultin their 70s or 80s 
defaultand will then be
default dependent on others for the mobility they need.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne action that would cost little is a campaign to persuade older people to move from isolated communities to places where they would not be car dependent, before increasing age forces them to restrict or s
defaulttop driving.
default&#xa0;
defaultA second action would be to support the many excellent local authority programmes to advise older drivers on their ability to continue 
defaultto 
defaultdriv

defaultn ways to extend safe driving further into old age.
