"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from Nhs Confederation (PEX 0029)&#xa0;\n1. Executive summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2. The state of NHS finances2.1 The NHS is responding to an extraordinary financial challenge. Today, NHS leaders are steering their organisations through a health care system three years into its tightest funding squeeze for more than 50 years. Furthermore, most experts believe it is highly unlikely that NHS funding will return to historic average increases in the short to medium term. Estimates indicate that the funding gap between what the NHS has traditionally needed and what it is likely to receive could reach £30 billion by 2020.\n More people need care and they want this care to be better than it has ever been before, but the supply of funding is simply not matching these growing demands and expectations.\n2.2 The current financial environment is a primary concern for our members. Our most recent member survey highlights significant concerns about the impact that flat funding might have on quality of care for patients.\n NHS organisations need to continue to drive up standards of care, responding to the issues raised in the recent Francis, Keogh and Berwick reports. Our \nmembers are concerned that the financial situation will make doing this all the more challenging. \n2.3 The key findings in our survey show that:\n2.4 We have previously outlined to the Committee that a significant proportion of the relentless rise in demand for health care is caused by demographic pressures. Take for example the 26 per cent increase in emergency admissions through A&amp;E of people aged over 85 in the last four years.\n Our recent report, \nEmergency care: An accident waiting to happen?\n \n, demonstrated that our members are certain that rising numbers of frail, older people with long term conditions are the most significant cause of growing pressures on urgent and emergency care.\n2.5 In a survey of our members, conducted as part of this report, NHS leaders emphasised the significant financial impact of these demand pressures on their organisations. They were clear that unless action is taken to solve this problem we risk triggering a domino effect, pushing challenged NHS organisations closer to the financial cliff edge and into failure. Pressures on A&amp;E services are one example of the growing pressures being experienced across the whole system and any response must therefore address the problems confronting the whole system.\n2.6 Rising demand has previously been met by increasing the NHS budget. We understand the current economic situation makes this difficult, but we believe future budgets and spending rounds need to deliver a sustainable funding package across health and social care.\n3. The future of NHS finances3.1 The most likely future scenario for the NHS is one of tough times, as recognised in our report \nTimes times, tough choices\n.\n We believe the NHS faces four choices that result from this financial dilemma. The four options we identify are:\n3.2 None of the choices facing the NHS are pain free and some may prove too difficult to accept. The public will be better placed to understand and engage in a national debate if we are open about where change needs to happen and why. We are calling on all political parties to be open and honest with the public about NHS finances as we head into the next general election.\n3.3 Our “2015 Challenge” will look to lead the debate on this and make the case that the NHS needs to change if it is to remain sustainable. Government policy must support change at a local level by creating a permissive environment and removing the barriers currently preventing our members from working with local communities to do things differently.\n4. The need to redesign services4.1 Our report, \nChanging care, improving quality\n, examines the case for radical, far-reaching change across the NHS. It was produced in partnership with National Voices and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, underlining the importance of patients, managers and clinicians working together to ensure local services remain sustainable. \n4.2 Our 2015 Challenge is a challenge to both politicians to create the space for the change needed and to local NHS organisations to be ready to make these changes. It is vital that the NHS is in a position to get on with purposeful, planned change that addresses the real challenges the health service faces. If we do not achieve this, it is very possible that the current basis of the NHS, free for all at the point of need, will become unsustainable in the future. \n4.3 For this to happen it is crucial that all political parties recognise this imperative and adopt policies that support plans at a local level. We must also ensure patients, local communities, and their representatives - including local and national politicians - are properly engaged in this debate. \n4.4 Change will involve looking at where we are currently putting our resources and deciding whether they might be spent elsewhere to maximise the value patients and the public get from them. This should mean investing more in care closer to where people live and in some cases it may be necessary to reduce the scope of services within hospitals. Similarly, if clinical evidence and patient experience highlight the need to concentrate certain services in specialist centres on fewer sites, as has been the case in relation to stroke service in London, then resources will need to be shifted. \n4.5 The changes in North West London's NHS, recently announced by the Secretary of State, show how the NHS can secure the support of the local community for service change by clearly explaining the benefits before any decisions are made. In this case an independent panel representing patients, managers and clinicians agreed that the changes planned in there are in the best interests of patients. Other parts of the NHS should consider this model when looking to redesign their services. \n4.6 Currently, many people are sceptical that they will receive the same quality of care from services based in the community as they will in their local hospital. We are calling on the Government, politicians and national NHS bodies to set out a vision for the future of community care, communicating more clearly the future contribution of community based services. They must demonstrate how patients can benefit from being treated in a more convenient location and how this will take the pressure off other services.\n5. Progress in meeting the \"QIPP\" challenge5.1 It is important, now more than ever, that the value from the money spent on the NHS is maximised to deliver the greater benefit for society. The NHS is already halfway through finding over £16 billion worth of efficiency savings up to 2015, and the Spending Round this year has highlighted that this challenge will continue at least another year, but probably for much longer. Good progress has been made so far in delivering the required savings and there is always more to be done to improve productivity and value for money. However, as we warned when we submitted evidence to the Committee last year, most NHS organisations are now approaching the end of their capacity to make \"easy\" savings, the so called \"low hanging fruit\". Now, if the NHS is to make the savings needed to remain sustainable it will need to radically change the way care is provided.\n5.2 This point is reflected in the findings of our member survey. Last year, NHS leaders told us that the most common action they were taking to achieve the cost savings were:\nThis year, the most common actions taken to ensure cost improvement objectives are met in the next 12 months are:\n5.3 In fact, 93 per cent of NHS leaders told us that they were considering major changes to health services, with most (67 per cent) planned over the next two years. Our survey is also illuminating on the growing challenge of the QIPP programme. Almost three quarters (74 per cent) of respondents felt confident that their organisation would meets its cost improvement objectives in the coming year, but this is down from 84 per cent in the previous year. One in five NHS leaders (22 per cent) told us that they were not very confident these objectives will be met over the next 12 months. The biggest barriers highlighted to meeting cost improvement objectives were: \n6. The need for more effective strategic planning6.1 If we are to ensure that the NHS makes the best use of the resources available then the Government needs to ensure that NHS organisations have the space to plan for the long term and think strategically about the future health needs of their local area. A period of stability in the NHS will be crucial to allow local communities to come together, build strong relationships and develop sound, evidence-based proposals for change. We must avoid another disruptive, structural reorganisation of the health service and we strongly recommend a cross-party agreement on this issue ahead of the next general election.\n6.2 One possible way that politicians could establish a more permissive environment for strategic planning and investment in the NHS would be to consider the scope for longer term health spending settlements. At present, the NHS appears to be focusing on making ends meet each year without necessarily knowing what is around the corner. This makes it harder for NHS organisations to work with local partners to front load investment on the basis of plans that might realise savings and value dynamically.\n6.3 Longer spending settlements, for example a ten year settlement, that are based on demographic and economic projections, produced by the Office for National Statistics and the Office for Budgetary Responsibility respectively, would provide a clearer indication of the funds available to the NHS in the future and would require governments to give good reasons for deviating dramatically from these projections. It could also provide the clear signal for establishing multiple year CCG allocations, extended tariff prices and longer local contracting. In addition, clarity is needed on allocations at a regional and local level within the overall NHS budget. \n6.4 The NHS will need to be imaginative and make best use of the money available, if spending is unlikely to increase over the coming years, not least recognising the need to invest in redesigning services. This means accessing all the funding available and taking a more joined up approach to risk pooling and budget underspends. We need to make sure that we manage risk in a way that ensures funds are available if the worse should happen. \nHowever, at present the NHS can be risk averse and risk pools are being dealt with separately. Greater transparency is still needed on how existing and future funds within the NHS can be reinvested to improve care. \n6.5 For example, NHS England needs to set out what in the long view its plans are for the top-slicing of CCG budgets. The Department of Health (DH) also needs to be clear about the reasons behind the repeated gap between total health spending and the Departmental Expenditure Limit and if this money can be reinvested. The consistent underspends of public money on the NHS suggest the DH needs to be less risk averse in how it is using this funding. At a local level, commissioners will need to be clear how they plan on spending the 30 per cent marginal rate for emergency admissions. \n7. Redesigning incentives7.1 More also needs to be done to ensure that the right incentives are in place across the system. We need to incentivise better joint working, more focus on prevention and greater investment in community services. The current NHS payment system includes an array of different arrangements but is dominated by an activity-based mechanism that funds most services in hospitals. This system has developed in an ad hoc way to address various issues and plug particular gaps across the system.\n7.2 While this is understandable, we believe there is now a real opportunity to take a more strategic approach towards incentives in the NHS as a whole. Monitor and NHS England take joint responsibility for the NHS payment system from next year and they will need to avoid being prescriptive and allow local leaders the freedom to develop local incentives. National bodies will need to support and enable these local freedoms by providing best practice case examples and expertise. We have been encouraged so far by the progress made by NHS England and Monitor on this and their engagement with the sector, but it should be recognised that this work is still at an early stage.\n7.3 Two thirds of NHS leaders in our survey this year highlighted funding mechanisms as the main barrier to delivering a more integrated and community-based model of care. That being said, it is also important to recognise that payment mechanisms alone will not be enough to make the progress needed. Providers and commissioners will need to have frank conversations about how they can best support each other to make changes local people want and need.\n8. Pay in the NHS8.1 Employers in the NHS tell us that they want to support NHS staff and improve morale and they recognise the important role pay plays in that. However, with the NHS under growing financial pressure, their focus is on improving patient care. Restraining the pay bill is essential to ensure this, as well as in minimising job losses. There is no denying the hard work of NHS staff but a one per cent increase in doctors pay, for example, would cost the NHS more than £100 million, the equivalent of over 2,000 registrars working in hospital. \nDespite a headline pay freeze in the last two years, most NHS staff have been receiving incremental pay increases of around three per cent as they climb up through their pay bands.\n8.2 This is a crucial time for negotiations on pay in the NHS. Nurses, support staff, cleaners and other healthcare professionals have already agreed on changes to sick pay and linking pay progression to performance. The BMA has agreed to negotiations with NHS Employers on consultant and junior doctors contracts. This represents a real opportunity to move forward on some important issues, not least facilitating more seven day working in the NHS, and is an opportunity for doctors to show leadership on this. \n8.3 In the long term, we need to engage with our staff and unions to explore how we can come out of a period of pay restraint in a sustainable way, recognising the significant contribution of staff to delivering high quality patient care and generating solutions to the financial and demand challenge that we face. \n8.4 It is important to note the potential impact of draft proposals for changes to the NHS occupational pension scheme which are likely to increase employer contributions from 2015. This is in addition to changes to national insurance which will come into effect in 2016. Employers have considerable anxieties about how additional national insurance contributions will be met and the impact on the NHS pay bill.  Consideration needs to be given to the wider implications of these proposals on employers' costs and the impact that would have on patients. It would be perverse if additional costs of National Insurance led to staff opting out of the occupational pension scheme making it unsustainable. These tensions will need to be resolved in the next spending review.\n9. Long term financial viability of NHS Foundation Trusts  (FT) and NHS Trusts9.1 We are deeply concerned about the growing number of NHS trusts that are in deficit and those approaching financial failure. It is becoming clear there is scant chance of a large number of NHS trusts being awarded FT status. Published accounts show that last year, without additional support, the NHS trust sector reported an overall deficit of £104 million.\n In fact, just under a quarter of NHS trusts (23) would not have broken even if not for additional funding. Over the last two years, just seven trusts have been authorised while almost double that amount have had their application withdrawn, postponed, rejected or deferred.\n Of the 98 NHS trusts that still exist, only around 30 per cent are either with Monitor for assessment or are being reviewed for referral by the NHS Trust Development Authority (NTDA). The deadline for all NHS trusts to become FTs has now been abandoned, but no clear strategy seems to have been put in its place to address these concerns.\n9.2 Furthermore, there are also alarming indicators about a number of FTs. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) margin, which gives a good indication of the operational profitability of an organisation, across the FT sector is 5.13 per cent.\n This has fallen from 5.7 per cent two years ago. Alarmingly, Monitor has a \nthreshold of 5 per cent, below which it would not normally authorise an FT. The average across the acute sector is 4.72 per cent, which highlights that a number of acute trusts are struggling. The EBITDA for small acute hospitals in particular is currently 3.30 per cent and 16 of the 18 trusts subject to enforcement action are small or medium in size (below £400m turnover). Similar concerns are found in the trends in average financial and governance risk ratings, which show a continual escalation in the risks associated with FTs.\n9.3 We are clear that the NTDA and Monitor need to play a more active role in supporting financially troubled trusts and to enable them to become sustainable or to make difficult change if this is not possible. National bodies will need to facilitate collaboration and joint working across the whole of a local health system - we are clear that problems cannot be solved by treating individual providers in isolation from their neighbours, and service redesign would almost always need to happen over a bigger footprint than just one trust. Commissioners too have a key system leadership role to play in tackling these issues. \n9.4 We are therefore calling on the Department of Health to set out a clear strategy on how this issue should be tackled. This will need to include clarity on the roles and responsibilities of national bodies and a clear indication of the resources available to those bodies to perform their roles. In the long term, all political parties will need to set out how they intend on tackling the issue of financially challenged and failing NHS providers. \n9.5 We have to be clearer though about the relationship between finance and quality. The NHS needs to deliver both better care and find efficiency savings year-on-year. Sometimes, these two challenges can seem independent, but in practice finance and quality in healthcare are inextricably linked. Better care can be cheaper and efficient services are often more effective, but the reverse can also be true. Proposals for a single failure regime announced in the Government's response to the Francis report highlight that this is now recognised by the national bodies. However, it will require more than just these proposals. National bodies will need to show in their actions that they understand the impact that financial decisions have on quality, and vice versa, and ensure that their regulatory approaches are complementary and reciprocal.\n9.6 Responding to failure, whether it is triggered by finances or quality, can mean a crisis driven change of services. The events regarding the South London NHS Healthcare NHS Trust demonstrate why this sort of change is not desirable and action must be taken to prevent it from happening in the first place. However, where crisis driven change is required a clear failure regime which allows for proper engagement with the local community is essential.\n&#xa0;\n We therefore welcome recent amendments to the Unsustainable Provider Regime in the Care Bill which would help address some of the concerns we raised with the Government about lack of clarity.\n10. Integration10.1 Our members are clear about the potential for integrated care to help NHS organisations improve care, ensure the future sustainability of services and get better value for money for the taxpayer. We remain concerned about the progress in integrating care. Our 2013 annual \nmember survey revealed that 59 per cent of our members think slight progress is being made towards a more integrated and community-based model of care and only 8 per cent believe this progress to be significant.  \n10.2 Respondents to our survey were asked about the consequences they thought might arise if not enough progress towards integration is made. 61 per cent think the main consequence would be an unsustainable service. These results highlight the need to overcome silos and practical hurdles towards integration at both a national and local level. \n10.3 In addition a recent joint NHS Confederation and ADASS survey found that the biggest positive contributor was strong leadership and commitment 'from the top'. More than 80 per cent of respondents said these were the most important factors at play in taking forward integration locally. The most frequently cited factor holding up integration efforts was data and IT systems. 64 per cent of survey respondents said data and IT systems are an impediment to developing integrated services\n. \n10.4 A range of models have been developed by local leaders to fit local needs but more needs to be done to ensure there is widespread adoption of these models. We have highlighted to the Committee recommendations for ensuring this is the case, including in our joint submission with ADASS and the LGA for the last public expenditure inquiry which we attach to this submission. To help ensure integrated care is adopted at scale and pace our recommendations include:\n11. Integration Transformation Fund (ITF)11.1 The principles behind the Chancellor's decision to allocate £3.8 billion to a joint NHS and social care budget in 2015/16 are welcome and this could help address the need to join up services and provide the right care in the right setting for many people. We have been very clear on the impact that underinvestment in social care and other out-of-hospital services has had on the NHS as a whole.\n11.2 Under the new arrangements funds will potentially be spent on health services, as well as social care once they are locally agreed. There will be stronger conditions in place in terms of how the money is used, and local joint plans will have to detail how the money is spent. However, it is vital that there is collaboration and agreement across health and social care on how best to use the money to get the best possible outcomes for the local population and the NHS must be closely involved in decisions on how these plans are developed.\n11.3 We have some questions about the feasibility of CCGs and local authorities being asked to create plans over a very short period of time - they are currently expected to develop and agree plans for both 2014/15 and 2015/16, by February 2014. Furthermore, the development of health and wellbeing boards varies greatly across the country and we would question how well equipped many boards are to play a key role in the fund and provide scrutiny of local plans, as is the current expectation.\n11.4 Clarity is also needed on how these plans will be funded. When deciding how the ITF will operate in practice, it is crucially important that we take into account the impact on particular parts of the NHS, given the current financial pressures. While we welcome any measures that ensure there is greater investment in community services, the Government will need to make certain they closely monitor the impact on the acute sector, given the number of trusts who are in danger of financial failure and to avoid any potential destabilisation caused by changes to the tariff being used to fund the ITF. \n12. Social care12.1 A sustainable long-term funding settlement for social care that allows local authorities to spend money on all those who need care is crucial if we are to relieve current pressures on the NHS. The funding package must enable investment in services which will save money by improving people's overall health and independence. \n12.2 When people’s needs are not met by the social care system they turn to the NHS which experiences the impact in the form of increased demand for emergency and unplanned work, and delays in discharging people from hospital. Social care can also play a key role in preventing people from reaching crisis point when they need more intensive costly treatment, and therefore needs to be funded to keep people as well as possible, for as long as possible Our report, \nPapering Over the Cracks: the impact of social care funding on the NHS\n, contains a wealth of information on the demographic and financial realties of social care - and how these impact upon the NHS.\n12.3 The Government must establish a clear threshold for care that is fair and does not allow the most vulnerable to fall through the cracks. This cannot be achieved without further investment in social care resources. While we welcome a minimum entitlement to social care as set out in the Care Bill, local authorities need to have the funding available to ensure they can meet this entitlement. We continue to support the Dilnot Commission's proposals as the \nmost credible and practical solution on social care funding and the proposals need to be implemented as soon as possible.\n&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAbout usThe NHS Confederation represents all types of organisations that commission and provide NHS services.
