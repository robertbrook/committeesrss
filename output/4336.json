"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence submitted by the Department for Work and Pensions&#xa0;\nThe following information was requested by the Committee after the evidence session\n:\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 1There are no plans to publish anything else on destinations but we continue \nto monitor the progress of Incapacity Benefit Reassessments. The link to the 2011 report is below:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/upload\ns/attachment_data/file/214578/rrep791.pdf\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 21.\n&#xa0;\n Can people be required to sign on if they are not receiving benefit because of a sanction?\n\"signing on\" is shorthand for continue to be entitled to J\nobseeker’s Allowance (J\nSA\n)\n. Claimants who are \nsanctioned continue to be entitled to JSA throughout a sanction period as long as they continue to meet the conditions of entitlement.\n&#xa0;\n We monitor these conditions by requiring claimants to \"sign on\" - in other words, attend reviews where their compliance \nwith the actively seeking and available for work conditions is checked.\n&#xa0;\n A claimant who fails to meet these requirements would - as normal - be disentitled.\n&#xa0;\n Where a claimant is disentitled they will not appear on the claimant count.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;\n Are there any st\natistics on the number and proportion of sanctioned claimants who do NOT continue to sign on during the period of their sanction or for a longer period?\nWe cannot quantify the number of claimants who choose to end their JSA claim as a result of a sanction \nreferral or decision to apply a sanction as the claimant could have ended their JSA claim for other reasons.\n&#xa0;\n There are incentives on claimants to continue to \"sign on\" during a sanction - to continue to receive JCP support and to receive hardship payments\n (to receive hardship claimants must remain on JSA).\n&#xa0;\n More generally, as sanction volumes have increased we have not seen a corresponding increase in off-flows.\n&#xa0;\n The recent decline in the claimant count is primarily driven by falling on-flows.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 3In addition the Minister said there would be a second independent review – separate to the Matthew Oakley review – of the sanction process and the WPSC asked for information on this.\nSince taking over her new portfolio, the Minister for Employment has take\nn a close interest in the sanctions regime and has asked for a review of the application of the regime.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe will share more details of the review, including the Terms of Reference, with the Committee shortly.\n&#xa0;\n2 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
