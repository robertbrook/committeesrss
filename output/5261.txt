[[[Written evidence from Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (]]]

[[[UEC0007)]]]&#xa0;The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (“the College”) has 50% of its UK Fellows and Members working in the NHS in England, and welcomes the opportunity to respond to this call by the Health Committee for written submissions on the allocation and use of the additional funding made available to support the emergency and urgent care system over winter 2013–14 and the performance of emergency departments in this period.Fellows of the College have reported that funding has largely been spent on sessional and locum payments to doctors and nurses to fill rota gaps and increase cover, mostly in the Emergency Department (ED) and less at the interface between ED and the Acute Medical Unit (AMU) or the interface to support safe discharge back to the community.  The weather this winter has been mild to date and this impacts on the ability to assess effectiveness.Experiences were mixed as to the effectiveness of the additional funding.  Some Fellows found that there was no difference and crises were only averted by all members of the team working hard to keep the system afloat; while others found that the additional staff could provide supplementary useful support, particularly the deployment of additional therapy staff in the AMU and additional weekend cover especially in in-patient medical wards.  Other examples of use of the funding included improved access to diagnostics, particularly radiology; real time bed management white boards; and improved use and access to discharge lounges.Fellows have advised the College that additional funding for winter would be more effectively spent and beneficial to patients if there was greater opportunity to plan and arrange how to allocate the money in advance, rather than the current reactive response which inevitably uses up funding on high rates of pay and agency fees at short notice. Additionally, the College feels that there should be more focus on primary and social care planning during the winter months and holiday periods and an increased emphasis on 7 day working, and their role in reducing patient admissions to hospital and facilitating timely discharge which would ease pressure on secondary care considerably. &#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
