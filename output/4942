[normal]Executive Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Ministry of
[normal] Defence should undertake to pay full tort damages for all deaths and injuries sustained during active operations
[normal] on a no-fault basis
[normal], as the 
[normal]quid pro quo
[normal] for removing the right to sue in 
[normal]tort (e.g. 
[normal]for 
[normal]negligence
[normal])
[normal].  (Crown immunity can be revived by the S
[normal]ecretary of State’s making a suitable Order under the 
[normal]Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987
[normal]; it has previously been suggested that this should be done to 
[normal]reverse 
[normal]Smith v. Ministry of Defence
[normal] to avert that decision’s likely pernicious influence on milit
[normal]ary effectiveness.)

[normal]the Scheme should continue without change to treat injuries, illness or death due to 
[normal]service in the same way, irrespective of the precise cause, because it is the act of joining up and signalling willingness to make a sacrifice that distinguishes those who serve.

[normal] The Boyce Review noted that there would also be practical difficulties in drawing the boundary of active operations—e.g. “travel to and from operational duty, training to deploy, plus those in posts where individuals are predominantly not on operations bu
[normal]t travel to operations occasionally”, ibid 2.85.
