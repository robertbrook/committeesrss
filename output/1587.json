"&#xa0;\nThe Energy Technologies Institute (ETI), a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering firms and the UK Government, believes \nthat \nCCS\n \nwill be\n \na critical part of an\ny\n affordable, secure and sustainable\n low carbon\n \nUK \nenergy system in the \nfuture.\n \n However, it is important that the right steps are taken to ensure the cost of carbon reductions are affordable in the context of sustaining UK economic growth and industrial development.\nCCS \nmay be the single, most cost effective lever for reducin\ng UK greenhouse gas emissions.\n  \nIts potential\n, because of its flexibility of use,\n extends beyond the electricity sector and is central to a national strategy to meet carbon targets cost-effectively\n by\n: \nETI’s analysis of the UK energ\ny system shows that deploying CCS to its full potential can reduce\n the cost\n of meeting carbon targets by up to 1% of GDP (\ncompared \nto the\n \ncosts if\n no CCS were deployed)\n – equivalent to\n a saving of around £1000 on average household bills for energy and transport costs in 2050.  These savings arise because spending on more expensive alternatives for cutting emissions \nwould be\n avoided\n.\nThe key technologies \nneeded\n to deploy CCS (CO\n2\n capture\n, compression, pipelines and geological injection\n and storage\n) have been successfully applied in a range of contexts.  T\nhe\n next step is to assemble and deploy these proven components at scale in a number of full chain projects.  \nWe believe the\n technical ch\nallenges are surmountable in engineering terms, but require the strategic will and investment to de\n-\nrisk, drive down costs and \nbuild a network of\n CO\n2\n transport and storage infrastructure.\nCCS will require upfront investment \nto create\n strategic infrastructu\nre and prov\ne\n storage sites, so the costs for early projects are likely to be h\nigh when measured on a simple £ \nper\n \nMWh basis.  \nT\nhis does not mean CCS is uncompetitive.  \nOur\n work suggests that net benefits (in terms of savings \ncompared to implementing \nmore e\nxpensive alternative\ns\n) start to flow by the late 2020s, if the UK deploys CCS effectively.\n&#xa0;\nOur work shows that the \ntotal investment out to 2050 is estimated at around £60 to £80 billion on capture, \ntransportation, storage\n plant and infrastructure.  This s\ncale of investment is significant, but deliverable within a supportive policy environment, and would quickly start to yield returns, in the form of avoided decarbonisation costs\n, \njob creation and safeguarding \nthe position \nof key industries in the UK.\n \n  \n \nI\nt \nis \nchallenging to deploy \nCCS \nin a market economy.  It requires large scale investment\n in complex new value chains\n, the returns on which are entirely\n \ndependent\n on \nlong term \npolicy \ncertainty.\n \n \nAttracting\n the\n private investment \nneeded to\n develop\n \nthe sector \nwill depend on \ncreati\nng\n confidence that it will command strategic support from policy-makers\n.\nThere are three\n fundamental approaches to captur\ning\n CO\n2\n from fossil-fuelled power generation: \nWe believe IGCC has \nsignificant\n potential\n \nfor the future\n, because of its performance and the opportunity to produce hydrogen as an energy vector.\nCompression and \ntransport of CO\n2\n \nrepresents relatively mature technology, with significant experience in Enhanced Oil Recovery applications i\nn North America.  \nStorage in a UK setting will be \noffshore \nin \ndepleted oil and gas reservoirs \nand \nsaline aquifers.  \nSignificant work is required to fully appraise storage sites before CO\n2\n storage takes place\n.  \nETI has \ncompleted an assessment of UK storage\n appraisal prospects\n and the results of this are \nnow available under license from the Crown Estate and BGS\n – at \nwww.CO2Stored.co.uk\n.\n \n ETI have \nalso co-funded \nthe UK’s first\n \nsaline aquifer appraisal drilling \nproject with National Grid.\nETI ha\nve\n announced over £50m of CCS\n technology\n projects\n.\n  In addition to the \nfour\n mentioned above \nwe \nare investing \nin \ndevelopment of measurement, monitoring and verification techniques for \noffshore storage sites and \ndesk top too\nls and studies for assessing and designing CCS systems.\nETI has\n \ncreated a\nn internationally peer reviewed\n \nmodelling c\napability for the UK energy system \nknown as ESME \n– the Energy System Modelling Environment\n.\n \n This allows us to model the UK’s pathway to decarbonisation \nby 2050 \nunder a range of scenarios, taking \ninto \naccount the underlying costs, engineering properties an\nd inter-dependencies of key energy technologies. \n \nThis \nwork robustly demonstrates that taking a system-wide approach substantially reduces the economic cost of decarbonisation. \nOur\n \nmodelling points to a critical role for \nCCS\n \nboth within and outside the el\nectricity sector. \n \nIt suggests that if we do not successfully develop CCS in the UK, the annual cost of meeting carbon targets is likely to increase by over 1% of GDP by 2050. \n I\nt also highlights the potential economic benefit of applying CCS in combinatio\nn with biomass, as a means of generating negative carbon emissions. \n \nThis \nwould\n mak\ne\n it possible to meet carbon budgets and continue using fossil fuels in some applications where low carbon alternatives are particularly costl\ny\n. \nA coherent strategy for developing CCS \nmeans\n taking account of the costs and benefits across the entire energy sector\n.\n \n \nT\nhe electricity sector \nis the\n obvious starting point for developing CCS, as it is least exposed to international trade, can demonstrate \nand de\n-\nrisk the full value chain at scale and through EMR has a reward mechanism available. However\n, our\n work also points clearly to t\nhe longer term importance of CCS \nin industrial and biomass applications\n – where it is possible to maximise the impact of r\nesources by taking account of these broader decarbonisation benefits in decisions on contract pricing, allocation and contract design\n. \n \nA\n substantial reduction in the cost of the \noverall \nnational energy system\n (1% of GDP by 2050)\n is likely to be the most important benefit to the UK economy\n.\n  \nSpending on energy currently represents about 9% of \nGDP.  \nContaining th\nis cost burden\n,\n \nfor \nboth industry and consumers\n \nby deploying \nCCS to\n deliver low carbon energy \ncost-\neffectively, \nwould have a major impact on national economic competitiveness\n and\n \nh\nelp to generate and safeguard jobs\n.\n \n \nWe have\n commission\ned\n work to assess the scale of the \nwider \neconomic benefits associated with deployment of CCS.  \n \nA number of studies have also assessed the direct economic impact of CCS projects, on regional employment and value added, often in challenged regional economies\n.  The creation of a significant new CCS sector would create new employment opportunities and enable the UK to build exportable skills\n (e.g. particularly in established strengths such as process and offshore engineering)\n and expertise relevant to an emergi\nng global CCS industry.  The CCS T\nechnology \nI\nnnovation \nN\needs Assessment produced by the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group \nestimates \ninno\nvation in CCS can help create a UK industry with the potential to contribute further economic value of £3-16bn to\n 2050.\nT\nhe \ndevelopment of CCS could \nalso \nprolong the life of UK oil fields, through the application of captured CO\n2\n in enhanced oil recovery\n and\n \nthere could be \nthe \npotential to re-use some \nexisting North Sea oil and gas infrastructure (e.g. platforms or pi\npelines) enabling\n a\n significant deferral of expensive decommissioning obligations\n.  \nOur initial estimates show there is \nenough storage capacity under UK waters to offer \nthe potential to provide storage not just for the UK but for other European countries \nwithout a similar resource.  \nCCS \nalso \noffers the only route to directly address emissions from \nsome key high emitting \nindust\nries\n which would help\n \nthe UK remain an attractive location and maintain employment in industrial sectors \nsuch as\n \nrefining, in futur\ne decades, as carbon prices become a growing part of their cost base.\nCCS offers \na \nunique potential to enable a genuinely economically viable transition to a low carbon economy.  But its strategic characteristics \n(large-scale, complex new value chains, dependence on policy for returns\n, its cost str\nucture with\n economies of scale and scope\n, and the long-term nature of risks and liabilities\n) \nmean there are a range of ba\nrriers and challenges that \nneed to be overcome.  \nThese include:\n&#xa0;\nThere are safety issues \nassociated\n \nwith any form of pressurised gas system and \nCCS\n is no different\n.\nThese safety issues can in part \nbe reduced \nthrough site selection.  Offshore storage of CO\n2\n \nminimises\n the impact of any leakage from a store or the \noffshore \npipeline and the select\nion of onshore pipeline routes needs to consider the potential impact of a containment failure. \nThe plant and pipeline operators should be responsible for the safety of their operation which should be subject to regulation and planning approvals.\nIn Norway and Algeria\n,\n \nCCS\n has been applied to high CO\n2\n gas field developments for many years and similar projects are \nunder developme\nnt elsewhere\n,\n including the Gorgon \ngas field\n \nin Australia.  These developments are typically mandated by the field development plan approval process, either by the operating companies own standards or \nnational or \nstate\n \nlegislation.  \nCCS has also played an\n integral role in onshore Enhanced Oil Recovery \n(EOR) \nin the US\nA.\n   \nOther\n \ncountries are developing technologies and purs\nu\ning commercial scale demonstration of CCS in the power \nand industrial \nsector\ns\n.  None are yet operational, although the Boundary Dam\n project \nin Canada \nis nearing completion\n.  \nChina has committed to cutting the carbon intensity of its economy and has launched an experimental, cap-and-trade pilot program\nme\n.  Recent press coverage suggests that China may commit to cap its emissions by 201\n6, which would represent a major escalation of commitment, and the government has ordered firms in heavy-polluting industries to cut emissions by 30% by 2017.  In April 2013, the National Development and Reform Commission\n \ndetail\ned\n the way in which China wo\nuld promote CCS pilot and demonstration program\nme\ns\n as an \nimportant task in \nChina’s\n 12th Five–Year greenhouse gas control plan. \nThe CCS Roadmap\n set out at a high level the steps needed to enable CCS deployment in the UK.  However\n,\n there have been delays in delivering the roadmap, notably in the CCS Commercialisation programme.  \nETI’s \nwork on \nprivate sector \nfinancing suggest there is considerable \nscepticism about the UK’s long term commitment to carbon targets.  Industry and investors are looking to\nwards\n Government to demonstrate\n a\n long term commitment to CCS and to provide further details of how it will do \nso\n.  \nEmerging economies are likely to remain dependent on fossil fuels use for decades to come, and CCS is vital to enable \nthese\n economies to continue to grow\n while containing emissions. \nT\nhe International Energy Agency highlighted the importance of CCS\n in\n \nits Energy Technology Perspectives 2012\n when\n \nit\n stated that “CCS is the only technology on the horizon today that would allow industrial sectors (such as iron and steel, cement and natural gas processing) to meet deep emissions reduction goals.”\nThe UK is particularly well-placed to play a leading role\n in develop\ning\n CCS \ndue to\n:\nETI \nmodelling\n \nsuggests that if CCS \nis not successfully developed \nin the UK, the annual cost of meeting carbon targets is likely to increase by \n1%\n of GDP by 2050.  \nThis impact is felt across all sectors.\nOur modelling suggests that:\nIn the transport sector this will require the abolition of liquid fuels and \nreplacing the\n entire car fleet \nwith zero\n carbon vehicles\n (electric and hydrogen)\n, which would \nbe extremely\n costly and difficult.  \nWith CCS\n introduced\n, approximately half the fleet could remain liquid fuelled\n with the remainder plug-in hybrid\n, with increasing efficiencies and use of biofuel blends.\n  Infrastructure investments would be \nmore limited and also incr\nemental,\n as the transition progresses.\n  \nIn the buildings sector no gas w\nould\n be permissible for home heating and all buildings w\nould\n need to be retrofitted with zero carbon t\nechnologies such as heat pumps,\n \ndistrict heating \n(but not gas fired) \nor biomass boilers.  \nW\nith CCS, gas boilers could be retained in difficult to retrofit houses\n,\n or for use in retrofitted houses during peak demand periods during cold weather snaps and \nif the\n electricity supply is reduced due to intermittency of renewables\n.\nThe impact in both the buildings and transport sector\n would\n increase the peak demand for \nelectricity sharply\n and t\nhis increase\n \nwould have to be \nmet from a combination of nuclear and renewables.  Because of the intermittency of renewables\n,\n and \nthe possibil\nity\n that peak demand from both the buildings and transport sectors coincides with low supply from renewables\n,\n considerable back up supply \nwould be\n needed.  Overall, the impact on the electricity sector is that \nwithout CCS \nthe \nrequired \ntotal installed \nUK ge\nneration \ncapacity is \nincreased by \nmore than \n50%\n higher.  \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
