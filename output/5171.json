"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Friends of Al-Aqsa&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Palestinian Authority lacks power and de jure and de facto sovereignty.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAid is being used to sustain a failed peace process and the occupation itself\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAid, especially in the case of the West Bank, treats the Israeli \noccupation as a temporary condition which is masking the nature and status of the occupation as a permanent fixture and thus it can be argued that aid is not assisting the Palestinians in the long term\n.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reliance on aid is a direct result of the Israel\ni occupation.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe political basis for the humanitarian crisis that generates conditions of aid remains unchallenged\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result of the occupation, the wall, restrictions by Israel and \n‘\nland grabs\n’\n, they are now unable to access their lands and therefore n\now reliant on aid\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAid to OPT can be significantly reduced, saving millions, if Israel ended its illegal occupation of Palestine.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFriends of Al-Aqsa &#xa0;\nFriends of Al-Aqsa is a UK based non-profit making NGO concerned with defending the human rights of Pal\nestinians and protecting the sacred al-Aqsa Sanctuary in Jerusalem. It is part of the United Nations network of organisations active on the question of Palestine. \nIt makes these recommendations as part of its work to help bring an end to the Israeli occup\nation of Palestinian land. \n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n              \n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.                             Effectiveness of Programmes&#xa0;\nIbrahim and Beaudet in Table 1 highlight how the actions of the donor community (we include DFID) do not meet any of the six principles for effective engagement\n. \n              \n            Table 1. Assessment of Fragile States Principles in the OPT\n             Principles                     Reality in the OPT&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTake context as the             starting pointMajor donors (the United States in particular) do not agree that \nthe core problem of the OPT is occupation. The starting point remains a series of social and economic problems related to governance issues while, in reality, the perpetuation of the occupation remains the core problem.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDo no harmDonors have done harm \nby not opposing physical destruction, human rights violations and disrespect for international law perpetrated by the Israeli occupation. They have also enhanced Palestinian divisions and opposed attempts to reconcile the different factions.\n&#xa0;\nFocus on state-buildingPalestinians so far have been unable to build their state. Moreover, the PNA is often neglected by donors who prefer quick-impact projects either under their own direct control or through private Palestinian or foreign entities.\n&#xa0;\nPrioritise preventionLittle preventive action was taken despite the predictability of recurring conflicts. The intensive clashes since 2000 were the result of the non-resolution of fundamental issues including the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Donor\ns have many times focused on the consequences rather than the causes of the impasse.\n&#xa0;\nRecognise links between political, security and development objectivesDevelopment objectives are usually secondary to political and security goals of Israel.\nA large \npart of the aid programme has been directed to security forces whose mandate is to police the Palestinian population rather than to defend their rights. Closures and illegal repression by Israel have been justified by some donors even if they are in contra\ndiction with the aid programme.\n&#xa0;\nPromote non-discriminationfor inclusive and stablesocietiesThere is clear-cut discrimination against Gaza and other parts of the OPT where local authorities or population disagree with PNA\n’\ns policies. (In Gaza, \ndevelopment cooperation has been frozen, leaving only emergency aid programmes in place).\n&#xa0;\nAlign with local prioritiesPalestinian actors (not only PNA) have been repeating that the priority is to end the occupation and, in the meantime, to improve social\n and economic conditions. Yet this priority has not been respected by donors.\nPractical coordinationCoordination with Palestinians has been minimal and erratic, even with the PNA. Coordination amongst donors is not systematic and does not cover some of \nthe main actors, such as USAID.\n&#xa0;\nAct fast and stay engagedResponses to crises have been ambiguous, especially with Gaza. Long-term commitments are unclear. Currently, aid commitments are being reduced.\n&#xa0;\nAvoid pockets of exclusionMany areas and sectors \nin the OPT, particularly in Gaza, have been excluded by donors.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nIbrahim and Beaudet\n’\ns analysis highlights that \n“…\nas long as the occupation continues and the Israeli closure policy\n \ndecimates the Palestinian economy, foreign aid can only address \nshort-term humanitarian needs rather than long-term development goals that remain the priority of the Palestinians and the international donor community\n”\n. This is due to the underlying root causes of the conflict not being addressed, namely the occupation\n of Palestine by Israel.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.                             Relieving Israel of its responsibilities&#xa0;\nSince the blockade of the Gaza strip in June 2007 a humanitarian crisis has enveloped the Gaza strip with nearly 34% of the population being unemployed in 2012 including over half i\nts youth. 44% of Palestinians in Gaza are food insecure and nearly 80% are aid recipients. 35% of Gaza\n’\ns farmland and 85% of its fishing waters are totally or partially inaccessible due to Israeli imposed restrictions. Furthermore a severe fuel and electri\ncity shortage results in outages of up to 12 hours a day. Some 90 million litres of untreated and partially treated sewage are deposited illegally in the sea each day and finally over 90% of the water from the Gaza aquifer is unsafe for human consumption w\nithout treatment\n due to the above actions of Israel. Although under the disengagement plan of 2004, Israel made clear it no longer held responsibility for those living within the Gaza strip, this is contrary to IHL.\n              \nUnder Article 42 of the 1907 Hague Reg\nulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land\n it is clear that responsibility is determined based on \n‘\neffective control\n’\n. As Al Haq illustrates, Israel continues to directly exercise control over parts of the Gaza strip. Israel\n’\ns control of the \nGaza strip includes controlling goods and services on land and air via the Gazan airspace (i.e: blocking the delivery of gas and electricity, controlling border points which control people and goods into Gazan territory), right through to its control over \nareas that would traditionally be under the ruling authorities control such as population registry to military duties (by conducting raids within the Gaza strip\n). \n              \nIsrael\n’\ns control has not relinquished since its disengagement from Gaza but has rather tig\nhtened over the years. \n              \nTherefore regardless of Israel\n’\ns biased interpretation it must still assume full responsibility for the needs of those not only in Gaza but the West Bank and East Jerusalem as provided for by the Geneva Conventions discussed earlie\nr. \n              \nTaghdisi Rad argues that by subsidising the PA, (in the form of official development assistance (ODA), it has allowed Israel to sustain the occupation without taking responsibility for the basic humanitarian needs of the people under this occupation. \nThe understanding of the international community is on the premise that the PA is responsible for the welfare of those in the West Bank and Gaza yet it is clear the PA does not have real control in order for it to assume such responsibilities. \n              \nA similar \nunderstanding can be reached of humanitarian aid in the Gaza strip given this was the main reason that the ICRC decided to withdraw from the oPT\n’\ns. It reiterated in 2004 when terminating two major humanitarian programs\n              \n \n“\nthat the obligation to take care o\nf the basic needs of any civilian population living under occupation does not lie with humanitarian organisations\n”\n \nand that humanitarian aid\n              \n“\nis never more than an exceptional and temporary measure designed to help the most vulnerable members of a \nsociety facing an acute humanitarian crisis. Under no circumstances should such aid become a substitute for the long-term measures necessary to ensure economic\n&#xa0;\nstability\n”\n.\n \nWhat is visible is that the occupation of the oPT\n’\ns and its consequences has now l\ned to a shift in the perception of the government and the public of being a humanitarian crisis rather one of being an illegal occupation which has led to humanitarian crisis.\nUnder the Fourth Geneva Convention Israel is engaged as the occupying power ther\neby also placing responsibility on Israel to rectify the situation (i.e to rebuild the demolished houses, where it has illegally caused damaged to properties\n). \nThe international community has abstained from holding Israel accountable for its actions and \ntherefore the donor community needs to ensure that Israel either compensates the owners of the houses demolished or that it pays compensation to the donor community for the repairs it has to make\n, as well as ensuring that assistance is provided to those l\niving in oPT\n’\ns. The donor community needs to do so urgently as by simply providing funds to rebuild infrastructure or humanitarian aid, the donor community is implicitly encouraging violations of international law and indirectly permitting Israel to contin\nue to operate outside the framework of its legal responsibilities\n. \n              \n              \n3.                            Funding the Administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its effects              \n              \nThe flagship development of the PA has been universally recognised as the cornerstone of the donor c\nommunity\n’\ns vision for providing aid to the oPT\n’\ns. The donor community from the time of the Oslo accords have made their investments with the belief that they were helping to build a future Palestinian state that was politically and economically self suffic\nient\n.  \n              \nOne of DFID's main objective has been that of state building. There recurrent aid donations have been with the view of supporting the PA on the path to self-sufficiency, however a number of problems have emerged along the way. \n              \nThe PA\n’\ns inabilit\ny to generate sufficient economic growth means they have suffered permanent budgetary problems\n. \n              \nThe underlying reasons for the PA\n’\ns lack of economic growth stem from its lack of real economic base. Clearance revenue during 2013 continued to be the main \nsource of Palestinian public revenue and accounted for 70 per cent of total revenue covering 84 per \ncent of the public wage bill and 45 per cent of current expenditure\n. As part of the Paris Economic Protocol a clause was set allowing Israel to collect rev\nenue on behalf of the PA which was subsequently transferred to the PA. This revenue was generated from VAT and Import taxes Israel levied on Palestinian imports transiting Israel\n. \n              \nHowever \n“\nthis arrangement gives Israel leverage over the Palestinian Auth\nority, leaving it hostage to political pressure\n”\n. On a number of occasions Israel has withheld such clearance revenue, most recently in the aftermath of Palestine becoming a non \n–\n \nmember observer state of the United Nations in 2012\n. This leverage has \nleft the PA at the mercy of Israel thereby leaving them unable to pay the salaries of the 170,000 civil servants in the West Bank and Gaza\n. \n              \nClearance revenue remains the main source of income due to Israel\n’\ns continued control over the oPT\n’\ns, which has \nstifled the economy of the oPT\n’\ns. Israel\n’\ns closure policy which includes its restrictions on free movement of people, goods and services via its checkpoints, roadblocks, separation wall and its external and internal border control\n, prevents workers from a\nccessing their places of work. Israel\n’\ns expansion of settlements means that many Palestinians have been dispossessed of fertile agricultural land. Many previously grew produce that they subsequently exported. Furthermore Israel\n’\ns security restrictions sinc\ne 2000 means that certain products which Israel regards as dual use are restricted or delayed in entering the West Bank and in particular Gaza, causing widespread difficulties for businesses within the oPT\n’\ns.  \n              \nWithout a functioning economy the PA, as a r\nesult of its inability to generate income, remains highly dependent on international aid\n for budgetary assistance. \n“\nThe\nPalestinian economy would have robust growth under better political and security conditions\n”\n, namely Israel bringing an \n“\nend to its bor\nder closures, roadblocks, curfews, and travel restrictions\n”\n \nand therefore ultimately its occupation of the oPT\n’\ns. \n&#xa0;\n              \nLe More therefore highlights how aid amidst the total collapse of the PA and the economy\n  has created an environment where \n“\naid [is being\n used] to keep the PA alive (rather than build institutions) and pay for its running costs and the salaries of its civil servants\n”\n. 2008\n. This is in addition to \n“\nhumanitarian aid which almost doubled, from $491m in 2005 to $885m in 2008\n”\n. The statistics \ntherefore highlight that official aid assistance is predominantly spent on budgetary support, emergency assistance and humanitarian relief\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nThis is in contradiction to the original purpose of the PA which was to help create an economy that was able to g\nenerate sufficient income and to create an economically prosperous Palestinian state. It is important to remember that the role of Aid is not to prop up a government but rather help it to achieve its goals, which currently the PA is not doing. It is in fac\nt doing the opposite in maintaining the status quo within the oPT\n’\ns, thereby disguising the true effect of the occupation on the oPT\n’\ns.  The PA ultimately lacks sovereignty to influence and create its own policies.\n&#xa0;\n              \nSayigh similarly argues that the donor \ncommunity is\n \n“\nlocked into policies that are bringing about the very humanitarian crisis it seeks to alleviate, while generating long-term dependence on external funding\n”\n. \nQarmout and Beland advocate further  that not only is this bringing about the humani\ntarian crisis but in fact aid has helped to perpetrate the humanitarian crisis by supporting the international aid community to take over the responsibilities of a dysfunctional government  and by assisting the government to meet the needs of its people wh\nere it has limited autonomy. They argue this has created greater instability\n and ultimately reinforces the lack of sovereignty that the PA currently has.\n              \n              \nA 2013 World Bank report has highlighted how if Israeli restrictions were lifted this would ensure\n an increase in GDP, which in turn would significantly help the oPT\n’\ns fiscal position with an increase in revenue of $800 million dollars. It would reduce the fiscal deficit of the PA by almost half, which would then reduce the need for donor recurrent bud\nget support. To conclude it is extremely important the international community places a greater emphasis on encouraging Israel to lift its restrictions which are currently stifling the Palestinian economy, as opposed to simply providing ever increasing amo\nunts of aid to the PA which is not assisting the Palestinians in the long term\n nor is it allowing the PA to perform its designated role.  \n&#xa0;\n4. Recommendations&#xa0;\nBased on the information detailed above, Friends of Al-Aqsa make the following recommendations:\n \n&#xa0;\n1. Aid given to the Palestinian Authority should be made dependent on improvements to the system of governance and routing out corruption. \n&#xa0;\n2. Aid should be structured in a manner that enables Palestinian society to progress towards independence with achievable targets put in place. Thus, it should build indepdence and not dependence. \n&#xa0;\n3. The British government should promote an end to Israel\ni occupation, and recognize that the continuing Palestinian need for aid is a result of occupation policies such as land confiscations which deprive families of sustainable incomes. \n&#xa0;\n Irene Calis, \n‘\nAid and Occupation\n’\n \n(2013) 42 Journal of Palestine Studies 10, p26. \n Calis (n8) p23 \n Calis (n8) p12-16.\n Nassar Ibrahim and Pierre Beaudet, \n‘\nEffective Aid in the Occupied Palestinian Territories?\n’\n \n(2012) 12 Conflict Security and Develop\nment 481, p495-496.\n Ibrahim and Beaudet (n16) p495-496.\n Judy Barsalou, \n‘\nMissing the mark: Foreign aid to the Palestinians\n’\n \n(2003) X Middle East Policy 48, p48/49\n United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Occupied Palestinian \nTerritory (OCHA-OPT), \n‘\nFive years of blockade: the humanitarian situation in the Gaza strip\n’\n \n(OCHA-OPT, June 2012) &lt;   \nhttp://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha\n_opt_gaza_blockade_factsheet_june_2012_english.pdf\n \n&gt; accessed 6\nth\n December 2013. \n Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (adopted 18\nth\n October 1907, entr\ny into force 26\nth\n January 1910) \n187 CTS 227\n \nAl-Haq, \n‘\nAl-Haq\n’\ns Rejoinder to Gisha\n’\ns \"Scale of Control\" Position Paper: Israel\n’\ns Continued Responsibility as the Occupying Power in the Gaza Strip\n’\n \n(Al-Haq, 12\nth\n December 2011)\n \n &lt; \nhttp://www.alhaq.org/images/stories/PDF/Gisha-Rejoinder.pdf\n &gt; accessed 6\nth\n December 2013. p1/2\n Electronic Intifada, \n‘\nAssistance is not a long term solution\n’\n \n(Electronic Intifada, \n31\nst\n January 2004) &lt; \nhttp://electronicintifada.net/content/assistance-not-long-term-solution/5010\n &gt; accessed 6\nth\n December 2013. \n Electronic Intifada (n45) \n Harv\nard University (n48)\n Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (n47) p33. \n Palestinian and Israeli Human Rights Organisations, \n‘\nCall for an end to international donor complicity in Israeli violations of International law \n–\n \n4 Mat 2009 (excerpts)\n’\n \n(2009) 3\n8 Journal of Palestine Studies 208, p209\n Barsalou, (n20) p53.\n CIDSE, \n‘\nThe EU\n’\ns aid to the Occupied Palestinian Territory (II) \n–\n \nThe deepening crisis in Gaza\n’\n \n(CIDSE, June 2009) p12.\n UNCTAD (2013) (n66) p8.\n Protocol on Economic Relations between the\n Government of the State of Israel and the P.L.O representing the Palestinian People (n60)\n UNCTAD (2013) (n66) p8\n UNCTAD (2013) (n66) p8.\n BBC News, \n‘\nEU must stop paying Gaza officials - auditors\n’\n \n(BBC News, 11\nth \nDecember 2013) &lt;  \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25330437\n \n&gt; last accessed 17\nth\n December 2013.\n Micheal Keating, Anne Le More and Robert Lowe (eds) \nAid, Diplomacy and Facts on the ground : The case of Pa\nlestine \n(Chatham House, 2005) \n Palestinian Authority Monitor, \n‘\nCountry Intelligence: Report : Palestinian Authority\n’\n \n[November 2013] Buisness Source Premier 1, 3\n Palestinian Authority Monitor (n77) p3\n Anne le More, \n‘\nKilling with kindness: funding the\n demise of a Palestinian state\n’\n \n2005 81 International Affairs 981, p982.\n The Portland Trust, \n‘\nReducing aid dependency in the Palestinian territory\n’\n \n(The Portland Trust, May 2011) &lt; \nhttp://www.portlandtrust.org/sites/default/files/peb/special_economic_feature_may__2011.pdf\n \nlast accessed 17\nth\n December 2013. p3\n Portland Trust (n79) p2\n Yezid Sayigh, \n‘\nInducing a failed state in Palestine\n’\n \n2007 49 S\nurvival: Global Politics and Strategy 7, \np7\n Sayigh (n81) p8  \n Qarmout and Beland (n7) p37\n World Bank, \n‘\nWest Bank and Gaza \n–\n \nArea C and the future of the Palestinian economy\n’\n \n(World Bank, 2\nnd\n October 2013\n’\n \n&lt;\nhttp://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/10/03/00\n0456286_20131003173450/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220GZ0Are030Box379840B00OUO090.pdf\n &gt; last accessed 17\nth\n November 2013 p XI.
