"&#xa0;\nPeak and Northern Footpaths Society (PNFS) – Written evidencePROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE DRAFT DEREGULATION BILL1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPNFS is a registered charity which has been active for well over 100 years, promoting the interests of the users of footpaths and other public rights of way in the North Midlands and the North-west of England. The Society has over 1250 members and a large number of affiliated groups such as parish councils and walking groups. We monitor and seek to protect and improve the public rights of way network for the benefit of all walkers. We are a statutory \nconsultee\n for public path and modification orders made by the local authorities within our area.\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnsealed routes which carry public rights of way are a very important asset for walkers, particularly as they are usually well defined, easy to follow, long, and pass through attractive countryside. When the surfaces of such routes are destroyed by the use of mechanically propelled vehicles, so that it becomes very difficult or impossible for people to walk safely along them, and when the noise of vehicles disrupts the peace of the countryside, walkers are severely disadvantaged. To base the existence of public rights for motorised vehicles on historic rights for horses and carts is nonsense. England’s rights of way network evolved for the use of walkers, \nhorseriders\n and non-motorised vehicles, and as such it supports the recreation, health, and sustainable transport aspirations of government and the public. \n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPNFS is a member of the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG) which has submitted evidence to the Committee regarding this Bill (21 August 2013). PNFS also supports the work of the Peak District Green Lanes Association (PDGLA), which has also submitted evidence, including specific details of damage caused by motorised vehicles to green lanes in the Peak District. We refer you to this evidence, which it is not necessary to repeat here.\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPNFS strongly supports the amendments to the Draft Bill proposed by these organisations, specifically:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRhoda Barnett\nCourts and Inquiries Officer (Derbyshire), PNFS\n8 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
