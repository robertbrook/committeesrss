[normal]I, like
[normal] many other people, do love the BBC and it is a wonderful creation of the British Nation and it should serve the nation well in providing news and entertainment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, in recent years 
[normal]it has become a master to itself rather than a servant to the nation
[normal].  Money has been spent like water with little or no accountability, proper checks on the safety of people (especially young people) have not been carried out, it has overpaid many of its staff and paid 
[normal]far too high amounts in redundancy or pension payment
[normal]s and it has lost sight of its core values and responsibilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It has shown scenes of violence, sex and bad language which are not necessary and which have upset many people and been available to young people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It has also been subject to claims of bias
[normal]ed reporting.  I understand that this is a subjective matter on which many people will disagree.  I believe it has consistently been pro-PLA in its reporting of the situation 
[normal]in the Middle East as opposed to reporting the Israeli position in equal terms.
