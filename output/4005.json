"5\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Robert Hay (CMI 001)\n&#xa0;\nEvidence of Robert Hay FRCSE Orthopaedic Surgeon to the select committee on “Reducing the cost of Whiplash Claims”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMy Qualifications&#xa0;Qualified MB ChB Edinburgh \nTrained and qualified in general and then Orthopaedic Surgery\nL\necturer in orthopaedic Surgery \nUniversity of Edinburgh\nLecturer in orthopaedic and spinal Surgery   University of Hong Kong\nSpinal and orthopaedic surgeon Duchess of Kent Childrens Orthopaedic Hospital\nOrthopaedic and trauma Surgeon SE Thames Regional health Authority 25 Yrs\nRetained expert in innumerable personal injury cases\n&#xa0;\nS\nummary &#xa0;It is my belief that an undesirable provider driven whiplash industry has developed in this country that defrauds the insurance industry and that the vast majority of such claims are exaggerated or contrived, and that the current adversarial legal system is an inappropriate tool for assessing damages.\n&#xa0;\nI have had extensive experience in the management and treatment of spinal, including neck injury, both within and outwith\n \nthe medico legal context. I have written many hundreds of medical reports for both claimant and defendant in personal injury litigation.\n&#xa0;\nI am well informed on the\n \nlarge body of medical evidence on\n \nthe subject, and in passing would recommend any party interested in this subject to Malleson’s scholarly book “Whiplash and other useful Illnesses.” McGill Press.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe clinical problem&#xa0;Although a high speed rear end impact can cause severe, and occasionally fatal injury the vast majority of  whiplash claims are the result of lesser and frequently trivial impacts.\n&#xa0;\nOn impact the occupant’s \nhead is first jerked backwards \nand rebounds off the head restraint. Extreme hyperextension of the neck which prompted the first use (\nUSA\n 1938) of the term “\nwhiplash” does not now occur because of universal head restraints. \n&#xa0;\n It is very rare in whiplash cases for there to be any truly objective signs of injury. X rays are usually taken defensively if the patient attends hospital and rarely show any abnormality \n&#xa0;\nI shall use the term \nPUWC (Prolonged Unconfirmable Whiplash Complaints) in the following discussion into which category the vast majority of whiplash claimants fall.\n&#xa0;\nThe injury is best regarded as a sprain of the neck which is expected to give rise to some pain and stiffness for a few weeks like sprains elsewhere in the body (eg sprained ankle) and then return to normal.\n&#xa0;\nThe usual claimant however continues with complaints months or years after recovery is expected,  Such persistence of symptoms are often ratified and encouraged by persons whose income depends on offering treatment eg physiotherapists, osteopaths, and the transcription of symptoms into documents and case notes often gives a spurious ratification to symptoms.\n&#xa0;\nIn the assessment of injury therefore no reliance should be placed on the observations of anyone with a pecuniary interest in the case.\n&#xa0;\nEarly access to physiotherapy (the rehabilitation code) has compounded the problem appearing to ratify injury before the presence or absence of injury has been assessed. \n&#xa0;\nThe Claim Problem&#xa0;\nIn recent years following similar process in the \nUSA\n the number of whiplash cases seeking compensation has risen alarmingly for the following reasons. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Diagnosis&#xa0;\nGenuine significant neck injury\n for example fracture or dislocation or both\n presents \nno\n difficulty in diagnosis\n. Without such damage the injury is a ligament or muscle strain and spontaneous recovery is expected within a matter of weeks.\n&#xa0;\nFinding a investigation (scan\n,\n \nx ray or blood test) to confirm whiplash in the hope of distinguishing the genuine from the fraudulent is a forlorn hope, certainly with current technology.\n&#xa0;\nThe fraudulent is easily identified by the perceptive expert, but persons with a pecuniary interest in management or an expert with ambitions to expand their practice will not do so.\n&#xa0;\nAmong the features which I have found consistent in the fraudulent claimant are\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRemarkable facts on PUWC =  (Protracted Unconfirmable Whiplash Complaints), which give grounds for suspicion of overstatement&#xa0;After settlement the claimant often makes a s\nurprising recovery which they \nattribute, not to the pay out, but to some unconventional \ntreatment \nwhich was \nnot\n \navailable\n \nto\n \nthem\n \nwhile\n
