"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Glass and Glazing Federation (HOT29)The GGF is the main representative organisation for companies involved in all aspects of the manufacture of flat glass and products and services for all types of glazing, in commercial and dom\nestic sectors. The GGF has approximately 500 members of all sizes who can be found in over 1,500 business locations throughout the UK.\nQuestion 1: Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand?A key part of reducing heat demand \nis ensuring that there is less \nheat \nwaste\n.  This is best achieved by increasing energy efficiency, particularly in \nthe UK’s\n building\n \nstock\n which is currently a significant contributor to carbon loss and heat waste. A\nround \none\n third\n of the heat produced by \na central heating system is \nrapidly lost through \na building’s \nroof, walls, doors, windows and floors\n,\n and \naccording to the Energy Saving Trust, \n25% \nof\n heat from a building escapes through non ene\nrgy efficient windows and doors\n.\n \nWhilst\n \nthe \nGGF \nacknowledges \nthat the Government has made positive steps towards addressing the \nneed to increase the\n energy efficiency\n of the UK’s housing stock in order to reduce heat waste\n, we believe that there is still much that should be done. \nThe GGF is supportive of the Govern\nment’s introduction of the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation\n (ECO)\n, as part of the UK’s efforts to reduce heat energy demand.\n \nHowever\n, despite the benefits of the scheme, \nthe recent figures published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change\n have revealed that there has been a slow uptake. \n \nThe GGF believes that the \nG\novernment must do more to incentivise uptake of the Green Dea\nl\n and ECO\n in order to reduce waste\n, reduce heat energy demand\n and meet the UK’s carbon targets\n. \n \nA number of Green D\neal trials have \nrevealed \nthat windows are popular with consumers\n. For example, a\n \ntrial by Gentoo revealed that double glazing \nwas very popular with customers\n who\n reported that windows offered extra benefits to other measures, which therefore made them mor\ne likely to install double glazing rather than any other measure. Participants in the trial reported feeling an extra sense of warmth and security and noted the importance of double glazing in blocking out excess sound. \n Windows can also play an important \nrole in encouraging consumers to install further measures in their homes, thereby helping to encourage a consumer to \nadopt a “whole house” approach\n. \n For example, there is much interaction between solid wall insulation (SWI) and windows, as to undertake SW\nI work correctly the windows should be replaced or the existing windows removed and reinstalled on wider projection sills and possibly external linings. The GGF has found that \nhouseholders\n \nare often disinterested in solid wall insulation however, as recent\n Green Deal trials have demonstrated, they are attracted to the idea of new windows and doors.  \nGiven the popularity of windows with consumers, the GGF believes that more must be done to make windows a more attractive proposition under the Green Deal as t\nhis could result in more consumers improving their windows and installing other measures at the same time. As such, alt\nhough the GGF \nis supportive of the \nsteps taken by the Government to improve energy efficiency and reduce heat waste, we believe that \nfurt\nher incentives must be introduced to encourage take up of the \nGreen Deal and \nECO \nand would support the introduction of\n such schemes as\n \nvariable rates of stamp duty and council tax based on the energy efficiency of a property as an incentive to Green Deal u\nptake.\n  \nIn addition, t\nhe GGF \nbelieves that DECC has made positive steps towards correcting an \nECO\n Statutory Instrument \n(SI) \nwhich \nto date has had a significant effect in dis\n-\nincentivising consumers from installing windows under the ECO.  On the 24\nth\n July \n2013, DECC published a consultation document which seeks views on \nallow\ning\n energy suppliers to count a higher carbon saving score towards their targets for delivering replacement window units compared to under the existing rule.\n \n  It is vital that this change to the existing SI be made in order to\n encourage more window installation\ns\n under ECO which, give\nn\n the popularity of windows and the focus on a whole house approach, could lead to increased uptake of further energy e\nfficiency \nmeasures in the home, resulting in a\n further\n reduction of heat energy demand. \nQuestion 2: What progress is the government making on reducing the demand for heat?Although the government has made some progress on addressing the UK’s need to make its buildi\nng stock much more energy efficient, the GGF believes that more must be done to \nincentivise \nhouseholders and commercial property owners to increase the ene\nrgy efficiency of their properties\n.  As mentioned above, the Government has a vital role to play in i\nncentivising this uptake in order for the UK to make real progress towards meeting its carbon targets.   \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-deal-and-energy-company-obligation-eco-monthly-statistics-august-2013\n \n \nhttp://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=gentoo%20-%20a%20look%20at%20a%20pay%20as%20you%20save%20trial&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gentoogroup.com%2FPay_As_You_Save%2FPay_As_You_Save_Part_1&amp;ei=0-0rT4LjPIiu8APflqjhDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHlc6\n31VD3eaNAkC5UAGwyQkXNcg\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/updates-to-the-electricity-and-gas-energy-companies-ob\nligation-order-2012\n&#xa0;\n"
