[normal]Written submission by Lord Cormack (VEP 0038)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I would wish to commend the following proposal to the Committee, namely, that prisoners who are on remand, or who are serving a sentence of twelve months or less, should be allowed to vote. If a Member of Parliament is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months or less, he/she can remain a Member of Parliament. It seems to me somewhat illogical that a prisoner sentenced for a similar term should be deprived of the franchise and I commend this proposal to the Committee for their consideration.
