[normal]Written evidence from Freight on Rail (CYS0111)[bold]Freight on Rail thanks the Transport Select Committee for the opportunity to comment on its 
[normal]follow up 
[normal]inquiry into
[normal] cycling safety
[normal].  We are commenting on 
[normal]2
[normal] of the subject headings.
[normal]Freight 
[normal]on Rail, a partnership of the rail freight industry, the transport trade unions and Campaign for Better Transport, works to promote the economic, social and environmental benefits of rail freight to local and central Government.
[normal]What central and local Gove
[normal]rnment could do to improve cycling safety. Ideas could include better training and advice for drivers and cyclists, better enforcement of the law applying to drivers and cyclists, and better vehicle and road infrastructure.
[normal]Lack of enforcement of road regu[bold]lations with regard to HGVs add[bold]s[bold] to dangers.[bold]Improved enforcement of vehicle standards would 
[normal] 
[normal]help 
[normal]ensure that 
[normal]all lorries meet legal guidelines 
[normal]which are designed for safety reasons. The r
[normal]oad haulage industry has a poor record in complying with existing r
[normal]oad regulations
[normal] which puts other road users, especially cyclists, at added risk.
[normal]In the UK,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]83% of HGVs exceeded their speed limit of 50 mph on dual carriageways and over 70% exceeded the 40 mph limit on single carriageway roads.

[normal]Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at 
[normal]peak hours.
[normal]In analysing cycling fatalities involving HGVs it is 
[normal]important to look at Government policy about HGV safety holistically. For example it is r
[normal]elevant to examine HGV involvement in all road fatalities
[normal] because 
[normal]there are serious inconsistencies in
[normal] Government policy 
[normal]with regard to 
[normal]HGV
[normal] safety which could make cycling more dangerous. Therefore the following issues need to be taken into account:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. HGV involvement in fatalities is rising as other categories of fatal collisions reduce.
[normal]2. DfT authoris
[normal]ed ten year trials of 7ft longer HGVs are more dangerous to cyclists
[normal]3. Impact on cyclists of increasing HGV single carriageway speeds to 45 or 50 mph.
[normal]4. Impact on cyclists of Government policy allowing cross border traffic of mega trucks in the revision 
[normal]of European Weights and Measures Legislation 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. General picture of HGV involvement in fatalities is rising [bold]Lorries are involved in a increasing percentage of fatal traffic accidents on Britain's roads. 
[normal]MTRU analysis using DfT statistics 
[normal]show
[normal]s
[normal] that 
[normal]in 
[normal]2013
[normal] HGVs were implicated in more than half of fatal motorway accidents and one-in-five fatal accidents on A-roads
[normal] continuing negative trends over the last five 
[normal]years.
[normal]This new research shows lorries are involved in a high percentage of the most serious a
[normal]ccidents on our roads and that the problem is getting worse. 
[normal]Therefore, we believe t
[normal]he Government should be taking steps to reduce the dangers posed by lorries
[normal] instead of introducing initiatives to al
[normal]low 
[normal]7ft 
[normal]longer lorries and 
[normal]considering 
[normal]higher speed limi
[normal]ts for HGVs on single carriageways
[normal], for example
[normal].
[normal]The assessment of official statistics, carried out by the Metropolitan Transport Research Unit (MTRU) for Campaign for Better Transport, showed that the ratio of fatal road accidents involving Heavy Good Ve
[normal]hicles (HGVs) compared with those involving other vehicle types has been climbing year on year:

[normal]he Government allowed trials of longer trailers despite the fact that these vehicles are more dangerous to cyclists 
[normal]and other vulnerable road users 
[normal]than existing HGVs
[normal],
[normal] especially on urban roads
[normal].
[normal]In fact, the 
[normal]Government did not even evaluate the impact on cyclists.
[normal]The then Minister, Mike 
[normal]Penning
[normal],
[normal] state
[normal]d in Parliament on 15
[normal]th
[normal] September 2011 
[normal]that 
[normal]the risk is not there for 
[normal]cyclists 
[normal]despite the fact that 
[normal]a subsequent PQ showed that 
[normal]the Government 
[normal]did not 
[normal]disaggregate the risk by road user
[normal]The revised Impact Assessment published with the Government's Report on the Consultation into longer semi-trailers does not disaggregate the safety risk between different categories of road user”
[normal] 
[normal](

[normal]The Government’s own tests showed that the new longer lorries 
[normal]7ft (
[normal]2.05 metres
[normal])
[normal] longer which are 18.55m long, have a greater tail swing, increased driver blind spots and inferior manoeuvrability which makes them more dangerous to cyclists.
[normal] Many urban junctions would simply not be able to accommodate these longer trucks, forcing them 
[normal]to mount kerbs, traffic islands or enter adjacent lanes when turning. 
[normal]Therefore, it is imperative that the longer HGVs are restricted to designated local authority routes agreed by the local authority and the operator. 
[normal]CBT 
[normal]research,
[normal] 
[normal]shows that because of 
[normal]their reduced manoeuvrability, particularly while cornering (known as out-swing) these trailers are unsuitable for many of 
[normal]urban 
[normal]the roads on which they are being used. 
[normal]CBT and the Technical Advisers’ Group has 
[normal]written to 
[normal]the Secretary of State calling on 
[normal]him to give local authorities the right to dictate which routes these lorries can travel on. 
[normal]As the DfT consultation stated, the new longer lorries, which are up to 18.55 m long, have a greater tail swing [1] and larger driver blind spots than existing 16.50 m trucks. The demonstration of the 18.55 m HGV at Millbrook on June 27th 2013 confirmed th
[normal]at the longer HGV has inferior manoeuvrability compared with the existing 16.50 m lorries which makes negotiating tight turns on urban roads even more difficult . A demonstration of the new longer vehicle at the Department for Transport’s testing facility 
[normal]in Millbrook Bedfordshire showed the rear tail-swing when turning corners was significantly greater than normal HGVs, up to 1.3  m greater under normal road conditions, and would occur within the driver’s blind spot, posing a significant threat to other ro
[normal]ad users. 
[normal] During the consultation, DfT officials had confirmed that the 18.55 m longer HGV, while meeting existing standards does not have the turning performance of existing 16.5 m HGVs.  
[normal]DfT research stated 7ft longer trailer would have increased tail 
[normal]swings and be more susceptible to cross-winds. P8 para 28. DfT Longer Semi-trailers Feasibility Study.  
[normal]The DfT research states that the longer lorry could meet existing standards with either 2 self-steer axles or a command steer axles but meeting existing
[normal] standards is not the same things as meeting existing performance Page 7 paragraph 23 DfT Feasibility Study 2011. 
[normal]3. [bold]Reviewing HGV speed limits on single[bold]&#xa0;[bold]carriageway roads[bold]Government is also showing signs of ceding to industry demands on speed limits for 
[normal]lorries. Currently, HGVs are limited to 40mph on single carriageway A-roads. Government recently consulted on plans to raise this to 45 or 50mph and is expected to make an announcement shortly
[normal]. Increasing speed of HGVs will make them more dangerous for cyc
[normal]lists.
[normal]4. [bold]Threat of mega trucks 82 ft long [bold]from revision of European directive 96/53[bold]In the current revision of the directive 96/53 governing weights and dimensions of HGVs
[normal] which is currently being considered by the Parliament and Council
[normal], the European Commission has proposed allowing cross border traffic of mega trucks between consenting countries. The industry is pushing for double articulated mega-trucks to be allowed on UK roads even though the Commission has admitted that these 25 met
[normal]re trucks can worsen road safety. 
[normal]In the Netherlands which allows mega trucks in national traffic
[normal] 
[normal]its Government
[normal] 
[normal]stated that
[normal] they 
[normal]should only be allowed on roads with a separate infrastructure for cyclists
[normal] which does not exist on most UK roads Source 
[normal]Marc
[normal]h 2010 Monitoring traffic safety Rijkswaterstaat, Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management
[normal]And Dutch 
[normal]Government experts acknowledged serious hazards of mega trucks for cyclists.  
[normal]SWOV, the Dutch national road safety 
[normal]r
[normal]esearch Institute has shown that lorries with trailers have an almost equal if not greater risk of accidents occurring on the side of the lorry or trailer and thereby doubling the risk that cyclists face 
[normal].
[normal]While it is welcome that the UK Government has st
[normal]ated that it will not allow 25 metre mega trucks on UK roads, the reality is that it will come under huge pressure from the road haulage industry again to allow these massive HGVs on competition grounds. Therefore
[normal] the only way to stop mega trucks is for th
[normal]e 
[normal]UK Government to oppose European plans for these huge lorries to be allowed to cross national borders
[normal], which it is not currently planning to do
[normal]. 
[normal]All the UK cycling organisations are opposed to mega trucks as is the European Cyclists’ Federation which re
[normal]presents their European interests. ECF stated in its briefing – gigaliners/mega trucks and road safety for cyclists January 2012 that 
[normal]However despite the lack of clear empirical evidence we believe 
[normal]that there would be increased road safety issues concernin
[normal]g blind spots; manoeuvrability and handling; infrastructure damage and changes.
