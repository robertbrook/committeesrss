"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nT. Martin Blaiklock\n (HSR 019)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;HS2 FOLLOW-UP&#xa0;Introduction:&#xa0;The Tr\nansport\n Committee is to examine the Economic Assessment of the HS2 project\n and, in particular, the KPMG Economic Assessment..\n&#xa0;\nI have been a consultant, banker and practitioner in infrastructure and energy project finance, - PFI, PPP and the like, - for the last \n30 years or more, with both UK and wide overseas experience.  I have also given Seminars and Courses on this topic in more than 40 countries \nover\n the last 5 years.\n&#xa0;\nCommentary:                            The Green Book:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. the discount rate used to express future costs and revenues in \n  \n    \ntoday’s values; and\n2.\n&#xa0;\nthe use of the concept of “Optimism Bias”.\nHence, in choosing a discoun\nt rate to bring future values back to today, we choose our \"cost of money\", or thereabouts. Mathematically, \narriving at  Present Values \nit is compound interest, \n- \nwhich we all learn \nin GCSE \nat school, \n- \nworking backwards!\n[Looking at it a different way, a “real” discount rate of 3.5% is equivalent today to around \n6.2\n% “nominal” after adding inflation (2.7%), compared with the Government’s actual, i.e. “nominal”, cost of money = \n3.7\n%!].\nIs it not surprising that they, - the DfT et al., - get their sums and comparisons of alternatives wrong???&#xa0;  [* = before 2003, a “real\n”\n discount rate of 6% p.a. was imposed\n by Treasury\n, which was equivalent to a rate of 8.5 - 9% “nominal”\n rate, when at th\nat\n time the long-term cost of borrowing for Government was around 5.5-6%.\n&#xa0;\n \nIs it not surprising, therefore, that for many PFI projects, - which push out into the future the payments Government has to make to finance the assets, like a cre\ndit card,\n \n- the projected Present Value costs for the PFI option were always going to look cheaper than conventional funding? Many PFI hospital projects suffered through such flawed decision-making.\nThe same prognosis can be applied to recent rail franchis\nes, e.g. West Coast Main\n-\nLine.\n]\nBased on a consultant’s report of a range of projects \nundertaken in 1980- 1990’s, Government/HM Treasury derived multiples, which they would apply to cost estimates. Sometimes this multiple was applied to the estimates before making adjustments for risk, sometimes afterwards**\n.\n \n[**. there is a mathematical d\nifference. Network Rail and HM Treasury for a time applied OB both ways respectively, and both claimed they were right whichever way they used it!!!]\n&#xa0;\nConclusion:Given the above, is it not time to question the use of the Green Book? I hope so, otherwise many more major UK infrastructure projects will be surrounded by controversy.\nPostscript:              Green Book Error:I\nn \nJune 2013 \nHM Treasury published an update of the 2003 \nedition of the Green Book\n.\n&#xa0;\nO\nn Jan 27, 2003 \nI alerted \nHM Treasury \n(&amp; HM\n \nTreasury ac\nknowledged\n the \nalert\n) \nthat \nthere was an error\n, \n- \nor, possibly, just a misprint!, - \nin one of the discount rates quoted in the Green Book. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThat error is still there today, 10 years on! \n&#xa0;\nI leave \nHM \nTreasury\n until 2023 to find it!! \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
