defaultThe term “community energy” refers to the ownership of renewable energy and energy efficiency assets by legal entities owned and operated for community benefit.
defaultFrequently, community energy groups choose an Industrial &amp; Provident Society (IPS) legal structure, incorporating as either a Community Benefit Society or a Co-operative.  Other organisation structures, either for the entities that own the assets or that provide support to the sector, are charities or Community Interest Companies (CICs). 
defaultAn IPS structure has become increasingly popular due to the increasing reliance on community share issues as the main source of funding.

defaultThere are approximately 400 community energy groups established with a focus on 
defaultrenewable energy, with around a half of have either completed projects or are in the feasibility and development stages. 
defaultThere is currently 58.9MW of total operational community energy capacity in the UK, made up of 146 installations.
default1
defaultSince 2003, UK community energy capacity has undergone a fourteen fold increase from 4.1MW in 2003 to 58.9MW in 2013.  This is over three times the growth rate of the UK’s total renewable energy capacity which has grown from 3.5GW to 17.6GW in the same period.
defaultThis growth has occurred alongside the introduction of various renewable specific incentives. The Renewables Obligation (RO) in 2002, the Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) and Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) in 2010 and the non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in 2011.
default 
defaultCommunity energy is still, however, just a tiny fraction of its potential size.  According to latest figures from Ofgem
default,
default it accounts for a mere 1% of feed-in tariff generation capacity.  By contrast
default, in 
defaultGermany 50% of renewable energy is owned by citizens and communities – more than twice the UK’s total renewable energy capacity.
defaultWe are committed to supporting a significant expansion of the field of community energy, with all of the social, financial and environmental benefits this will bring to communities across the UK.
defaultCommunity Energy groups tend to originate from the following sources: a Transition Town group, a local sustainability group, a local authority initiative or a response to a call for funding proposals.
defaultThe early groups working with renewables tended to arise in more wealthy areas of the UK and this is a trend that has continued. Having said this, the integration of climate change and fuel poverty incentives into policy along with the genuine desire of wealthy groups to help poorer neighbours is beginning to redress this balance. There is a growing trend for successful groups to look for new projects in the areas where they can make the biggest impact.

defaultBelow is a list of barriers 
defaultfaced by community energy groups.
default 
default  The list is not intended to be exhaustive, and inevitably each community group will encounter its own particular challenges:
defaultPlease see Appendix A for a more detailed analysis of the 
defaultspecific challenges 
defaultfaced by community energy groups seeking finance
default.   This
default highlights 
defaulta number of issues which community groups must address to secure appropriate funding.
defaultOne of the primary barriers to the expansion of community energy to the levels achieved in Germany is the difficulty that these projects have in accessing conventional finance while retaining community ownership.
defaultMost debt providers are unwilling to finance community energy projects
default,
default and even those who have a commitment to community energy are reluctant to provide funding for projects below the £2-5 million level.
defaultThis 
defaultwould leave private equity as the only other 
defaultconventional financing route for smaller projects. 
default 
defaultThis cuts out community ownership and means that financial benefits do not accrue for community benefit.
defaultThis explains why smaller-scale community energy projects to date have been funded exclusively through a combination of local equity and social finance, i.e. grants, debt or equity on preferential terms.
defaultPure Leapfrog aims to overcome this barrier by acting as an “aggregator” of smaller projects, bundling them up into portfolios of sufficient size and with the right risk/return profile for conventional finance.

defaultin aggregation can 
defaultunlock hundreds of millions of pounds of capital to fund community energy, transforming the demand for community-based renewables and making a major impact on the UK social investment market.
defaultIn order to get to a situation where individual projects, with different owners, technologies and locations can be aggregated effectively for commercial investment, there are a number of hurdles to overcome:
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReduce origination and transaction costs
defaultOrigination and transaction costs for community energy projects are too high to make conventional debt provision viable because the projects are small and they often move at a slow and erratic pace.
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevelop risk management techniques appropriate for community energy
defaultFunders often do not know how to (cost effectively) evaluate the credit-worthiness of community based organisations, which may lack a balance sheet or trading history, but are underpinned by community support.  Conventional techniques for reducing risk, e.g. expensive due diligence and insurance, are not appropriate for community-based projects.

defaultAppendix A: Analysis of funding challenges for community energy from a traditional senior debt funding perspective.defaultThis analysis makes reference to the often used ‘CAMPARI’ canons of lending, a traditional approach to senior debt funding.  It exposes a number of issues which community groups must address to secure appropriate funding.

default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat is their track record?
defaultCommunity energy projects are often developed and delivered by newly established community enterprises.  These community enterprises will likely have a limited track record, making it difficult for a funder to assess their credit quality.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a perception amongst the funding community that community groups may not ‘tied’ to projects, therefore presenting a risk that management walk away from a project.  There is, however, mixed evidence as to whether this is the case.  In some instances community individuals (who have invested their own money / have persuaded friends and family to invest) find it much more difficult to walk away from a non viable project than professional developers.  Whilst in other cases individuals (for whom community energy is not their job) find it easier abandon difficult projects.
default&#xa0;
defaultRisk mitigants may include the appointment of appropriate professionals to act on behalf of the community group.  Professional services to consider in this regard would include technical advisers / owners’ engineers, financial modelling specialists and legal advisers.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe additional costs incurred by the appointment of professional advisers often prove prohibitive to community groups seeking to establish a ‘one off’ renewables project.  Costs will need to be carefully considered and modelled.
default&#xa0;
defaultAbilitydefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat key skills / potential weaknesses do management display?
defaultNewly formed community enterprises typically include individuals with varying degrees of relevant experience and expertise.  
default&#xa0;
defaultOften less advantaged areas which would benefit significantly from community energy projects, have the lowest concentration of experience / ‘human capital’.
default&#xa0;
defaultSubject to the skills already represented within the group, communities may again consider the appointment of third party professional advisers.  As a minimum, a funder would likely expect that a suitably experienced legal adviser is engaged and that a high quality delivery partner is selected to develop, install, operate and maintain any project.
defaultMargindefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDoes the funder’s remuneration match the perceived level of risk?
defaultThe interest margin demanded by any funder will be calculated on a risk / reward system.  Community projects are typically considered higher risk than professional developer projects and therefore will demand higher margins.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis requirement for higher margins is opposed to the community group’s ability to repay.  Community groups (and particularly those seeking to establish a ‘one off’ project) will have higher set up costs than professional developers, and the additional funding cost will often be prohibitive.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo mitigate this issue, community groups should consider reducing the perceived levels of risk by employing experienced advisers and selecting high quality, proven technologies.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAggregation of projects will also allow for lower margins on later projects (when community groups have demonstrated a track record of successful operation and repayment). 
default&#xa0;
defaultPurposedefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDoes the purpose match the funder’s policy?
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIs the risk appropriate?
defaultFundamentally the funder will need to be convinced that funding will be used for the described purpose.  This ties back to the trustworthiness of borrowers, and can be mitigated by the Bank’s due diligence process.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, the project as described will need to present an appropriate level of risk.  For example, a pilot project showcasing new technologies will likely not attract senior debt lending, and may only be attractive to equity funders with a greater appetite for risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultMitigation of this issue will require a shift in funders’ mind-sets.
default&#xa0;
defaultSenior debt lenders in particular need to be:
default- convinced of the scale of the opportunity;
default- offered education and training in the sector; and
default- supported by government policy,
defaultAmountdefault-

defaultIs the amount appropriate?
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat is the debt / equity mix?
defaultThe amount of funding requested can pose difficulties both where it is relatively small (and therefore does not generate a sufficiently attractive return) and where it is relatively large (and therefore presents a too great a risk).
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunity groups must demonstrate a clear understanding of project costs and an ability to cover unforeseen cost overruns.
defaultSenior debt lenders will often require equity funding to underpin the project, taking a first loss position in an event of default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAggregation of community energy projects may develop a more attractive funding requirement.
defaultRepaymentdefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow will the debt be repaid?
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre repayments manageable?
defaultAny community energy project must demonstrate its financial viability, i.e. the project must generate sufficient revenues (for example through the FiT or RHI) or sufficient cash savings (paid for by the end user) that it can afford to service its debt repayments.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe funder will require a level of headroom such that cash flows more than cover repayments.
default&#xa0;
defaultA financial model will be required for any project, demonstrating the availability of cash to meet repayment requirements.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis model will likely be subject to audit during the funder’s due diligence process.
defaultInsurancedefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat security is available to the funder?
defaultAny funder will be mindful of its security position in an event of default, i.e. how will the funder recover its debt or equity in the event that a project does not perform as expected and modelled.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn standard property loans, for example, the funder would take security over the property in question.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is not appropriate that individuals involved in any community project should offer personal security to project.  Instead a funder may look to take an option to step into any project that is underperforming.
default&#xa0;
defaultAggregation of projects and cross-collateralisation allows a funder to take a portfolio approach to risk.  E.g. in a portfolio of 10 projects, 2 may be able to fail without senior debt repayments being impacted.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe funder will likely require a full suite of due diligence (technical, financial, legal, insurance) to confirm project viability.
default&#xa0;
defaultIdeally, a central body may step in to cover a first loss position and protect senior lenders.
