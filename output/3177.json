"&#xa0;\nHealth \nCommittee\nOral evidence:\n \n2013 accountability hearing with the Care Quality Commission\n, HC \n761\nTuesd\nay \n22\n October 2013\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published on \n22\n October 2013.\nWritten evidence from witnesses:\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCare Quality Commission\nWatch the meeting\nMembers present: \nMr Stephen \nDorrell\n (Chair); Andrew George; Barbara \nKeeley\n; Charlotte\n \nLeslie; \nAndrew Percy\n; \nDavid \nTredin\nn\nick\n;\n \nValerie \nVaz\n; \nQuestions \n1\n-\n130\nWitness\ne\ns: \nDavid Prior, Chair, and David Behan, Chief Executive,\n \nCare Quality Commission\n,\n gave evidence.  \nQ1 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYou are welcome. On \nthese\n occasions I normally ask witnesses to introduce themselves. You might feel you have been here sufficiently often for that to be unnecessary. You come on an occasion where we are at least in calmer water\n. W\ne would like to examine not just the specifics of the cases that we have discussed on previous occasions but where the CQC is on the path of improvement that was acknowledged to be necessary following both of you taking up your roles over the last 12 months. \nI would like to open by asking you this. It is an acknowledged fact\n—\nand you have both acknowledged it in public many times\n—\nthat the CQC, until recently, has not been delivering the service that the public looked to it to deliver. You have both committed the organisation to a process of renewal and raising \nof \nstandards. The core question I am interested in is\n,\n what do you think we should be looking for to assess how successful you are being in delivering that objective? \nW\nhat does good look like and how do we recognise it when we see it?\nDavid Prior: \nIt is very much work in progress\n at the moment.\n As to the new hospital inspections we have started, we will have done 18 by Christmas and we will have published a shadow rating for three of them. An assessment of those 18 inspections will be very important. The question is, \nh\nave we got underneath the skin of these hospitals? Can we actually do an inspection \nthat\n can determine whether or not that hospital is safe, well led, \nof \nhigh quality and providing compassionate care?\n \nI guess the jury is still out on that. \nI should say that\n,\n as to the ones we have done so far\n,\n we have had between 25 and 30 people on the inspection team, a large preponderance of clinicians and experts by experience as well as inspectors\n, and \nMike Richards\n’\n view is that we are getting underneath the skin of those \nhospitals, finding out what is happening and getting a real understanding of what is going on in them. If we can do that and hold it up as an accurate mirror to the public, commissioners and to other hospitals, that will be one marker in the ground in the hospital sector of what is good. It will not pick up everything. We are not going to pick up everything in a hospital. \nTo give you an idea of the size of it, \nBarts\n has revenues of £1 billion, employs 15,000 people and is on five different big hospital sites. We are not going to pick up everything in every ward, department and specialty, but we do feel that we will pick up systemic problems in those hospitals. So\n,\n \ni\nn the hospital sector\n,\n the honest answer to the question is that it is too early to say, but \nthat\n is critical to me\n. A\nre we getting under the skin of those hospitals?\n&#xa0;\nQ2 &#xa0; \nChair: Mr Behan\n, do you\n wish to \nenlarge\n on that?\nDavid Behan: \nNo, but I think it is an important question, Chair, and, just to build on what David \nhas \nsaid, public, political and professional confi\ndence has been shaky in the CQC, s\no one of my measures will be a restoration of public, political and professional confidence. \nThe way w\ne will do that \nis \nby doing what we have been set up to do\n. Y\nou personally have challenged us about clarity of purpose on numerous occasions and we have tried to settle that issue\n about our purpose and clarity of purpose. N\now \nwhat we are doing is\n building an organisation \nthat\n will deliver that purpose. We have\n reorganised at a senior level. \nAndrea is \nhere \nbehind\n me;\n Mike Richards is off to a flying start, if I may say\n so.\n \nWe are\n six inspections into the 18 b\ny Christmas. I did the Barking, \nHavering \nand Redbridge \ninspection\n for a couple of days last week and\n will join the \nBournemouth\n inspection on Friday this week\n.\n \nW\ne a\nre using that wave 1 group to think our \nway into and challenge ourselves in the way that we are taking that forward\n,\n learning from every one and tweaking the way we approach the learning we extract from each of those inspections. I am confident that\n,\n by the time we get to the end of these 18 and into the second wave beginning in January\n,\n we will have extracted the learning and will be building on that.\nQ3 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWhen will these reports start to \nreach\n the public domain?\nDavid Behan: \nWe are doing 16 inspections\n;\n \nwe\n will release them in batches of four. The first will come out in November, then December, January and February, which \nmeans they \nwill be coming out approximately eight weeks after we have completed the inspection. That will be the schedule coming through. T\nhere\nafter, we will release them as we go. We are doing that with these first batches so \nthat \nwe can extract the learning and make sure we have the calibration across all of them so that the rating and the judgment we arrive at \nin the first will\n be similar in the 16th one\n—which is why we are doing that\n.\nQ4 &#xa0; \nChair: \nDo you have any public process for \nassessing your own assessments—\nin other words\n,\n public feedback either from the hospitals themselves or from other people who may be able to provide a user\n’\ns view of your reports?\nDavid Behan: \nOn our current methodologies, Chair, we survey those that we have inspected about how they have found us and we use that information in the way that we move forward. The returns we get on that survey work show that most people are satisfied. This links to and correlates with\n—\nQ5 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut they cannot know that because they have not seen the report yet.\nDavid Behan: \nThat\n is\n on these new ones, but on the current ones we ask people and we will continue that practice. We have also recruited \nKeiran\n \nWalshe\n of \nManchester\n \nBusiness\n \nS\nchool\n to do an evaluation of wave 1 and wave 2 inspections\n,\n and we will do that along with our own internal evaluation capacity. We have built that up over the past few weeks to make sure we have the capability to do \nit. Certainly \nin \nBarking, Havering and Redbridge, \nthe chief executive was keen to point out both to myself and Mike \nat the feedback meeting \nthat staff had \nvalued \nthe way \nthat \nwe had conducted \nourselves and conducted \nthe interviews\n with them; they\n \nfelt \nthat it had been a proper process and one that they could give \nto\n.\nDavid Prior: \nCan I add to that? When the inspection report \nhas been\n written\n,\n there is then a quality summit held where the commissioners, local patient groups or anyone can come to discuss the report, which is again an important part of the process.\nDavid Behan: \nWe think we are writing these reports, Chair, for people that use services, so they will be written in a style \nthat\n is acc\nessible to patients, relatives and \nresidents\n—your family members or \nmy family members\n—\nso it is accessible to people. We do not see these as being written essentially for the providers of care. We see them being written for people who are using care. \nW\ne are keen to adopt a style \nthat\n is less bureaucratic, less legalistic in a sense\n,\n and much more about answering these five key questions around safety, effectiveness, caring, responsiveness and how well led a service is. That is the challenge. I was looking yesterday evening at one of the ones we are doing out of the first four inspections and will continue to work at that so that we are couching these reports in a language \nthat\n is accessible to ordinary people and is not written for the boards of the chief executives and executive teams.\nQ6 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThe implication of my line of questioning is to ensure that it is not just your opinion of the work that you are doing but that you are seen, real time, to be subject to assessment by precisely the kind of user groups that you \nare\n targeting\n,\n to ensure that they believe that you are speaking truth unto power\n,\n because if they do not believe that then we have not made the progress we need to make. \nDavid Behan: Quite so, and o\nne of the things we have done is this. Every inspection \nhas\n people that use services as part of the inspection teams. They are not \njust\n speaking to other users of the service\n but \nto the executive teams and non\n&#x2011;\nexecutive\n directors as well, so they are making a contribution to that. We use a people\n’\ns panel to test our language. Our strategy and consultation documents will frequently use a people\n’\ns panel to check that the language we are using is accessible and the right language to be using. \nW\ne are constantly trying and testing our approach. You and Robert Francis have said that any of our work needs to be understandable to ordinary people, so we have taken that literally and seriously to make sure we are testing our language as we go. \nLast Tuesday evening at Barking was a session with people who are using services in that hospital, so we are not just testing our method\nologies—\nwe are conducting our inspections based on the experiences of people \nwho\n are using services and making sure we are testing those as well.\nQ7 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI have a \nquick question on the report. \nEffectively, the report is a final report, is it, and no one can challenge what is in it, including the hospitals? Is that right?\nDavid Prior: \nWe provide the first draft of the report back to the hospital for them to check for factual accuracy, but it is our report\n—\nit is a final report\n—\nand it will be published. \nDavid Behan: \nOf course, a key issue is that we are committed to introducing a rating scheme. We will produce three ratings by December, so three of the 18 inspections will drive a rating. We will publish those ratings, so it is absolutely essential that the judgments that we arrive at in these inspections are our judgments because it will then drive the rating.\nQ8 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWill the rating apply to \nBarts\n and its 15,000 employees as a single rating or to dif\nferent departments within \nBarts\n if \nBarts\n is one of the\nm?\nDavid Prior: \nThere will be an overall rating\n,\n but there will also be a rating of the eight core services, which are identified as A and E\n,\n maternity, paediatrics and the like. There will also be a rat\ning for whether it is well led and \nwhether there is compassionate, safe, effective care and responsiveness. So there will be a number of ratings. Ultimately, we want to be able to rate ev\nery department in the hospital—\ndiabetes, radiology and the \nlike—\nand we think we will be able to get there \nby \nworkin\ng very closely with the r\noyal colleges\n,\n using the peer reviews and clinical audits that they do already. \nDavid Behan: \nInitially, the rating will be of a trust, but our ambition is that we will rate services within a trust. The key point here is that\n,\n if I have just had a stroke\n,\n I may be more interested in how the str\noke service is going to operate; \nif I am pregn\nant and about to give birth, I \nmight be more interested in how the maternity service is. \nI\nt is that \ndegree of \ngranularity that we \nthink we \nneed to serve, hence David\n’\ns point about the work\n we are doing with the medical r\noyal colleges in relation to what potential use we can make of th\neir clinical audits and how that\n can inform service level judgments as well as overall organisational judgments. But the background work that Jennifer Dixon did when she was at the Nuffield was saying that the degree of granularity we need about ratings needs to be about the quality and safety of services rather than overall organisations because that is ultimat\nely what members of the public—patients—\nare interested in knowing about\n.\n That is our ambition, but it will take us time to get to that.\nQ9 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThere is a final question and then I will move to others. The danger in this conversation so far is that we are making the old mistake of focusing on big acute hospitals. How does that methodology translate into inspections at primary care and small care homes and so forth?\nDavid Behan: \nAbsolutely. The approach we will take will extend across all of our services. Indeed, when Jennifer Dixon was carrying out the tasks that the Secretary of State asked \nher \nto, the appetite within the adult social care sector for what they saw as a return of ratings was huge because they had seen it having two advantages: first, it provided people who were choosing care services with a guide to what they \nchose\n; second\nly\n, they argued that it led to services being able to drive improvements because they all aspired to be good or better. That is the way that the adult social care sector has received this. Andrea\n \nonly \nstarted \ntwo weeks ago\n,\n \nbut she \nhas got off to a flying start in relation to that work\n.\n \nI\nn the document that we published last week on \n“\nA Fresh Start\n”—\nI think that was the title we gave it\n—\nwe set out how we would work with the sector to develop those ratings. We have used the phrase \n“\nco\n&#x2011;\nproduction\n.”\n We are committed to that and that is what we will see through. \nQ10 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWhen will the first batch of those reports reach the public domain?\nDavid Behan: \nWe are saying we will begin our wave 1 inspections in relation to adult social care in 2014. We will begin to make our changes from spring 2014 in relation to producing our reports in a narrative style against \nthe five questions of safety, effectiveness and caring \nand so on.\n We will begin formal consultation on the standards. We are waiting for the regulations from the Department and we expect those in the next few \nweeks. We will then consult on \nour guidance so that guidance and regulations are available from April and begin to use those through 2014\n&#x2011;\n15. \nO\nur new model will be fully rolled out to all providers on adult social care from October 2014. Our ratings initially will come \nin \nfrom October 2014 for adult social care and we will have completed our inspection and rating of every adult social care provider by March 2016. \nWe are on \na three\n&#x2011;\nyear journey to make sure we can get through all \nof \nwhat is effectively 25,000 services\n—\n17,000 residential and 8,500 domiciliary care. \nQ11 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYou have not mentioned primary care.\nDavid Behan: \nPrimary care has a similar time line. \nTo be \nbrutally honest, we need to do more work on developing that methodology and m\nodel. We will publish a sign\nposting document at the end of November\n,\n similar to \n“\nA Fresh Start\n”\n that we published last week, which will set out some of our ambitions. We will be bringing in our changes in relation to inspection of out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhours\n services from April 2014 and will be piloting our new approach to general practice from January 2014. \nT\nhat is the approach we are taking\n,\n with ratings to follow as we build that methodology. \nW\ne have pretty much nailed in quite firm detail how we will go through the period between now and 2016 to complete the transformation of the way that we operate across all three sectors over that three\n&#x2011;\nyear period.\nQ12 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nMoving on to th\ne issue of the chief inspectors—\n the thre\ne that have now been appointed—\nwhat was the fundamental weakness of the CQC for which the appointment of chief inspectors was the solution?\nDavid Prior: \nThe fundamental weakness was that we had a generic inspection model so that the same inspector would go into a dentist, an ac\nute hospital and\n a care home. Now we are organising ourselves in, if you like, three separate units, so there will be a much greater degree of specialisatio\nn than we had in the past. T\nhat is not to say that we do not recognise fully that the trend of health and social care is towards greater integration. \nWit\nhin the capacity of each inspector\n,\n at least 20% of their time will be set aside to work across the patient pathway from social care into health\n \ncare and primary care. We have gone for a much more specialist inspection model.\nQ13 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nIn relation to the status of each of those three inspectors, I notice that the chief inspector of hospitals is a board member but th\ne other two inspectors are not—\nor at least not so far as we are aware \nfrom\n your submission to us. Has that position now changed?\nDavid Prior: \nYes. All three are board members.\nQ14 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nIn terms of the function and oversight \nrole \nof the chief inspectors and the chief executive\n’\ns role in relation to the chief inspector, how would you describe that relationship and in what way can the chief executive, if you like, negotiate priority or indeed even direct those priorities of the chief inspectors?\nDavid Prior: \nThe three chief inspectors report directly to the chief executive\n,\n who is accountable to the board. That is the management accounting structure within the CQC.\nQ15 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: C\nan the chief executive, the board or the chairman challenge the judgment\ns\n or conclusions of the chief inspectors?\nDavid Prior: \nYes. There will be a very robust discussion at times about what they want to do and how they want to do it. What is critical is that the judgment is independent of the NHS system and independent of the\n Secretary of State for health.\nDavid Behan: \nThe thing that I would emphasise, Andrew, is that, in a legal sense, Parliament has given the CQC as a body the power to inspect and regulate. The 2008 Act sets out our duties and responsibilities and they will be amended by the Bill that is currently in the Lords\n,\n which will be coming into this House soon\n. When that Bill secures Royal A\nssent\n,\n it will introduce new powers and amend some of the powers that were in the Act. \nI\nt is through the delegations document from the board to me\n,\n from me to the chief inspectors and from the chief inspectors through the organisation that we carry out our responsibilities. I see my job as to support the chief inspectors to do their job. I am the accounting officer and the chief executive of the organisation. That is how I see the difference. I do not see myself making operational decisions, but\n,\n if an internal appeal is required \non\n a decision made \nby \na chief inspector, it may well be\n \nthat I would consider an appeal\n,\n \nin the way that that operates \ninternally\n. Of course\n people can go externally to tribunals and other places, but I think it is clear. I know there has been a lot of discussion about the nature of the role\n,\n \nthe \nresponsibility\n and so on\n, but I see the power and authority to act \nas\n \nbeing \nwith the \nc\nommission\n,\n and \nthen \nthrough our system of delegations to me\n,\n and then, through me, to the chief inspectors\n,\n and through the organisation to others as well. There is no way, with 25,000 inspections, that Andrea is going to do every inspection in adult social care. So you need a system of delegations that is clear about who is delegated to do what, when, where, why and how\n,\n and that is the work that we will do as we continue the transformation and change within the organisation\n,\n to set out a\nn organisational structure that\n can deliver our purpose with a set of systems and processes \nthat \nallow us to do that. I do not wish to be boring and bureaucratic about this, but process has its place and we need to make sure it has its proper place in the way that we set up the organisation to move forward.\nQ16 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nIf we as a Select Committee, for example, undertook an inquiry in the adult social care sector and felt we needed to look at the quality or \nthe \noutcomes of in\nspections within that sector,\n would \nit \nbe you, Mr Behan, as the chief executive of the CQC, who would come and take overall responsibility for the actions of the CQC in that respect, \nand not the chief inspector?\n \nDavid Behan: \nI think this is a good question\n.\n \nJ\nust to pick a\n way carefully through the\n difference between accountability and responsibility\n,\n I would see myself as being accountable for the work that goes on in adult social care and Andrea \nas \nbeing responsible f\nor the way that is taken forward\n. But I would account to the board for that work. This is my point about the power that we have under the legislation, which is \nfor\n the organisation as a body\n,\n not \nfor us as individuals. P\nutting the chief inspectors on a statutory footing preserves their role in statute so that it cannot be done away with, in a sense. It does not invest in them special powers\n. The powers that exist are for\n the Commission. \nQ17 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nSo they are accountable to you in the sense that you take an oversight of their work\n,\n but at board level you are accountable to them. How does that work?\nDavid Prior: \nI do not think that is\n—\nDavid Behan: We have got a \nunitary board\n—\nDavid Prior: \nLet us take a case in point. Andrea is in the room. If we felt that she was not performing, that she was not up to the job\n—\nI am \nsure that is not the case, so this\n is highly hypothetical\n—\nthe board would say, \n“S\norry, Andrea, you\n’\nre not making it, so we\n’\nre going to recruit somebody else.\n”\n \nT\no that extent she is accountable to us.\nQ18 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nThat is helpful. The Department of Health in its evidence to us says that establishing the position of the chief inspector\ns\n on a permanent statutory \nfooting will “ensure that individuals who are appointed to the roles are able to speak up for patients and provide clear judgments about quality of care.”\n In relation to that role, will they be sufficiently independent to be advocates and champions within their sector?\nDavid Prior: \nThey will be\n,\n and so will the CQC. The whole thrust of\n \nthis change to\n \nthe Care Bill\n, and what lies behind it,\n is to make us demonstrably more independent.\nQ19 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nFinally, on inspections of hospitals, there has been a lot sai\nd, both in the Mid Staffs\n report\n—\nthe Francis inquiry\n—\nand elsewhere \nabout \nhow one objectively measures the quality of care at hospital ward level. Given that there is now \na lot of professional pressure, \nand some political pressure, I should admit, in\ncluding from myself and others, \nto address the issue of adequate registered nurse staffing levels\n on the hospital ward, and s\nince you are going into much more specialised inspections\n—\nin this case, of hospitals\n—\nwill \nyou establish, \nbefore you even go in and see what it is like on the ground, in terms of the inputs going into the service itself,\n \nany objective measures or new objective tools \nthat\n you will use to assess how the hospital is doing?\n \n              \nDavid Behan: \nWe are working with NICE and NHS England on exactly this issue\n,\n about a tool that can assess the adequacy of staffing. The fundamental standards will also address this issue, so the regulations will need to address the appropriateness of staffing. \nW\ne continue to work with, as I say, NHS England, NICE and the Departme\nnt of Health on exactly this. For\n our new inspections, one of the key issues that we are exploring is the adequacy and appropriateness of staffing to ensure that people \nreceive safe \nhigh\n-\nquality care. \nJ\nust this week\n Mike\n has met with colleagues in NHS England and had conversations with them about exactly these issues. \nSo w\ne continue to make good prog\nress on this—and, yes, we will. \nThe issue is really \nwhether we \nwill just assess against a particular \nratio, and whether the ratio will be set.\n That presents more difficulties because I do not think all services, hospitals, care homes or primary medical services are homogenous in the way you can set the ratio. The geography, the physical \nenvironment, is different and the ratio\n needs to be appropriate to the particular set of circumstances at the time. \nBut \nwe \nalso \nknow from our experience that the quality of care that people receive is related to the number of staff on duty\n,\n and actually making sure that there are sufficient staff on duty is an essential assessment, an essential judgment\n,\n that we need to make around the quality and safety of care that we are assessing.\nQ20 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: Yes, o\nkay. You recognise that obviously\n,\n in the acute setting\n—although \nI know there is no standard acute ward\n—\nthat is quite different\n,\n because in \ny\nour answer you provided a whole range of different scenarios as to where staffing levels might vary, and quite rightly so. But in t\nerms of the acute hospital ward,\n you would at least acknowledge the fact that adequate staffing\n—\nthis is very important\n,\n because you use the word \n“\nstaff\n”—includes \nthe clinically\n \ntrained registered nurse levels on those wards\n. That\n is very much the focus of where the professions are pushing both the inspectors as well as the hospital providers.\nDavid Behan: \nAbsolutely. We see it as being an absolutely fundamental issue that we need \nto \nlook at, so the\nre is the\n skill mix, \nand ensuring that \nthe number of qualified staff \nis \nsufficient to \nmeet the \nacuity\n of the people that are in those services\n,\n but \nthere is \nalso the geography of those services.\n The physical geography of the\n wards can be very different\n. I\nf you have single room occupancy as distinct from more open wards\n,\n that is going to have a very direct impact on the number of people and the skill mix that you are going to need on duty to make sure that people are adequately assessed. The\nre is also the\n difference between intensive care units and acute admissio\nn wards\n. So, yes, we do think that is an important issue\n,\n and\n we are looking carefully at i\nt. \nThe other thing that we want to see is not what the establishment is\n,\n but how many people are actually there. \nT\nhis last week at Barking I was with a qualified nurse looking at A and E and that is what we were exploring: what was the difference between the establishment and the number of staff that were on duty\n?\n That is exactly the conversation we had. So it is also about being granular in the questions we are asking as we go through and do our inspections to make sure \nthat \nwe have an accurate understanding\n,\n not \nof \nwhat people\n’\ns plans are but \nof \nthe actuality of the delivery.\nDavid Prior: \nWe\n need to know that the hospital\n knows that \nit\n has done a proper assessment of the right levels of staffing in their wards. If we know they have done that work\n—that \nthey have \ndone a proper dependency audit, \nan \nacuity\n audit\n—\nwe take a lot of confidence from that.\nQ21 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThis is on the same point. I am \nrather \nastonished that we ke\nep going round and round and round this issue, and i\nt gets \nterr\nibly frustrating for us here that you are \nstill \ntalking to people in NHS England and NICE\n about this\n. \nO\nur latest report included an example of how it is done in one hospital, which is one of the s\nafest hospitals in the country—\nhow they use a safe staffing tool and h\now they publish both the numbers of\n how many staff there should be\n on duty, and how many there are.\n \nThey\n have bee\nn doing that since the summer, s\no why on earth you have to keep going round and round this, I do not know. \nQ\nuestions \nhave been raised here today. \n              \nThis\n is an incredibly important time\n,\n as the chief inspectors\n’\n roles are established, and I understand it was reported that Robert Francis called a meeting with yo\nu recently for a rethink on safe staffing levels,\n and said that minimum staffing levels should be an alarm bell for questions about safety. It seems, to a certain extent, that people fall back on the fact that the original Francis report did not recommend minimum \nlevels. But he has had a rethink.\n \nH\ne has looked at the evidence from the Safe Staffing Alliance and\n \nit \ni\ns reported that \nhe \nsays \nthat \nhe is convinced\n that this \nshould be the alarm bell for questions about \nsafety—\nthe level below which you cannot be safe. But we understood from reports of that same meeting\n—\nit was your meeting\n—\nthat Sir Mike Richards was not planning to include staffing levels in his surveillance model\n,\n but will look at things like unanswered ca\nre bells. Unanswered care bells come\n from \nnot \nhaving enough staff\n,\n and I am still talking to and getting information from people working in ho\nspitals where the ratio falls to 2:28 and 2:23. \nI was talking to somebody at the weekend \nwho\n was saying that on nights they are expected to look after \npeople on a ratio of \n2:23\n. L\nots of patients\n,\n or people visiting older family members, for instance\n,\n will tell you\n that \non a ward it is not uncommon to see the nurses totally stretched and running round. \n              \nThe Secretary of State today\n, \nanswering \nq\nuestions in this House on the troubled hospitals that have been in special measures, was reporting how one of them had recruited 257 nurses. \nIt is absolutely obvious—\nobvious from \nwhat \nRobert Francis said and obvi\nous from where the level is right—\nthat this is the answer. So why are you still talking to NHS England\n,\n and why is it all so \nagonised? Why can you \nnot \njust do it? Look at our Committee\n’\ns recent report and adopt what it says.\nDavid Prior: \nWe are in huge agreement on this. Mike was slightly misquoted. He absolutely believes that staffing levels are critically important. He was saying that just having a minimum \nof \n8:1, for example, on its own was probably not the right way to go. He absolutely is looking at staffing levels and\n,\n \nas for the hospital that you referred to—\nI think it is the Salford Royal\n—\nwe will be looking to see whether or not hospitals have made an assessment of what the right staffing level is for ward\ns. W\ne will be looki\nng exactly at that. So we are on\n the same page as you on this. \nThe difficulty\n \nis\n whether or not there should be a minimum level of 8:1 across the piece.\nQ22 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nI need to correct you. The Safe Staffing Alliance are very clear that that is the fundamental standard\n,\n and that if you are at that level the alarm bell is already ringing\n—\nbearing in mind that the nurse in charge is supernumerary to that assessment. In other words, that is the fundamental standard\n,\n \nand\n once you are at that level you need to start asking questions about the safety of patients on that ward. But \nthey are\n not saying that that is the target. That is the fundamental standard, which is a different concept to that of a mandated minimum, as it were.\nBarbara Keeley: \nThe second part of what we included in our report was about t\nransparency\n. It is okay for you to check\n,\n but y\nou would not have to check if that information\n was \npublished on wards, would you—i\nf that information was available to the public\n? Y\nou have talked a\n lot about your reports making \nsense to the public\n,\n so why not let us all push for having that information out there?\nQ23 &#xa0; \nChair: Can I \nre\ncommend \nthat \nyou look, as we suggested in our last report, at the Salford Royal precedent\n,\n where information is publicly available to clinicians, \nto \npeople on the wards and to patients\n’\n families\n,\n so that they can make their own assessment a\nnd contribute to the discussion?\n But let us not take over the session with nursing numbers.\nDavid Behan: \nCan I just add\n something—\nnot to extend it, Chair, \nbut just \nto pick up on Barbara\n’s point?\n We are \nnot\n \njust \ntalking about this. We are building \nit\n into the six inspections we have done\n. I\nndeed\n,\n today we started our inspection of Salford Royal. We chose the 18 so that there were six low\n-\nrisk\n hospitals\n, six medium and six high\n-\nrisk\n,\n so \nthat we can\n learn not just where these things are not done well but where they are done well\n,\n an\nd we can publicise where they are\n done well. So today, as I have said, we have begun\n \nat Salford Royal\n.\n \nW\ne will be there over the next three days\n,\n and we will be able to pull these out. \nW\nhen we publish our reports, if this is what we find, we will be able to demonstrate that as being good practice. Salford Royal is held up as an example by many\n,\n and we will be given the opportunity to do the same in our inspection. I do not want to give \nthe\n \nimpression\n that we are just going round\n and round having conversations. W\ne are actively building an assessment of the adequacy of staffing in\nto\n our new inspection model. We are doing that from now\n,\n and wh\nen\n we write our reports we will comment on how that contributes to the safety and quality of services.\nBarbara Keeley: \nThat is good.\nQ24 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nCan I push you on that? Do you have an end date for your chats? Have you \nsaid\n to Mike, for instance, \n“\nRep\nort back to me before Christmas”?\nDavid Behan: \nYes. \nQ25 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWhat is the end date then?\nDavid Behan: \nI have already given you a sense of what the end date is. We have said that we will complete our wave 1 pilot inspections by December.\nQ26 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: O\nn this issue.\nDavid Behan: \nWe will learn from those and build that into wave 2, which will get carried out between January and March next year\n,\n and then from March next year we will begin wave 3\n,\n and they will be the inspections that we intend to run through that next wave.\nQ27 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI was talking specifically about the safe staffing issue. You said \nthat \nMike is looking at it\n,\n so I was ask\ning basically to pin you down. \nHave you given him an end date to report on this particular issue?\nDavid Behan: On that particular issue\n there is an end date that we have agreed between us as a senior group of colleagues\n—\nthat we will have a new inspection methodology up and running and finalised from 1 April next year.\nQ28 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Will y\nou let us have it and publish it on your website?\nDavid Behan: \nAbsolutely. We will start to publish our wave 1 reports, which will give you an indication of how we are dealing with this, from November. Those four will be in November. The next four will be in December, the next four in January and the next four in February.\nChair: \nBarbara, you were half way through.\nQ29 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nGoing back to a further question around the introduction of the chief inspectors for hospitals, primary care and social care, the Foundation Trust Network have said that they believe this introduction may delay the development of new regulatory approaches in other areas, \nsuch as \nambulance services, community services and mental health services. How do you guard against your regulatory work \njust\n focusing on the core remits of the three chief inspectors and other things becoming less important or not attended to?\nDavid Behan: \nThey are not less important. We have a good relationship with the Foundation Trust Network and we have a good and robust conversation with them about what is going well and what they would like us to move more quickly on. You as a Committee have challenged us historically about being all things to all people and not being clear. If everything is a priority, nothing is. The only thing we have said, Barbara, is \nthat \nour focus, for very obvious reasons\n—\nyou have mentioned Robert Francis on three occasion\ns\n now\n—\nis to sort out what we are doing around acute hospitals. We will then begin to tackle what we are doing around independent healthcare, mental health, community trusts and ambulance services. We have accelerated the work we have been doing. \nWe have had a number of accelerated solution events\n—\nif I can use that jargon\n—\nduring October in relation to how we will inspect mental health and community health\n&#x2011;\nbased\n services\n,\n and we will begin to pilot our mental health and community health substance misuse out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhours\n service from January next year. The only thing we are saying is that we cannot do everything at the same time. We do not want to build in delay. We are acut\nely conscious that there is a \nfoundation trust pipeline that people are keen to get through and we have given commitments\n,\n working with Monitor and the TDA\n,\n about how we will do that. \nI\nn answer to Valerie\n’\ns question about time lines and \nwhether we \ncan guarantee th\nem\n, we have set those time lines out. They are a plan, but we do not intend them to slip\n—\nwe are worki\nng very hard to deliver on them—\nand we know that others are dependent on us. \nW\ne are trying not \nto \npromise to do everything at the same time and fail\n,\n but to be absolutely clear what we are going to do and when. Our strategy was a three\n&#x2011;\nyear strategy of reform. The bigger issue, quite frankly\n,\n is not\n,\n \n“\nCan we hit these dates?\n”, but,\n \n“\nCan we change the attitudes and behaviours within the organisation so that we can move from a system of compliance and generic inspection to one which is about assessment and judgment led by professionals?\n”\nQ30 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nMoving on to a different point, you recently announced \nthat \nan internal disciplinary inquiry had cleared Anna Jefferson of any wrongdoing in relation to the instruction to delete the report on the registration of Morecambe Bay \nNHS Foundation \nTrust. Clearly that announcement, which was very brief that day, contradicts the findings of the Grant Thornton report\n,\n which said otherwise. Can you explain the basis for the disciplinary inquiry\n’\ns conclusions?\nDavid Behan: \nWhen we were here last time we were asked if we would consider any action against either past or current employees. We said we would take that away. We reported publicly in the summer\n,\n in a letter to the Secretary of State about past employees\n,\n \nthat \nwe \ndid\n not think there \nwa\ns anything that we \ncould \ndo in relation to those individuals\n,\n and said we would carry out disciplinary investigations into \nthe\n two employees who were still employed by us. We have carried out a proper investigation. We took external legal advice and found that there was no case for Anna Jefferson to answer. She has returned to the organisation and commenced a period of training. We \ndo not think this\n contradicts the major findings and substance of the Grant Thornton report. We have also advised that we have updated our website in relation to a formal complaint that we have had from solicitors acting \nfor \none of the previous employees of the CQC\n,\n \nbut that \nwe will continue to move forward in the work that we are doing to change the way that we operate. We do not think there is anything that is contradictory at all.\nQ31 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nCan I ask \nyou \nanother question about that? That is a peculiar conclusion to come to. \nW\nhen that was a key element in that part of the report\n—as we said \nin a previous hearing here, that is an important issue because it was about a situation in a hospital where babies and mothers had died\n;\n that is why it was serious\n,\n and I drew y\nour attention to that before—it is hard to see \nhow members of the public affected by what was in that report \ncan \nhave confidence in it when, effectively, you have now said you have looked into a part of it \nand it \nwas \nnot true. Apparently \nit was not true that she issued the \n“\ndelete\n”\n instruction\n,\n and you have cleared her of any wrongdoing. \nT\nhat part, w\nhich seemed quite clear in the\n report, did accuse people of wrongdoing. There were all kinds of accusations and things said around that report. It does not stack up. \n              \nThe\n question that people outside\n here will want to ask is, \n“\nHow about the rest of it?\n”\n There were questions that were asked \nabout\n how Grant Thornton went about their investigation, the fact that they did not feed back to people, did not allow notes of meetings, \nthat notes \nwere not taken contemporaneously and \npeople\n were not allowed to correct notes that were written when they were submitted afterwards. There were all kinds of issues like that. If you have looked into this and found it was not true in the case of one particular person, how can you say that the substance of the investigation and the report is not queried in any way and you have confidence in it? \nTo me, t\nhat does not stack up.\nDavid Behan: \nYou need to \nlook\n with precision \nat\n Anna Jefferson\n’\ns involvement in that\n—\nthat is exactly what we looked at\n,\n and we did not look at what other people were said to have done or did not do in relation to it\n—\nan\nd go back to what we said at your\n last hearing specifically on this\n,\n which is that we commissioned Grant Thornton as a reputable independent body to carry out their review of what happened in relation to Morecambe Bay. \nQ32 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: And y\nou found part of what they investigated and what they reported to be wrong\n,\n and you cleared the person that they had accused of doing something of any wrongdoing. \nY\nou have effectively, through what you announced, contradicted what they said in their report.\nDavid Prior: \nNo. They raised issues about the behaviour of certain individuals\n,\n which we looked at very carefully. They raised issues but did not come to a conclusion that anyone was guilty of this, that or \nthe other. They raised issues. \nWe checked those issues out very thoroughly through a disciplinary process and found that, in the case of Anna Jefferson, the allegations raised were not valid. It does not in any way undermine the major thrust of the Grant Thornton report\n,\n which was that the \nwhole organisation, and the \nregulatory system that we were implementing\n,\n was completely unfit for purpose. The two are very separate. \nQ33 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: But this\n does call into question the way that they investigated\n—\npresumably the way that they spoke to people, the way they did not keep contemporaneous notes, \nand \nthe way that they did not offer the people that they were making conclusions about an opportunity to correct the note of a meeting, for instance. All of that was submitted to us as evidence\n,\n from people mentioned in that report, that there were great concerns about it. It seems to me that you have agreed with at least certain aspects of that in the case of Anna Jefferson. You were saying that there was no wrongdoing and there was not a \n“\ndelete\n”\n instruction. If you will excuse me saying this, it does not stack up that part of it is wrong and the rest of it is okay.\nDavid Behan: \nThere are two different issues, Chair: one is a report into the events and the circumstances that we\nnt on,\n and the other \nis that \nwe were asked\n—\nand we agreed\n,\n and it was the right thing\n—\nto consider whether there was an employment case to be answered. That is what we have done.\nQ34 &#xa0; \nChair: T\no be clear, you are saying that when there was an allegation that Anna Jefferson was involved with a decision to cover up a criti\ncal internal report claiming, “\nThis can never be in \nthe public domain or subject to \nFo\nI\n,\n”\n that allegation stands but it is not a disciplinary issue.\nDavid Prior: \nThat allegation was not proven, Stephen.\nDavid Behan: \nThe issue is where the contemporaneous evidence sat in relation to what went on in Grant Thornton\n,\n and we have contemporaneous evidence in relation to other things that took place and that were set out in the Grant Thornton report and set out in relation to Louise \nDineley\n. In relation specifically \nto\n Anna Jefferson, in the disciplinary investigation we did not see any contemporaneous evidence in relation to the allegation against \nher\n. In relation to the others, there was contemporaneous evidence\n,\n and that is the \nbasis on which \nthis difference has actually taken place.\nQ35 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nIndeed. We can leave this point here because there are lots of other questions to be answered, but I think we questioned \nthe \nappoint\nment of \nGrant Thornton \nlast time\n when we covered this in\n more depth\n. There was a fair amount of evidence given to this Committee about the way they went about it being very defective, the \nway that they ran the \nmeetings—\nth\ney were hostile and aggressive—and \nvery many \nother \nissues. Given that, it might be something th\nat really needs thinking about \nif there were\n \nanything similar\n to that report to commission in future, because\n it does seem to have been a faulty decision to appoint them\n,\n and they do not appear to have carried out the work in the way that they should\n. I\nt really does not s\ntack up for you to say you can find \nfault with part of it \nbut\n the rest is okay\n.\n I would not be surprised if questions about this ran on and on, but that is probably\n enough for today\nCa\nn we go back to the way that\n hospitals are categorised\n,\n because there is a question that flows on from \nthe point \nDavid Behan \nmade\n about inspecting hospitals that are at different leve\nls of performance at the moment?\n It is perhaps a concern that\n,\n even if a hospita\nl is categorised as outstanding,\n there are questions sometimes about individual departm\nents, about individual services. T\nhings go wrong even in hospitals \nthat\n are overall very safe and providing very good service. There is a concern that a hospital that becomes categorised as outstanding \nmight start\n to think, \n“\nWell, we\n’\nre not going to be inspected for three to five years,\n”\n and they could easily become complacent. How can that \nconcern \nbe squared up? How can you keep the good and outstanding hospitals where they are\n,\n and not let them become complacent? This used to happen in \nschools with \nOfsted\n, did it not? I\nf you knew you were not going to be inspected, did you really keep on your toes and keep up to the standard you were at?\nDavid Prior: \nWe have developed\n not a perfect \nbut\n \nquite a sophisticated surveillance model \nthat\n comprises 150\n&#x2011;\nodd indicators, largely around mortality, complications, safety issues, patient surveys, staff surveys and the like, which enables us to monitor hospitals in between inspections. We will be publishing the results of the first cut of that model on Thursday\n—\nI think we have sent a copy of it to the Chairman today\n. That\n will help us keep an eye on all hospitals in between inspections\n,\n and\n,\n if there is a risk ind\nicator that goes off in between,\n that will trigger an inspection. So just because you have an outstanding rating, it does not mean that you will not get inspected in between times.\nQ36 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nWould that apply to individual services? Can you see a situation where there might be an outstanding hospital\n—\nin an overall sense, outstanding\n—that \nhad problems in one department or\n—\n \nDavid Prior: Or in \na ward\n. Yes,\n I can see that. \nQ37 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThat would be triggered to you. How would that happen?\nDavid Prior: \nNo. The critical thing for us is that we do not expect hospitals to be perfect. I do not think there is any hospital in the world which is perfect, but we will expect the managers to know where the issues are. They will know they have a problem in urology, for example, or know they have a problem on a certain ward\n,\n and they are aware of that and \nwill be \ndoing something about it. But we certainly do not expect hospitals to be perfect.\nChair: \nDavid.\nDavid Tredinnick: Thank you very much, Chair. \nI thought you were going to say I had been \n“\nvery patient\n”\n.\nChair: \nIndeed. Since you have put words into my mouth, I am happy to speak them for you.\nQ38 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nThank you, Chair. I want to return to standards\n—\nI say \n“\nreturn\n”\n because \nthey have \nbeen fairly comprehensively covered in many respects\n—\nand ask a few questions. How do you react to the English Community Care Association\n’\ns criticism that detaching expected standards from fundamental standards will confuse the general public?\nDavid Behan: This\n goes back to what I said earlier about work\ning\n with the adult social care sector to make sure that that confusion does not arise. We are working on the fundamental standards. We will inspect all services against the five key questions that will drive a rating on that four\n&#x2011;\npoint\n scale of outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate. The fundamental standards will be set in law so \nthat \nthey are enforceable\n. S\no if we need to take action we will take action against those fundamental standards. \nT\nhat is how we will do it.\nQ39 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: Earlier\n you were talking about setting up\n—\nI forget what they were called\n—\nsomething along the lines of \n“\nclarity panels\n”\n with the general public\n,\n to make sure\n—\n \nDavid Behan: \nPeople\n’\ns panels.\nDavid Tredinnick: —\nthat what you were saying was understandable. Will you apply that standard in this case\n,\n to mak\ne\n sure that the general public thoroughly understand this change?\nDavid Behan: \nYes, we will, in short.\nQ40 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: So it will be \nscoping groups. You will go out and ask people, \n“\nDo you understand what is going on?\n”\nDavid Behan: \nYes.\nQ41 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nGood, thank you very much. \nI think you\n touched on this earlier, but just for clarity\n I will ask again: w\nill your fundamental and essential standards apply to all providers\n \nacross all sectors\n,\n or do you expect to tailor them for different parts of the health and social care system?\nDavid Behan: \nThe fundamental standards are going to be set out in regulations. They will apply to everything that we regulate, but the way we inspect and the questions we ask\n—\nthis comes back to Andrew George\n’\ns question about the rationale for differentiation\n—\nin a three\n&#x2011;\nbedded\n home for somebody with autism are likely to be different \nfrom\n the questions we will ask in an international teaching hospital on numerous sites, for pretty obvious reasons. But, ultimately, what we can enforce in law will be set out in the regulations and they will apply acros\ns all \nthe services that we register and regulate.\nQ42 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: T\nalking about the law, \ny\nou have said that tough action will be taken against social care providers that fail to meet acceptable standards. What sort of sanctions will you be able to apply?\nDavid Behan: \nOur ultimate sanction is \nthat \nwe can close a service and they can fail to operate. Indeed, just this week in \nNottingham\n we are taking action to remove from operation a care home \nthat\n we think has consistently failed to meet standards. We can also take a range of actions, from issuing warning notices to issuing fixed penalty notices.\nQ43 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nSo in this particular case you were going to take criminal action. Do you think criminal prosecutions might be suitable in certain circumstances?\nDavid Behan: \nYes. A fixed penalty notice is indeed a criminal prosecution.\nQ44 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: Yes\n it is, but\n,\n if I get a fixed penalty notice for parking badly round the corner, that is at a different level to being t\naken to a magistrates court or a C\nrown court. \nW\nhen I talk about prosecution I am not thinking about a fi\nxed penalty notice particularly;\n I am thinking about prosecutions of members of the staff for failing to comply with the law.\nDavid Behan: W\ne can take action where a service is failing and we can take action against the boards\n—\nthis will be one of the changes that comes through when the Care Bill is introduced\n—\nbut any criminal prosecutions, as in the case of the staff in Winterbourne View, for instance, are taken by the police and not by the CQC. Rober\nt Francis raised the issue of Health and Safety Executive prosecutions—\nindeed\n,\n I think they have taken a prosecutio\nn in relation to Mid Staffs—\nand w\ne have been working with the Health and Safety E\nxecutive and the Department of Health as to how that recommendation from Robert Francis is going to be taken forward.\nDavid Tredinnick: \nThank you. I have no further questions. \nQ45 &#xa0; \nChair: \nCan I pursue the question of one of the five fundamental standards, which is safety\n? Y\nou will know that this Committee on more than one occasion in the past has disagreed with the Go\nvernment on the moving of the \nNPSA responsibility into the Commissioning Board\n. I\n seek your view on \nwhether \nthe most effective way to follow up this fundamental standard of patient safety \nis \nfor \nit\n to be divided, essenti\nally, between the CQC and the Commissioning Board.\nDavid Behan: \nThe important thing here, Chair, is that the intelligence collected through th\nese incidents being reported \nto the national patient reporting system, which is currently held by NHS England, is passed to us\n on a regular basis and we use i\nt as the basis of our inspections. Indeed\n—\nnothing to do with today\n’\ns hearing\n—\nMike met NHS England on this very point yesterday evening. It was genuinely nothing to do with this; we are not that clever at the minute, I have to say.\nValerie Vaz: You are \nworking to be clever.\nDavid Behan: \nThis is \nall \njust moving too quickly, to be honest, to schedule meetings to coincide\n—\nas important as this meeting is, he hastens to add. We are also going to agree with NHS England what the safety dashboard and its content \nwill be\n. I am meeting Imperial in a couple of weeks\n’\n time because they act in a capacity to carry out some of the analysis of this. So we do understand why you are making your recommendation\n and\n why that should not be separated and split. If we were to be asked to take on that responsibility, we would take it on. At the minute\n—\n \nQ46 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIf this Committe\ne\n were to commend to the House an ame\nndment to one of the\n bits of legislation coming through \nthat would have \nthat effect, would you be supportive of it?\nDavid Prior: \nIn principle, it is something that we feel ought to be with us, not with NHS England.\nQ47 &#xa0; \nChair: \nPatient safety responsibility should be with you.\nDavid Prior: \nYes.\nChair: Thank you.\nDavid Behan: \nBut in making that recommendation, Chair, there is a broader set of issues around sending out alerts. A lot of these alerts relate to machinery and equipment, not just critical incidents about where patients have b\neen badly cared for. There is an \nimportant judgment to arrive at ultimate\nly\n, as you push this to a conclusion and then \nto \na decision, about our range of responsibilities. That is a point that needs teasing out\n,\n in a way. You may well have questions on this later on other issues.\nQ48 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYou know \nthat \na specific case \nhas been \nraised with the clerk and with me on behalf of the Committee by Professor Toft around \nneuraxial\n connectors\n—that\n is the technical term\n. A\n patient\n \nsafety\n-\norientated recommendation now 10 years old \nhas \nstill not \nbeen \nimplemented. The question is, first, is this something that the CQC should follow up on during its inspections\n,\n and, second\nly\n, would not a national patient safety reporting system reporting to the CQC be an effective means of delivering something that was first recommended 10 years ago and has been endorsed repeatedly since then\n,\n but still not implemented? \nDavid Behan: Yes, \nI think that is absolutely right\n.\n \nI\nf you take away the ownership\n—\nwho is owning that\n, and \nwhere that function sit\ns—\nthe important issue is that information \nis\n com\ning\n to us and\n being built into our inspections.\n \nI\nndeed\n, on Friday \nMike, who knows about this because of his own clinical background in cancer services, did ask about \nthis \nand \nfound \nthat \nthat \nneuraxial\n system is not yet in \nplace in Surrey\n. So we are able to build \nthat aspect \nin. \nOne of the challenges for us, Chair, is \nthat \neverybody wants us to build things into our inspection. We were criticised for having a rules\n&#x2011;\nbased\n system which generated a tick\n&#x2011;\nbox\n approach to inspection and we have said we will cease to do that\n.\n \nT\nhere is a balance to be struck here about how far we build things \nin\nto our inspection. I am n\not saying this is not important.\n \nI\nndeed\n, we did ask about this,\n and how we avoid creating another approach where every \ninspection has to run through a\n list of things we need to check\n,\n \nwhich\n then drives us into a tick\n&#x2011;\nbox\n culture yet again rather than judging the quality of the experience of people using these services and ensuring that the service they get is safe and of high quality. So there is a balance and \na \njudgment to be struck here.\nQ49 &#xa0; \nChair: I do not want to prolong this,\n because I think you are agreeing with us, but this specific case should surely simply be a safety requirement\n,\n where\nby\n a green box means there is nothing for anybody to discuss and \na \nred box means there is something for somebody to do as a matter of urgency.\nDavid Behan: \nYes. I think NHS England are going to issue something on this. That is my advice in relation to making sure that this is picked up.\nQ50 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nDon\n’t get us wrong,\n \nas \nwe do not underestimate the task that you have\n and we \nappreciate that you are putting all your best efforts into it\n, \nbut I am just go\ning to focus on another slight\n overlap now. In your \n“\nA Fresh Start for the Regulation and Inspection of Adult Social Care\n”\n you mention that you are going to carry out financial checks on a small number of providers. Could you explain what sort of financial checks those are\n,\n and whether you see some sort of overlap with Monitor in that?\nDavid Behan: \nThere is no overlap. This is specifically a responsibility we have been asked to take forward in relation to adult social care, not in relation to the NHS. This is as a result of quite a considered consultation by the Department of Health following Southern Cross \nand its \nfinancial collapse. Southern Cross exposed \nthe fact \nthat for national organisations there is no oversight of service continuity and financial resilience. For single homes and small care \ngroups, loc\nal authorities deal with the 70 or so\n services that go bust each year quite successfully\n,\n and have done for the past 30 years. \nF\ninancial failure at a local level is picked up by local authorities and \nis \nmanaged quite successfully. Southern Cross raised a challenge \nin \nthat when you have a national organisation which goes across\n—\nI think, from memory\n—\nover 70 local authorities, there is an issue about who takes responsibility and acts to ensure there is a continuity regime in the interests of people who are in those services. As a result of that consultation the CQC was asked if it would take on this responsibility\n,\n and the Care Bill is pr\noviding some responsibilities for\n local authorities in relation to continuity of care at the local level\n,\n and will also ask us to take some financial oversight over between 50 and 60 large\n&#x2011;\nscale national groups of adult social care providers. That will be a responsibility that we will take on from April 2015\n,\n so we will spend the period between now and 2015 building both our capacity and \nour \ncapability to take on that responsibility. We do not have those skills in the CQC at the moment.\nValerie Vaz: That was my next question\n.\nDavid Behan: \nTherefore, either we will \nneed to \nmake some arrangement to buy those skills in from organis\nations that do insolvency work—t\nhis is not about economics\n but\n about business continuity\n—\nor we will need to recruit them. \nT\nhe first judgment we need to make is\n:\n what \nare \nthe skills \nthat \nwe need to discharge this responsibility\n? Then we need to ask:\n where are they, do we have them as part of our permanent establishment or do we go to some of the organisations that specialise in this work and have a specific contract with them to act with us and on our behalf?\nQ51 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nYou mentioned Southern Cross, which I was going to mention. There was a complex financial arrangement of selling off their homes and then a leaseback. Are you satisfied that, with the new skills that you have, you would be able to pick up that sort of financial arrangement, given\n—\n \nDavid Prior: \nAt the moment, the a\nnswer is no. We do not have th\ne financial skills that are required and it is highly unlikely that we would want to have them in\n&#x2011;\nhouse. These tend to be private equity companies with very complex capital structures. We will require external help to do that.\nQ52 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: W\nill you ever be able to?\nDavid Prior: \nI am not sure we would want to. It is something we will need to debate more in\n&#x2011;\nhouse but my gut feel is that we would want to outsource that.\nQ53 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nYes, but you have been given these powers to try and prevent the situation \nfrom \nhappening. My point is that it is a commercial arrangement. How are you ever going to know that people who are in the financial management of care homes are ever going to do this kind of thing\n?\n You will not be able to do that, will you? You would not be able to avoid another Southern Cross\n,\n because you would not be able to look behind their accounts to see that they are doing lease and leaseback procedures\n,\n or that they are in trouble. You are not going to be doing that, are you?\nDavid Behan: \nIt is possible to review some of these companies in terms of those th\nat are publicly listed, and so on\n, in terms of their accounts and the robustness of the arrangements.\nQ54 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nIs that what you will be doing?\nDavid Behan: \nThe Sunday newspapers have had three or four stories this year of these big groups that were in some financial difficulty \neither \nbecause they are overleveraged or \nbecause \ntheir income is insufficient to pay back the loan.\nQ55 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI am trying to go a bit further and \nbe \nmore robust. You are not going to rely on newspapers.\nDavid Behan: \nNo.\nQ56 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nHave you got some system in place? I know \nyou are getting it up until 2015\n, but\n—\n \nDavid Behan: \nWe will establish a financial monitoring system and the issue is whether we\n—\nQ57 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: T\no monitor these companies.\nDavid Behan: —\nbuy that in as a return from a specialist company\n,\n or whether we recruit, as David has said. \nA\nt the minute \nw\ne favour buying this in, but we need to work through the arguments for and against that\n,\n and plot with precision exactly what it is we are asking people to do.\nQ58 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWould it \nnot \nbe better to put that into \nMonitor? \nIs that really something that you also need to get expertise in?\nDavid Prior: \nCan I answer that in two \nways\n? First, there is a close correlation between a company\n or\n business that has financial problems and poor quality, as we have seen with Southern Cross. \nMa\nking the distinction between finance and quality is a false distinction. They are two sides of the same\n—\n \nQ59 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut the trouble is that is built\n into the regulatory structure. \nWhy is this case an exception?\nDavid Prior: \nIt is built in for health\n \ncare. It is not built in to adult social care. My own personal view is that Monitor and the TDA are very much in the improvement space. We are very much in the \n“\nholding\n&#x2011;\nup\n a mirror\n”\n space. That is the way our two organisations will go over time, but I do believe that monitoring quality and financial health are two sides of the same coin.\nDavid Behan: \nIf you look at the history of Southern Cross, what began to happen was they were not able to pay back \non \nthis complicated loan structure and operating structure that they had. Quality was falling because they could not pay that back so they started skimping on support staff, training and managerial staff. Quality fell even further. \nThere\n was effectively a race to the bottom as the revenues could not \npay \nback and the quality was suffering. \nThe\n relationship between quality and finance was quite apparent in Southern Cross. \nWhen I did the job in the Department, the question I kept asking myself was, \n“\nWas it possible to predict Southern Cross?\n”\n and then, \n“\nWas it possible to prevent Southern Cross?\n”\n On the basis of the intelligence that people were gathering at that particular point in time, I do not think any one agency would have been able to gather the intelligence together and assemble it in such a way \nas \nto predict that there would have been a failure at Southern Cross. \nW\ne need to see whether it is possible\n,\n in a sense\n,\n to put together surveillance metrics which will be about quantity and quality in the way that that market operates\n,\n because the \nrelationship between financial resilience and the quality of services was pretty much established in the way that Southern Cross collapsed. So it is possible, I think, for us, as we have done on healthcare, not to be definitive \nabout \nwhere failure will take place but to ha\nve some smoke alarms that cause\n us to ask questions about whether there is sufficient resilience. \nI\nf you looked at the external management\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nhomes\n ratio in somewhere like Southern Cross, they had got very large managers\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nhomes\n ratios, whereas the better large groups\n—the \nBarchesters\n of this world—have\n very small \nratios of \nexternal\n managers \nto\n \nhomes\n; that means that \nmanagers are there to supervise and support those homes. That was one of the financial compromises in Southern Cross. \nI learned\n from that to ask the question of the large groups, \n“\nWhat \nis your manager\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nhomes\n ratio? \nIf a home gets into difficulty, do you have sufficient managerial support to get it out of difficulty and support it to provide quality care?\n”\n \nSo there is learning to be extracted from Southern Cross and we need to set up \nthe\n capability and capacity to do it. Whether we own it or buy it, we need to establish that capability \nand \ncapacity\n,\n because we do know that there \nare\n a number of these large groups that are still financially fragile, some of them because they were overleveraged from 2008 but some because they were just fragile.\nChair: \nCharlotte\n wants to ask a question and then Barbara. \nQ60 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nThank you. I have a couple of things. First, there have been concerns raised with me that CQC staff are using personal e\n&#x2011;\nmail accounts to engage with patients. Is this something that you are aware of\n,\n and what is your policy on such engagement?\nDavid Behan: \nBlimey!\nValerie Vaz: \nGive us the names.\nDavid Behan: \nI think there i\ns a more specific bit to this—but, n\no, people should not be engaging directly with people from personal e\n&#x2011;\nmail accounts. It g\noes back to the accountability of chief inspectors—a point raised\n before you arrived, \nCharlotte\n. The powers that we have as on organisation come from Parliament to the board through the health and social care legislation and the Care Bill\n, and people do not act o\nn their own account. They act on behalf of the CQC. T\nhat is what their warrant says—\nso, no, people should not be e\n&#x2011;\nmailing\n patients from their personal e\n&#x2011;\nmail accounts. A number of our staff are home workers. In fa\nct, all \nour inspectors are home workers, but they should be e\n&#x2011;\nmailing\n through a CQC address, not through a personal e\n&#x2011;\nmail.\nCharlotte Leslie: \nThank you. I will see if I can provide you with some more information on that as I get it.\nDavid Behan: \nYes, please.\nQ61 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nThe second issue is that one of the things holding back the CQC in its mission to\n—\nI would not think \nthis\n is too strong a term\n—\nreinvent itself from the misdemeanours of the past is the legacy mist\nakes that still hang over it, such as n\north Linco\nl\nnshire and Morecambe Bay. Is there any move \ntowards, \nor do you think there is any benefit in\n,\n setting up a special investigations unit to look at some of the bigger legacy cases where the CQC did get it dramatically wrong and over which questions still hang?\nDavid Prior: \nYou are talking about a truth and reconcil\niation commission or something. \nWe can learn from the past. For example, when we were doing the new surveillance model we applied that to Morecambe Bay a\nnd applied it to Mid Staffs,\n to see whether or not it would pick up those hospitals early enough. We are going to be doing a root\n&#x2011;\ncause\n analysis of the problems at the home that was reported \non \nin the papers on Friday and Saturday, for example. \nT\nhat methodology is something that we are very keen to use.\nQ62 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nBefore I move on, the concerns about personal e\n&#x2011;\nmail addresses were raised with me by a member of the public\n,\n who is hoping to provide me with \nsome \nmore information, so I am not in a position to affirm \nwhether \nor not \nthis is actually the case.\n I just wanted to hear your view on the situation \nbefore we\n get more information \non \nit, if indeed there is any.\nDavid Behan: \nTo add to David\n’\ns point, \nCharlotte\n—\nth\nis\n was an earlier question\n—\nwe have built some evaluation capacity into the CQC so we can learn from what has gone wrong in the past and from what we are doing now to make sure we are learning these lessons in real time, not historically because something has gone wrong. We have asked \nKeiran\n \nWalshe\n of \nManchester\n business school to do an evaluation of our hospitals inspections wave\ns\n 1 and 2\n,\n and we know that the Secretary of State has asked that there be an investigation into maternity \nservices at \nMorecambe\n \nBay\n. Of course we will co\n&#x2011;\noperate with that investigation. Dr Bill \nKirkup\n has\n been asked to lead \nthe investigation,\n and as he looks at maternity services in Morecambe Bay, because we have in the past looked at maternity services in Morecam\nb\ne Bay\n—\nthere was an investigation\n—\nwe would expect to co\n&#x2011;\noperate with that.  \nWe w\nill do that both to assi\nst in the investigation and\n to continue to be open to any learning that can come to us as well.\nQ63 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nBut, very briefly, the trouble is that there are victims of exactl\ny the practice you want to see—\nwhistleblowing\n—\nwho are still out of a job\n and\n watching people who they perceive as responsible for some of the problems which they alerted\n us to, who are still very happily in a job\n. What can the CQC do to help these people who have \nbeen shown to have \nwhistleblown\n with good merit\n \nbut \nwho still cannot find a job\n?\n I would like to know who the whistleblowers who have been proven to have saved lives in alerting \nus to \ndangerous practice are applying to for jobs\n,\n and why, if they do not get\n those jobs, they are rejected—\non what grounds\n. T\nhen I would like to know what those organisation\ns\n have to hide\n.\n \nW\ne have all said \nthat \nif an o\nrganisation wants to make sure it does not have mission drift and is serving patient safety—if it is \nan or\nganisation with nothing to hide—it \nwould want to employ whistleblowers so that they know exactly what is going on \nat \nthe coal face. What can the CQC do to help \nhere\n?\nDavid Prior: T\nhe culture is changing, \nCharlotte\n, on this. We have taken on \nJames \nTitcombe\n and we have re\n&#x2011;\nengaged\n Kay Sheldon on our board, for example. Helene Donnelly,\n who was a nurse at Mid Staffordshire, is now working as an ambassador in another hospital. There is a similar person\n,\n Delilah\n—\nI can\n’\nt remember her name\n—\nwho is a safety ombudsman working at \nBrighton\n. It is starting to happen. One of the things I have learned over the last six months is that, to be a whistleblower, you have to be very brave. I have spoken to a couple of surgeons, for example, alpha male types, whose careers have been severely limited because they expressed concerns about what was going on in their hospitals. How we enable people to raise concerns with us at a much earlier stage, in confidence, is incredibly important\n.\n \nW\ne have set up a new committee of our board \nto look precisely at this issue. \nI hope that next time we meet we will have done a full audit of our own \nwhistleblowing\n activities \nand\n also \nof \nhow we can encourage other people. We go in to inspect for a day\n,\n or three \ndays, \nonce a year or once \nevery two years sometimes. We need to get continuous flow of information from staff, patients\n,\n residents and carers in between times. That is our best source of information. How we can lower the threshold to enable that information to come to us is critically important.\nQ64 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: W\ne would all welcome the employment of James \nTitcombe\n.\nDavid Behan: \nWe have made a public commitment as well\n,\n in relation to making an assessment of how robust complaints handling is in services as part of our inspection methodology. We have also made \na \ncommitment to look at how organisations deal with and handle whistleblowers. This week in \nSurrey\n we did have a discussion with a hospital about \nwhistleblowing\n and how they handled it. They provided two examples of \nwhistleblowing\n action that they had received and went on to describe what they had done with it. We came away with a sense of, \n“\nThis is an open organisation that is prepared to talk about these issues and deal with it.\n”\n Without giving our assessment away, we were positive about the way they had dealt with that. We will build into our wave 2 hospital inspections\n—\nthe work we will do from January onwards\n—\nhow we undertake this. \nAs David said, we have made a real effort at the most senior level to reach out to whistleblowers, whether that is \nthe group in Mid Staffs—\nWill Powell, Helene Donnelly and Kim Holt\n—\nor a whole range of others that had made contact with us. We have met with them to discuss and try and learn from them about their experiences. We have been fortunate to have the ability to appoint James to come and work with us\n,\n and\n,\n although he is not a whistleblower, \nto \nbuild in \nthe\n dimension that he brings from his work in the nuclear industry\n,\n as well as \nfrom being the\n father of a child who died while receiving services. \nW\ne are trying \nnot \nto walk away from the issues about \nwhistleblowing\n but \nto \nbuild \nthem\n into the way that we are developing our inspection. \nW\ne are trying \nto \ntake a lead in this and demonstrate why this is important in the way that we move forward. \nW\ne will continue to do that\n—\nto test and \nto \ntake that forward.\nQ65 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: I\nf you ever feel leant on by a Minister, please can you come and tell us\n?\nDavid Prior: I do not think that\n Ministers at the moment want to lean on us. They are going the other way\n,\n actually. I think they genuinely want us to be independent\n,\n and that is shared across most people in the House of Commons. \nQ66 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: Just on this point about\n whistleblowers, David Prior, you mentioned two alpha male surgeons whose careers have been severely limited. Do you think you have a duty to monitor these two alpha male\ns—\nnot that \n“\nalpha male\n”\n has anything to do with it\n,\n so let us take that out of it\n—these two \nsurgeons whose careers have been severely limited? \nI\nt seems that unless we track effectively what has happened to thos\ne concerned—\nand these are surgeons rather tha\nn nurses working in a hospital—\nwe will be failing \nin \nour duty of care. What do you say to that?\nDavid Prior: \nIn these cases they have retired and time has gone\n on\n.\nQ67 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nI did not know that. You did not say that. \nDavid Prior: \nThey have retired now\n,\n and this relates back to issues that happened two, three or four years ago. The most chilling phrase that came to my notice after the Franc\nis report into Mid Staffs\n was \nfrom \na very distinguished clinician saying\n,\n \n“\nWhere were the doctors?\n”\n \nW\nhere were the doctors? For years this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head \nabove the parapet. Why is that? In part\n,\n the answer is, I am afraid, that they are frightened. Even if you are an alpha male surgeon, you are frightened. We might well say that is not good enough, but that is the situation. \nW\ne have to be absolutely sure when we do an inspection that hospi\ntals have proper \nwhistleblowing\n—raising concern—\nprocedures within the hospital, that the culture in that hospital is open and that there is good clinical engagement. But we also have to have that safety net, which is that we need to be available to people like that at a much earlier stage\n,\n so that they can ring us up, get in touch with us and that can precipitate an inspection.\nDavid Behan: Could I add that \nI think \nthat \nwhat Francis said was about the im\nportance of listening to people?\n The big issue about \nwhistleblowing\n is that \nthere\n is a failure to listen. The fact that people feel they need to \nwhistleblow\n means that the system internally is not listening, so part of our inspections and the assessment tha\nt\n we make is \nabout \nhow open the hospital\n—or the service or care home—is \nto listening to the concerns that people are raising internally\n,\n as well as \nabout \nhow whistleblowers \nare \nhandled. That will be part of what we do. So it is not just about \nwhistleblowing\n: it is about how concerns are raised, listened to and dealt with.\nQ68 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nIt is, but\n,\n since you have come back to it, it is also about organisations closing ranks so tightly that if anybody steps out of line they are finished\n.\n \nT\nhis is a kind of Mafia code\n—\nOmertà\n comes to mind\n—\nwhere\n,\n if you do anything against the status quo of the organisation, you are finished. That surely is something that has to be broken.\nDavid Prior: \nIt is. You have to recognise that we are tribal people. We all have our tribes\n—\nclinicians, hospitals, the CQC and the House of Commons \nall \nhave their tribes\n—\nand one tends to be quite defensive about one\n’\ns tribe, but we need to break those walls down. I completely agree with you.\nChair: \nRather than going into the metaphysics of tribalism, we will go on to Barbara.\nQ69 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nIndeed, but I feel a need to express an alternative view to that we have just heard\n.\n \nT\nhere is a view on our side of the House that Health Ministers just want to hold the whole of the NHS at \nsuch \na distance \nthat\n nothing would be their responsibility at all\n.\n I think there is a happy medium. So\n there are two views of that. \nCan we move on to specialist inspection teams? Your inspectors were recruited\n,\n largely\n,\n years ago to service a generic model of inspection, but in their evidence to us the Relatives &amp; Residents Association say that they remain concerned that recruitment of expertise in the care of older people in residential and nursing care is still thin on the ground. They would like to see you publish data on the number and range of experts and specialists that you have recruited or that you intend to recruit. They say\n—\nI do not know where they get this from\n—\nthat their intelligence is that specialist teams for care homes are not yet fully in place. You might want to comment on your recent skil\nls audit about work force \nchallenges and what training is still needed to transfer inspectors into those specialist teams.\nDavid Behan: \nSince last year we have not been recruiting any inspecto\nrs unless they have a health or a \ncare background. \nW\ne have not been recruiting generic inspectors for a good period of time. We are committed to introducing our restructured organisation where people will be organised on a specialist basis by 1 April next year, so we will begin that process of restructuring and moving from the current model we have of people being organised geographically and generically into our specialist model. That is a huge change. \nA\nll 2,000 people in this organisation will change their role. \nWe are also committed in our hospital, adult social care and primary medical services inspections that inspections will not be carried out by single inspectors. Inspection has ceased to become an individual pursuit and has become a team pursuit. The team will have our inspectors\n,\n who will come from \na \nhealth or \na \ncare background\n,\n and people from the field. \nI\nf it is in adult social care and we are going in to look at a service for people with autism, I would expect that that team would have somebody who has some experience and knowledge of autism, whether they are employed by the CQC or \nwhether \nwe need to br\ning somebody in from outside \nthe service to make sure that they have that specialist background. That is what we are committed to and have set \nout. “\nA Fresh Start\n”—\nthe document we published last week\n—went in and\n explained this\n,\n \nand began to set i\nt out. I hope that the \nissues that  the \nRelatives &amp; Residents Association have put in their evidence to you \nhave been\n \naddressed by what we have set out in\n \n“\nA Fresh Start\n” as to \nhow we intend to take that forward\n.\n \nQ70 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nDo you still need an extensive recruitment programme, or how extensive would it be, to make sure that you have enough experienced and even senior specialist inspectors? A secondary point is\n:\n will it be necessary to replace people and will there be redundancies as part of that process? Do you still have \na fair amount to do? That \n2,000 is a lot of people to change roles. \nTo what extent \nwill you have to recruit people specifically into certain senior or very specialist roles?\nDavid Behan: \nThere will be a mixture. We have a significant proportion of our staff \nthat\n have a health and care background. The issue, though, is not what the background\n is—\njust to play on this point that David was making about tribalism\n. J\nust as important a question is, \n“\nHow long is it since you practised?\n”\n I hold my social work registration but actually it is 30\n&#x2011;\nodd years since I practised as a social worker, so I would not claim that I can actually go in and assess, with the detail, the practice of today\n’\ns social workers in the same way\n as I once could\n. \nT\nhe issue is about how \nwe\n get contemporary knowledge. This is why we are building inspection teams in both health and care where we have inspectors that come from a professional background\n,\n but they will be accompanied by people who are currently active in their practice. \nL\nast week at \nBarking, Havering and Redbridge\n, as part of my time there\n,\n I went round the accident and emergency service with a nurse who is currently in practice\n,\n and her contemporary knowledge about what current practice should be assisted in us arriving at \na judgment \nabout the quality of that service. So it is not just about what your background \nis, \nbut how contemporary your knowledge is as well.\nQ71 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nWill \nthat mean you will still have an\n \nextensive recruitment programme? People’s\n concern\n—this has been raised \nin earlier hearings that we have had with you and \nin \nthis one, and it might be out of date\n,\n but they expressed it\n—\nwas about care homes and nursing homes. I understand that you \nhave \nprobably picked up for your hospital inspections\n,\n but that is not going to help when it comes to inspecting nursing homes, is it?\nDavid Behan: \nIt is\n,\n because I want nurses going into nursing homes \nwho\n have contemporary experience, not people who were nurses 15 years ago. People\n’\ns registration is an important part of their professional identity. That is why I think over 90% of the nurses we employ in the CQC have maintained their professional registration\n—\nbecause they draw their professional identity \nfrom\n it. They have invested their time and energy in maintaining their registration. In future I want us to support those individuals to continue to keep their registration live. But if you were a nurse 12 years ago, \nit\n becomes an issue about whether that is sufficiently contemporary knowledge in terms of current nursing practices. \nW\ne want to ensure\n—\nthis is my point about inspection ceas\ning\n to be an individual pursuit and becom\ning\n a \nteam pursuit\n—\nthat we have a mixture of people who know inspection and regulation\n,\n so if enforcement action is required they know how to do that. But they will do their inspections with experts by experience\n—\npeople who have used services\n, \nand clinical and professional experts. Those clinical and professional experts will bring contemporary knowledge of current standards of practice.\nQ72 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nI still do not quite get the sense of how far through the process you are, though. You are targeting 1 April. Are you 30% or 50% through the recruitment?\nDavid Behan: \nWhat we have said, Barbara, is that we will begin to make our changes in relation to adult social care\n—\nto stick on this\n aspect—\nfrom April next year. \nW\ne are now beginning the restructuring of the CQC so that from 1 April next year we have specialist teams\n.\n \nW\ne will have managers and inspectors working \nto\n Mike Richards in relation to h\nealth care \ninspection\n—\nhospitals, m\nental health, community health and \nambulances\n—\nand inspectors \nand managers \nworking to Andrea who will undertake the 25,000 inspections of residential and domiciliary care. Those inspectors will go out\n—\n \nQ73 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: I am fine on the process,\n but it is a question about numbers. Is it that you have not started yet because you have\n—\n \nDavid Behan: No,\n because we are going to begin that from April next year, so we are planning to deliver that. But on our residential and domiciliary care inspections we do have professional experts going out. \nT\no answer specifically, if there is a medicines management issue within a care home, we would ask a pharmacist to be part of the inspection team in a care home.\nQ74 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nBut they are not full\n&#x2011;\ntime staff of the CQC. They are additional\n—\n \nDavid Behan: \nSome are. We have pharmacists. We employ over 30 pharmacists \nwho\n will go out on pharmacy inspections.\nQ75 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nPerhaps you could send us an answer later, but the question is how far you have gone through this? What is the scale of the challenge? How extensive a recruitment programme is going to be required? Perhaps if it is difficult to formulate\n—\n \nDavid Behan: \nThis is in process. I am not being evasive here. We are not going round and round, to use one of your earlier phrases. We are moving an organisation from where it was to where it needs to be\n,\n and that will take time.\nQ76 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nCould you send us a note of how far through you are\n,\n because that is all I am asking? \nDavid Behan: \nI will send you a note on our milestones and where we expect to be on health\n \ncare, adult social care and general practice.\nBarbara Keeley: \nI am fine with the process, but I do not have a feel for where you are on the path.\nQ77 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI want t\no follow up on what Barbara is saying,\n because I cannot hold in my\n hand exactly how many you need.\n \nY\nou must have done a cost analysis of how many extra staff you need. You have all these teams going round, so you must have an idea of how many you are going to recruit.\nDavid Behan: \nYes, we do have that. We have a model of, taking our inspection programme\n—\n \nQ78 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nHow many is that?\nDavid Behan: \nWe currently have 955 inspectors and we calculate we will need about 1\n,\n100 inspectors.\nQ79 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo have you asked for more money from the Department?\nDavid Behan: \nThis year, 2013\n&#x2011;\n14, we have an additional £20 million that has been made available to us.\nQ80 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nJust for these\n inspections\n.\nDavid Behan: \nIt is partly on a recurrent and some on a non\n&#x2011;\nrecurrent\n basis\n,\n and there is a commitment that next year we will get £29 million available to us as we build towards this new inspection process.\nQ81 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo what is\n t\nhe balance between the two\n—\nthe \nre\ncurrent and the non\n&#x2011;\nrecurrent\n? Presumably you mean you buy in the experts\n,\n like the pharmacist or the nurse that you do not have.\nDavid Behan: \nThat is right.\nQ82 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo they are on an agency or consultancy basis.\nDavid Behan: \nYes.\nQ83 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nHow much would they charge you for doing an inspection\n,\n or how much would you pay them?\nDavid Behan: \nAt the minute\n—for \nthe \n18\n that we are doing on wave 1\n—\nthere are no charges being levied: people are giving their time and assisting us without any charges.\nDavid Prior: \nCan I add\n,\n in answer to Barbara\n’\ns point\n,\n that we are now recruiting, for example, in adult social ca\nre, four deputy chief inspectors?\n We hope they will be in place by January. We then will need to recruit, as David said, probably between 150 and 200 more inspectors\n.\n \nT\nhat new recruitment campaign will start early in the new year.\nBarbara Keeley: \nPerhaps we need you to send us a note, if it is clear. It is just that I was not getting a sense of it\n,\n apart from the process. I was hearing the process but not the numbers. \nWe need the break\ndown of the numbers as well.\nQ84 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI am staggered that in an organisation of your size you do not know how much it is going to cost. You have asked for more money.\nDavid Prior: \nWe do know what it is going to cost. We have a three\n&#x2011;\nyear pla\nn. We have only just recruited \nAndrea Sutcliffe and Steve Field\n, who have\n been with us for two weeks. We want them to be part of developing the detail of this plan, but we do have a three\n&#x2011;\nyear indicative plan\n,\n and we have the financials and the numbers of people that we think we will need, but we are just nailing down the details with the new chief inspectors. \nQ85 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nYes. You must have had that\n,\n because otherwise you would not have been able to ask for more money. But I am just trying to work out on what basis you are going to buy in the expertise.\nDavid Prior: \nA lot of the inspectors will be employed inspectors\n,\n but we will have a big bank of people\n—\nclinicians, experts\n—\nwho we will draw down as and when we require them.\nQ86 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: One final detail, so as \nnot to lose it, is that I did ask whether there would be redundancies. From your generalist staff, do you think there are people that you will have to let go?\nDavid Prior: \nThere may be some people who do not make the move.\nQ87 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nBut \nsome \npeople are \nthere \nalready, are they\n not?\n \nYo\nu have made some redundancy payments, have you not?\nDavid Behan: \nOn the senior team, yes. The previous senior team have gone, some on redundancies and some because they went to do other things.\nQ88 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWhat is the total cost of the redundancy payments? \nDavid Behan: \nThere were various redundancies. I think in total it was about £800,000 over a two or three\n&#x2011;\nyear period.\nQ89 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI want to go back to the inspectors. I think you had already been moving towards the specialist inspectors before the chief inspectors came in\n,\n and I was not sure from our last accountability hearing, Mr Behan, whether you were in favour of this. I do not think you were in place, Mr Prior. Could you set out what your view is, please? I know you have to work within the system, but it seems to me\n \nthat you now have another\n, additional,\n layer of deputy chief inspectors\n.\n \nA\nre there then going to be the deputies to the deputies? How much further down are you going to go in these bureaucratic layers?\nDavid Behan: \nI was absolutely clear on coming into this job that the generic model did not work and we needed to move away from it and to specialist inspections.\nQ90 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Y\nou were working towards that, I think, yes.\nDavid Behan: \nThat is what I set out a\nt the interview for the job. I \nwanted to be absolutely clear that if they gave me the job they knew exactly how I was going to do it, and that was to reintroduce specialism. It is not tenable\n,\n for me\n,\n that you can go round A and E with somebody who is not clinically qualified to judge it. It is just not tenable. My dad would not understand that, quite frankly, and therefore we needed to change it.\nQ91 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI think you have misunderstood what I a\nm trying to say, as to initially\n when you first came to the job. Nobody thinks you are going round to individual organisations asking them about it. Obviously you are going to have inspectors doing it, however \nyou organise it.\n \nThis \nprocess has been going on for a while anyway, so I am just saying that at our last accountability hearing none of us had the idea that chief inspectors were going to be put in place\n,\n and now we hear that there are deputy chief inspectors. I am \njust \nwondering when the process is going to stop.\n \nDavid Behan: \nTo come to your question, \n“H\nave we been modelling the numbers we have\n got\n?\n”—y\nes, we have. \nTaking\n adult social care, we have been planning that each adult social care inspection will probably have one or two inspectors. They will have an expert by experience and a specialist. That specialist might be a pharmacist or somebody with knowledge of dementia services, \ndepending on what the service i\ns. The numbers will depend on the size of the home. There are some homes that have 180 beds and some \nthat \nhave 16 beds. \nT\nhe size of the team, \nand so on\n, will need to flex. We think a typical inspection, from preparation and inspection to report writing, should take between three and five days. We have taken those assumptions, multiplied by 17,500 residential, 8,000 domiciliary\n—\nwe have done exactly the same on hospital inspections in terms of the numbers, the amount of time that we will spend\n—\nand that is what we are using as our financial model to drive the numbers of the inspectors \nand \nmanagers that we will need to support and oversee that work\n.\n \nWe have done \nexactly the same on primary medical services. So we think we will need about 2,700 staff in the future to discharge our responsibilities. If you just move by a fraction whether we visit once every two years or once a year, that changes those numbers quite dramatically. \nW\ne have a model which we can flex based on that, so arriving at the cost is literally the work we are doing in real time now\n—\nbut we worked with the Department last year about our changing model and they made an additional £20 million available to us for this year\n,\n which is sufficient for us for this year. \nT\nhe assumptions that we made this time last year\n—\nto come back to what has changed between now and the last time we were here\n—is that \nwe thought we \nwould \ndo intensive inspections of only 70 hospitals when we planned the resource\n,\n and we are now going to do intensive inspections of all hospitals\n.\n That means the resource requirement is larger rather than smaller. That is why the numbers have changed since last year. \nI am fully supportive of having specialist teams under the chief inspectors to take this forward. Steve Field\n—\nI think David has already alluded to this\n—\nwill have a deputy chief inspector who will be responsible for looking at integrated services, looking at people\n’\ns care careers, particularly for those people who are using health and care services\n,\n so we are not just looking at the individual services but at people\n’\ns experiences. \nQ92 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nDon\n’t get me wrong—\nI think you need people to do the job\n—\nbut I was \njust \nwondering why there is another layer of management. It is really the people on the ground that you need, the people who are going round doing the inspections. But obviously you have not built in, if \nsomeone gets \na good rating, anything for additional inspections.\nDavid Behan: \nYes, we have.\nQ93 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nYou have, okay. So why do you think th\nat\n frequency o\nf inspection will not add value?\n I think you have said that, haven\n’\nt you\n—\nthat if you do it more f\nrequently it will not add value?\n Or do you not think that?\nDavid Prior: \nWe will be visiting\n and\n inspecting the homes that are not good more frequently than the ones that are good\n,\n because we feel they need to be inspected more often. So they do add value, we think, yes.\nQ94 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo I suppose the feeling is, \n“What happens in between?”\nDavid Behan: \nBetween inspections, \ndo \nyou mean\n?\nQ95 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nIf you have a \n“\ngood\n”\n and then there are five years before you go back and\n—\n \nDavid Behan: \nNo. We got a very clear message from our consultation that five years is out\n.\n \nN\nobody is interested in anything being on a five\n&#x2011;\nyear frequency. The support was for three years or less\n—b\nut David referred earlier to our intelligent monitoring function. This is the announcement that will be made on the 24th in relation to the next wave of inspections. In order to \nmake sure we are inspecting th\ne places that have the highest risk, we have deve\nloped a surveillance scheme—“\nintelligent monitoring\n”\n is \nhow we are describing it—of 150 \nquantitative indicators\n:\n mortality rates, hospital readmission rates\n and other indicators\n, alongside qualitative information\n such as\n staff satisfactio\nn, patient satisfaction surveys and the number of complaints.\n \nW\ne will use that intelligent monitoring tool continually through the period between inspections\n.\n \nI\nf we think there is an increase in, say, patient dissatisfaction, that might be a smoke alarm that causes us to ask questions of the service such as, \n“\nAre things deteriorating here? Do we need to come back?\n”\n There may be a critical incident\n—\na never event or an untoward incident\n—\nthat means we need to go back and do a reactive inspection because there is a worry in that alert, in that nomination. I think this is behind the Chair\n’\ns point about patient safety alerts\n—\nmaking sure that they are coming through in real time and that we assess whether there is any risk\n,\n and perhaps \ngo \nand do further inspections \nas a\n result of that. \nO\nur assumptions about\n inspection frequencies of, say, two years\n \nare on the basis that people\n continue to improve and maintain the quality and standards of care. I\nf we saw \ndeterioration through the monitoring of those hospitals, one of our reactions could be to trigger a reactive inspection to go back and look at that, whether that is of the whole organisation or just of a particular service.  \nValerie Vaz: \nThank you.\nChair: \nDavid \nTredinnick\n has been very patient once again.\nQ96 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nMay I return to the ratings system, which has already had some \nthought applied to it earlier\n? Are yo\nu not trying to square a circle—\nthat might be im\npossible to do—\nin providing a ratings system which has an appeal to the general public but at the same time has to be used by health commissioners who must make detailed decisions about various aspects of service provision?\nDavid Prior: \nAre you talking about the hospitals?\nQ97 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nYes. You are really trying to address two audiences, are you not? You are trying to give confidence to the general public and also trying to provide enough information for commissioners and people who are in authority in the health service to make proper decisions based on your inspections.\nDavid Prior: \nI do not think it is a circle that needs squaring. I think it is a circle. It is true that commissioners might want more detailed information than members of the public, but wait till you have seen some of our inspection reports, David, and see what you think of them. I think they will address both issues.\nQ98 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nWe have seen, in looking at food standards and other standards generally, that the easiest system for the public to understand is the traffic light: you have a green light for \n“\ngood\n”\n and \n“\noutstanding\n”\n, then, using your proposed hospital ratings, obviously you would have an amber light for \n“\nrequires improvement\n”\n and a red light for \n“\ninadequate\n”\n. Have \nyou thought about putting a traffic\n&#x2011;\nlight\n symbol on the front of your reports to make it crystal clear what you feel at first sight?\nDavid Prior: \nFor hospitals, we have adopted the \nOfsted\n terminology, if you like, of \n“\noutstanding\n”\n, \n“\ngood\n”\n, \n“\nrequires improvement\n”\n and \n“\ninadequate\n”\n, which are pretty well understood by people. That is where we are with hospitals.\nQ99 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nYou misunderstand me, if I may say so. I am saying use the \nOfsted\n ratings but put colour coding on\n, so that people\n can look at it and see\n: if it is “\ninadequate\n” it has a red lamp, if it “requires improvement” it has an\n amber \nlamp, \nand \nif it is “\ngood\n”\n \nit has \na green \nlight\n. \nT\nhat is very understandable\n.\n \nC\noming many years ago from an advertising background, we would always try to encapsulate what we were trying to \nsay in not more than a sentence—hopefully in a phrase—or \nwith a symbol.\nDavid Behan: \nIf it helps, Ch\nair, in our literature to date—our consultation documents—\noutstanding was blue, good was green, requires improvement was amber and inadequate was red\n,\n in the way that we have actually described this, so that pl\nays exactly to your point about\n aligning a colour to the descriptor\n,\n and that is what we will do. But on a four\n&#x2011;\nrate\n scheme we needed to bring blue in.\nQ100 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nThank you for that. Have you started to think about how the rating system can meet the Government\n’\ns objective of one that can quickly \n“\nrespond and reflect new information about a provider\n’s performance”\n?\nDavid Behan: \nWe do think that the rating system will be an assessment of a provider\n’\ns performance across a range of services. So ratings will follow an inspection. They will be made on a four\n&#x2011;\npoint\n scale. We will give them a level that is meaningful to t\nhe public, at trust—and at service—\nlevel. We will rate\n—\nthis is where a lot of our effort is going at the minute\n—\nsafety, effectiveness, how caring \nand \nresponsive \na service\n is and how well led it is. We think the primary audience for ratings \nis\n indeed the public. We would expect hospitals to be looking at more data in more detail than we will look at\n,\n because we expect them to know their own story about their effectiveness. We also think that ratings are something that providers can appeal against: people need the right to come back to us in relation to the ratings\n,\n and that is how we are setting up the approach that we are making to ratings.\nQ101 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nHave you identified any services where you believe \nthat \nit would be inappropriate to provide a rating?\nDavid Prior: \nI am not aware of that, no.\nQ102 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nFinally, the CQC plans to introduce the same ratings scale for hospitals and social care providers, but \nProfessor Nigel Sparrow\n has said \nthat \nGP practices will not be given a single overall rating. Won\n’\nt this inconsistency ultimately prove confusing to patients and the public? So could not having two different systems sow the seeds of confusion in the future? Is that something you should address?\nDavid Behan: \nI am not aware of where Nigel has said that.\nQ103 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nWould you agree that it would be sensible to go and have a look at what he said there? \nDavid Behan: \nOf course. Nigel works for us, so we will think about what he is saying and we have brought Steve Field in to lead this work. I am not wanting to deflect this in any way, but there was\n—\n \nQ104 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nI am trying to be helpful. I am in a sense throwing you \nan\n opt\n&#x2011;\nout\n clause right now for you to say, \n“\nI will go away and look at it.\n”\nDavid Behan: \nI will take it \naway \nthen\n, and beat a retreat. \nWe know broadly how we are going to approach ratings in relatio\nn to hospitals. We will issue something\n before December in relation to this. Andrea is leading the work on the design of the ratings around adult social care\n,\n and the framework we will use will keep these four descriptors, the four categories. Steve will lead that work on how we rate primary medical services as well\n—\nso again, at the risk of saying that we are still in a process, I come back to the point that we will do these in an order. We cannot do everything at the same time. I make no apology for that, but we will build our approach to it and our endeavour is to have a consistent approach to ratings.\nDavid Tredinnick: \nThank you.\nChair: \nAndrew, you have been even more patient.\nQ105 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nYes, I have been patient. \nOn the subject \nof ratings\n—\nand then I have another question as well\n—\nI know the \nOfsted\n regime quite well, being a school teacher, and when we have an \nOfsted\n inspection the school is required to write to all parents. It got a bit silly at one point and we had to write to\n the pupils, which was a bit odd—\nwriting to six\n&#x2011;\nyear\n&#x2011;\nolds\n. Is\n that going to be a requirement?\n \nO\nbviously for a hospital it is a bit more complicated, but for a care home is that going to be a requirement, explaining what the inspection has said, what it means for\n \nresidents and what the improvement plan is going to be?\nDavid Prior: \nWe had a meeting with \nOfsted\n on this very subject last week. I like the idea of doing that\n,\n and I think we are going to consider writing to residents of a care home, for example, telling them in words of plain English, \n“\nThis is what we have found.\n”\nQ106 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nFollowing on from that, schools got very good at predicting\n—\nand perhaps even fiddling\n—\ntheir way through \nOfsted\n inspections and doing certain things when \nthey were \nbeing inspected that would not ordinarily occur in our schools. Certainly I saw that in\n my old school. When we were “\nOfsteded\n” things were very different—the entire regime was different—from\n how I ever recognised the school. Sure enough, the day after the inspectors left hell was let loose yet again and everything returned to normal. How are you going to ensure that we do not have people acting up, as it were, predicting the regime and then responding, accordingly, to, in some cases\n—\nand it is a minority of cases, I would hope\n—fiddle\n their way through?\nDavid Prior: \nThe best way of answering that is that we are going to a professional judgment\n&#x2011;\nbased\n system, not a compliance\n,\n tick\n&#x2011;\nbox\n system. The people making the judgment will be experienced clinicians when they go into a hospital, for example. It is much more difficult to game those sorts of people. Also the surveillance model that we have used has over 150 indicators in it. They are not capab\nle of being gamed in a way that \nfive or six \nmay be\n. But I recognise exactly what you \nare \nsay\ning\n. \nY\nou do raise a good point, though, and it is worth saying to this Committee that inspection is not the whole game on this. If you think that we are the guarantor and deliver\ner of high\n&#x2011;\nquality\n standards, that just\n is not the case. We \nhave to rely upon clinicians, \nboards and \ncommissioners as well as \non ourselves.\n If you are looking to us solely to deliver high\n-\nquality care in \nBritain\n, you will be disappointed.\nQ107 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nWhen you identify failure\n \nin the school context you have a governing body which has parent representatives on it\n,\n who are charged with running the school. Obviously in a private care home you do not have that\n,\n so I think it is important that you \nhave \nsome system of engaging families and residents\n,\n where possible\n,\n whenever there is an inadequacy found\n,\n to ensure that there is regular communication with them as to how that is being addressed. \nT\nhat is not really a question but more of a comment, unless I add, \n“\nDon\n’\nt you agree?\n”\nDavid Prior: \nI do agree. \nDavid Behan: \nThis is why in this document we set out that one of the things we want to do is put the views and experience of people using services at the heart of what we do. That raises an issue about unannounced inspections, \nabout \nhow you can get relatives\n’\n comments in before an unannounced inspection. Therefore, one of the things we are looking at is how \nwe \ncan give short notice of an inspection, \nwhich I think is what \nOfsted\n do—\nthat was per\nhaps your experience—\nand/or how \nwe \nmight return after an initial inspection\n,\n where we do the unannounced bit and look at what it was like, and \nthen go back and \ncreate an opportunity to meet with families, carers and people who might not have been available during an inspection\n,\n to ask them how they have experienced care. \nW\ne are thinking about how we can flex our approach to do that. \nThinking about t\nhe last care home I was in\n—this is\n going back to your question, Valerie, about why we need more than one inspector in a care home\n—\nit is not possible to be a single inspector in \na \ncare home. Somebody needs to be speaking to the staff and looking at the systems and processes. \nR\nelatives and residents will be in\n,\n and it is important that somebody spends time speaking to \nthem\n about how they experience it, not just when they are visiting, but we need to create the opportunity to speak to them outside of an inspection. This is particularly the issue about domiciliary care\n,\n where we are not attending somebody\n’\ns own home when they are receiving personal intimate care. \nW\ne need to think creatively and laterally about how we are going to look at that. \nThere\n \nare\n the same issues in relation to community healthcare\n.\n \nA\n lot of our methodologies are built on being able to observe care, which is where \nOfsted\n are, but of course a lot of care is not delivered in an observable set of circumstances and situations. \nP\nersonal care \ntakes place \nin somebody\n’\ns own home\n,\n and how we assess the quality of that is something that we need to work through. Remember, there are 8,000 domiciliary care agencies delivering care to individuals in their own home\ns\n. \nB\ny definition, it is not in an organisation like a hospital, a care home or a school\n,\n \nso it\n requires different approaches. \nQ108 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nYou are not considering cameras.\nDavid Prior: That is\n part of the consultation. There are circumstances where, for example, we had real concerns \nabout\n abuse going on. There are, of course, human rights, confidentiality and dignity issues, but there may be some circumstances where we would wish to use covert cameras.\nAndrew Percy: \nI should say, for the record, having accused schools of gaming the system to pass \nOfsted\n,\n that when I was rated \n“\ngood\n”\n it was thoroughly deserved\n—\n just to make that clear. \nValerie Vaz: \nAnd you will never work there again.\nQ109 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nI did get a \n“\nsatisfactory\n”\n for geography but that was not my subject anyway\n—“W\nasn\n’t my fault, governor.”  \nOn registration, obviously there is going to be \njoint registration or joint licensing with Monitor. W\nhat are the practical implications for you and your registration process \nin \nimplementing this joint licensing arrangement with Monitor?\nDavid Prior: \nDo you want to answer this\n, David\n? I think the issue is that Monitor will not enable somebody to become a foundation trust unless they have had a proper inspection from us. So it is not a joint licensing situation. They are licensed by Monitor but they only get the licence if they have had a good inspection from us.\nDavid Behan: \nBut we are setting a tougher test around registration m\nore generally. This is post-\nWinterbourne \nView, \nas well. \nW\ne are looking, as David has said, \nat\n how\n,\n for foundation trust status\n,\n Monitor can take our assessments of the quality of the service, and we have said we will do\n that through a full inspection.\n \nT\nhey will not award foundation trust status to any organisation unless it has a good\n,\n or better\n,\n rating from the CQC. \nI\nf a hospital gets an inadequate or poor rating, it will not proceed through to foundation trust status. That is how we have set that up.\nQ110 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nIn terms of registration for the system and the fit and proper person test, there is not going to be an application or an approval process through \nthe \nCQC, is there, for somebody to be designated as a fit and proper person?\nDavid Behan: \nI am sorry, \nbut \nwill you ask that again to make sure I have \ngot the question\n? \nQ111 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nThe fit and proper person test which is coming in\n means that \nan individual who sits on a board or who is a respo\nnsible person in an institution\n has to comply with \nthat \ntest\n—b\nut I am thinking of other examples. For example, I was chair of licensing in our local authority for 10 years\n,\n and people were designated premises supervisors\n.\n \nT\nhe only way they could hold a licence for the premises to operate \nwas\n if \nthey\n were a designated premises supervisor\n,\n and \nthey \nhad to apply to receive \ntheir\n designated premises supervisor authorisation\n.\n \nW\nithout that, obviously, the licensed premise\ns\n could not operate. For this fit and proper person test, there is not an application \nprocess\n for somebody to be deemed to be a fit and proper person, so how do you test the test? Are you relying on somebody coming forward and raising concerns about a trust board chairman\n,\n or a private health\n \ncare\n organisation’\ns board membership? Are you relying on people to come forward in that situation?\nDavid Behan: Regulations will be \nrequire\nd\n \nfor this \nto be taken forward\n, and as\n I understand the way the regulations\n \nare being established\n,\n in terms of \na\n hospital trust, it will be for the chair of the trust to determine that the people being appointed to that board are fit and proper people. They \nmust \npass that test.\nQ112 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nWho regulates the regulator? Who ensures that the chairman fulfils that test? Presumably they have to fu\nlfil the fit and proper person \ntest\n as well\n.\n \nDavid Behan: \nThey will be appointed by the Secretary of State.\nQ113 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nBut if there is a concern\n, then,\n you are not directly responsible, or you do not think you will be, because there is no approvals process. \nDavid Behan: T\nhe regulations govern\ning\n this will need to be \nrevised to ensure that specific \nchecks are undertaken prior to directors being appointed to the board. That information needs to be made available to us. \nW\nhen we inspect we need to assess that the appointments are of fit and proper people.\nQ114 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nBut if there is a concern raised\n,\n and that comes directly to you as opposed to, say, a trust board, will you have the power to remove somebody?\nDavid Behan: \nI do not know. I will need to come back to you on that. The legislation and the regulations are just being drafted.\nQ115 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nI am thinking \nabout \nhow that work\ns out\n practically. It i\ns a great test to have in place,\n but there \nhas to be\n proper monitoring of it\n.\n I am guessing \nthat \nin a hospital trust situation you would not expect there to be a problem\n,\n because there is so much transparency in terms of\n who are the accountable people and\n what is \nthe accountable body, \nbut \nwith \na privately\n&#x2011;\nrun\n care home, is it clear who the fit and proper person test needs to apply to\n?\n \nH\now do you, as a lot of these people may not necessarily be well known\n, either to\n users of the service or to yourselves\n—\n \nDavid Prior: L\nying behind the purpose of this is that there have been a number of care homes w\nhere we found problems, they have\n been deregistered\n,\n and \nthen \nthe same people have cropped up again\n,\n setting up a new home. That is why, when they come up for new registration, we can apply the fit and proper test.\nQ116 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: But how do you know, though, i\nf they do it through somebody else\n?\n \nW\ne know there are various mechanisms by which people can shade their involvement, particularly in a private company\n. \nIt is the robustness of that test in those circums\ntances that I do not understand—\nunless someone comes forward and alerts \nyou—\nbecause there is not a required application process.\nDavid Behan: \nYes. We are not a licensing authority in the way that you would have experienced in a local authority\n,\n where the local authority does act as a licensor.\nQ117 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nThey would be directors of the limited company, would they not, so yo\nu could get them under directors’\n disqualification\n?\nDavid Behan: \nWhere they are directors, yes.\nDavid Prior: \nPerhaps we need to come back to you on that.\nQ118 &#xa0; \nChair: A\n negative approvals process is what you envisage.\nDavid Behan: \nYou have \ngot it, Stephen. Yes,\n it is.\nQ119 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThe assumption will be that somebody is fit and proper unless it can be demonstrated that they are not. There will not be a register of fit and \nproper people from which\n directors can be drawn. Is that correct?\nDavid Behan: \nCan we come back to you on this\n,\n to ma\nke sure we are absolutely right? \nThis is tied up in the drafting of the Care Bill\n,\n the amendments that are being made and the \nregulations that need to be laid\n. \nWe will send you a note, Chair, setting\n out our understanding of this. In addition to the fit and proper person test, we have committed to having a more rigorous approach to registration, particularly for care homes and private health\n \ncare services. Winterbourne View was a private hospital; it was not a care home. The issue there was ensuring that we have a rigorous test of those peo\nple who\n sat behind Winterbourne View\n,\n to make sure that they were taking their responsibilities around quality seriously. If you remember, the staff of Winterbourne View were convicted and a number were imprisoned\n, but the \npeople \nwho\n sat behind the organisation were not\n.\n \nT\nhis strengthening of registration allows us to hold people \nwho\n sit behind the service provision to account for the way that they are promoting quality within those services.\nQ120 &#xa0; \nChair: \nExactly that thought invites a series of further questions, does it not, about who is in control of care\n,\n particularly in a large organisation\n?\nDavid Behan: \nThat is absolutely right.\nQ121 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWhat \nis the name on the writing paper\n,\n and who are the people in control\n?\nDavid Behan: \nAnd\n,\n where equity finance is involved, how far can you go back in relation to all of those things\n?\nQ122 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nMoving on, we have this new duty of candour. Do you think it is the right vehicle to develop a broader culture of openness among health and social care providers? Do you t\nhink it is the right vehicle?\nDavid Behan: \nIt is not the only solution\n,\n but it is an appropriate solution. People have campaigned for this for a long time. I think Robert Francis considered it, weighed it and came out with his recommendation. We have been asked by the Department to, in a sense, ensure that our regulations have the duty of candour as something that we inspect against\n,\n and we think it is one of the contributions to making the system more open and transparent.\nQ123 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nWhat are you going to do to make people apply the duty of candour in spirit rather than just going through the motions?\nDavid Behan: \nWe are going to inspect. That is what we will do. The issue about the duty of candour, going back to the previous conversation and David\n’\ns point, is \nthat \nit is the providers that have a responsibility to make sure that they are being candid. I\nt is the commissioners, and so on\n. \nTha\nt does not just sit with \nthe \nCQC, but we will inspect against the duty of candour, so a part of our inspections will be to assess that organisations are indeed carrying forward their responsibility in that respect.\nQ124 &#xa0; \nChair: \nCan I ask you two questions\n,\n in conclusion\n,\n that we went over in earlier sta\nges about internal housekeeping?\n First relating to finance, in 2012 it was said to be an objective of the CQC to wean itself off grant in aid by, I think, 2015, at which \nstage\n you were planning that you \nwould be\n financed entirely by charges on registrants. Is that still your objective?\nDavid Prior: \nNo.\nQ125 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIf it is not, what is your objective?\nDavid Prior: \nAt the moment we spend about £153 million, of which £100 million comes from fees. In three years\n’ time \nwe will be spending between £200 million and £210 million. I do not think our fees are going to go up by very much, but we will see. That will be up for consultation. So I think the grant in aid that we will require\n—\n \nQ126 &#xa0; \nChair: Presumably one of the \nconsultees\n \nin that case is Her Majesty\n’s Government.\nDavid Prior: \nIt will be, but Her Majesty\n’\ns Government have wished us to become an effective strong regulator\n,\n and there is a cost attached to that.\nQ127 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYes. Going beyond facetious\n comments on my part, if all \nthis description of \nthe\n process that we have been discussing this afternoon depends upon resources yet to be agreed with the Treasury, \ntha\nt is a significant issue, is it not?\nDavid Prior: \nThey have been substantially agreed with the Department of Health. I am not sure how far they have agreed it with the Treasury.\nDavid Behan: \nWe have had constructive conversations. I think this was behind Valerie\n’\ns question. We have been doing our numbers, we\n have been working them out—and when \nyou change the assumptions the numbers change. \nW\ne are honing those down so we can be absolutely confident. We are committed to changing the organisation from April next year and we need to know that the changes we \nmake are going to be sustained. We need to know that the income—the revenue\n that we need to do the job we are being asked to\n do—\nis going to be forthcoming. We think we have that \nunderstanding \nfrom the Department\n,\n but we want to secure and confirm \ntha\nt\n,\n because, from the original business plan for 2013\n&#x2011;\n14\n—\nthis year\n—\nwe have changed some of our assumptions. We think we have agreed those changed assumptions with the Department\n,\n but we need to lock that down so \nthat \nwe have a three\n&#x2011;\nyear strategy and a three\n&#x2011;\nyear financial plan to support the delivery of that strategy. We will need more staff to do the job we are being asked to do\n,\n and therefore we will need the resources to buy those staff. \nComing back to Valerie\n’\ns and Barbara\n’\ns point, if we are buying in experts from services, they will need to be replaced so we are not taking them away from the front line, and \nas for \npe\nople who are giving their time—experts by experience—\nwe will need to buy their time back as well. So there will be a cost to a new model.\nQ128 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut the precise financing of this model is still work in progress\n,\n you are saying.\nDavid Behan: \nYes.\nDavid Prior: \nT\nhis year it is fully financed. \nThereafter, \nfor \nthe next two years, the details are still being nailed down, but in principle we have full support from the Department.\nQ129 &#xa0; \nChair: This is t\nhe final question. We have talked a lot this afternoon about culture in your registrant community. One of the criticisms of the CQC in the recent past has been not only the culture in the registrant community but in your own organisation. What steps have you taken within your own organisation to address staff culture\n,\n and what is the visibility? How do we test what you say is happening? What is the external evidence?\nDavid Prior: \nOur governance structure has been completely changed. Do you want me to go into that now?\nChair: \nA written note might be the simpler way of doing it.\nDavid Prior: \nI will drop you a note on \nthat;\n \nit\n has been fundamentally changed. The\nre has been the\n change in the sen\nior leadership team, with David and \nthe three chief inspectors, \nand \nour direct\nor of intelligence and strategy; all \nhave been changed. So in the top management the\nr\ne has been 100% change. That is making a very big difference. \nW\nhat is really interesting\n—\nthis is a tribu\nte to David, not to me or to\n anybody else\n—is that if you look at our\n staff survey this year, despite the change that we are \nmak\ning, it is markedly more positive, upbeat and supportive than \nwas the case \nthe year before. So I think there is some strong evidence that we are making good progress.\nQ130 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut even accepting that it is improving, there are, no doubt, parts of the organisation \nthat\n are not as good as you would want them to be. Can you demonstrate that there is a culture within the organisation that encourages your employees to raise concerns\n,\n as you are encouraging people within the registrant community to allow concerns to be raised?\nDavid Behan: \nRobert Francis, when he attended our board meeting, talked about the way that we had handled some of the challenges to us as an exemplar\n,\n and \nsaid \nthat perhaps we could demonstrate\n,\n by the way we were dealing with some of our challenges\n,\n how \nthings could \nbe taken forward. We did a sta\nff survey in July this year in which \n83% of our staff participated\n.\n That is very high compared to any staff survey. \nOf those, \n82% said that they were positive about the CQC changing for the better. Staff satisfaction went up to 61% and they calculate\nd an engagement index at \n63\n. T\nhe public sector average is 56. I am not happy to be average and I am certainly not happy just to beat the best of the public sector. We need to have more ambition than that and benchmark ourselves\n—\nand that is what we will\n do. Our lowest scores in the survey—\nit is not appropriat\ne \njust \nto look at the high scores—\nwere about whether people feel valued in the CQC, \nwhether \ntheir morale is high\n,\n and \nwhether \nthey have confidence \nthat \nthe senior leadership \nwill\n effectively mak\ne\n the changes that we have to make. \nT\nhey are good challenge\ns, and we are mindful of that. \nI was worried by the numbe\nr of e\n&#x2011;\nmails I was getting from\n people \nwho \nwanted, in confidence, to talk about their concer\nns about the culture in the CQC, s\no we commissioned a\n completely independent person—\ns\nomebody I had never met before—\nto do a report \non\n bullying and harassment. We received that report\n and\n published \nit\n. This week at the leadership team we will spend time for a second period looking at what we are going to do to take forward the issues that were raised from that. I currently\n have a number of concerns that\n have been raised with me by staff\n, which we are pursuing\n both within the organisation \nand\n \nby people who \nwe have brought in to look at those specifically. \nJust last week, Chair, we h\nad the 300 managers in the CQC—\nwhether they manage one person or\n 300 people—\nall together \nto discuss\n the changes that I was speaking to Barbara\n \nabout\n:\n the fact that we need to change everybody\n’\ns job. The feedback from that conference was incredibly positive about the direction of travel\n, about\n specialisation and about what we are doing. People are incredibly anxious about having to change their job\n. W\ne have this classic paradox of people being very supportive of the changes, as demonstrated through the staff survey, but very anxious\n,\n because \nfor some people \nthis will be abou\nt the fifth or sixth change\n they have been through in 10 years. That \ngenerates anxiety. We are t\nrying not \nto \nbe closed about that, but \nto \ntalk about \ni\nt and support people through the change\n,\n because we need to take the energy that people have about wanting to change and harness \nthat \nand carry \ni\nt forward\n,\n as well as acknowledging the anxiety. \nWe will do a \npulse survey in December.\n \nThrough \nGfK\n, an external survey company, \nwe will do \na staff survey every July and a pulse survey every December. \nW\ne will use \nt\nhe organ\nisation that did the report on\n bullying and harassment to speak to staff teams\n and\n staff groups, and I will invite \nit\n back \nnext spring \nto do a review of whether we ha\nve made progress or otherwise. Tha\nt will coincide with the height of the changes, but we need constantly \nto \nensure \nthat \nwe are testing the robustness and resilience of the culture that we are creating within the CQC. My belief is \nthat \nit is moving\n—\nbut is ever\nybody happy all of the time? No\n they are not\n,\n and we need to do more.\nChair: Tha\nt is a comment on the human condition. Thank you very much for your contributions this afternoon. We will publish a report in due course.
