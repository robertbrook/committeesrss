It is the largest learned microbiological society in Europe wi\nth a worldwide membership based in universities, industry, hospitals, research institutes and schools. The SGM publishes key academic journals in microbiology and virology, organises international scientific conferences and provides an international forum \nfor communication among microbiologists and supports their professional development. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, t\nhrough a comprehensive framework of communication activities and resources.\n \nFurther information about SGM is provided in Appendix 1.\n&#xa0;\nIn early 2013, the Council of the Society for General Microbiology agreed to establish a short-term Working Group to make recommendations to Council to improve the equality of opportunity and diversity of representation in the Society’s membership. The Wor\nking Group is chaired by Professor Hilary Lappin-Scott, E\nquality and Diversity Champion. \nThe Working Group is currently preparing \nthe SGM Policy on \nEquality and Diversity\n for Council to consider\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRole of universities and the higher education sector\n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRole of Government\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSociety for General Microbiology – President &amp; Chair of the Policy Committee:&#xa0;\nSociety for General Microbiology – Policy Committee:&#xa0;\nSociety for General Microbiology – Equality and Diversity Champion:&#xa0;\nSociety for General Microbiology – Equality and Diversity Working Group:&#xa0;\nSociety for General Microbiology – Professional Development Committee:&#xa0;\nThe Policy Committee additionally sought the views of\n \nProfessor Jodi A.
