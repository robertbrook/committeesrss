[[[Metropolitan Police Service]]]

[[[ (FSS039)]]]&#xa0;

[[[Declaration]]]1 This evidence is provided to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee inquiry into the aftermath of the closure of the Forensic Science Service (FSS) by Gary Pugh Director of Forensic Services in the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). The MPS employs around 950 forensic staff who undertake over one hundred thousand crime scene examinations a year and produce expert evidence in over 50,000 cases across a range of acquisitive, violent and sexually motivated crime. The MPS also hosts the Counter Terrorism forensic databases and contributes to counter terrorist investigations nationally and internationally. &#xa0;2. Gary Pugh has over thirty years experience in forensic science, he was part of the team that set up the FSS as an Executive Agency in 1990-91. In 1999 he was appointed a Director on the Executive and Main Boards of the FSS. He joined the MPS in May 2001 as Director of Forensic Services. He currently sits as the MPS representative on the Home Office Forensic Policy Group.

[[[Response to the Questions Posed in the Terms of Reference]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[ and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?]]]3. The simple answer is no, the forensic landscape in the UK is fragmented and does not have a corporate or strategic approach to the development of regulation, innovation or commercialisation of forensic science. A more pertinent question might be could or should the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK. &#xa0;4. Any strategy would need to recognise the three very different governance, policy and operational models for forensic science delivery and development within the UK. In England and Wales there is a mixed state and commercial model with limited central coordination, in Scotland there is a central model of a state run forensic science service independent of the police and criminal justice agencies incorporating all forensic resources from crime scene examination through laboratory analysis to expert court evidence, and in Northern Ireland there is a state run forensic science laboratory separate from the police service who undertake crime scene and fingerprint examination. &#xa0;5. The development of a strategy for forensic science in the UK would suggest a need to set direction and ensure that forensic science develops to increase the offenders brought to justice and eliminate the innocent while recognising the constraints on the public finances. There is no doubt that forensic science can have a massive impact in comparison to the very small proportion of public funding that is required to deliver this front line operational service. In the MPS the three sadly iconic murders of Damilola Taylor, Rachel Nickell and Stephen Lawrence were all ultimately and exclusively solved by forensic science. The consequences of not using forensic science effectively or the human and financial cost of failure would argue for some means of ensuring that forensic science provision is stable but innovative, and that the public can have confidence in the results and opinions of forensic practitioners.&#xa0;6. The MPS has identified four areas for strategic capability building;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7. These capabilities could not only revolutionise the forensic science process but change the operating model for policing, for example the rapid identification of an offender and making this information available to police response units in the vicinity would increase the chances of apprehension, recovery of stolen property and give rapid access to justice. Securing the funding and capability to implement such transformational change is a major challenge as there is no means to do this within the current Home Office structures and the private sector is unlikely to invest as the returns and scale are low compared to other science and technology based industries. A step change in forensic science provision to the “real time forensics” operating model could mean that fingerprint bureau and forensic science laboratories are obsolete and forensic science providers will need to fundamentally re-engineer their businesses. However, the harsh reality is that with the current fragile state of forensic science in England and Wales and significant funding pressures the emphasis for strategic management will be on identifying and mitigating risk to continuity of operational delivery and reduced public confidence. &#xa0;

[[[Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?]]]8. The MPS set out in its submission to the Committee’s inquiry in 2011 that it would implement an operating model where the recovery, interpretation and reporting of forensic evidence would be undertaken by the MPS and the DNA profiling and analytical services continue to be undertaken by the commercial sector. This model has been implemented at the MPS Lambeth site. The MPS agreed a transfer of the accommodation leased to the FSS at Lambeth back into the MPS estate and the transfer of around 100 staff from the FSS to the MPS under the TUPE legislation. There were some FSS staff who were understandably reluctant to transfer given the highly advantageous redundancy terms offered by the FSS Board that were twice what the public sector currently compensates staff who leave on voluntary or compulsory departure. The MPS referred a number of legacy issues to the Forensic Science Regulator during the course of establishing forensic science services in the MPS at Lambeth.9. The MPS is not aware of the Home Office budget for the closure of the FSS or the final costs of closure.  

[[[What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples]]]

[[[)]]]10. We are not aware of a significant adverse effect of the closure of the FSS on any MPS criminal investigations. There were some increases in the time taken to complete forensic examinations and in some niche areas such as forensic toxicology analysis and gunshot residue analysis there was limited capacity for a period. The MPS worked closely with its commercial providers in these areas and the capacity and capability issues have been resolved. Throughout the process of transition the MPS prioritised and managed cases through its case management unit to ensure there was continuity of forensic science evidence to the courts and that changing priorities and requirements for urgent investigative or trial dates were met. &#xa0;11. The MPS suspended its accreditation on physically moving resources to Lambeth and making a major service change, and was subject to re-instatement visit in May 2012. In October 2012 UKAS confirmed that the MPS had achieved accreditation for its operating model and service provision at the Lambeth site. Throughout the period of the transfer and establishing forensic science services at Lambeth the MPS continued to work to establish operating procedures within its Quality Management System. &#xa0;12. With regard to research the MPS has an established relationship with Kings College London formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding in 2005. This has involved the MPS taking 6-10 MSc students each year to undertake short projects in area of mutual interest, to date we have completed over one hundred projects which have resulted in twelve published scientific papers. The MPS also collaborates with other universities and we are currently jointly bidding for research funding in the areas of improved body fluid and DNA detection, gunshot residue analysis and digital forensics. In recognition of the increased involvement in scientific activity the MPS has established a Senior Forensic Scientist post to coordinate its involvement in academic research and we will strengthen our strategic partnership with Kings College London. We are also currently working with two US companies to evaluate the first prototypes of DNA analysis that can be conducted on-site the so called “DNA in a box”. &#xa0;13. We cannot identify a product of the FSS research programme in the years prior to closure that has made a significant impact on the use of forensic science in the MPS. &#xa0; 

[[[What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator?]]]14. The role of the Forensic Science Regulator as set out on the Home Office website is to provide independent advice on quality standards to the government and the criminal justice system, i.e. he has no statutory powers to set standards or deal with quality failures. This reflects the original remit of the Regulator on establishing this role in 2008. Since then the European Union have mandated standards for fingerprint recovery and DNA profiling and in December 2011 the Regulator published the Codes of Practice and Conduct for forensic science providers and practitioners in the Criminal Justice System. Central to these codes are validation of techniques, the demonstration of organisational competence and impartiality. In response to the establishment of the role of the Forensic Science Regulator the Commissioner and MPS Management Board formally endorsed the role of Director of Forensic Services to act as Head of Profession and to be the senior accountable person to ensure that the MPS meets the standards set by the Regulator. &#xa0;15. The original advisory remit of the Regulator now seems to be out of step with the development of mandated European Union standards for forensic science, and the expectation that organisations, including police forces, are accountable for ensuring that accurate and reliable forensic evidence is put before the courts. The Criminal Procedure Rules, particularly Rule 33, are quite clear on the responsibilities of individual forensic practitioners who act as expert witnesses to give unbiased evidence within their area of expertise. The responsibilities and accountabilities of organisations are less clear, not just forensic science providers but accreditation bodies and criminal justice agencies with no clear primacy or oversight of standard setting, ensuring compliance and referral of individuals or organisations who do not meet the standards. The role of the Regulator and by implication other agencies needs to be clarified and strengthened to ensure that there is clear accountability and that standards are not only set but maintained. We suggest a number of changes or improvements to the regulatory framework for forensic science;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;16. We are aware that the Regulator has on occasion been directly involved in criminal trials and Inquiries where there is disputed expert forensic evidence and a need for an independent source of expertise/advice as to what is the current state of knowledge or the accepted consensus within a particular area of expert forensic evidence. In highly complex areas the jury may be overwhelmed by the complexity of expert evidence and we see merit in the Regulator having a role in providing or facilitating a balanced view within our adversarial criminal justice system. &#xa0;

[[[What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it?]]]17. We can only comment on the size of the MPS spend on external forensic science provision which has reduced from c£30 million to an estimated £14 million in 2012-13 following the closure of the FSS and the MPS implementing a different operating model for forensic science delivery. 18. We have always worked closely with our providers of forensic science services at an operational and Board level seeking to understand the drivers and risks inherent in forensic science provision. The closure of the FSS created significant uncertainty in the market and from our discussions it is clear that a key driver for the commercial sector is clarity about future levels of spend, return on investment and effective business processes. We deal with procurement below but more mature commercial relationships are required between customers and suppliers to manage risk, meet the requirements of regulation, ensure viable businesses and maintain public confidence.

[[[How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could]]]

[[[procurement processes be improved?]]]19. Prior to the closure of the FSS the MPS had formally withdrawn from the National Forensic Framework Agreement (NFFA) and did not use it for digital forensic work, instead setting up its own framework. Out of necessity the MPS modified the NFFA products and used it to secure DNA and analytical services in the extremely short timescales that were allowed for the FSS closure transition. &#xa0;20. The MPS and police force regions run tender processes at different times involving different operating models leading to a constant state of flux in the market. There is a heavy focus on price as the main determinant of contract award, assuming that quality standards have been met. The move to shorter term contract awards of two years with optional extensions may not allow for investment in major capital equipment as the period of return is too short. Also the NFFA is based on buying products (e.g. a DNA analysis of a body fluid) and this has become increasingly complex with multiple products on the framework and many pricing points within each product; one of the forensic science providers reports that in the latest framework one product has over twenty nine pricing points.&#xa0;21.  While our immediate priority was securing continuity of forensic science provision we will look to improve our procurement processes at the end of the current contract recognising the need to build a more mature commercial relationship, streamline business processes and support stability in the market.&#xa0;

[[[Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[? (please provide evidence/examples)]]]&#xa0;22. We are not aware of any significant loss of intellectual wealth through FSS scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK. Having canvassed the views of MPS forensic staff including those who have joined the MPS there are mixed views but their primary concern is security of employment for forensic staff both in the private and commercial sector and that forensic science will not be an attractive career choice for the most able scientists. Also in niche or specialist areas we are seeing a decline in demand for fibre and contact trace examinations and there are reducing numbers of experienced scientists who have expertise in these disciplines. &#xa0;

[[[Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could ]]]

[[[arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[ be ]]]

[[[improved?]]]&#xa0;23. The MPS took the precaution of securing all the case files from 2009 onwards at its Lambeth site and this enabled us to deal efficiently with requests for court attendance and casework reviews. We have always seen the forensic archive as a temporary issue, once the majority of live cases have been through the courts then there will be little demand on the archive and it will have little relevance to current forensic delivery. We have experienced some problems as all the records seem to be paper based and it has been difficult and time consuming to retrieve FSS procedures and MPS retained material. One improvement would be to ensure that forensic organisations have an auditable and robust means for securing and providing electronic data and information that IT systems can be also retained as well as paper records.&#xa0;24. The MPS has established a cold case team of five forensic scientists to continue the work of reviewing unsolved forensic cases and looking for new opportunities. The Cold Case Team report that in general the arrangements and protocols with the FSS Archive are working well. The time taken for retrieving samples/materials has improved in recent months to a service level of 95% completed within contractual times. &#xa0;January 2013&#xa0;
