"EIS 30&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Glencore Xstrata (“Glencore”)&#xa0;1. Introduction1.1 \nGlencore Xstrata\n \n(“Glencore”)\n \nis one of the world’s largest global diversified natural resource companies and is one of the biggest companies within the FTSE 100 Index. The Group’s industrial and marketing activities are supported by a global network of more than 90 offices located in \nover 50 countries. Our diversified operations comprise over 150 mining and metallurgical sites, offshore oil production assets, farms and agricultural facilities. We \nhave \napproximately 190,000 \nworkers\n, including contractors.\n1.2 \nOur business model \nenables \nus to capture value at every stage of the supply chain from sourcing raw materials deep underground to delivering products to an international customer base.\n1.3 We are a major producer and marketer of over 90 commodities that are transformed into products\n used in everyday life, such as mobile phones, bicycles, cutlery, plastics and electricity, to customers in industries ranging from automotive to food processing and power.\n1.4 Glencore is also a significant investor in the sustainable development of the c\nommunities in which it operates, spending\n over\n $200 million in the last financial year, a sum equivalent to 3\n.6\n per cent of the group’s net income. \n1.\n5\n Our \nGroup \nis structured into three distinct business segments:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMetals and Minerals: focusing on copper,\n nickel, zinc/lead, alloys, alumina/aluminium and iron ore. We have interests in both controlled and non-controlled industrial assets that include mining, smelting, refining and warehousing operations;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnergy Products: focusing on oil and coal. Our Energy\n Products businesses include controlled and non-controlled coal mining and oil production operations and investments in strategic handling, storage and freight equipment and facilities; and\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgricultural Products: focusing on grains, oils/oilseeds, cotton \nand sugar. Our Agricultural Products group is supported by both controlled and non-controlled storage, handling and processing facilities in strategic locations.\n1.\n6\n  Glencore\n’\ns customers around the world are active in a wide range of industries, such as a\nutomotive, oil, power generation, steel production and food processing. They rely upon the company’s established global network for the supply of metals and minerals, energy products and agricultural products. These commodities either originate from Glenco\nre\n’\ns \nown production assets or are sourc\ned from third parties. Glencore\n also provides financing, logistics and other supply chain services to producers and consumers of commodities.\n1.\n7\n Glencore owns and operates mines and other industrial facilities throug\nhout the world, including in developing countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America. As a result of these investments Glencore has gained significant knowledge and experience in building sustainable businesses in collaboration with local communities an\nd national governments.\n1.\n8\n Glencore is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE \n100. Glencore has\n a secondary listing on\n \nthe Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and \nis in the process of making\n an\n application\n for its shares to be listed\n on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\n2. Our perspective on the extractive industries&#xa0;\n2.1\n  The extraction of\n \nminerals is\n the cornerstone of all industrial activities\n \nand \nit \nunderpin\ns\n the global economy. Without the commodities produced by mining and energy companies the world would not be housed, clothed, fed or transported. \nWithout the extractive industries, t\nhere would be no globalisation and sophisticated modern economies, such as \nthe UK, which depend on the supply and trade in commodities\n,\n would be unable to function.\n&#xa0;\n2.2  The extractive sector is not merely a collection of mines and oil fields\n. It is instead a complex global industry that connects resources with customers through\n a network of transport, supply and logistics. At the heart of the extractive sector is the commodity market which efficiently ensures that consumers worldwide have access to the resources they need, when they need them and at competitive prices.\n&#xa0;\n2.3   \nMining is becoming more valuable. According to statistics from the International Council\n on Mining and Met\nals\n, the value of global production of metals rose from $214 billion in 2000 to $854 billion in 2011. More importantly, the value of the world’s metal\n output ha\ns been rising at a faster\n rate than the overall increase in global GDP, a consequence of greater demand for metals in the emerging markets. Simply put, mining’s contribution to the global economy is becoming more significant. It is generating mor\ne wealth for producing countries and for those countries, such as the UK, which support \nthe global trade in commodities with finance, marketing and technical skills.\n&#xa0;\n2.4  We believe that sustainability\n must be central\n to the operations of extractive companies, not least because the source of many vital minerals is now mainly to be found in the developing world. Due to the nature\n of\n the\n business, extractive companies must acknowledge the significant impact of their oper\nations on the environment and local communities. At the \nsame time, extractive companies\n have a distinct opportunity to render assistance to communities and governments in poorer countries.\n \n \nMining com\npanies, such as Glencore\n,\n have\n exceptional skills in pro\nject management as well as access to knowhow and resources. \nThe best operators in\n the extractive sector are aware\n tha\nt their licence to operate \ndepend\ns\n on their good relations with local communities as well as national governments.\n&#xa0;\n2.5  At Glencore\n w\ne constantly strive to find new ways to improve how we manage our health, safety and environmental practices, the welfare of all our workers and our support for the development and well-being of the communities in which we \noperate\n.  We are open and transpa\nrent in our engagement with our stakeholders. Respect for human rights is fundamental to all our activities.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n6\n \n Glencore\n plays a unique role in the extractive sector bringing together mining assets, refining, transportation\n, logistics and marketing. \nArguably \nn\no other company in the extractive sector has\n the breadth of expertise and skills in extractive technologies\n,\n \ncommodity trading and transportation/logistics.\n \n&#xa0;\n3. Our response to the Committee’s question areas&#xa0;\n3.1 What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?&#xa0;Britain has been a centre for the extractive industries for thousands of years. Tin was mined in Cornwall during the Bronze \nAge and a thriving trade in \nmetal then extended \nas \nfar as the Mediterranean. \nDuring the 18\nth\n and 19\nth\n centuries \ncoal and iron ore \nmines \nprovided the raw materials for the Industrial Revolution. In the second half of the 20\nth\n century, the development of \noffshore \noil and ga\ns\n \nproduction \nin the North Sea\n \nmade Britain \nagain \nthe focus\n of a technological revolution that provided \nnew sources of energy for the world, \nwhich are \nstill being exploited \nand developed \ntoday\n.\n&#xa0;\nNorth Sea oil and gas is in decline and l\narge-scale mining is no longer conducted in Britain but the UK still plays a \npivotal\n role in the extracti\nve industries\n as a centre of trading, technology, finance and knowhow. Britain’s role as a trading hub\n \nfor com\nmodities is not an accident. It is \na consequence of centuries of \ni\nnvestment by businesses\n in \nthe development of \nnetwor\nks of commerce \nlinking Britain to Asia, Africa and the Americas\n.\n Many of these British enterprises remain among the world’s top companies.\n&#xa0;\nTrade in commodities has been supported by the parallel development of banking and financial markets that enable the\n expansion\n of trade\n. T\nhe\nse developments \nhave been made possible through the \nstrategic policies \nof successive British governments which\n encourage\nd trade and\n \nallow\ned\n it to thrive. \nIt is worth remember\ning that one of the world’s largest oil companies was \nfounded in the late 19\nth\n century in London as a trader in exotic seashells.\n&#xa0;\nGlencore\n, too,\n \nwas founded as a \nmarketing business, initially trading oil \nand then extending its reach into metals and other commodities\n.\n Since then it has expanded\n into\n a global enterprise\n:\n Glencore\n links copper mines in Zambia to \nfactories in Asia\n and it\n brings wheat from the Canadian \nprairies to flour mills in the Middle East\n. \nGlencore has mining and industrial activities on every continent.  Although it has a relative\nly small industrial presence in the UK, Glencore has a significant trading activity in Britain and it is our view that the UK can ill afford to ignore the vital role played by a trading and financial hub as important as \nthe City of London. \nWithout networks\n of trade and finance, the extractive industries would be nothing more than\n stranded mines and oil wells\n.\n&#xa0;\nAccording to ONS figures, the extractive sector accounts for \n2.3 \nper cent of the UK’s gross domestic product. \nAccording to figures from HM Revenue \nand Customs, the annual t\naxation revenue from \nthe UK oil and gas sector over the last five years has \nranged \nbetween £5 billion and £12 billion\n, with the fluctuations being\n due to changes \nthat include \ntax rates, investment levels and production.  \n&#xa0;\nLondon-listed extractive companies account for\n \n21\n per cent\n of the FTSE\n350\n index\n, the largest sector by value\n.  \nThese figures \ndo not take account of\n the large indirect contribution to the UK economy made by the activity of companies in the extractive sector in terms of the purchase of financial\n,\n business \nand professional \nservices and technological procurement.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, extractive companies with a\n headquarters or major office presence in the UK provide high \nvalue\n employment\n.\n&#xa0;\nFrom our perspective, v\nalue\n is \ngenerated by linking mines to mills and, in turn,\n to consumers. Without efficient markets and sound finance, the extractive industries \nwould struggle to satisfy the world’s hunger \nfor raw materials and\n, ultimately, the \ncost\n of consumer goods\n would rise significantly. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.2 How do the UK based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?&#xa0;While the \nphysical mining sector in Britain\n is now relatively sma\nll, the employment opportunity\n presented\n overseas\n \nand among ancill\nary service providers in the UK\n due to\n the presence of international mining groups \nis \nsignificant. \n&#xa0;\nThe UK is an important s\nource of professional staff in the areas of finance, accountancy and law as well as engineering skills\n, project\n management, marketing and trading. In addition to direct employment opportunities in the UK\n and ancillary services\n overseas, \nthe UK is a global \ncentre for the procurement of mining finance and business services which in turn creates indirect employment in Britain.\n \n&#xa0;\nBritain also benefits from the contribution made by major extractive companies in the sponsorship of graduates and in grants to \neducational institutions. BRM, our lead and zinc smelter in the UK, has recently developed several apprenticeship programmes to address the sudden acceleration in the UK’s youth unemployment rate and worsening skill shortages as a result of Britain’s deind\nustrialization. In addition to programmes for accountants and electrical engineers, we have tailor-made programmes for process operators and refactoring apprentices. Apprentices will represent almost 10% of the workforce in 2014, up from less than 1% in 20\n11.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, \nGlencore\n is \ncurrently sponsoring \nthree\n Un\ndergraduate\n Mining Engineers at the internationally renowned \nCamborne School of Mines\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhree\n UK Students \nhave also \ncompleted 12 weeks of paid Vacation Work Placements from June – September 2013 at \nthe \nRolleston Coal Mine and \nMount ISA Copper and Zinc Mine, both of which are in Australia.\n&#xa0;\nGLENCORE IN THE UNITED KINGDOMGlencore employs directly 564 people in the UK. Our London office, which employs 373 staff is home to our oil and sugar trading activity and our shipping business. London is also the headquarters of our upstream oil exploration business, an area of significant expansion for Glencore.  Since 2004, Glencore has drilled 39 wells within the West and Central Africa region with one producing asset and further significant production growth to follow in 2013.BRM, our lead and zinc smelter, employs 155 staff and 16 contractors at its site in Kent. A further 36 staff are employed at our grain business in Thame.&#xa0;\n3.3 Does UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive industries i.e. In sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?&#xa0;Glencore actively seeks to purchase products and services locally as far as possible, according to specific need. Typically we purchase maintenance services, catering supplies, transportation and basic construction materials locally, amongst a range of oth\ner items depending on local availability. Local purchasing provides quick access and also reduces the costs and environmental impact associated with transporting materials. In addition, our support of the local economy helps to fund local services includin\ng those that meet health and education needs.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2012, Britannia Refined Metals, our lead refinery in north Kent, spent £9 million on procurement, \nof which \nless than 4% was with non-UK suppliers. Of its total 218 suppliers, only 8 were non-UK companies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.4 Has the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?&#xa0;\nThe relationship of \nGlencore\n \nto the UK is primarily through\n the financial \nand commodity trading \nmarkets and the company’s activity in\n these markets and \nthrough the purchase of \nancillary services\n and equipment\n. \nGlencore\n is listed on the London S\ntock E\nxchange because it is a global mar\nket of superior standing that attracts a very wide community of \ninternational \ninvestors including many with a focus on natural resources\n.\n London-listed extractive companies provide numerous benefits to the UK\n including employment and procurement.\n&#xa0;\n3.5 What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?&#xa0;Glencore believes that high corpo\nrate governance standards are a pre-requisite for properly functioning financial markets. Meeting the listing and corporate governance requirements of the London market may be a challenge for some companies but such hurdles provide comfort and protection f\nor investors and, ultimately, benefit\n the reputation of the City of London and the UK, generally.\n  \n&#xa0;\nExtractive companies are not, in themselves, a reputational risk. G\nlencore \nand other companies of similar stature in the mining and energy sectors are \nrequired to comply with extensive regulation in numerous jurisdictions relating to health, safe\nty, the environment, the control\n of industrial processes as well \nas \ntax and corporate governance matters. G\nlencore\n is scrupulous in its adherence to all relevant\n legislation. Reput\national risk typically arises where businesses \nsuffer from weak management, \nthe failure of\n individual\ns and where there is poor internal and external oversight of corporate governance standards.\n&#xa0;\nThe corporate governance concerns which have been raised do not apply to the main FTSE 100 resources companies such Shell, BP, Glencore, BHP Billiton, Rio and Anglo American. Rather these concerns have been raised in respect of the \nsmall number of companie\ns\n with a dominant or very significant shareholder or shareholders based \ni\nn jurisdiction\ns\n \nwhich \nlack \na strong track record in corporate governance. Such companies are not exclusively \nlimited \nto the extract\nive\n industries sector but the recent focus on these \nreflect\ns\n \nthe \nsignificant \nnumber of \nlistings \nby extractive companies \nin the 2000s.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK Stewardship Code provides an additional mechanism by which investors can improve the governance of listed companies by monitoring the performance of directors and the\n fulfilment of their duties to investors and other stakeholders. \n&#xa0;3.6 Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?&#xa0;We \nbelieve that NGOs can play an important role in promoting awareness of best practice in the conduct of extractive companies. At Gl\nencore we have\n \nan open door policy towards outside stakeholders who have a legitimate interest in working \nconstructively \nwith \nus either\n centr\nally or\n on specific country\n projects\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nGlencore’s investment \nin sustainable development in the local communities in which it operates is significant, spending\n over\n $\n200\n \nmillion in the last financial year, a sum equivalent to\n \n3\n.6\n per cent of the group’s net income. \n&#xa0;\nWhile the advocacy role of NGOs in promoting best practice is welcome, the potential also exists for some organisations to see their role in ter\nms of both judge and jury in\n condemnation of the \nextractive \nsector genera\nlly. \nWe reject this stance since we believe that without the contribution of the \nextractive\n sector, the relevant  countries would\n suffer a\n material reduction in investment and tax revenues\n, in turn causing harm to local communities\n. \n&#xa0;\nWe are co\nmmitted to \nworking with all non-\nstate actors who share \nthe \ndesire to foster sustainable economic growth.\n&#xa0;\n3.7 Does the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas?&#xa0;The UK has an enviable \nendowment of academic and technical education that is relevant to the extractive sector. This can be found in world renowned universities and colleges\n across the UK, such as Imperial College in Londo\nn and the\n Camborne School of Mining.\n&#xa0;\nThere is, however, no room for complacency in the UK. The extractive sector, like much of British industry, is in need of skilled and technically competent workers.  \nTh\ne Government should therefore place particular \nemphasis on investing in skills\n-\nbased learning to ensure that young \nBritish \npeople are able to take advantage of the opportunit\nies presented by energy and mining companies, active both in the UK and overseas.\n&#xa0;\nWe \nalso \nbelieve that the extractive industries\n can play a major role in the rebalancing of the UK economy and in ensuring that it enjoys \nthe sustainable growth that will result from a diverse and skilled labour force.\n&#xa0;\n3.8&#xa0; \nWhat is the impact in the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?&#xa0;G\nlencore\n is a signatory to the EITI and welcomes the British government’s decision which provides a \nrenewed \nimpetus to the EITI initiative\n. Glencore is committed to the development of robust g\novernance procedures that promote\n the transparency and accountability of relationships between extractive industries and host Governments.\n&#xa0;\nWe consider that the EITI will work to its best effect if Governments take greater responsibility in ensuring that data is collected more efficiently\n and made available\n in a timely fashion\n to all stakeholders.\n&#xa0;\n3.9 Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies resultin competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?&#xa0;\nThe UK should resist the temptation to introduce new regulation \nexcept \nwhere:\n&#xa0;\nand\n&#xa0;\nHigh standards of corporate governance \ndo not \nnecessarily affect the competitiveness of a location\n. However, regulatory regimes which tend to create cost and personnel \nburdens are unlikely \nin themselves\n to improve standards of conduct.\n \nIf the UK wishes to remain an attractive location for extractive c\nompanies, it should seek to maintain a regulatory regime that not only imposes high standards but does so with the minimum cost to companies and the public purse.\n&#xa0;\n3.10 What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?&#xa0;\nDuring the first decade of this century, the mining and\n extractive sector\ns\n enjoyed a period of high commodity prices and heavy investment. Recent trends in metal\ns\n and \nin \nmineral\ns\n suggest that a period of consolidation and adjustment may \nnow \nbe underway. This should lead to a more competitive environment for extractive companie\ns, one in which th\ne more\n efficient players will\n thrive\n while those that are less resilient may fall by the\n wayside\n. In such an environment, successful companie\ns seeking capital and skills will gravitate towards the most efficient and liquid markets in both financial and human resources.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK has a big endowment of skills in natural r\nesources, in part becaus\ne of offshore\n oil and gas production\n in the North Sea but also because of Britain’s\n colonial legacy\n and a long and distinguished history of commodity trading, based in the City of London. T\nhe continued presence of a number of large extractive \ncompanies, li\nsted on the Lo\nndon Stock Exchange, is also important. While the value of oil and gas production \nin the UK \ncan be quantified, it is difficul\nt to measure the benefit to Britain\n \nof extractive companies established in Britain but whose activities are mainly overseas. However, it would be a mistake to focus only on dividends repatriated or tax paid \n(although as noted above, these are themselves significant benefits)\n. \nThe UK derives \nhuge benefit \nfrom mining and oil companie\ns \nin \nterms of training and \nthe \nemployment of Britons in posts overseas and in the services activity generated in Britain by the corporate activities of extractive companies\n.\n&#xa0;\nMoreover, the corporate presence and \nstock exchange listing of extractive companies, including many of the world’s largest enterprises, represents an important attraction to foreign capital, thus boosting the UK’s position as a global financial centre.\n&#xa0;\nIn the future\n,\n the extractive sector wi\nll\n continue to see the UK as a natural corporate home if it retains its competitive advantage in terms of finance, skills\n, regulation, tax\n and its open-\ndoor policy to foreign investors.  As\n the physical output of \nminerals in the UK dwindles, the UK’s impor\ntance as a home to the extractive sector will depend more on its ability to provide high-level skills in finance\n, trading\n and project management and engi\nneering.\n&#xa0;\nThe opportunity exists for Britain to enhance its position as a global hub for energy, mining\n and resources with further economic benefit to the UK. In seizing that opportunity, the UK must commit to\n remain\ning\n an open \nand efficient \nmarketplace for the conduct of \ncommodity trading, corporate finance and \nbusiness\n, generally\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
