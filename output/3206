Written evidence submitted by defaultNeil KingdefaultExecutive Summary
default1.default              defaultThe 432:50 report – balance, objectivity authorship and relationship with SACdefaultTreat this report with extreme caution. One of its authors, Andy Wightman, is skilled at taking arresting facts and statistics out of context and splicing them together to form readable but highly tendentious accounts. Note for example an extract from a review in the Edinburgh Law Review by Professor George 
defaultGretton
default of Edinburgh University of Andy’s book “The Poor Had No Lawyers” :-
default“Academic research aspires to be objective, neutral, and fully researched. Mr Wightman’s book, for all its merits, is not in the style of a PhD. It is tract for the times, seeking not only to inform but also to persuade. While I enjoyed it immensely, and admired the range of the information presented–I wish I had been able to read it before signing off the Scottish Law Commission’s Report on Land Registration (February, 2010)–I was sometimes left with the dissatisfied feeling that one has after hearing a speech by an able politician. This is the feeling that one has heard one side of the story, but that there may be another side too. To justify this comment would take more space than is available in a short review, but I will mention a couple of examples [Professor defaultGrettondefault discusses Andy’s treatment of the law of prescription before concluding] But one would need to weigh the arguments on both sides, the benefits that flow from the law of prescription as well as the drawbacks. Balanced debate of this sort is too often lacking in this book.”default&#xa0;

defaultBe aware also that Ian Davidson MP, chair of the SAC, is a “fan” of Andy’s and therefore possibly unlikely to be able to be objective where he is concerned:-
default“Q516 defaultChairdefault [Ian Davidson MP]:default defaultWe welcome the commercial for your [Andy Wightman’s] book, which I have readdefault. Therefore, I was aware of the bits about the House of Lords and the iniquities of 19th-century landowners, dukes and so on.default 
defaultIf you remember, on the previous occasion you were here I could not find your book south of Berwick. There was not a copy available in London to be had for love nor money, although I think that is now resolved.defaultAndy Wightmandefault:default Excellent.defaultChairdefault:default The paperback is out, but we are still waiting for the film.defaultAndy Wightmandefault: I’ll give you a starring role.”defaulthttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmscotaf/1117/111207.htmdefaultThere are always two sides to every story. I would urge the committee to make its mission to seek out the other story from that presented in 432:50.
default&#xa0;default2.default              defaultThe 432:50 Report – flawed central premisedefaultThe title of the report is an allusion to the claim that:- 
default“a mere 432 landowners account for half of all Scotland’s privately owned land – such land (since not much more than 10 per cent of Scotland is in public ownership) accounting, in turn, for the bulk of the country.” default(432:50, defaultparadefault 2.1)defaultIn the following paragraph the report goes on to claim:-
default“Inequality in wealth is an increasing concern internationally. Debate about the causes and consequences of inequality has focused, in the UK and elsewhere, on the divide between the ‘one per cent’ (who hold a large and growing proportion of available wealth) and the ‘ninety-nine per cent’ (whose share of total wealth has been falling). The inequality inherent in Scotland’s land ownership pattern, however, is of an entirely different order to the more general 1:99 divide. … the divide is between the equivalent of one twelve-thousandth part of the population (the part owning half of Scotland’s privately-owned land) and the remainder.” (432:50, defaultparadefault. 2.2)defaultThis is an example of the worst sort of spin and playing with statistics (“lies, damned lies and …”) because it muddles 
defaultarea
default of land with 
defaultvalue
default of land. 
defaultThe statistic and the premise about equality would have validity if all land in Scotland were of equal value but it’s not. It ranges from seven figures per acre for suburban building land to three figures per acre for hill land. The point is that the overwhelming majority of Scotland in terms of area (that which the 432 own) is at the latter (cheap) end of the spectrum.
defaultAsk the authors of 432:50 how many people own half of Scotland by 
defaultvalue
default (=wealth)?
default3.default              defaultTax avoidance &amp; “subsidy milking” defaultThe accusation is that the tax treatment and subsidies available to the holding of Scottish land is such that it has become simply an efficient investment for wealthy people concerned to shelter their wealth but with no concern for the management of the land or wellbeing of the communities who live on it. 
defaultIt’s further claimed that the attraction of Scottish land for these ulterior motives, in turn, drives the price up and it puts it out of reach of local people. Although we’ve all heard about Sir James Dyson (of vacuum cleaner fame) allegedly investing in farm land for its tax advantages, I believe these claims are wildly exaggerated. I urge the SAC to discover the truth about this and resist the temptation to prejudge the way the authors of 432:50 have:-
default“We propose that [a comprehensive land reform] strategy should include: default&#xa0;default• defaultA series of measures (defaultbased on the findingsdefault of enquiry into the fiscal and subsidy regime outlined immediately above) intended to end the uniquely generous tax concessions and subsidy payments available to owners of landed estates.” default432:51, 
defaultpara
default. 15.10 (emphasis added)
default3.1 - Tax
defaultThe impression is often given by the land reform lobby that Scottish landowners don’t pay tax. Or that paying tax is merely optional due to the ease of simply incorporating themselves as trusts and/or offshore companies.
default“Most of the land here is owned by exceedingly wealthy people. Some of them are millionaires from elsewhere: sheikhs, oligarchs and mining magnates who own vast estates in this country. defaultAlthough they might pay no taxes in the UKdefault, they receive millions in farm subsidies”default 
defaultArticle by George 
defaultMonbiot
default in 
defaultThe Guardian
default, 2 July 2013 quoted on page 6 of 432:50 (emphasis added)
defaultLand reformers don’t understand how this can be so but cover their ignorance with tendentious spin. This then tends to be accepted uncritically and repeated by others. Note for example Community Land Scotland’s evidence to the committee:-
default“It appears increasingly clear that land acquisition and the ongoing holding of land is, for many owners, simply a vehicle for optimising tax advantages and accessing beneficial subsidies.”defaultI would urge the SAC to take evidence from HMRC and/or appropriately qualified tax accountants to get to the bottom of this. Amongst the questions I would ask such witnesses were I a member of SAC would be:-
default3.1.1
default              
defaultIs it true that someone (natural or corporate) non-resident and/or non-domiciled in the UK or trusts (UK based or otherwise) don’t pay UK Income Tax or Capital Gains Tax? If so, why is that – what are the commonly employed dodges?
default3.1.2
default              
defaultA trust never dies hence, on the face of it, can’t pay inheritance tax (IHT) but isn’t there a “ten year charge” to IHT on trusts to plug this loophole?
default3.1.3
default              
defaultDoes the General Anti-Abuse Rule introduced by the Finance Act 2013 have any bearing on these issues? If not, why not?
default3.1.4
default              
defaultIt may be tricky to pursue shadowy individuals in Caribbean islands for tax, but does HMRC not have powers to raise assessments and seize assets belonging to the ostensible owners in the UK as disclosed by the Land Registry? If not, does HMRC need such powers?
default3.1.5 
default              
defaultAre these issues peculiar to Scottish land? Might they also be features of other holdings of wealth, e.g. stocks and shares etc? (For “Land Registry” in 3.1.4, read “Stock Exchange” instead.)
default“… you can pass it [a Scottish estate] on to your family without HM Revenue wanting a slice …” (Article in the Daily Telegraph 2012 quoted on page 9 of 432:50)defaultThat’s not unique to Scottish land, you can do it with 
defaultany
default form of wealth!
default 
default3.1.6
default              
defaultAre the tax reliefs for agricultural property and timber still justified? Might it not be more sensible to integrate any reliefs peculiar to land owning with wider tax reliefs (e.g. Business Property Relief, Retirement Relief etc.)
default3.1.7
default              
defaultAre agricultural subsidies paid on land in the UK liable to UK income tax?
default3.1.8
default              
defaultHave these issues ever been investigated by other committees of parliament (e.g. Treasury Committee)?
default3.2 – “Subsidy milking”
defaultThe impression is also given by land reformers that Scottish landowners receive large amounts of subsidy without having to do anything in return – as if 
defaultall
default they have to do is simply write to the appropriate office saying “I’m the new owner, please redirect the cheques to my accountants noted below …” 
default“Wait, though, it gets better; on top of all that, the European Union will give you money.default 
defaultIt’s called the Common Agricultural Policy direct payment …”default 
default(Same article in the Daily Telegraph 2012 quoted on page 9 of 432:50)
defaultBut it’s not true.
defaultIt 
defaultwas
default the case that Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct payments (DPs) used to be tainted by the concept of “slipper farming” – the syndrome that what had to be done by way of farming to qualify for DPs in some cases was so minimal that you almost didn’t have to get out of bed. But that will stop in 2015 as a result of the so-called “Scottish clause” introduced into the EU-wide 2013 review of the CAP. (But although of largely only historical interest now, I would ask myself why, if it really was that easy, anybody bothered to do any actual farming in upland areas – a 
defaultvery
default marginal occupation - at all? Note that 
defaultAuch
default &amp; 
defaultInvermearan
default estate featured in 432:50 carries over 8,000 sheep and 146 cows managed by three full time employees.)
defaultSo far as 
defaultforestry grants
default are concerned, the impression is also sometimes given that you just need to stick a few saplings in the ground and the Forestry Commission will write you a six figure cheque with no strings attached. That is not so either. The FC only pays in instalments against satisfactory progress towards successful establishment of a plantation. If a plantation subsequently fails, FC will claw back previous instalments already paid. Establishing plantations is a horribly risky business – the trees may not take, they may get burnt, they may blow over etc. I’d suggest SAC took evidence from FC on these matters.
defaultBeyond agricultural subsidies and FC grants, 432:50 alludes rather vaguely to “other tax-payer financed payments” (
defaultpara
default 1.3) and “nature conservation grants and other disbursements” (
defaultpara
default 2.3). They should be asked to clarify what they’re talking about there. By “nature conservation grants”,  they may be alluding to the old system whereby compensation was paid to landowners for 
defaultnot
default doing things within Sites of Special Scientific Interest. This led some to dream up grandiose but impractical schemes for the sole purpose of being compensated for projected profits foregone but I believe that was put an end to by the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. The SAC may wish, however, to call for evidence from SNH to hear more about “nature conservation grants”
defaultIn summary on tax and “subsidy milking”, Danes (
defaultet al
default) buy Scottish sporting estates because they like hunting, not because they’re trying to save tax. And subsidy milking is not nearly as much of a gravy train (if you’ll pardon the mixed metaphors) as estate agents (
defaultsheesh
default!) would have you believe.
default4.default              defaultBeneficial ownership of companiesdefaultI’m not sure what the peculiarly Scottish landowning dimension of this is but if it’s a tie-in to tax evasion, then a company’s beneficial owners are not liable for its tax, even if they are fully disclosed, so does it matter who they are? 
defaultThus, supposing 
defaultBuccleuch
default Estates Ltd’s shareholder was disclosed at Companies House as Anderson 
defaultStrathern
default Nominees Ltd 
defaultas corporate trustee for the Duke of 
defaultBuccleuch
default.
default That doesn’t mean His Grace is personally liable for the company’s tax (or other debts). That’s the whole point of a company. So what does disclosure add?
defaultThere may be some less tangible benefits (ability to “name and shame” for e.g.) but don’t we in practice 
defaultalready
default know who’s behind 
defaultBuccleuch
default Estates? And 
defaultGinge
default Manor Estate Ltd (Bahamas - Lord Astor, the Prime Minister’s step father-in-law) and 
defaultSmech
default Properties Ltd (Guernsey – Sheikh 
defaultMaktoum
default of Dubai) Etc. Etc. Revealing this doesn’t seem like something worth spending any political capital over.
defaultIf the concern is about criminality and money laundering, then this seems even more tenuously related to Scottish landowning. And I suspect the links between criminals and the nominees who hold their ill-gotten gains tend to rely on relationships capable of existing quite independently of what may or may not be disclosed in public registers!
default5.default              defaultLand use or landownership?default 
defaultLand reformers are always anxious to point out that the debate is not about use of land but about ownership of it. (see e.g. 432:50, 
defaultpara
default 2.14) Surely, that’s putting the cart before the horse and the important thing is to decide how we want to use land.? Then, once we’ve done that, see whether the ownership pattern facilitates or impedes the desired use and, if it impedes it, reform the ownership as necessary?
default6.default              default“Removing Saddam Hussein syndrome”defaultLand reformers are quick to tell you what they don’t like about the present landownership pattern but (with two exceptions, see below) are frustratingly coy about what they would like to see in its place. I liken this to the rush to depose Saddam Hussein without thinking about what to replace him with.
defaultOne of the two exceptions I mentioned is increasing the opportunities for community ownership of estates. Yet when the Land Reform Review Group indicated in its interim report that it was going to be concentrating on community ownership, land reformers (including Andy Wightman) were shrill with condemnation of the limited scope of the LRRG’s future direction: “the most useless 52 pages ever committed to print”, Brian Wilson called it. Jim Hunter resigned from the LRRG around this time (and if I were a member of the SAC, I would ask him why). Even 432:50 says (
defaultpara
default 15.13)
default“Land reform, however, should not begin and end with expanding community ownership. That is why we propose: default&#xa0;default• defaultGranting tenant farmers an absolute right to buy their farms.” defaultAbsolute right to buy is the second of the two exceptions I alluded to. There are no other proposals for the “
defaultcomprehensive land reform agenda for Scotland” the sub-title of 432: 50 mentions. 
defaultConsider 
defaultAuch
default &amp; 
defaultInvermearan
default Estate which 432:50 mentions disapprovingly several times. It doesn’t have any tenant farmers so what is the land reform prescription for it if community ownership isn’t the be all and end all?
default7.default              defaultPutting the lights back on in the glens: defaultOrbostdefaultAlthough the “big beasts” of land reform such as the authors 432:50 prefer to talk about the need to remove Saddam Hussein (or, if pushed, the weapons to be deployed against him), others (e.g. people making submissions to the LRRG or leaving comments on Andy Wightman’s blog) are more ambitious. They suggest the core of land reform is “putting the lights back on” – repopulating the glens denuded during the Highland Clearances. 
defaultAuch
default and 
defaultInvermearan
default Estate provides a good example of such a glen.
defaultThere is a precedent. 
defaultOrbost
default was a 4,600 acre farm on Skye bought by the local enterprise company in 1997 with a view to the creation of a new community based on dividing it into small holdings. As I understand it, there are now some half a dozen small holdings on 
defaultOrbost
default. If you scaled that up, 
defaultAuch
default and 
defaultInvermearan
default (28,000 acres) could presumably accommodate over 30 similar holdings.
defaultIt’s strange 
defaultOrbost
default isn’t mentioned in 432:50 considering one of its authors, Jim Hunter, was the chair of the LEC concerned. But I would suggest that a useful line of enquiry for the SAC could be to look in to the implications of repeating 
defaultOrbost
default more generally and on a larger scale. Questions such as:- 
default8.default              defaultAffordable housing defaultI’ll use the remaining space on this page to talk about a pet subject of mine.
defaultIt’s often alleged that estates refuse to release land for housing which keeps prices high. I have some doubts about that. I think some people like to have a convenient bogeyman – their local estate – for the problems of their community. In the 
defaultcrofting
default areas, a lot of the land most suitable for housing isn’t controlled by estates, it’s controlled by crofters. Perhaps the real bogeyman is the planning system which means that planning permission (PP) for houses in rural areas is like hen’s teeth – so those 
defaultanyone
default who controls land will only release it for lucrative, “un-affordable” houses rather than waste the rare opportunity of PP for affordable ones.
defaultThe countryside is dotted with former council houses built by councils back in the days when (presumably) the council’s housing department was singing from the same hymn-sheet as its planning department. The council was also endowed with powers of compulsory purchase to compel a refractory landowner.
defaultReforming the planning system is too far off-topic to get into here but if the accusation is that lack of affordable housing is solely down to land owners refusing to release land, then a very simple expedient would be to give housing associations powers of compulsory purchase. (They also need appropriate funding, naturally!)
