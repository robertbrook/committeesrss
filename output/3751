defaultWritten evidence from Mr Barry AndersondefaultMy name is Barry Anderson and this is my personal view.
defaultI have been employed by Peterborough Regional College for the past 12
default 
defaultyears as an AM2
default electrical
default examiner.
defaultI 
defaultam a time served electrician
default holding a City &amp; guilds C certificate, City &amp; Guilds 2382 17
defaultth
default edition Electrical Wiring Regulations &amp; City &amp; Guilds 2391 Inspection &amp; Testing.
defaultBelow I have listed the problems I believe to exist.
defaultI fail to see how somebody can be competent in such a short space of time.
defaultI see these bodies as money making organisations trying to keep a niche market for themselves. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe solution is have only time-served tradesmen who have a JIB
default/ECS
default grading
default card
default (which
default has a photo
default of person
default proving identity) 
defaultwhich already exists as a body having stamp
defaulted
default on the card what level of competence they are at. The fee 
default(approx
default £15) for this is far less than what the other organisations are charging. This 
defaultis done on an individual basis not as a cover for one person in a company signing all employees work off.
default 
defaultThis would simplify the already very complicated and confusing system.
default How was this missed when first thinking about proving competence?
