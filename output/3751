[normal]Written evidence from Mr Barry Anderson[bold]My name is Barry Anderson and this is my personal view.
[normal]I have been employed by Peterborough Regional College for the past 12
[normal] 
[normal]years as an AM2
[normal] electrical
[normal] examiner.
[normal]I 
[normal]am a time served electrician
[normal] holding a City &amp; guilds C certificate, City &amp; Guilds 2382 17
[normal]th
[normal] edition Electrical Wiring Regulations &amp; City &amp; Guilds 2391 Inspection &amp; Testing.
[normal]Below I have listed the problems I believe to exist.
[normal]I fail to see how somebody can be competent in such a short space of time.
[normal]I see these bodies as money making organisations trying to keep a niche market for themselves. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The solution is have only time-served tradesmen who have a JIB
[normal]/ECS
[normal] grading
[normal] card
[normal] (which
[normal] has a photo
[normal] of person
[normal] proving identity) 
[normal]which already exists as a body having stamp
[normal]ed
[normal] on the card what level of competence they are at. The fee 
[normal](approx
[normal] £15) for this is far less than what the other organisations are charging. This 
[normal]is done on an individual basis not as a cover for one person in a company signing all employees work off.
[normal] 
[normal]This would simplify the already very complicated and confusing system.
[normal] How was this missed when first thinking about proving competence?
