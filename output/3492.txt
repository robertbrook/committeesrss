[[[Written evidence submitted by David Livermore (AMR0049)]]]&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?Please see Livermore DM; Fourteen years in resistance. Int J Antimicrob Agents 2012; 

[[[39:]]]283-294.  This has been submitted among background papers&#xa0;Note particularly 

[[[Declines]]] in (i) MRSA and (ii) resistant pneumococci

[[[Rises]]] in resistant gram-negatives, including (i) ESBL-producing and quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, (ii) carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and (iii) cephalosporin-resistant gonococci.&#xa0;The issues with gram-negative bacteria include both the transfer of resistance, by loops of DNA called plasmids, among bacteria, and the spread of successful resistant bacterial strains among patients.  What is more, resistant Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli and related species) can be carried in the healthy human gut for months or years, facilitating spread e.g. in care homes.&#xa0;2.              What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?&#xa0;Despite the agreed need for good ‘antibiotic stewardship’ there is a lack of clarity about what good stewardship looks like, beyond a general agreement on the obvious point that profligate use drives further resistance for little gain.&#xa0; &#xa0;There is a simplistic tendency in the UK to equate stewardship with minimising use of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, which were blamed for the Clostridium difficile problem of the last decade. Consequently there are major balancing increases in the use of a very narrow range of alternative antibiotics, especially piperacillin-tazobactam.&#xa0;&#xa0; There are reasonable grounds to fear that this will end badly, insofar as it concentrates selection pressure on these few heavily used agents, and can be characterised as 'squeezing the balloon'. &#xa0;Such concentrated usage led to repeated sequential destruction of antibiotics against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (first sulphonamides, then low dose penicillin, then high dose penicillin, then ciprofloxacin, latterly cefixime….)&#xa0; 

[[[It might be better stewardship to seek to minimise total usage but to seek heterogeneity of antimicrobial prescribing within this limited total. ]]]&#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?&#xa0;No: there is not sufficient.&#xa0; Private investment should be made more attractive, given that govt spending already greatly exceeds revenues, limiting the scope for public funding.&#xa0; The GAIN Act in the US is a useful model, effectively extending patent life and is already stimulating considerable interest.&#xa0; &#xa0;More generally I would favour Pull rather than Push incentives, as being more likely to encourage diversity of development rather than bureaucratic attempts to ‘pick winners’.  &#xa0;Barriers to entry should be reduced.&#xa0; Pharma repeatedly tells me that a typical Phase III trial enrolling 1000 patients (300 per arm plus 'wastage') costs $50-100m, or $50000-100000 per patient --- usually far more than the patient's total treatment costs .&#xa0;&#xa0; This means that only a few large companies can run such trials and creates a bottleneck, even when small pharma has promising drug candidates.&#xa0; We should identify why costs are so high (demands of regulators or demands of the physicians/hospitals who recruit and supply the patients entered) and seek to reduce them.&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens? 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Infection control is effective when the issue is clonal spread of bacterial strains among patients by cross-infection, as with MRSA. It is, however, less clear that infection control works when the issue is dispersion of resistance plasmids coding resistance among different Enterobacteriaceae.&#xa0;Fines to hospitals for MRSA bacteraemias and C. diff have worked (case numbers are reduced) but are now distorting activity.   Hospitals now worry more about the one MRSA bacteraemia than about 30 E. coli bacteraemias, yet E. coli bacteraemias, many of them caused my resistant strains, are increasing whilst MRSA declines…&#xa0;Fear that cephalosporins select for C. diff has led to extreme aversion to using these agents even when they are appropriate therapy and the patient is at low risk for C. difficile. &#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?&#xa0;We should seek to collaborate internationally on surveillance of resistance --- this is good across EU with EARS-net, but weaker with Commonwealth countries with which we have major population flows esp the Indian sub-continent, where resistance is extremely prevalent.&#xa0; We need to support constructive initiatives, e.g. Chennai Declaration, in India.&#xa0; Note, more generally, that resistance is most prevalent in newly prosperous developing countries.&#xa0;We need to recognise that growing chaos in the Middle East &amp; N Africa will spread resistance--- UK brought 50 casualties from Libyan conflict to UK for treatment &amp; dispersed across hospitals---- at least 12 of these patients had multi-resistant bacteria sent to AMRHAI, 6 of them K. pneumoniae with OXA-48 carbapenemases.&#xa0; Malta has been over-run with OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae since similarly accepting patients from the Libyan conflict.. &#xa0;We should co-operate within the EU e.g. on improving licensing regulation (which is handled via EMA) and on legislation akin to the GAIN act, creating 'Pull' incentives.&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?&#xa0;I contributed to writing this and so have conflict of interest.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
