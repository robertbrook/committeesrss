[normal]Dear Sir / Madam
[normal]Thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the select committee inquiry.  I hope that you will find a parent’s perspective useful when considering the 
[normal]issues affecting academies and free schools.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some of the issues on which views were sought are addressed in more detail below. 
[normal]“[bold]The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing [bold]the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes.[bold]”[bold]What should actually be done[bold] to narrow the gap?[bold]  
[normal]As discussed previously there are some actions that merely play lip-service to narrowing the gap rather than having a material impact.   
[normal]Useful partnerships 
[normal]are likely to involve sharing experience and resources. 
[normal]Sharing experience[bold]Again, the forces that put schools in competition with each other may not result in maximisi
[normal]ng co-operation.
