"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Phonographic Performance Limited t/a PPL [FBB0060]&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0; \nPPL is the UK-based music licensing company which licenses recorded music \nto be played in public or broadcast (including certain online \nuses)\n.\n Established in 1934, PPL carries out this role on behalf of over 10,000 record company and 65,000 performer members\n,\n the majority of which are small businesses or sole traders. PPL generated revenue of over £170m in 2012.\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nPPL’s broadcast and online \nlicensing covers the use of recorded music on the BBC’s television, radio and iPlayer services and by hundreds of commercial broadcasters. These include ITV, Channel 4, Five and BSkyB, together with services such as Virgin Media and BT Vision. These licenc\nes often cover a range of new media uses of recorded music in addition to “traditional” broadcasts. PPL also licenses commercial radio networks such as Capital, Heart and Absolute Radio, online services such as Last.fm, and community, hospital, student and\n prison radio stations.\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nAs regards the BBC, t\nhe licence granted by PPL provides the BBC with the right to include recorded music controlled by PPL’s members within the wide range of services operated by the BBC, including its radio and television broadcasts and digital services such as the BBC iPlaye\nr. PPL also licenses BBC Worldwide for \nvarious uses of r\necorded music\n.  \n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nPPL welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Inquiry.  PPL notes the remit of the Inquiry and the questions set out in the Inquiry’s call for evidence. Many of the topics \ncovered by the call for evidence are matters in respect of which, given its role as a music licensing company, PPL is not best placed to comment\n.\n1.5.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, PPL can offer evidence in the form of its experiences of licensing the BBC (and BBC Worldwide) \nover m\nany years, \npart\nicularly with regard to those aspects of the call for evidence which focus on the public purposes set out in the current Charter. PPL hopes that the information it is able to provide will be of some assistance to the Culture, Media and Sport\n Committee as it considers further the matters covered by the Inquiry. \n2.1.&#xa0; \nThe BBC’s principal radio services broadcast a substantially wider range of sound recordings than equivalent commercial radio services. Not only does this contribute to its public purpose of “stimulating creativity and cultural excellence”, it also provides a wider opportunity for new sound recordings and new recording artists to be heard by the public, which is important for the future health and success of the UK music industry.2.2.&#xa0; \nThrough the international transmissions of its music radio services and the distribution (by BBC Worldwide) of television programmes which include UK music, the BBC helps to meet its public purpose of “bringing the UK to the world” and supports the global success of the UK music industry.2.3.&#xa0; \nIn launching new digital services such as the iPlayer (as an example of fulfilling its public purpose of “helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologies and services”), the BBC has favoured a collective licensing approach and this has paved the way for PPL’s collective licensing of similar services by commercial providers, thereby widening the scope of legitimate online services in the UK. 2.4.&#xa0; \nAs a general observation, PPL notes that the BBC (as a music user on a considerable scale) demonstrates due respect for the need to obtain legal clearance for the rights to use PPL’s members’ recordings.  It also observes due process, with the licensing terms being agreed by way of robust arm’s-length negotiations and by reference to appropriate comparators in the commercial sector, whilst always recognising that the BBC must make appropriate payment for such rights.2.5.&#xa0; \nFor ease of reference, PPL’s comments below are presented under the headings of public purposes from the current Charter.&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0; \nIn \nPPL’s experience\n,\n the BBC \ngenerally \nmakes use of a wider range of different sound recordings than equivalent commercial \nbroadcasting \nservices. \n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nThis is based on the reporting information provided by PPL’s broadcasting licensees.  \nIn order to appropriately \ndistribute royalties to its members, PPL requires its licensees \nto \nreport details of the \nrecordings that have been used \nunder their licences, \nand the extent of such usage\n. PPL then pays its members \nbased on this usage information (\napplying the same methodo\nlogy whether the recording is owned by major record companies, independent labels or self-releasing artists\n)\n.\n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nBy way of example, \n27,868\n \ndifferent unique\n recordings were played on BBC R\nadio 2\n in 2012\n. This\n is significantly higher than the equivalent number on any commercial radio station\n in the same period,\n and\n can be compared to \n1,375 \nunique recordings played on\n the Heart network of stations and 4,073 \nunique recordings played on\n the Magic network of stations. \nIt is reasonable to assume that s\nourcing and selecting this larger range of recordings is likely to require investment of time and effort that is unlikely to be recreated by a service operating in the commercial sector. \n3.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe\n BBC is also a member of PPL in its rol\ne as the owner of a substantial amount of commercial music. New music commission\ned by the BBC adds to the world-\nleading UK repertoire of music, particularly \nin the classical \ngenre\n. \n4.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe UK is a net exporter of recorded music\n,\n adding to the UK’s balance of trade and helping to promote the UK and British culture in a wider sense. By way of example, \nin 2012\n,\n \nUK \nrecordings\n made up 12% of the\n US recorded music \nmarket and \nfour out of five of the top selling albums in the US were from UK artists.\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nPPL licenses\n the BBC \nand/or BBC Worldwide for a number of international activities\n, which therefore form part of the revenue generated for PPL members by virtue of the popularity an\nd consumption of UK recorded music around the world\n:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimulcasting \nthe World Service outside of the UK\n (BBC); \n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nnclusion of recorded music within BBC television and radio programmes released \n(i\n) as digital downloads\n-to-own (BBC) and (ii\n) for sale, rental or\n lending on DVDs and spoken-word CDs\n (BBC Worldwide);\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCopying recorded music within radio and television programmes for the purpose of supplying those programmes \nfor secondary use by \nother broadcasters; \n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBroadcasting recorded music within programming on th\ne international television channels operated by BBC Worldwide. \n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nCollective licensing of rights in music and other creative content enables providers of new digital services to reduce transaction costs and invest in and operate their services with the confidence that rights have been cleared. \nIn turn, t\nhis also delivers\n efficiencies and \nfair remuneration \nfor creators\n and copyright owners\n and\n,\n ultimately\n,\n a greater range of \nlegitimate \nservices and content for consumers.\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC has been an advocate of collective licensing \nfor innovative digital services, such as the iPlay\ner\n. It has\n, on a number of occasions, been PPL’s first licensee in respect of new forms of \nexploitation, simply due to it being the first to offer those new services and/or to seek collective music rights clearance for them\n. \n This has paved the way for the\n collective licensing of similar services operated by \ncommercial \nproviders\n.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
