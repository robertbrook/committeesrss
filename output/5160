defaultCase Study defaultBzee Shopdefault, Cavendish Square, ChesterfielddefaultOn 14 January 20
default13, following complaints to the trading standards 
defaultservice regarding the alleged sale of illicit/counterfeit tobacco, an officer of the Department undertook a ‘test purchase’ from 
defaultthe above shop in Chesterfield
default. This resulted in the sale of cigarettes which, on further examination by the brand holder, were found to be counterfeit.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a result, on 30
defaultth
default January, the shop was searched and a quantity of counterfeit cigarettes (approximately 31,000) and tobacco (approximately 16kg) was found on the premises, all of which has been confirmed as counterfeit or illicit.
default&#xa0;
default These goods were found hidden in an outside store, linked to the premises, and under the counter. The assistant in the shop at the time was arrested, interviewed in custody and bailed pending our on-going enquiries.
default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing further reports that the shop was continuing to sell, a second visit was carried out on 20
defaultth
default March 2013, with police and Trading Standards Officers again in attendance. A prior test purchase was conducted
default on the day which resulted in a 
defaultsale. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn this occasion the goods were hidden inside a security door (which we believe had been constructed since the last raid) and in the empty tank of a disused water heater. In total 4
default,
default680 cigarettes and 2.15
default 
defaultkg of tobacco were found. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn th
defaultis occasion the shop assistant 
defaultwas arrested, questioned, detained (as he provided no definitive address) and prosecuted in Chesterfield Magistrates Court on the following day, having pleaded guilty to the ‘sale’ charges for the test purchase. Our enquiries continue following this subsequent enforcement.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is worth noting that the person working in the shop has been different on the three occasions our officers have attended (overtly or covertly)
default&#xa0;
default- and we do not believe that they are acting in isolation of some greater degree of control from a ‘directing mind’.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have had reports again since our visit that the shop has reopened and is continuing to sell illegal goods. The reports have been direct and via the local police, and often emanate from local shopkeepers who 
defaultstate that
default they are losing significant trade due to the illegal activities 
defaultof the Bzee shop
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe local authority has no power
default to close down premises 
defaultbreaching either
default 
defaultthe 
defaultTrade Marks Act 1994 or the Consumer Protection Act 1987 
defaultwhich are enforced by the 
defaultTrading Standards
default division
default. Our experience is that the shops restock and are up and running within a day/a few hours of our enforcement, and consider our intervention an ‘occupational hazard’
default&#xa0;
defaultIt 
defaultcould be argued
default that the get up of the shop, the concealment of illegal stock, the lack of legitimate cigarettes and tobacco (and other stock) and the alterations undertaken to facilitate this trade (security door and water heater), as well as the conduct of the shop workers, all give rise to the conclusion that the main purpose of the shop is the supply of counterfeit cigarettes and tobacco.
