"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Professor Donald Bligh [CST0059]&#xa0;My ID and relevant backgroundI am Professor Donald Bligh.  \n  \nI represent no organisation\n.  \n1985-1995 I was Special Adviser to the Home Office on Police Curricula and the Promotion Exams for Sergeants and Inspectors\n.  \nDuring that time \nI retrained police trainers nationally \nafter PACE and Scarman.  \nI was then Police\n Ombudsman\n for those exams\nSince then I have been a\n University\n Honorary Fellow in Police Studies, a volunteer inspector of detainees in police cells, a Neighbourhood Watch Coo\nrdinator and a member of a PA.  \nI read in the Times for November 20\nth\n 2013 that Mr Jenkin was shocked by police fabrication of crime statistics.  \nOn 14/12/2013 the Times ran an article headed “Met silences the PC who exposed ‘fiddled’ figures”.  For 14 ye\nars \nI have researched \nthe consequences\n \nof suspicious crime statistics in Tshire,\n the bullying of a potential whistleblower\n, the apparent collusion and cover-up by all public institutions concerned,\n and \nthe\n repercussions\n for hi\ns family\n.\n \n You suggested I \ncom\nment\n.  \n&#xa0;1                            Abstract2-16                            Events              2              Suspicious statistics              3              The Chief wanted a review              4              Bullying a potential whistleblower (PWB)              5              PWB’s Complaint              6-10              Perverting the course of investigation              11-16              The IPCC protects the alleged conspirators17-25                            Interpretations, Implications and Comments              17              The innocent suffer most              18              Responsible professionals appear criminally collusive              19              What motivates members of these organisations to collude?              20              A misplaced loyalty and power are prioritised above truth and justice.                21              The neglected moral values of policing.              22              Whither Reform?              23              Conclusion&#xa0;Abstract1              \nWhat I find is a\nn alleged\n \nconspiratorial \nchain of \ncriminal \ncollusion where\n professional and \ninter-professional\n loyalties are more important than the truth\n or the rights of lay\n citizens\n.  \nI have reason to believe this is part of a wider malaise.  I suggest a response\n, albeit an inadequate one\n.  \nEvents2              \nSuspicious statistics.  I\nn the \nmid\n 1990s \nTshire\n, a relatively small rural constabulary,\n appear\ned\n to \nbe \nreporting\n very high levels of \nViolence Against the Person (\nVAP\n)\n and high levels of detected crime, when compared with similar areas of the country.  \nProbably\n responsibility for their presentation lay with the Deputy Chief Constable (DCC), Assistant Chief Constable \n(\nACC\n)\n, Chair of the Police Authority (C\nhair\n), the PA Clerk and the \nDetective Chief Superintendent\n.  \n&#xa0;\n3              \nThe Chief wanted a review.  The raw figures \nwent unnoticed amongst those for the big cities.  \nHowever w\nhen I calculated VAP per 1000 population (which the Home Office did not do) the anomaly stood out.  \nYet\n a\n \nnewly\n arrived\n C\nhief Constable\n, \n(CC)\n \ndid notice.  He \nfunded \na review \nand asked Officer PWB\n t\no set up a short list of potential researchers\n.  \nReportedly the DCC was livid.  \nDCC \nand ACC, with the apparent support of the \nClerk\n and \nChair\n, \nmade \na \ncomplaint\n \nagainst \nthe \nCC\n \nregarding \nthe\n contract\n to investigate statistics\n. \n \nOfficer Potential Whistleblowe\nr (PWB)\n \nhad information to\n falsify\n this complaint\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n4              \nBullying a potential whistleblower.  Tshire’s \nComplaints and Discipline Department\n (\nC&amp;D\n)\n, reporting to DCC,\n \nstarted to investigate \nPWB\n,\n his \nestranged wife \nand \nfamily\n.  \nPWB believes t\nhey looked at \nhis, his \nfamily\n’s\n \nand his wife’s business \nbank accounts, telephone records, utility bills, \ncommunity charges, \ntapped their phones\n, told the Inland Revenue \nwithout evidence \nthey were guilty\n \nof “widespread tax evasion”,\n \nmade 45 house to house enquiries about\n their marriage; and told their son’s local education authority\n \n240\n miles away\n \nto withdraw his \nuniversity \ngrant.  L\nater \nthey\n prosecuted \nPWB\n and \nhis \nwife \nregarding a\nn innocent\n university grant application\n. \n \nThe \nC&amp;D\n also tried to caution their children for a\nlleged offences related to this application. \n PWB\n observed that \nC&amp;D\n’s\n \ninterview transcripts sent to the CPS had over 100 excisions.  One interview was reduced from 62 to 15 pages.  \nThe effect \nand purpose \nwas to discredit \nPWB\n.  His evidence \nabout\n \nthe contract \nrelating to\n criminal statistics \nwas never \nasked for or \nobtained.  \nIt seems the Chair and Clerk \nof the PA \narranged\n a\n pension and resignation agreement with CC \nthat compelled absolute secrecy\n.  \n&#xa0;\n5              \nPWB’s complaint.  Wanting to complain PWB \nwrote\n to the Home Secretary.  He did not believe anyone would investigate the depth and thoroughness\n with which the \nC&amp;D\n persecuted his family.  \nSo he decided to\n include\n as much evidence as he could in the complaint itself.  It ran to over 200 pages and containe\nd 132 specific allegations in bold underlined text \nagainst the DCC, ACC, \nCC’s \nsuccessor\n \n(\nCC\n2\n)\n, the \nClerk, Chair\nman and \nnamed \nmembers of the \nC&amp;D\n \nalleging misfeasance in public office\n \ninclud\ning\n details of \nan \nalleged \nconspiracy to incriminate \nPWB\n, his wife and his children, to induce false confessions, to maliciously prosecute Mrs \nPWB\n and her children\n, to pervert justice, to abuse process, and to subvert evidence by \nmaking \nthe\n excisions\n from interview transcripts\n.  \n&#xa0;\n6              \nPerverting the course of investigation.   Email\ns \nallege\n that \nin an abuse of process \nthe Home Office discussed the Complaint with at least one of those accused, probably the Clerk.  \nBecause the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) was not empowered to investigate \nan alleged conspiracy of\n \njunior officers, ACPO officers and PA members, t\nhe \nHome Office \nsent \nthe Complaint \nto HMIC who\n, the Minister said\n,\n \n“does have locus to recommend the appointment of an investigating officer in such cases”\n.  HMIC\n consulted\n two alleged \nconspirators\n, \nthe Clerk\n and \nCC2\n, \nand \nreferred \nthe Complaint \nto the \nPCA\n.  Arguably th\nese three\n perverted justice because \nthe conspiracy\n itself\n, \nACPO and PA members were no longer investigated\n.  Arguably too\n,\n HMIC \nhad \nthereby \njoined the conspiracy.  \nYet the conspirators still had to sideline PWB’s 200 pages of information and its 132 specific allegations.  \nThe CHMIC said the HMI had neither authority nor power to conduct such enquiries; \n“These are matters for the Chief Constable”\n.  \n&#xa0;\n7              \nHMIC sent\n no co\npy of the Complaint\n to the PCA.  \nConsequently\n,\n the PCA had no idea \nwho \nwas complained of\n, what the complaints\n were\n, or any of the evidence\n.\n \n \nA \nDeputy Chairman of the \nPCA\n (PCA1)\n wrote to \nPWB\n.  \nShe says t\nhe Clerk \nand\n \nCC\n2\n’s\n new DCC, \nDCC\n2\n,\n \nattended a meeting\n \nt\no advise the PCA and \na \nDCC \nfrom\n \nConstabulary\n \nA\n.  This DCC\n confirms\n \n(private communication) that \nthe Clerk \nand DCC\n2\n \nsat through that meeting without saying \nt\nhe \nClerk \nwas one of those accused. \n Effectively DCC\n2\n was \nthereafter\n, if not 18 months earlier,\n \nalso \na member of the alleged conspiracy.  \nTh\nus the\n \nalleged \nconspiracy widens.  \n&#xa0;\n8              \nDeputed as the \n“\nAppropriate Authority\n”\n, DCC\n2\n ignored \nPWB’s\n \noriginal\n Complaint and \nselected\n new allegations based on a\nn invited\n supplementary statement \nby \nPWB\n.  \nPWB \nand \nI\n \nsa\ny\n the\n \nallegations\n were \ntrivial, uninvestigable and \nselected to fail\n.  One \nfabrication \nwas against a\nn inspector in another force\n of whom \nPWB\n made no mention\n \nor\n complaint\n.  It \nshowed knowledge only possessed by officer\ns\n \nC&amp;D\n3\n and C&amp;D4\n.  \nD\nespite repeated requests\n,\n \nt\nhe number and \ncontent\n of these misrepresentations was kept secret by PCA\n1’s\n successor\n,\n PCA2\n,\n \nand DCC2 who appeared to be in collusion\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n9              \nIn other words the alleged offender\ns\n themselves\n chose the items for investigation\n.  \nWe \nallege\n \nthe\n \nPCA\n enquiry was \npe\nrverted\n by the alleged \nconspirators\n before it started.  \nTh\nis\n alleged corrupt\nion\n had a momentum \nPWB\n was powerless to stop.  \nPCA2\n refused to consider there was any corruption.  \nConstabulary\n \nA finished their report within a year\n.  Without\n its author\n’s knowled\nge,\n it appears \nOfficer\n W of Tshire\n, reporting to DCC2,\n secretly changed it to prevent more complaints.  \nThe\n alleged criminal conspirator\n, CC2,\n owned the report\n.  \n&#xa0;\n10              \nTo circumvent\n this power, PWB’s MP and PWB \nasked to meet\n the Minister\n personally\n to \nshow evidence of what was happening.  \nHitherto\n the Home Office’s \nabuse of process \nseemed to me \nsomewhat\n partial.  This would test it\n.  \nThe Minister\n \nrefused to see us\n after 15 months\n.  S\nhe \nsaid she got her \ninformation from Tshire police\n, the PA, the PCA and the\n IPCC.  She \nfail\ned\n to appreciate that all these sources got their informatio\nn from one source, \nDCC2\n.  Her description \nomits his role in paras 7, 8 and 9 above\n thereby protecting alleged senior conspirators\n.  \nThis left me questioning the moral integrity of \nthe Home Office \nofficials upon whom\n ministers must depend.  \n&#xa0;\n11              \nThe IPCC protects the alleged conspirators.  The IPCC undertook a \nr\neview these events\n.  \nThough arguably in the public interest, \na\n IPCC \nCommissioner \nhas refused to release \neven a summary of \nit\ns \nfindings\n, \nciting Parliament’s Freedom of Information and Data Protection.  \nWhy not? \n \nI sincerely believe\n \nthere is \nconcealment of offences \nto protect \nalleged \ncriminal \nconspirators\n.  In effect\n \na\n Commissioner \njoin\ned\n the \nalleged \nconspiracy.  \n&#xa0;\n12              \nIn 2003\n and again \ni\nn \n2004\n \nPWB\n further complained that \nC&amp;D\n3 and \nC&amp;D\n4\n lied to the High Court\n \nin a libel case against me\n, \nwhen \nclaim\ning\n, amongst many things,\n there were no excisions\n \nfrom the \nPWB\n family’s interview transcripts\n.  \nThe \n2004\n complaint set out \nthe \nalleged\n criminal \nimplications\n \nagainst\n ACPO \nand \nPA \nofficers.  \nT\nhe IPCC Commissioner avoided these implications by only investigating\n th\ne \n2003\n complaint\n under the 1996 Act\n,\n \nnot the latter\n.\n  \nAgain \nI believe \nthe IPCC \nCommissioner \nprotected alleged \nsenior \nconspira\ntors\n.  \n&#xa0;\n13              \nOfficers from another force\n wrote a very lengthy report that the \nIPCC \nCommissioner has also \nrefused to release\n.\n  \nAs with the Review\n,\n PWB\n might ask, \n‘\nIf there is nothing incriminating in it\n why can’t it be open; and if there is, what is it?\n and what\n is the IPCC’s duty\n regarding it\n?\n’\n  \nT\nhe\n IPCC\n \nfound\n no law prohibiting lies in the High Court, \nand \nthen t\nold\n \nPWB \nthere was insufficient evidence that officers \n“knowingly and deliberately”\n made the excisions.  \nI c\na\nn’t \nunderstand\n how they made them unknowingly.  \n&#xa0;\n14              \nAfter \nyet\n more e\nvidence was supplied it appears \nC&amp;D\n3\n \ngave the IPCC nearly full transcripts (here called [f]) \nclaiming\n to be copies of those sent to the CPS (here called [a]).  The IPCC accepted them as such.  The Comm\nissioner and\n his caseworker \nrefused to send copies for \nPWB’s\n scrutiny even though, if truly genuine, \nPWB\n should have received \nthem \nwhen released by the CPS\n \na decade earlier\n,\n instead of \nreceiving \nth\nose with excisions\n.  \nLater \nwe got copies via the IPCC’s Lon\ndon Information Officer.  Thus we have two sets of transcripts.  We can show 10 different kinds of evidence that [f] \nwere not sent to the CPS\n.  \nC&amp;D3 must know that.  So should the Commissioner\n and his caseworker\n.  \nThe Commissioner’s suggestion that 100+ ex\ncisions were made by the CPS \nattempts to protect \nC&amp;D\n3\n, but so beggars belief that it undermines his own credibility\n.  \nFor what possible motive would anyone at the CPS have to go through every \ninterview \ntranscript cutting out bits to change the meaning of what was said (13), and to hide evidence of innocence (31), oppression (34), implanted false information (10), errors (7), solicitor interventions (14), fishing (17), lies and misrepresentation (14), oth\ner abuses of process and police malpractice (33) \nfor the sole purpose of sending\n \na \ndeception to the \nPWB\ns?  And did the CPS then complete new \naccompanying \nMG15(T)\n forms\n, Exhibit lists, forge \nC&amp;D\n3’s\n signature, re-type all transcripts,  re-stamp all paginatio\nn and stamp Exhibit Nos with a stamp they probably don’t possess?\n&#xa0;\n15              \nThe alleged conspiracy is not over.  \nAfter \nI \nreport\ned\n this \nalleged \nforgery \nas a crime in 2012 two more Gwent officers \nwrote to protect their colleagues\n and \nthen \nrefused further correspon\ndence\n.  \n&#xa0;\n16              \nSo much for \na few of the \ndocument\ned\n \nfacts \nas I see them\n. \n The implications \nand questions \nare so diverse I cannot get my head round them.  \n&#xa0;Interpretations, Implications and Comments17              \nThe innocent suffer most.  This is a case of bullying, \n(a)\n not of a whistleblower, but a \npotential whistleblower\n; \n(b)\n of \nhis estranged wife\n and her children\n who\n have, and had, nothing to do with Tshire Police or their crime statistics.  They lived 240 miles away.  They are powerless to battle against the pilla\nrs of the criminal justice system\n, the very people employed to maintain standards and protect them\n.  \nParliament allows no challenge to an IPCC conclusion except JR.  \nHow can they \nafford\n justice?\n  \nWhat can PWB do?\n&#xa0;\n18              \nResponsible professionals appear criminally collusive.  My allegations, mostly of perverting justice, are against \nup to 20 members from \nTshire’s Complaints and Discipline Department, its Standards Department, ACPO officers, \nthe \nPA, HMIC, the IPCC, the Home Office and the P\nC\nA.  \nThere needs to be\n an impartial investigation, but \nnone of these organisations can be trusted\n to do it\n.  \nNone has shown moral integrity.  Who should take responsibility now?  The Home Secretary?\n&#xa0;\n19              \nWhat motivates members of these organisations to collude? \n \nHow \nand why\n does this conspiracy work?  \nDo all the\n people \ninvolved \nknow each other?  I doubt it.  \nYet they \nprotect each other.  \nThey don’t know Mrs PWB either\n but there is no loyalty to her.  S\nhe doesn’t matter to them.  \nL\nike racism,\n ‘She’s not one of us’.  \n&#xa0;\n20              \nA misplaced loyalty and power are prioritised above truth and justice. Psychologists call this phenomenon, ‘Groupthink’.  It commonly unites bullying groups.  It is characterised by pressures to conform, \nperceived \nsafety in group membership, \na sense of power, \nr\nationalised self justification,\n a belief in group unanimity, self censorship, belittlement of others\n, self denial, a belief in their own morality and sometimes ‘mindguards’ who actively prevent expression of dissent.  There may also be laziness: ‘It must b\ne OK if all those people think so’.  Arguably Hillsborough and Met Police also offer examples.  \n&#xa0;\n21              \n‘Collusion’ or ‘corruption’?  \nBy saying “collusion” I have carefully stopp\ned short of saying “corruption”.  \nBut when \nthose \nin positions of governmental \npublic service\n protect each other\n in breaking the law\n, and \nthen use their position and power to \npressure conform\nity by others,\n \nis \nthat the essence of a corrupt state\n?\n  \nI cannot prove it, but w\nhatever the word, if the paperwork had fallen \non\n other \ngovernmen\ntal\n desk\ns\n I believe the forces of ‘Groupthink’ would have applied just the same\n.  It is too much for me to believe a remarkable coincidence that the paperwork always fell to collusively vulnerable individuals.  \nAnd that is all the more alarming because mos\nt of the individuals in question are in senior positions.  If the media asked me, ‘How near is corruption to the top of these governmental institutions?’ I should have difficulty in giving rational assurance.  \n&#xa0;\n21              The neglected moral values of policing.    Part of the problem is that the police, public and government have \na one-sided \nTV \nview\n of what policing should be.  The police are seen as an organisation responding to incidents, catching and prosecuting offenders.  \nThese are the values of power.  \nThey \nare that\n of course\n, but \npolice should offer\n far more than that.  Police should offer protection and the provision of needs. \n Many do.  \nThese are the values of \ncare, \ncompassion and service.  \nPWB \nand his family \ngot none of that.  Police need both.  \n&#xa0;22              Whither reform? If s\no who is in any position to change\n this unprofessional \ncollusive \ncounter-culture\n? \n No one.  \nIndividuals have\n to change \nthemselves\n.  Chang\ning\n values cannot be imposed.  Opportunities can be created, that is all.  It is\n a massive task.  The f\nirst step is Truth and Reconciliation using \nthe methods of \nRestorative Justice\n.  \nWithout them\n,\n do we have a long inquiry and even longer \ncriminal \ntrials?\n  And what would th\ney\n do?  \nWe need procedures that can support a culture in changing itself. \n That seems lacking.  \nAttitude change is by far the most difficult task in adult education.  It needs taking empl\no\nyees out of their comfort \nzone for say two weeks, requiring them to decide upon ambiguous decision scenarios, \nindentifying and clarifying in \nd\niscussion the moral principles implied\n,\n and the beginning of each day \ndevoted to\n shared inner reflection in a group of up to 30 similarly engaged.  I have done this work when re-training police trainers\n.  It requires very careful of preparation of scenario\ns, but can be rewarding in the long run.  \n&#xa0;\n23              \nConclusion  \nStatistics for Domestic Violence should be distinguished from other VAP.  \nCrimes per population could aid interpretation.  \nI believe what began with \nsuspicious crime statistics \nhas led to \na long ru\nnning criminal conspiracy\n amongst relatively senior members of\n \npolice related professions.  There is no effective redress for its victims.  Correspondence shows the police know that and trade upon it.  Thus there is power without adequate restraint, a reci\npe for corruption.  \nSecrecy is the vehicle of conspiracy.  I believe its \nlegitimised use is excessive and needless\n.  M\nore than statistics\n,\n \nultimately it is these issues and flaws in procedures that need parliamentary attention.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
