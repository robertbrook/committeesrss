[[[Written evidence submitted by Icax Ltd (HOT15)]]]ICAX Ltd is the innovative designer and installer of Interseasonal Heat Transfer. Interseasonal Heat Transfer integrates complementary renewable energy technologies to capture surplus solar energy in summer, store the heat in ThermalBanks over the autumn in order to release heat economically to buildings in winter. ICAX is leading the drive to provide Economic Renewable Energy.This written evidence is submitted by Edward Thompson who is a director of ICAX Ltd and is also the Treasurer of the Ground Source Heat Pump Association.The response has been restricted to questions relating to heat pumps, the RHI and thermal storage. •&#xa0;What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?There is zero local environmental impact from the use of ground source heat pumps in urban areas (no emissions, no noise, no visible impact) as ground source heat pumps provide invisible heating systems.•&#xa0;What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?&#xa0; This depends on the efficiency of the power station in converting gas to electricity (normally around 50%) and the Co-efficient of Performance (CoP) of the ground source heat pumps (normally around 400%). If heat pumps are poorly installed there is a danger that the CoP could fall to 200% and, at that level, there would be no merit in using heat pumps. Ground source heat pumps can now be used in conjunction with solar thermal collection in summer and heat storage in ground arrays to yield COPs of over 500%. In these installations a clear advantage can be demonstrated for centralised electricity production plus domestic ground source heat pumps.Ground source heat pumps in well insulated buildings can be set to provide background heating at night (when electricity supply is significantly cheaper).&#xa0;•&#xa0;Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?Legal problems and custom have held back district heating schemes in the UK, as well as issues of measuring heat used by customers of district heating. CHP has advantages in the heating season – but only marginal advantage in summer, unless connected to Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage.•&#xa0;Should the government take any further any specific actions in relation to cooling? We know that DECC are opposed to the idea of subsidising cooling by air conditioning: we are very much in sympathy with the idea that standard air conditioning should not be encouraged – because there are large carbon emission implications. This is because the standard approach to cooling – heat exchange with hot air – is expensive in electricity [and therefore carbon emissions].  The CoP (Coefficient of Performance) of a roof-mounted chiller can be as low as 1.5 on a hot day [1 kilowatt of electricity is needed to provide 1.5 kW of cooling].  However, some cooling is necessary, and there is a very much more effective way of achieving this – by employing ground source energy and allowing heat to escape to cold ground instead of forcing heat into hot air.  The CoP of “free cooling” (heat exchange with cold ground by means of a circulation pump) can be as high as 25. The CoP of Renewable Cooling (heat exchange with cold ground assisted by a reversible heat pump) can frequently achieve a CoP of 8. The carbon emission savings of using Renewable Cooling, instead of standard Air Conditioning, are huge and we believe that DECC will come to see that these should be encouraged.There will need to be appropriate safeguards, which could be defined in terms of requiring a high CoP before Renewable Cooling is recognised and requiring a high temperature set point so that Cooling is only used when necessary (rather than as an indulgence).DECC needs to acknowledge that a by-product of Renewable Cooling is to heat the ground. The heat in the ground becomes a major asset when heating is required the following winter. Renewable Heating makes Renewable Cooling more efficient and vice versa.DECC has been inclined to reject subsidy for renewable cooling as their interpretation of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is that it would not count as “renewable”, although it would save significant CO2 emissions. We think that DECC, which frequently claims that the RHI is a “world first”, should be making the case to Brussels, rather than following DECC’s own timid interpretation of the RED.&#xa0;•&#xa0;Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully? The practical effect of DECC policy (although not the intention) has been to suppress the heat pump market and to drive some installers into insolvency:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Five years of discussion RHI, but no RHI yet in place for domestic heat pumps.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; FITs subsidies from April 2010 diverted attention to PV cells, with initial subsidies of up to 43 p/kWhr [when the price of electricity was only 10p/kWhr].-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commercial RHI for heat pumps was introduced in November 2011, with initial subsidy at only 3.5 p/kWhr (at the same time RHI for biomass introduced at 9.2 p/kWhr).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DECC also introduced the unscientific idea of “naturally occurring energy” which confused the market and prevented Ofgem from accrediting any ground source heating and cooling systems for over a year.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DECC have overlooked the ability of ground source heat pumps to provide invisible heating systems with zero on-site environmental impact.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ground source heat pumps can also recycle energy from summer to winter and, through thermal energy storage, they can balance the limitations of other renewable technologies which suffer from intermittent energy supply.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RHI provides an annual subsidy to reduce the annual cost of using renewable heat. The barrier to installing a ground source heat pump is not the annual running cost (which is small) but the up-front capital cost (which is large).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RHI effectively aims to subsidise inefficient technologies over efficient ones. DECC argues that inefficient technologies need more subsidy to be employed. This discriminates against the use of efficient technologies like ground source heat pumps. This is the opposite of what DECC should be doing.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RHI provides a subsidy to the owner of a building over many years if renewable heating is installed. The RHI provides no subsidy at all to the builder who often decides which form of heating will be used (and therefore chooses the cheapest capital cost).•&#xa0;How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?This will depend on the efficiency with which the RHI is administered by Ofgem. This, in turn, will depend on the complexity of the regulations Ofgem is asked to administer.DECC has taken far too long to decide its approach and has a tendency to introduce impractical and confusing elements that will add to the cost of administration and present barriers to uptake.  The idea of using EPC certificates as the financial basis of administering the Domestic RHI is unhelpful. EPC certificates were introduced for other reasons and DECC should not attempt to pass off responsibility in this way to estate agents who are not knowledgeable and are not disinterested parties.We fear that there may be more people employed by Ofgem to administer the RHI than there will be people employed in the country to install ground source heat pumps.•&#xa0;Thermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.&#xa0; Thermal storage using seasonal thermal energy storage is a simple and practical method of balancing energy demand which is already in use in the UK. Government policy has not yet recognised the merits of this approach in saving carbon emissions. The misconceived policy of “naturally occurring energy” held back market developments in this innovative technology. DECC has now recognised that this was inappropriate, but the Statutory Instrument of 28 November 2011 has not yet been updated. What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?We are not yet aware of any government policy to promote thermal storage – in spite of the power of thermal storage to reduce overall energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Government policy urgently needs to recognise and promote 

[[[Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage]]] as a means of saving carbon emissions. The Government should also encourage all forms of Heat Recovery where this can be used in conjunction with thermal storage in order to save carbon emissions. ICAX is a British company that has proved its innovative technology, but DECC has not yet acknowledged that this major technical advance needs to be promoted by government.September 2013&#xa0;
