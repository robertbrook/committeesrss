This relationship is not likely to be possible as support for housing costs \nmove under the DWP, especially where the customer is hard to engage and has not given consent to discuss their application. This may lead to delays in rental costs being paid\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs customers will be expected to take control of their own household finances und\ner Universal Credit, there is a risk that they may not also take responsibility for notifying the DWP of their change in circumstances when they move into TA – unless consent is given to TA staff. This could lead to delays in payment adjustments to include\n updated housing costs\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonthly payments to customers could pose several issues for TA, including:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt has been outlined that deductions, including sanctions and income above the benefit cap or from earnings of those in low-pa\nid employment, will be taken from the support for housing costs element of Universal Credit. There have already been difficulties in securing service charge payments from customers in TA who have had existing benefits sanctioned; this is likely to be exace\nrbated as more substantial deductions come into place\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough exemptions to direct payment have been outlined, these need to be clarified. The qualifying period of 8 weeks non-payment before direct payments can be requested also poses a particular issue f\nor TA due to the transient nature of its customers\n.\n TA could not keep a household beyond one month’s missed payment due to the levels of arrears built up – the service could not afford to run like this. After one missed payment, people would be evicted. \n&#xa0;\nOther issues: Claimant Commitment-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis could pose particular issues for homeless people. Current information from Universal Credit pilot areas suggests that the commitment will involve customers devoting 30+ hours per week to job searches, or risk sanction\ns. This time commitment could be problematic for a population already having to deal with associated issues around their homelessness, without a settled base. Not meeting the commitment and resultant sanctions could have serious implications for rental inc\nome at \nTA\n. As above, if sanctioned UC meant no housing costs are paid to cover rent, this would result in eviction. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“Digital by default” also presents an issue for those in TA, due to limited access to ICT facilities. Whilst some provision is available wi\nthin the schemes and local area, resources are limited especially when competing with others in a similar situatio\nn\n. In addition, it cannot be stressed enough the high level needs and vulnerability that comes with this client group – often a lack of any fo\nrmal education; learning difficulties; mental and physical health issues; drug and alcohol dependency issues \netc.\n will prevent this client group from being able to \nengage with any digital inclusion initiatives, and as such will present major problems in te\nrms of them being able to use ICT facilities or engage with support staff attempting to support them in doing so. \n&#xa0;\nOther issues: Household benefit cap, social sector size criteria and TA-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe definition of ‘exempt supported accommodation’\n is \ntoo\n narrow\n to \nreflect the actual circumstances of many homeless customers\n, as is the DWP statement that the majority of households in TA are in accommodation procured from the private sector\n. \nUnder homelessness legislation, local authorities can \nuse\n several types of acc\nommodation which is not limited to those falling within the definition of exempt\n. \nIn Stockport\n almost all homeless customers are placed into accommodation managed by the ALMO on behalf of the Metropolitan Borough Council; therefore these customers, over \n30\n0\n households (families and single occupants)\n per year, face being \nadversely affected by reforms\n despite this accommodation provi\nding the same\n service\n to vulnerable customers\n \nas defined \nexempt supported accommodation scheme\ns.\n Temporary Accommodation in Stoc\nkport provides high level intensive suppo\nrt, as defined in SEA criteria.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence from the Universal Credit Pathfinders has also caused further concern with regards to ‘\nexempt supported accommodation’. One Pathfinder has reported that \nthere is some confusi\non with regards to how the exemption is applied, as \na DWP representative issued advice stating that for existing Universal Credit claimants, moving in to TA / exempt supported accom\nmodation would be classed as a “\nchange of circumstances” \nand the exemption\n \nfor supported housing costs\n would not apply as it would with current legacy benefits. A significant proportion of TA resident intakes will require a “change of circumstances”; therefore this presents a real risk to rental income as well as posing a confusing scenario to vulnerable h\nomeless clients. Therefore there needs to be clarification and a uniform definition of what is classed as exempt, and how this comes to be applied from the DWP.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe basis of entitlement to \ntemporary accommodation costs in\n Universal Credit on household size\n rather than accommodation type does not take into account the demand, throughput and pressure on TA.\n This is also exacerbated by the benefit cap\n already in place\n.\n Customers are placed into TA overwhelmingly on an emergency basis, and into whichever flat/r\noom vacancy is available. Due to TA schemes often being at capacity and the broad range of households within them, there is not always scope to move customers into more suitably sized accommodation. \nEven where a move is possible there is a risk that some f\nlats, e.g. larger units carrying higher rent, \nwill be \nunder-occupied \ndue to the on-going need to provide some form of accommodation to homeless households\n,\n \nand further reduce rental income. \nThe inflexibility posed by these size criteria therefore has serio\nus consequences for both rental income at TA, and financial pressure on customers who may n\need to meet shortfalls in rent.\n&#xa0;\n1 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
