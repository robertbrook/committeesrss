[[[2013]]]&#xa0;In response to the Committee's recent report and in light of the Christmas Eve disruption at Gatwick, I am writing to update you on the CAA's work in this area.&#xa0;

[[[Gatwick]]]The disruption at Gatwick Airport caused major inconvenience to passengers and it is right that we get to the bottom of what went wrong.  The airport has commissioned its own review of the causes of, and response to, the flooding and subsequent power problems. We have commented on the terms of reference and intend to robustly examine the report when it is available.&#xa0;In the meantime, we are making our own enquiries of Gatwick and the airlines. I have received a brief preliminary report from Gatwick and will be meeting Stewart Wingate next week.  I have also received a preliminary report from easyJet and we will meet with their operational team next week.  In addition to this we are surveying passengers affected by the disruption.&#xa0;

[[[Heathrow]]]The CAA has today published two notices proposing to grant licences to the operators of Gatwick and Heathrow under the Civil Aviation Act 2012.  The CAA plans to grant these by the middle of February so that they come into force on 1 Apri12014.  Both these proposed licences contain broadly similar provisions on operational resilience, with an overarching obligation to secure the availability and continuity of airport operation services, particularly in times of disruption.&#xa0;To achieve this overarching obligation, the conditions require them to have resilience plans to deal with disruption (coordinated where possible with key stakeholders' plans) and to coordinate the dissemination of information to stakeholders and to passengers.  If necessary, the CAA may issue guidance on what should be included in those plans.&#xa0;Heathrow's operational resilience condition is set out in the licence itself and also includes an explicit obligation to coordinate the management of disruption, thus giving it responsibility for a greater leadership role.  Gatwick's licence is slightly different in form, but not in effect.  Gatwick has commitments on operational resilience (and also on price, service quality, financial resilience and some other matters); these have contractual effect as they are included in its Conditions of Use, so the airlines can enforce them.  In addition, the CAA has included these commitments as licence conditions, subject to the CAA's powers of modification and enforcement under the Act, so the CAA can also enforce them on behalf of passengers. Gatwick's inclusion of operational resilience in its voluntary commitments follows direct feedback from the CAA and we regard it as a sign of commitment to take a stronger leadership role.&#xa0;In the reasons accompanying the licence notices, we have offered some thoughts on how we expect the airport operators to take these obligations forward. We have noted that disruption at the airport can be caused by a number of factors, from severe weather, industrial action, security incidents, cyber attack, accidents at the airport or even incidents at facilities remote from the airport upon which the airport relies (such as oil supply depots).  We have therefore made it clear that it will expect them to have contingency plans to cover the loss, for whatever reason, of&#xa0;&#xa0;We will expect the plans to include risk assessments and resilience plans for infrastructure that is under the control of the airport operator and for all services it provides.  Where the airport operator relies on infrastructure or services provided by third parties, it will not be expected to have contingency plans for that infrastructure or those services, but will be expected to plan for the impact of their loss on its own airport operation services. The airport operators will also be expected to underpin these plans with sound business continuity planning.&#xa0;So we have aiready given industry some guidance about what is expected.  If the plans produced by airports over the spring and summer do not include all appropriate elements, we will use our licence powers to require this to be remedied.&#xa0;

[[[Weather]]]We welcome the Committee's recent report and particularly the stress on pro-active schedule management.  We have worked closely with Heathrow on refining its Air Traffic Management Demand and Capacity Balancing group (HADACAB) and are aware of its limitations.  We have therefore started reviewing the process of capacity allocation during disruption to determine what the barriers are and how best to remove them, and will begin this process as soon as a licence is in force.&#xa0;

[[[steps]]]We will work with the airport operators and other service providers on the development of the resilience plans; we will update the Committee on progress in late 2014; and we will evaluate the impact of the new licence conditions on passenger welfare by Spring 2015, as the Committee has recommended.  In the meantime, we will discuss with Heathrow and Gatwick ways in which best practice on the provision of information and passenger welfare can be shared with the non-regulated UK airports.&#xa0;I hope this information is useful. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like any further briefing.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
