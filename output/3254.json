"Submission from the Federation of Master Builders – written evidence&#xa0;ABOUT THE FEDERATION OF MASTER BUILDERS&#xa0;\nThe Federation of Master Builders (FMB) is the largest trade association in the UK building industry. Established in 1941 to protect the interests of small and medium-sized\n (SME)\n construction firms, the FMB is independent and non-profit-making, lobbying continuously for members’ interests at both national and local levels.\n&#xa0;\nThe FMB is a source of knowledge, professional advice and support for its members, providing a range of modern and relevant business services to save them time and money. The FMB also offers practical advice and support to the general public on choosing and working with a builder.\n&#xa0;BACKGROUND&#xa0;\nPublic sector construction contracts are worth more than £37bn per year, which is a considerable 38% of all construction output. However, although small firms dominate the construction industry in terms of both output and employment, this is not usually reflected in the success rate of SMEs when tendering for public sector contracts. According to our research, 41% of construction SMEs are only successful 10% of the time or less when bidding for public sector contracts and a significant 55% of firms have seen their success rate decrease over the past five years.\n&#xa0;\nIn March and April 2013, the FMB surveyed its members in England on their experiences of the public procurement process. The survey received more than 450 responses and the results have been analysed and discussed with a working group of FMB members with experience of public sector procurement. This information then formed the basis of a research report with sixteen recommendations to central government, local government and the wider public sector, as well as to industry itself. The report was published in June 2013 and the full version can be viewed \nhere\n. The findings of the report have helped form the basis for this written evidence submission to the CLG Select Committee.\n&#xa0;\nFMB members are typically micro-businesses employing ten or fewer employees and therefore most are not suited to working on central government contracts. Of those members that do engage with public sector clients, most work for local authorities or housing associations. Therefore \nthe CLG Select Committee inquiry into \nlocal government procurement is o\nf great interest and most welcome. However, \nthe headline topics and questions laid out in the call for evidence are not ones that the FMB can easily respond. In light of this, this paper provides a few key points under the areas that are of particular interest to small construction firms – namely the pre-qualification process; framework agreements; the \nperformance of public sector procurement teams; visibility of local authority contracts; and \ntransparency and accountability.\n&#xa0;LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT – KEY ISSUES&#xa0;Pre-qualification process&#xa0;\nAlthough Pre\n-qualification Questionnaires (PQQs) are \nnow \nan integral part of the supplier assessment process\n for local authorities\n, their introduction has had the unintended consequence of increasing the cost and time burden on SMEs and thus, in many cases, reducing their access to public sector contracts.\n \nAlmost half of all those members responding to the FMB’s public procurement survey describe their experience of completing PQQs for public sector clients as being “quite negative” or “mostly negative”.\n&#xa0;\nKey points include:\n&#xa0;\nFramework agreements&#xa0;Construction SMEs accept that, as part of the public sector’s desire to reduce construction costs by 2015, framework agreements will continue to be used as a means by which to help deliver so-called efficiency savings and reduce consultancy and construction costs. However, it is clear that framework agreements are perceived as a barrier to \nconstruction \nSMEs\n that\n attempt to win public sector work, with 51% of FMB members reporting that their workloads have decreased as a result of the introduction of frameworks. \n&#xa0;\nKey points include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPerformance of local authority procurement teams&#xa0;Public sector spending cuts have significantly reduced the amount of resource available to \nlocal authorities\n and this is most likely to have increased pressure on their procurement processes.\n \nM\nore than 260,000 jobs have been lost in local government since 2010 through redundancies and the deletion of vacant posts\n and more cuts are imminent.\n&#xa0;\nOne impact of this lack of resource available to public sector bodies, particularly local authorities, is the limited supply of feedback to those who are unsuccessful, which is a commonly cited problem by construction SMEs. However, FMB research shows that, in terms of local authorities, 50% of respondents describe the expertise of the procurement staff as being “average” and 22% describe them as “good” or “excellent”. Further still, 44% of FMB members stated that local authority procurement teams adhere to statutory timescales for responses “most of the time” and 9% said that this is “always” the case.\n \nDespite this, there are concerns about the provision of detailed and timely feedback to unsuccessful bidders in the procurement process.\n&#xa0;\nKey points include:\n&#xa0;\nVisibility of local authority contracts&#xa0;For construction SMES, particularly micro-businesses that have little or no administrative support, it\n i\ns essential that they can find out about public sector contracts quickly and easily.\n&#xa0;\nKey points:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorth East: \nwww.qtegov.com\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorth West: \nwww.thechest.nwce.gov.uk\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSouth West: \nwww.supplyingthesouthwest.org.uk\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSouth East: \nwww.businessportal.southeastiep.gov.uk\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLondon: \nwww.londontenders.org\n&#xa0;Transparency and accountability&#xa0;The FMB believes that greater transparency in relation to the proportion of SME firms that local authorities and other public sector clients procure from, would gradually increase SME engagement. It would boost the proportion of work being awarded to SME firms by providing the star performers with positive feedback and media attention (such as the newly introduced ‘best councils to do business with’ awards) and the worst performers with negative feedback. It is likely to create a sense of healthy competition among neighbouring local authorities and drive up performance across the board.\n&#xa0;Key points:\nOctober 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nUNISON press release, End the squeeze on Local Government (19th March 2013)\n"
