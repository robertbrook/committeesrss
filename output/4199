It also covers suppliers of the machinery used in the industry. As such it is the representative body for the UK’s plastics packaging industry and recyclers of plastics.

defaultPlastics recyclers are hostile to an exemption for biodegradable bags as this would have catastrophic consequences for the UK recycling industry.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey report that t
defaulthe compromising effects of biodegradable bags on the entire waste stream seriously threatens househ
defaultold film recycling. They insist that b
defaultiodegradable plastic
defaults
default of whatever kind cannot be recycled along with conventional plastics without catastrophic effects. 
defaultT
defaulthe two streams would have to be kept separate and since there is little obvious difference between the plastics, there is a great risk of confusing the wider public. Domestic household film recycling would become a casualty, whilst achieving the government’s 2017 packaging recycling targets would be impossible.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecyclers point to a
default study carried out by the AEA to the Welsh Assembly Government on single use bags (
defaulthttp://wales.gov.uk/docs/desh/publications/091016wastebagreporten.pdf
default)
default 
default concluded that: ‘Bio-degradable bags are included under the Irish (bag tax) legislation because they contribute to litter and take some considerable time (months extending 
defaultto
default years) to degrade in the natural world. Degradation in landfill may take a considerably longer time.’ 
default&#xa0;
defaultThey also point to an E
defaultnvironmental Agency’s Report on Life Cycle Assessment of Supermarket Carrier Bags concludes that ‘The 
defaultprodegradant
default additive does not seem to add much benefits and has a negative impact as it increases the weight of the bag if a recycling system is developed for bags it should not be used’.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn any event, as a general point, a consumer response to the availability of biodegradable bags could well be even more littering simply because they would perceive that as the products are degradable, they will simply disappear from the environment.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultSeveral studies have been conducted on the environmental impact of carrier bags.

defaultDEFRA, Report on

default, 2010 (Report EV0422)
defaultThe key finding of this report was that
default:
default “The overall conclusion of this review is that incorporation of additives into petroleum-based plastics that cause those plastics to undergo accelerated degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects”.
default 
defaultThis report highlighted the risks to recycling, composting streams and the time it took for the materials to breakdown.

defaultReport by European Plastics Converters (
defaultEuPC
default), November 2013.
defaultThis recent report states: “the results show that even in quantities as low as 2% degradable plastic films cause significant, detrimental impacts to the quality of plastic 
defaultrecyclates
default. These impacts are not only detrimental in terms of mechanical properties of the recycled material, but also involve visual impacts on the newly produced film”.

defaultCanada’s example
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn Canada similar conclusions were reached relating to the risks associated with the use of Biodegradable plastics.
default 
defaultThe City of Toronto has very strict procedures, according to their website: “The City of Toronto does not accept biodegradable plastic packaging, including biodegradable plastic bags in the Green Bin organics or the Blue Bin recycling programs.” The reasons for not accepting this material include:
default 
defaultBiodegradable plastics are removed during organics processing
default, they can ruin recycling markets and they can put marketed recyclables revenue at risk.

defaultDEFRA’s figures on household waste
default&#xa0;
defaultAt present carrier bags form a very small part of household waste at around 0.02%
default according to DEFRA’s own figures.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe impact of carrier bags in terms of litter is overstated as carrier bags form a very small part of litter and it was disappointing to hear politicians within DEFRA giving support to the notion that plastic bags play a major part in litter in our country.

defaultKeep Britain Tidy
default&#xa0;
defaultKeep Britain Tidy (KBT) in their latest report on litter found on our streets, concluded that the number of supermarket carriers had fallen each year for the last four.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe incidence of carrier bags at 3% of all sites observed compares to 82% for the first item on the KBT list for litter types present and 65 % for the second item on the list.
default&#xa0;
defaultOf litter on the beach and in the seas 80% of it originates from the land (source KBT) so it follows that trends on litter found on the beach will follow those seen on land and therefore the incidence of supermarket carriers found will have decreased within the mix of plastics found so  although the number of plastic pieces found actually registered a small increase in 2013 the number originating from carrier bags must have fallen.

defaultEnsure that policy ensures the adoption of bags made of materials with the least environmental impact 
defaulte.g
default use the least resources and reinforce the principles of the packaging and  WFD and encourage the use of recycling and recycled content .At present the proposal in England does not meet these criteria.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsure any exemptions are consistent, fair, are not in any way subject to challenge under c law as being unfair and do not in any way undermine the recycling of plastics. Again the present proposal does not meet these criteria.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsure that exemptions reinforce the principles of the packaging and WFD and reinforce the principles of minimising resource use, recycling and recycled content. Again it is difficult to see how the present proposal meets these criteria.

defaultRecyclers say that the promotion of biodegradable bags would be a disaster for the UK recycling infrastructure.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe promotion of biodegradable bags could well promote littering.
