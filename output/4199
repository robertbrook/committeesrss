[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Br[bold]itish Plastics Federation (BPF)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The BPF is the leading trade association for the UK Plastic Industry representing the views of the raw material producers, additives suppliers and manufacturers of semi-finished and finished articles. It also covers suppliers of the machinery used in the industry. As such it is the representative body for the UK’s plastics packaging industry and recyclers of plastics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BPF objects to the discriminatory nature of the charge which applies only to plastics bags.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At present carrier bags form a very small pa
[normal]rt of household waste at &lt;0.02% according to 
[normal]DEFRA
[normal]’s own figures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plastics recyclers are hostile to an exemption for biodegradable bags as this would have catastrophic consequences for the UK recycling industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They report that t
[normal]he compromising effects of biodegradable bags on the entire waste stream seriously threatens househ
[normal]old film recycling. They insist that b
[normal]iodegradable plastic
[normal]s
[normal] of whatever kind cannot be recycled along with conventional plastics without catastrophic effects. 
[normal]T
[normal]he two streams would have to be kept separate and since there is little obvious difference between the plastics, there is a great risk of confusing the wider public. Domestic household film recycling would become a casualty, whilst achieving the government’s 2017 packaging recycling targets would be impossible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recyclers point to a
[normal] study carried out by the AEA to the Welsh Assembly Government on single use bags (
[normal]http://wales.gov.uk/docs/desh/publications/091016wastebagreporten.pdf
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal] concluded that: ‘Bio-degradable bags are included under the Irish (bag tax) legislation because they contribute to litter and take some considerable time (months extending 
[normal]to
[normal] years) to degrade in the natural world. Degradation in landfill may take a considerably longer time.’ 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They also point to an E
[normal]nvironmental Agency’s Report on Life Cycle Assessment of Supermarket Carrier Bags concludes that ‘The 
[normal]prodegradant
[normal] additive does not seem to add much benefits and has a negative impact as it increases the weight of the bag if a recycling system is developed for bags it should not be used’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In any event, as a general point, a consumer response to the availability of biodegradable bags could well be even more littering simply because they would perceive that as the products are degradable, they will simply disappear from the environment.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Several studies have been conducted on the environmental impact of carrier bags.

[normal]DEFRA, Report on 
[normal]Oxo-degradables
[normal], 2010 (Report EV0422)
[normal]The key finding of this report was that
[normal]:
[normal] “The overall conclusion of this review is that incorporation of additives into petroleum-based plastics that cause those plastics to undergo accelerated degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects”.
[normal] 
[normal]This report highlighted the risks to recycling, composting streams and the time it took for the materials to breakdown.

[normal]Report by European Plastics Converters (
[normal]EuPC
[normal]), November 2013.
[normal]This recent report states: “the results show that even in quantities as low as 2% degradable plastic films cause significant, detrimental impacts to the quality of plastic 
[normal]recyclates
[normal]. These impacts are not only detrimental in terms of mechanical properties of the recycled material, but also involve visual impacts on the newly produced film”.

[normal]Canada’s example
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n Canada similar conclusions were reached relating to the risks associated with the use of Biodegradable plastics.
[normal] 
[normal]The City of Toronto has very strict procedures, according to their website: “The City of Toronto does not accept biodegradable plastic packaging, including biodegradable plastic bags in the Green Bin organics or the Blue Bin recycling programs.” The reasons for not accepting this material include:
[normal] 
[normal]Biodegradable plastics are removed during organics processing
[normal], they can ruin recycling markets and they can put marketed recyclables revenue at risk.

[normal]DEFRA’s figures on household waste
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At present carrier bags form a very small part of household waste at around 0.02%
[normal] according to DEFRA’s own figures.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The impact of carrier bags in terms of litter is overstated as carrier bags form a very small part of litter and it was disappointing to hear politicians within DEFRA giving support to the notion that plastic bags play a major part in litter in our country.

[normal]Keep Britain Tidy
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Keep Britain Tidy (KBT) in their latest report on litter found on our streets, concluded that the number of supermarket carriers had fallen each year for the last four.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The incidence of carrier bags at 3% of all sites observed compares to 82% for the first item on the KBT list for litter types present and 65 % for the second item on the list.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of litter on the beach and in the seas 80% of it originates from the land (source KBT) so it follows that trends on litter found on the beach will follow those seen on land and therefore the incidence of supermarket carriers found will have decreased within the mix of plastics found so  although the number of plastic pieces found actually registered a small increase in 2013 the number originating from carrier bags must have fallen.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensure that policy ensures the adoption of bags made of materials with the least environmental impact 
[normal]e.g
[normal] use the least resources and reinforce the principles of the packaging and  WFD and encourage the use of recycling and recycled content .At present the proposal in England does not meet these criteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensure any exemptions are consistent, fair, are not in any way subject to challenge under c law as being unfair and do not in any way undermine the recycling of plastics. Again the present proposal does not meet these criteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensure that exemptions reinforce the principles of the packaging and WFD and reinforce the principles of minimising resource use, recycling and recycled content. Again it is difficult to see how the present proposal meets these criteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recyclers say that the promotion of biodegradable bags would be a disaster for the UK recycling infrastructure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The promotion of biodegradable bags could well promote littering.
