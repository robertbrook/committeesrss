defaultMINEHEAD -TAUNTON BUS (Service Number 28)
default&#xa0;
defaultNew timetable â€“ buses cease from Taunton to Minehead at 8pm. Buses Outbound from Minehead to Taunton cease at appox. 6.45pm. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTHIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. 
defaultPeople are forced to turn down jobs that may require later hours of transport. People are avoiding coming to Minehead as their time spent here is severely limited. Custom will be lost, local economy will suffer, unemployment will not improve. 
defaultI strongly believe that these cuts to later bus services are a case of false economy, myopic at best.
defaultIn our current economy, more people are unable to afford to insure and maintain their own transport. 
defaultAlso, there are people unable to drive because of disabilities, what about them? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a tax paying citizen of this country, I would strongly suggest to the people in charge to NOT ignore life outside of the cities. Do not take our rural areas for granted. The working class will not stay silent forever.

defaultRemember, if we don't grow it, you can't eat it.
