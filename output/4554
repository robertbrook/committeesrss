[normal]More than 60,000 UNISON members work in the community and voluntary sector. UNISON works hard to ensure that good terms and working conditions of workers in this sector are promoted and 
[normal]are 
[normal]recognised as an important part of providing qualit
[normal]y voluntary and community services. UNISON believes that by working together with UNISON, employers, providers and community and voluntary workers 
[normal]we 
[normal]can achieve more
[normal] in our Community sector
[normal].

[normal]                                                     [bold]In November UN
[normal]ISON held a parliamentary round
[normal]table event with organisations from the voluntary and community sector
[normal],
[normal] hosted by 
[normal]the new Shadow Minister 
[normal]for charities, 
[normal]Lisa Nandy MP
[normal]. 
[normal]The roundtable event focused
[normal] on the launch of UNISON
[normal]’
[normal]s recent
[normal] 
[normal]report
[normal] based on a ‘speak out’ survey of over 3,000 community, voluntary and housing workers across the UK.  
[normal]Report findings[bold]The report exposed services to our most vulnerable people in society as 
[normal]“hanging by a thread”
[normal] by uncovering dangerously underfunded services leading to hardship and exposing children and the disabled to risk.
[normal]The 
[normal]survey and 
[normal]report in full can be downloaded

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UNISON, along with other organisations at the roundtable called,
[normal] on the Gover
[normal]nment to have a major rethink 
[normal]on
[normal] its
[normal] attitude to the third sector. 
[normal]Its sink or swim philosophy is leading to a struggle for survival. Almost unnoticed by the public, many charities have become increasingly financially dependent on winning con
[normal]tracts from th
[normal]e public sector. Charities increasingly now rely on winning public sector contracts just to survive
[normal] along with increased marketisation
[normal].
[normal]As austerity has bitten, funding for these contracts has been squeezed to breaking point and UNISON is warning that 
[normal]whilst charities are reputable and trusted by the public they do not have a magic wand, so cuts are putting vulnerable people at risk
[normal].
[normal]Private companies use them as ‘bid candy’ in an effort to improve their chances of winning more public sector business. The whole contracting-out process means that accountability for public services is increasingly at arm’s-length, and this has led to pub
[normal]lic fears and damaging reports over the quality of services to children and the disabled
[normal].
[normal]The voluntary sector attracts many thousands 
[normal]of dedicated, hardworking staff
[normal] who know that they won’t be paid big 
[normal]salaries or bonuses
[normal] but who have a right to expect a
[normal] fair deal for their clients and themselves. Instead many workers are bearing the brunt of the austerity drive, through damaging cuts to their pay and conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]                                                                                            
[normal]                                                          Staff morale has dipped and low pay is endemic, leading to rising levels of personal debt and long-term financial hardship for many in the sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A 
[normal]worker
[normal] providing respite services for children w
[normal]ith autism, challenging behavior and profound disabilities, said
[normal]“Due to financial pressures we have to combine more vulnerable children with children with challenging behavior. It creates an unsafe environment for both the child and the staff. There have [bold]been medication and other errors due to time pressure.”[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A disability worker in the East Midlands reported:
[normal]“Users have less chance to go out, have to wear second hand clothes, have no transport, and blind people now have to buy their own white sticks whe[bold]n they lose them.”[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A housing worker from the West Midlands revealed that: 
[normal]“Fewer aids and adaptations are being installed, leaving [bold]peopl[bold]e at risk in their homes and communities due to budget cuts.”[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]UNISON
[normal] is blaming the Government’s austerity drive 
[normal]for pushing people out of the sector, as it is increasingly difficult to provide even 
[normal]the basic help and support that client
[normal]s
[normal] need.
