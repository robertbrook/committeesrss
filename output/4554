defaultISON held a parliamentary round
defaulttable event with organisations from the voluntary and community sector
default,
default hosted by 
defaultthe new Shadow Minister 
defaultfor charities, 
defaultLisa Nandy MP
default. 
defaultThe roundtable event focused
default on the launch of UNISON
default’
defaults recent
default 
defaultreport
default based on a ‘speak out’ survey of over 3,000 community, voluntary and housing workers across the UK.  
defaultReport findingsdefaultThe report exposed services to our most vulnerable people in society as 
default“hanging by a thread”
default by uncovering dangerously underfunded services leading to hardship and exposing children and the disabled to risk.

default&#xa0;
defaultUNISON, along with other organisations at the roundtable called,
default on the Gover
defaultnment to have a major rethink 
defaulton
default its
default attitude to the third sector. 
defaultIts sink or swim philosophy is leading to a struggle for survival. Almost unnoticed by the public, many charities have become increasingly financially dependent on winning con
defaulttracts from th
defaulte public sector. Charities increasingly now rely on winning public sector contracts just to survive
default along with increased marketisation
default.
defaultAs austerity has bitten, funding for these contracts has been squeezed to breaking point and UNISON is warning that 
defaultwhilst charities are reputable and trusted by the public they do not have a magic wand, so cuts are putting vulnerable people at risk
default.
defaultPrivate companies use them as ‘bid candy’ in an effort to improve their chances of winning more public sector business. The whole contracting-out process means that accountability for public services is increasingly at arm’s-length, and this has led to pub
defaultlic fears and damaging reports over the quality of services to children and the disabled
default.
defaultThe voluntary sector attracts many thousands 
defaultof dedicated, hardworking staff
default who know that they won’t be paid big 
defaultsalaries or bonuses
default but who have a right to expect a
default fair deal for their clients and themselves. Instead many workers are bearing the brunt of the austerity drive, through damaging cuts to their pay and conditions.
default&#xa0;
default                                                                                            
default                                                          Staff morale has dipped and low pay is endemic, leading to rising levels of personal debt and long-term financial hardship for many in the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultA 
defaultworker
default providing respite services for children w
defaultith autism, challenging behavior and profound disabilities, said
default“Due to financial pressures we have to combine more vulnerable children with children with challenging behavior. It creates an unsafe environment for both the child and the staff. There have defaultbeen medication and other errors due to time pressure.”default&#xa0;
defaultA disability worker in the East Midlands reported:
default“Users have less chance to go out, have to wear second hand clothes, have no transport, and blind people now have to buy their own white sticks whedefaultn they lose them.”default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA housing worker from the West Midlands revealed that: 
default“Fewer aids and adaptations are being installed, leaving defaultpeopldefaulte at risk in their homes and communities due to budget cuts.”default&#xa0;
defaultUNISON
default is blaming the Government’s austerity drive 
defaultfor pushing people out of the sector, as it is increasingly difficult to provide even 
defaultthe basic help and support that client
defaults
default need.
