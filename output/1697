[normal]Summary
[normal]Introduction
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women leave aca
[normal]demia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the Government wishes to see faster progress in bringing and retaining wome
[normal]n in STEM careers, it could mandate Research Councils UK to stipulate that only university departments that have obtained the status of Athena SWAN Silver or its equivalent will be eligible for research grant funding. This is 
[normal]already the case for NHS Natio
[normal]nal Institute for Health Research and would push universities to embed practices that advance the careers of men and women on an equal basis.
