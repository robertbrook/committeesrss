[[[&#xa0;]]]Increasing scepticism&#xa0;1. Over the last few years there has been an increase in public scepticism over the subject of man-made climate change.  This has become apparent through a number of recent surveys and opinion polls.  A recent editorial article and sequence of research papers [1] summarises this situation. However, the change of opinion is fairly modest, and there has been a tendency for both sides of the debate to overstate this trend and its significance. &#xa0;2. The 2012 LWEC survey [2] found that “A growing number of people in the UK do not trust climate scientists to tell the truth about climate change” and “the UK public's belief in the seriousness of climate change has decreased over the past five years”.  63% of survey respondents were at least 'fairly concerned' about climate change, down from 71% in 2010. Those 'not at all concerned' increased from 8% to 13%.  44% thought that climate change was exaggerated, a slight increase. Particularly notable was the low and declining levels of trust in Environmental groups, Government scientists and the media (Figure 2 of the LWEC report). Only 10% trust the government, and only 13% trust government scientists, to provide correct information on climate change. Trust in environmental groups has fallen from 46% in 2006 to 32%. &#xa0;3. This increasing scepticism is not unique to the UK but part of a global pattern. A survey by NORC reported in February 2013 that the environment ranked low among issues in most countries, and a Globescan survey on environmental concerns including climate change announced that “Environmental concerns among citizens around the world have been falling since 2009 and have now reached twenty-year lows” .&#xa0;4. Increasing scepticism has also been seen in the media. The Mail and Express have for some time shown sceptical views, but this has recently increased (at least four sceptical articles appeared in the Express in the week of March 18th). Among the broadsheets, the Telegraph [3] recently expressed the view that the Climate Change Act should be repealed.  An excellent recent article in the Economist [4] discussed the flat global temperature of the last 15 years, the mismatch between models and observations and the increasing realisation among mainstream climate scientists that the sensitivity to carbon dioxide is less than they had previously thought. The FT reported in an article on the collapsing carbon market on 17 April that “global warming has been consigned to a seat in the waiting room”. &#xa0;&#xa0; Inquiry terms of reference&#xa0;5. The remit of the inquiry seems to suggest that climate scepticism is a problem and that this change in public opinion is somehow wrong and needs to be corrected. This misguided view is at best undemocratic and at worst almost Orwellian.&#xa0;6. The increase of scepticism is entirely rational and arises from a number of causes. Foremost among these is the exaggerated claims about climate change made not just within certain sections of the media but also, worryingly, from climate scientists themselves. Other factors include the climategate emails that showed scientists withholding data and hiding data that did not support their theories; the lack of any warming for the last 15 years; the run of recent cold winters; and the absurd energy policies involving unreliable and expensive wind turbines paid for by increased public energy bills. In short, more and more members of the public are realising that the global warming story has been oversold.&#xa0;7. One area where this realisation has not yet dawned is within government. There are several reasons for this: (a) Most of those in government have very little understanding of science; (b) government has been misled by biased advisers who in some cases are merely activists; (c) some of those in government have a direct conflict of interest due to their association with the renewables industry. The most notable example is Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change, who is chairman of Veolia and formerly chairman of wind turbine manufacturer Forewind.&#xa0;&#xa0;Specific questions&#xa0;8. The Committee has raised a number of specific questions. Unfortunately these questions are the wrong questions, are confused and show a poor understanding of the issues, making them difficult to answer logically. One basic implicit misunderstanding is the idea that if only more people could become better informed about climate change, more of them would accept the need for climate 'action'. This naïve view is known as the 'deficit model' or 'deficit fallacy' in social science (See for example the blog by Prof B Nerlich [5] on this specific STC inquiry; see also [6]).  In fact, the opposite may be true – bombarding the public with information (or propaganda?) on climate change may make them more sceptical, particularly if this information comes from untrusted sources, which as noted above include government.  A study by Kahan et al [7] comparing science literacy with concern about climate change showed that people with higher knowledge of science were slightly less concerned about climate change. &#xa0;&#xa0;What is the current state of public understanding of what is meant by climate change? How has this changed in recent years?9. Public understanding of the issue is improving. But this is not helped by the constantly changing story presented by climate activists and some climate scientists. The phrase 'global warming' has gradually been replaced by 'climate change', particularly since the slow-down in warming of the last decade. In the 2007 IPCC report we were told to expect warmer winters, but since the recent few cold winters climate scientists are now claiming that colder winters are to be expected [8].  Another recent change is to blame a specific weather event such as a flood or hurricane on climate change, where previously anyone doing so was told that “weather is not climate”. Public understanding of these misleading claims is improving, leading to increased scepticism.&#xa0;Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?&#xa0;10. As noted above, the LWEC survey [2] shows that government, media, business and environmental groups are not trusted.  These are groups who may have political or financial motivations towards a particular view.  The public are, quite rightly, sceptical of such sources. The most trusted group in the LWEC survey was independent scientists.  Note again the 'deficit model' delusion. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?&#xa0;11. As already noted, a major barrier is the inconsistent and frequently changing story presented by climate scientists and the media.&#xa0;&#xa0;How important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy?What evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?&#xa0;12. There is widespread resentment of the Government's misguided energy policies, that are simultaneously damaging the environment through the construction of wind turbines and associated additional power lines, and increasing fuel bills through ROCs and FITs.  Wind turbines simply do not provide useful reliable energy, and require backup sources.  This public outcry is largely just common sense, but is to some extent increased by the perception that the energy policy is being driven by the Government's adherence to climate change dogma. &#xa0;&#xa0;Does the Government have sufficient expertise in social and behavioural sciences to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policies?&#xa0;13. As discussed in paragraph 8 and the social science blog [5], the issue of public understanding of climate science is much more complex and subtle than one might at first anticipate. However, this is really the wrong question. The main issue is that the Government does not have sufficient understanding of the basic principles of science to formulate a sensible policy. There is an urgent need for input from more scientists and engineers, in particular those who are not directly involved in climate science. Again, the implication that public opinion needs to be somehow manipulated to conform to policy is quite worrying.&#xa0;&#xa0;Conclusions &#xa0;14.  The climate change message has been exaggerated, by climate activists, certain sections of the media and some climate scientists. More and more of the general public are gradually realising this, and therefore increasingly questioning expensive, destructive and pointless policies. Any attempt to try to “correct” this, for example by some new Government initiative to improve public understanding of climate science, would be doomed to failure. &#xa0;15. If the Government genuinely wishes to understand why people are becoming more sceptical about climate change, the people to talk to, and in particular to listen to,  are precisely those who are becoming more sceptical. This obvious point has been missed by the Government and also by most of the academic researchers in the fields of social science and psychology who have studied the question.   In the words of one sceptical blogger, “All that’s needed to create a dialogue is for someone to talk to us.” [9]&#xa0;References&#xa0;[1] N.
