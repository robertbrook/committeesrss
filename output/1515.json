"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Oil &amp; Gas UK (HOT06)&#xa0;IntroductionOil &amp; Gas UK \nis the principal trade association for the offshore oil and gas \nexploration and production \nindustry in the United Kingdom, with \nmore than 370 \nmember companies, comprising oil and gas operators and investors and a broad spectrum of the supply chain: contractors, suppliers, law firms and consultants\n.  We \nha\nve\n pleasure in submitting our evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry \ninto heat.\n&#xa0;\nIn the public debate about energy during recent years, there has been a lot of emphasis on electricity, but little about heat (or transport).  In overall terms, only about 35% of the primary energy consumed in the UK is used as electricity; the\n remaining 65% has two main forms of consumption, namely heat, where gas is the principal source, and transport, where oil is dominant.\n&#xa0;\nWhile industrial heat demand is reasonably constant, domestic demand is highly seasonal, being almost entirely temperat\nure dependent.  The \nvariation\n between summer and winter demand is large and, because gas provides 80% of domestic properties (and a large proportion of smaller commercial premises) with heat, the demand for gas varies widely as the seasons change.  However\n, gas is well suited to this; it is much more flexible than electricity which has to be balanced instantaneously, whereas gas does not – it is normally balanced over a 24 hour period.\n              \nTerms of ReferenceThere are others who are better placed than Oil &amp; \nGas UK to answer the Committee’s 12 questions and so we are taking the opportunity to make some broader points relevant to this inquiry, but also answering the specific question about the relative merits of using gas in space heating.\n&#xa0;\nGeneral Points Relating to the InquiryThe following \ngeneral \npoints provide \nsome context for\n the specific\n questions\n of the Committee’s inquiry:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSpecific Question Regarding the Use of Gas in Space HeatingQ.6:\n              \n“What are the relative merits of using gas to directly pro\nvide space heating compared with\n central electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?”\n&#xa0;\nThere are \na number of\n advantages of using gas directly\n to provide space heating\n:\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGas is a primary source of energy and so\n, in converting gas to heat,\n there are no\nne of the \nlosses \nassociated with \nconverting it to a secondary source\n of energy\n, such as happens when a primary sour\nce is converted into electricity\n before\n the resulting electricity is turned into heat\n.\n  The best \n(i.e. super-critical) \ncoal fired power stations achieve about 45% thermal efficiency and the best gas fired ones about 58%, so there are s\nignificant\n losses inv\nolved\n in generating electricity\n.\n  The best coal fired power station in \nthis country\n, Drax, is not super-critical and only achieves 38% thermal efficiency.\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe existing \nnational \ngas transmission system \n(NTS) \nprobably\n has the necessary \noverall \ncapacity for m\nost \nfuture \nrequirements\n, but will no doubt require some investment to take account of changing patterns of supply and demand\n.  \nThe NTS\n has also proved to be very flexible in its operation during testing conditions in the past five winters.  By contrast, th\ne electricity grid is going to need substantial investment \nbecause its capacity will have to be enlarged in \na more electrified \nfuture.\n  This will be expensive.\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, as mentioned above, gas does not need to be balanced instantaneously (which electri\ncity does) and gas can be stored at scale (\nwhich \nelectricity cannot).  Indeed, the NTS itself acts as a short term store of gas by virtue of “linepack”, i.e. the ability to compress the gas in the system\n \nduring the night\n, when demand is lower,\n and use such\n extra gas during the day, as required.  This is impossible with electricity.  A\ns a means of delivering energy to users, gas is much more flex\nible than electricity\n.\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe conversion of gas directly into heat is highly efficient (c. 90%) where modern applianc\nes \nare\n used.\n  This is better than \nmodern \ncombined heat and power plants \ngene\nrally achieve (c. 80%).\nv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGas heati\nng\n gives households and smaller commercial premises complete control over heat\ning\n \ntheir\n building\ns\n.  District \nor similar \nheating systems, however good, do not \ngenerally \nprovide the same degree of local control.\nvi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGas heating is \nbetter \nthan a heat pump\n with \nthermally inefficient buildings, \nsuch as are common in the UK\n.  The incoming heat is at a lower temperature with a heat pu\nmp than \nis delivered by\n a gas boiler\n. \n \nH\neat pumps \noperate\n best \nat constant load, \nwith well insulated buildings\n,\n and are not \nwell \nsuited to poorly insulated ones\n.\nvii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe r\netrofitting \nof \nheat pumps to existing properties means that they will mostly be of the ai\nr source type.  Although ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air source, they are more costly and, obviously, require land adjacent to a building which is not generall\ny available in towns and cities, where the majority of people live.\nviii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn cold \nweather, air source heat pumps operate at reduced efficiency and require “topping up” by electricity in order to maintain their heating effect which, therefore, places an additional load on electricity supplies at time\ns\n of highest demand.  National Grid fo\nresees electricity demand for heating rising rapidly from 2035 in its \nFuture Energy Scenarios\n, especially if its “Gone Green” scenario applies\n, but less so in the case of “Slow Progression”.\nix)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGas fired power stations are going to be required \nin considerable\n numbers\n over the next 15-20 years in order to\nBut, it \nwould \nmake no sense to convert gas into electricity at a power station and then \nto convert the electricity generated into heat within buildings\n,\n in order to satisfy demand during cold\ner\n weather.  This is inherently less efficient than converting gas directly into heat within buildings.\n&#xa0;\nTherefore, given the nature of the building stoc\nk of this country, the high penetration of gas in supplying space heating and the current programme of conversion to high efficiency boilers, it seems inevitable that gas will continue to have a major role in heating until at least 2030.\n&#xa0;\nWe trust that thi\ns submission is helpful to the Committee’s inquiry.\n  If there are any queries relating to our submission, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n  See \nhttp://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Gas/OperationalInfo/TBE/\n \n"
