"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Philip Lund (HSR 007)HS2 – to Birmingham and Manchester, but who benefits?\nA Virgin\n train glide\ns\n into Manchester \nPiccadilly\n station, just one of 46 trains each weekday doing the journey in as little as 127 minutes.  \nThese\n trains stop locally en route, offering those living in the south Manchester suburbs the opportunity to join the trains at one of three stations on two different routes, \nas well as\n providing a fast twice\n-\nhourly service to London from Stoke-on-Trent.\nThis is the service, much improved by extensive and expensive modifications to the track, \nsigna\nl\nling\n and other infrastructure over a decade, which the Government is now seeking to supplement by a new \nHS2 \nroute, track and service \n- \ninitially between London and Birmingham, but with one of two spurs extending to provide a High Speed link between Manchester and the capital.\nThe distinction between ‘fast’ trains, travelling at speeds up to around 125 mph\n,\n and \n‘\nHigh Speed\n’\n trains is essentially arbitrary, \nbeing different in different countries and even in the EU being dependent on whether the tracks are new or upgraded.  Indeed the current services, which run on upgraded tracks, already achieve speeds for this EU classification \nthough \nthese speeds are substantially lower than those planned for the \nproposed\n new ‘Ultra High Speed’ \nsystem.  This is known as HS2 since Great Britain (Northern Ireland has its own rail system) already has one High Speed rail link – that through the Channel tunnel to Brussels and Paris\n,\n with High Speed connections beyond to other countries and places.  Surely, the argument goes, if other countries have, and are to have, more High Speed trains \nthen \nBritain should not be left behind?\nHowever, from a rational - as opposed to \na \npolitical – point of view, that presupposes that the geography and demographics of Britain and the other countries are similar.  This is not however the case: certainly in England the distances between the major cities are shorter than in the main comparator countries; and the populations based in and around those cities tend to be more dispersed than elsewhere since – at least outside London – the more affluent members of the population, and hence the more frequent users of such long distance rail routes, tend to live in dormitory suburbs and, increasingly, more rural locations.  Moreover in England there are multiple \ncentres\n of population, not all of which can expect to be served by the proposed High Speed routes. \nThe justification for HS2 on the basis of savings in travel time is based on comparisons of times between the termini rather than for door\n-\nto\n-\ndoor journeys.  They thus exclude the additional time which many \ntravellers\n would have to spend travelling to and from the terminal stations as opposed to boarding trains at\n \none of the more local stations currently served by the existing fast routes.  Already\n,\n in the case of Birmingham\n,\n many rail travelers from the south of the city prefer to catch a Chiltern Line service from stations such as \nSolihull\n or Warwick Parkway rather than travel further to catch the faster speed Virgin service from the centre of Birmingham, the airport or Coventry.  If this happens now would there not be the same tendency when the access point is limited to just one station in Birmingham\n?\n \nThis point has apparently been overlooked (or understated) in the cost-benefit appraisals of the case for HS2, with consequent effects on the forecasts of fare revenues and tim\ne\n savings.  High ‘public’ benefits have been attributed to the saving in time spent on the main part of the journey – which time is rarely ‘lost’ due to the provision of various business facilities on trains and the opportunity to make use of the time spent on them – whereas account does not seem to have been taken of the greater amount of mainly wasted time taken in reaching city centre termini.  Moreover it can be questioned whether the valuation of time savings as a benefit to the economy as a whole\n (i.e. as an ‘externality’) \ndoes not duplicate \nthe payment for those time savings \nalready incorporated in fares.  \nIf HS2 may not be the \nideal\n solution to the forecast need for the provision of more and better rail services is there any other solution\n?\n  \nFirst, it\n should be recognized, even by one such as I (who am \ninstinct\nive\nly \nfavourably\n disposed to rail as a means of transport)\n,\n that there are many journeys for which rail is not, and cannot be\n,\n a convenient form of travel; that it may be unrealistic to project the recent rapid growth in rail passenger numbers far into the future\n;\n and that technological developments, and both the increasing real cost of energy and wider environmental concerns, may result in lower growth in transportation (by all modes) in the future.  \nMoreover, e\nven leaving these more speculative and longer-term considerations aside\n,\n there are other solutions to the perceived problem of capacity constraints on these major inter-city parts of the existing rail network\n.  The concept of ‘capacity’ is rather nebulous in the case of rail transportation, it being dependent on such factors as train and platform length and \nsignalling\n technology.  Modern technology should allow greater usage of a line, with shorter distances between trains.\n&#xa0;\nF\nollowing on from the thoughts expressed above, there \nis\n a case for facilitating the use of rail by the provision of more Parkway stations, thus allowing people the convenience of driving from their home to a station without having to encounter the congestion associated with city centre stations.  Those MPs with constituencies in north Cheshire (such as \nTatton\n and Weaver Vale) who \nfavour\n the HS2 proposal – on the grounds of ‘bringing the north and London closer together’ – should try to evaluate what proportion of their constituents would have quicker rail journeys to London by using an HS2 from the centre of Manchester as opposed to \ntravelling from \nstations \nsuch as \nWilmslow\n or Crewe o\nn\n the existing services\n (the speed of which is likely to be enhanced by the time HS2 would be operational).\n \n Such constituents\n would \nprobably \nbe better served by a new Cheshire Parkway station on the existing \nW\nest Coast mainline, \nbetween Warrington and Crewe.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nI\nt should also be recognized that not all rail passengers put a high priority on time savings – for some leisure \ntravellers\n, cost and even pleasantly routed journeys are relevant considerations.  Thus any perceived capacity constraint with respect to\n \nrail travel between London and Manchester could be eased by a reopening of the short missing link (between \nChinley\n and Matlock) in the route used regularly whilst the \nW\nest \nC\noast mainline was being electrified in the 1960s.  This route would then link in, at Derby, with the existing Midland mainline which is due for the type of improvement already provided on the main routes to its east and west.  Moreover this line terminates at St \nPancras\n,\n thus giving direct access to the HS1 routes to the Continent.\n&#xa0;\nOne apparent oddity about the HS2 proposal is that its London terminus \nis to\n be at Euston station rather than St \nPancras\n, the terminus for HS1.  This means that some passengers may have to transit between the two stations \n(\nwhich are \nabout\n 600 yards apart)\n,\n though some services will procee\nd directly onto the HS1 route. \n \nT\nhere are other oddities \nin\n the proposed route, for example the location of the proposed Birmingham terminus some distance from the city centre and thus \nat a point \nless convenient for that centre than the existing termini of New Street and Moor Street\n.\n \n \nAlso the route does not go near the existing main corridor of London – Birmingham transport routes (the M1 and the \nW\nest \nC\noast mainline) and thus does not afford the possibility of easy access to the latter if and when required.  In particular the route does not go near Milton Keynes, the main locus of development between London and Birmingham and \nthe most obvious location for any possible \nfuture st\nation\n \nserving the south Midlands.\nInstead of passing through this already developed\n,\n and thus \nrelatively \n‘spoilt’\n,\n countryside the proposed route passes through some fine and currently largely \nunspoilt\n countryside, both on the outer fringe of the London commuting area (the Chiltern \nhills\n)\n and \nin\n Warwickshire.  It is thus not surprising that the existing residents of those areas are strongly opposed to the proposal but their concern for their local environment and peace and quiet is not the only reason to be \ns\nc\neptical\n about this proposed enhancement of GB’s existing rail network.  There are other means by which to improve \nthe existing \nrail\n system\n and \ns\no enhance the nation’s international competitiveness – ones that would bring benefits to more \npeople \nwithout impinging so harmfully on others.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex\n: \nSuggested questions for the meeting of the \nTransport Select Committee Meeting on 26th November at which Patrick McLoughlin and KPMG are to answer questions on the KPMG Report “HS2: The Regional Economic Impact”&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.  \nThe analysis is based on the estimation and then use of production functions linking regional estimates of output to the normal inputs in such a relationship and also to measures of connectivity. \n&#xa0;\nThe method of deriving coefficients for the latter has been \ncriticised\n by Professor \nOverman\n because of \nthe 'non standard'\n method of dealing with the problem of \nmulticollinearity\n between the separate measures of connectivity. \n&#xa0;\nHowever it is not clear how measures were derived of connectivity, both for the current position and \nfor \nthe hypothetical 'with HS2' position. \n&#xa0;\nCould you please explain this, \nsince\n it would seem that \nthe\n results are dependent also on the figures input for these variables\n?\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLinked to this it might be questioned \nas follows:\n&#xa0;\n2.  \nHave any tests been conducted to examine the sensitivity of your findings to the extent of separation of your local areas\n?\nThe relevance of this \nsecond question \nis that HS2 will have fewer stopping places than existing trains and thus measuring connectivity from a central point within a local area and with a prospective HS2 station may tend to overstate the effect on the more \noutyling\n parts of that same area.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
