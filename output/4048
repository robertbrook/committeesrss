default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Before I open with the questions, can I emphasise t
defaulthat, with five of you, 
defaultthere is no need for every person to answer every question
default? 
defaultWe only have an hour with you
default,
default and 
defaultwe have 
defaulta considerable number of questions
default. 
defaultHowever, in saying that, if you disagree with a pre
defaultvious answer, or 
defaultif you feel there is something you need to add to a previous answer, feel free to do so.
defaultI am going to start with the industry charter
default. 
defaultAs you will know, this was introduced in November of last year
default. 
defaultIt was designed to ensure responsible lending
default. 
defaultSince then, CAB, StepChange and OFT have reported that the reverse seems to have happened
default. 
defaultThere has been a significant increase in complaints about
default,
default and problems with
default,
default the industry
default. 
defaultWhat is your reason for that
default? 
defaultWho will lead on it
default? 
defaultCan you give an explanation?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: It is important to know what the C
defaultonsumer 
defaultC
defaultredit 
defaultT
defaultrade 
defaultA
defaultssociation
default is
default,
default in terms of its membership base
default. 
defaultWe have 373 members, which range from SMEs to large firms
default. 
defaultMany of our members are community commercial lenders and many 
defaultare second
default and third
default&#x2011;
defaultgeneration businesses
default. 
defaultThey are
default,
default and always have been
default,
default attempting to do the best they can do with regard to their customers
default. 
defaultWe have 61 members who either partially or wholly provide payday
default&#x2011;
defaultlending
default products, and 
defaultthat is reducing, because many members 
defaulthave 
defaultm
defaultoved
default away from payday lending over the course of the last 12 months
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultamount of payday
default&#x2011;
defaultlending members has decreased within the Consumer Credit Trade 
defaultAssociation by 13%
default. 
defaultMany of our members are coming out of this market, as I said
default. 
default70% of members are still in traditional credit granting.
defaultThe charter and
default the
default code of practice, which 
defaultwere
default i
defaultntroduced in November 2012, have 
defaultchanged things
default. 
defaultWe see it 
defaultin
default the number of complaints that actually come through to us
default. 
defaultThe total number of complaints about payday lending for the year 2012 was 15
default. 
defaultDuring the period we have measured in 2013,
default year to date,
default there have been 36 complaints, 19 of which came from one member
default. 
defaultT
defaulthere is 
defaulta reduction in terms of the overall number of complaints, because we have people 
defaultwho are doing more loans in tho
defaultse areas
default. 
defaultThe actual number of loans has increased, even though the number of our members has decreased to an extent
default. 
defaultThe feedback 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have taken from members is that many things are changing
default. 
defaultWe do not 
defaultbelieve that credit is being given in terms of the changes that have taken place
default and that 
defaultcontinue to take place
default. 
defaultComing back to the figur
defaultes and assertions that are 
defaultmade, we would be very concerned if the 
defaultstatistics from Citizens Advice
default were found to be representative, accurate and up-to-date
default. 
defaultWe have asked for granularity; we have asked for clarity on the customers, including customer details and agreement numbers
default. 
defaultThese have not been forthcoming.
default 
defaultWhen assertions about companies are made, we do need evidence in terms of case studies
default. 
defaultWe need those to take back to our members to understand what is
default 
defaultdeemed to have gone wrong, so that we can actually work with the members
default.
defaultThe 
defaultConsumer Credit Trade 
defaultAssociation is 122 years old
default. 
defaultWe have been working with regulators and legislators over that period to ensure best practice for consumers
default,
default and we continue to do that
default. 
defaultWe are doing regular training and compliance meetings with our members to ensure 
defaultthat 
defaultthey actually provide the best service.
default&#xa0;defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultMay 
defaultI follow up on that
default? 
defaultYou said 
defaultthat complaints had increased to 36, 19 of which were from
default one company
default. 
defaultCan you give det
defaultails of what those complaints a
defaultre about?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: No, I cannot
default. 
defaultI do not have the breakdown.
default&#xa0;defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default With respect, you have
default just
default criticised others for a lack of granularity
default. 
defaultIt would appear that you are as deficient in that as they are.
defaultThe charter actually does outline that there should be affordability checks
default. A
default loan has to be suitable 
defaultto be
default taken out
default, and i
defaultt must take into account the circumstances of the individual
default. But
default the OFT report said that only 74% of lenders actually took affordability into account
default. 
default67% said they did not do so for every loan
default,
default and 23% said they did so for a rollover
default. That
default seems to conflict with the charter 
defaultthat 
defaultthe industry itself has set out
default. 
defaultHow do you explain that?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: Mr 
defaultChairman, I wonder if I could 
defaultgive some context—
defaultnot on behalf of the i
defaultndustry, but on behalf of Wonga—on 
defaultthe background to this
default. 
defaultOne thing I would point out—this is not 
defaultto decry any people 
defaulton thi
defaults p
defaultanel or elsewhere—is that, not surprisingly, perhaps, the OFT found that compliance was better among the larger lenders, because, frankly, we have more sophisticated systems to do so.
defaultI think that t
defaulthe charter was an important development
default. 
default[Interruption.]
default The charter was an important development. 
defaultAccording to the OFT, 
defaultsome 
default90% of the industry came together
default to agree tho
defaultse provision
defaults. 
defaultIt will take time for some of the lenders to comply with them
default. I think actually, t
defaulthe picture is mixed
default. 
defaultAs far as Wonga is concerned, as people know, we h
defaultave always done thorough credit
default&#x2011;
defaultchecking; we have always bought and returned data
default. 
defaultYou are seeing improvements across the sector.
defaultThe
default 
defaultother thing to be borne in mind is that the OFT has done its own review of the sector
default. 
defaultI believe they will tell you later that, of the 50 lenders they visited, 19 are no longer carrying on payday
default&#x2011;
defaultloan activities
default. 
defaultThat has to be seen in the context of this process as well
default. Because
default we do not have 
defaultthe 
defaultgranularity as to who has done what, we will have to bear that in mind as well.
defaultI think that t
defaulthe charter has made some progress; 
defaultI think 
defaultit is absolutely right that people keep focusing on it
default and th
defaulte commitments.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Very specifically on this, 
defaultI think 
defaultit was reported earlier this year that Wonga had had a significant increase in the number of bad debts 
defaultit was
default writing off
default. 
defaultThat does suggest a less than robust approach to affordability.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: That is not the case, actually
default.
defaultPaul Blomfield:default It was reported in the papers
default, was it not? 
defaultHenry Rainedefault:
default I know. It was a mistake.
defaultPaul Blomfield:default defaultThe papers were wrong, were they?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultI think t
defaulthey took the wrong figure
default. 
defaultI addressed this 
defaultwith the Public Accounts 
defaultCommittee
default. Because i
defaultn our previous accounts we had not shown the amount of money we had lent, 
defaultwhich wa
defaults over 
default£700 million, the comparison wa
defaults made between 
default£77 
defaultmillion and a lower number
default. The National Audit 
defaultOffice confirmed at that meeting that the correct comparison was to compare the write-off with the amount of money lent
default. 
defaultThat is roughly 9.7%; it has not changed
default. That
default was 
defaultjust a
default misreporting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default 
default£77 
defaultmillion of 
defaultbad 
defaultloans is still a substantial number
default. That
default is a substantial number of people, considering the average size of the loans 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are talking about, who are presumably left in a position where their credit rating is ruined and they are unable to repay a debt
default. That, surely, 
defaultis a matter of concern
default 
defaultif you are 
defaultsaying that you are 
defaultrigorously assessing affordability criteria.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: I
default think, in one sense, any loan—
defaultWonga’s business is 
defaultaimed 
defaultto lend to people who can pay us back
default. 
defaultThat is how we make money
default. 
defaultThe vast majority of people pay us back on time
default. 
defaultWe freeze interest after 60 days
default. 
default25% of people pay us back early.
default So in one context, of course, any loan—but w
defaulte are lending 
defaultsmall
default&#x2011;
defaultsum
default credit to vast numbers of people
default, and I think 
defaultit is fair to say that those figures compare favourably with other lenders in the industry, including credit cards and banks
default. 
defaultWe also have a very significant system, as you know, to he
defaultl
defaultp people in financial difficulty, 
defaultincluding freezing interest after 60 days and allowing people to go online and do their own
default income
default&#x2011;
defaultand
default&#x2011;
defaultexpenditure form and, effectively, have a proposal accepted
default. So w
defaulte do everything we can to lessen the effect of bad debt.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Just coming back on th
defaultis
default 60
default&#x2011;
defaultdays point, a lot of your advertising will focus on much shorter period
defaults
default of time
default, and argue
default that you have great cost transparency over 18 days, 
defaultwhich a 
defaultlot of your advertising focuse
defaults on. 
defaultIf peop
defaultle end up borrowing for 60 days
default because they are rolling over loans, they end up paying a lot more.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: To be clear, our average
default first time
default loan is £17
default8
default for 17 days
default. 
defaultPeople cannot borrow for 60 days
default. 
defaultIf people cannot pay us back, 
defaultthen 
defaultinterest continues, 
defaultbut 
defaultthree days 
defaultbefore the due date, 
defaultand 24 hours before the due date, they get reminders
default. They get
default text messages
default. They get 
defaultnumbers they can call if they are having financial difficulty
default. So v
defaultery few people ever end up paying us that amount of money.
defaultThe point of introducing a cap was to differentiate ourselves from the credit
default&#x2011;
defaultcard market, where, as you know, the basic business model
default, I think,
default is to lend 
defaultpeople money they cannot afford;
default they pay the minimum amount and they
default get 
defaultinto a debt spiral.
default That is why we do it like that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Can you give us figures for how many people owe 
defaultthat 
defaultamount of money?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultI think
default 
defaultaround 3% of loans go to that period, but I can confirm that.
default&#xa0;defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default How many would that be in numbers?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: I do not know
default. 
defaultI would have to confirm that to you in writing
default. I do not know the exact
default numbers.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: I can jump in there
default. 
defaultIt is probably about 2% or 3% with us, as well, who say they are going into financial difficulty.
defaultChairdefault:default I am trying to pin down how many people 
defaultthat 
defaultinvolves
default, to get a picture.
default 
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultIt is pro rata. 
defaultIf it is 100,000 people or 10,000, it is always going to be a percentage of people
default. 
defaultIt depends.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default The point is that there still could be an awful lot of people enduring an awful lot of hardship as a result of it.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: To come back on that, we and
default I am sure
default other lend
defaulters here d
defaulto everything we possibly can to avoid th
defaultat, not only by thorough credit-
defaultchecking, but also by moderating the amount people are borrowing and giving them lots of warnings about the impact, both on our website and throughout the journey
default. Of course it is regrettable, and
default our j
defaultob is to make that
default number as small as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default defaultWe 
defaultshall 
defaultbe 
defaultcovering credit-checking in a moment,
default 
defaultand 
defaultI will bring Robin back in to deal with that
default, but
default 
defaultmay
default I
default go
default back to the charter for a moment
default? 
defaultWhat sanctions are there for lenders that do not actually abide by the charter?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: The c
defaultharter and the addendum to our c
defaultode of 
defaultp
defaultractice, which is the payday
default&#x2011;
defaultlending addendum, lays down what members should do
default. 
defaultWe are not a regulator
default. 
defaultI pointed this out to the then Minister, which was Norman
default&#xa0;
defaultLamb, with regard to 
defaultus being a
default trade association.
default 
defaultWe are there to ensure members adopt best practice
default. 
defaultWe monitor it 
defaultin 
defaultthe same way that the OFT do: we look in terms of complaints
default. 
defaultWe take up the complaints with the companies
default. 
defaultIf we find there are regular complaints about an organisation, the sanctions are we work with them 
defaultwith regard 
defaultto applying 
defaulta best practice model, so 
defaultsomebody goes in and works with them
default. 
defaultWe can then suspend the member and, eventually, we can actually expel the member from the trade association.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Do you actually monitor whether the companies abide by the charter as opposed to 
defaultjust 
defaultresponding to complaints?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: We do not directly monitor on a regular basis
default. 
defaultWe monitor when the company comes into the trade association
default. 
defaultWe do not know what takes place after that
default. 
defaultWe do not do regular monitoring.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultT
defaulthe larger lenders that I represent are independently monitored by an independent panel
default. 
defaultWe have incorporated the charter commitments into a wider code of practice
default,
default and introduced independent monitoring for that.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: In Wonga’s case, we are 
defaulta member of the 
defaultFLA
default, which I think many of you know 
defaulthas been going for around 20 years
default. 
defaultThey have their own code, which we abide
default by, and of course
default the
defaulty have independent monitoring;
default they do monitor us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default But
default the only sanctions are, basically, suspension from the membership of the association or organisation.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: 
defaultOr expelling.
defaultChairdefault:default It does not stop them trading.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: We would also expect, if someone was in breach 
defaultof our code 
defaultand had not corrected it given the opportunity, having been identified by the independent monitoring, we would expect them to be reported to the regulator
default. 
defaultWe would expect the independent panel to be able to make a statement to that effect and, ultima
defaulttely, recommend to the Consumer Finance 
defaultAssociation that the member be expelled from the trade association.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Very quickly, to Russell and Greg, 
defaultso 
defaulthow many people have you expelled in the last 12 months?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: Our independent panel has been in place since March and we have not expelled any members yet
default. 
defaultThey have all been seen to be compliant.
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Greg, you said you have been going for 120 years.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: I will answer the question in terms of payday lending, which is what we are talking about
default. 
defaultIn terms of payday lending, we have expelled nobody
default. 
defaultWe have had many pe
defaultople who have exited the market
default because of the charter
default. 
defaultWe have had people who 
defaulthave left the trade association
default because they did not want to comply with the charter
default and the c
defaultode of 
defaultp
defaultractice.
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultBut y
defaultou have not
default 
defaultexpelled anyone.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: They have expelled themselves, because they—
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultYou have not 
defaultactually taken action and expelled anyone
default. 
defaultThat is my question: yes or no.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: No
default, as I have said.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Do you think either of your organisations are doing a good enough job in this market
default,
default or have you just gone native?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: The answer is no,
default we have not gone native
default. I do 
defaultnot 
defaultthink 
defaultenough credit is being given in terms of how the market has been tidied up, in terms of the work done by the OFT, by the charter and 
defaultby 
defaultthe consumer groups
default. Many people have left the
default market.
default 
defaultYou also have to remember there are more companies that are not in trade associations than in trade associations
default, and m
defaultany of those companies are the ones that create the problems in the market
default, 
defaultcertainly with regard to lead generation
default. 
defaultThere are other factors that play in this market
default. 
defaultMany of the complaints that come in are 
defaultabout companies that are 
defaultnot under trade associations.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultBut also i
defaultt is a market that gravitates towards the very big guys, because they can afford the advertising
default. That is the model.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default The market is concentrated in a handful of Wonga-type companies
default. 
defaultLet me get this right, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine: what was your profitability last year on the £700
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion of loans 
defaultthat 
defaultyou made?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: The most recent profitability
default was
default we lent £1.2
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion and we made a net income of £62
default.5
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, which
default is about £5 for every £100 lent
default.
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default What was it before tax?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: I think
default 
defaultit was 
default£80
default&#x2011;
defaultsomething
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion; I do not have an exact figure
default. 
defaultWe look at the net income.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default You said that 2% or 3% were people getting into real pain on your model.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultAround 
defaultthat
default, yes. 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default It is the same for Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman
default, roughly?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultCorrect
default.
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default You refused to give us an answer, but my calculation would be that there are around 123,000 people 
defaultthat you put 
defaultin real pain.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: We have
default around
default 1.25
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion customers
default,
default and 3% of that is a much lower number.
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default I worked this out from £700
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion
default. 
defaultYou said the average loan was £174, so I did the calculation
default. 
defaultWhy do you not just give m
defaulte the number, instead of 
defaultme try
defaulting
default to work it out?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. Well, 
defaultI do not know the number.
default The average loan—
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default You must know the number, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine
default, because
default you will have that number.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: The average loan across the portfolio is £27
default2
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default I just want to know how many people you put in real pain
default—in 
defaulta number, not 
defaultin 
defaulta percentage.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: I do not accept we put any
defaultbody
default in real pain
default. 
defaultIf you take 
default1.25
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion customers and
default 3% 
defaultof them 
defaultis the 
defaultnumber 
defaultwho
default, in your definition,
default have gone beyond 60 days
default, t
defaulthat will give you the number of customers you are looking for.
defaultChairdefault:default It is around about 40,000, is it not?
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Yes, it 
defaultis about
default 40,000 people
default—
defaultnot 125,000; I 
defaultgot it 
defaultwrong.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: Respectfully, 
defaultI think that is 
defaultthe way 
defaultof looking at it, yes
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Do you think that your charges are extortionate and that you are a rapacious organisation?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: No, of course we do not accept that
default. Indeed—this is an important point—when you look at the market that we are competing in, w
defaulthen the business was started, the aim was clearly
default to disrupt the financial 
defaultservices market and disrupt consumer credit
default. 
defaultWhat we looked across at were people who 
defaultwere having 
defaultto borrow fixed-term sums and 
defaultwho 
defaulthad no flexibility
default. 
defaultWith Wonga, as you know, the first thing you see 
defaultas 
defaultyou come on
default 
defaultto the website is the amount it is going to cost you; you choose how much to borrow for how long
default. 
defaultThe product actually 
defaultis 
defaultused moderately by most people.
defaultOf course, the market 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have opened up is composed of those people traditionally using overdrafts and credit cards
default. 
defaultAll the surveys show—the research from 
defaultBristol
default rather confirmed this—that
default, for online customers, that
default is the market we are serving.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default I have had an overdraft
default. I ra
defaultn a small business
default. 
defaultWhat is your interest rate when someone goes over the period of time for the overdraft or equivalent in your world?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: If you borrow £100, my understanding—this is from 
defaultWhich?,
default who 
defaultI think 
defaultwill be here later—
defaultis that 
defaultthe unauthorised overdraft charges for 30 days run up to between 
default£80 and £115. 
defaultIf you borrow 
defaultthe same 
defaultfrom Wonga, our most expensive loan for 30 days is £37
default. Those are some of the comparisons.
defaultPeople also tell us, and 
defaultthere is evidence from the Friends
default&#xa0;
defaultProvident
default&#xa0;
defaultFoundation, 
defaultthat the vast majority of those people using credit cards are not, of course, paying their debt off every month
default, and
default 
defaulttherefore
default the cost to them of using a credit
default&#x2011;
defaultcard product is considerably higher.
defaultChairdefault:default We are still on our first question and there are a lot more to come
default. If you could make
default questions and answers brief, I would appreciate it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default This morning, Wonga admitted
default that
default they were one of the 50 companies investigated by the OFT, which covered 90% of the market
default. 
defaultCan the other two companies here today confirm whether they were also on that list of 50
default? 
default19 of those 50 lenders 
defaulthave now left the market, according to the OFT
default. 
defaultCan the trade associations confirm how many of those 19 were one of their members?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: We had the OFT audit us at the beginning of the year.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: Yes, QuickQuid was also one of the 50.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: Of the 19, none of them were members of my trade association.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: The 19 is a spurious figure
default. 
defaultMany of those people were not in trade associations
default. From the 19, w
defaulte had two
default,
default who have actually changed products
default. 
defaultThey are still trading as credit granters.
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultT
defaulthey are no longer in payday lending
default. 
defaultThank you for the clarification.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I would like to pick up on something that Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultStevens intimated
default. 
defaultHe intimated there were good payday lenders and there were bad payday lenders
default. 
defaultCould you very briefly define who the bad payday lenders are?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: I 
defaultdon’t think I
default intimate
defaultd
default good and bad
default. I think there are lenders and lead-
defaultgenerators who have been confusing the market
default. 
defaultTheir practices were probably not where they should have been.
default&#xa0;defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I admire your defence
default. 
defaultMay I go on
default? 
defaultAre all the payday lenders on this panel members of your association?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Let me pick up a point
default. 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman, I shall come to you shortly
default. 
defaultOn the Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultLender website, it says, “If, for whatever reason,
default I can’
defaultt lend to you, 
defaultthen 
defaultI will do my very best to ask around and recommend another friend of ours, who may be able to help you ou
defaultt. P
defaultroviding you have consented I can do this
default.”
defaultOn the surface, that sounds very good indeed
default, but w
defaultho are the friends
default? 
defaultWho do you think the friends are, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultStevens?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: We—
defaultMr Binley:default defaultI will come to you, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman
default. 
defaultWho do you think the friends are, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultStevens
default? 
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: 
defaultI am sorry; could you repeat the question? 
defaultMr Binley:default defaultI want to know who yo
defaultu think those other friends are who
default are operating in the business
default and 
defaultclearly 
defaultare 
defaultnot operating to the standards that Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman would want to operate to.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: 
defaultFirst of all
default, having 373 members
default,
default I cannot comment on one company
default. 
defaultAll lenders work with other companies with regard to people’s special circumstances, because the underwriting criteria of most companies are
default different from
default 
defaulteverybody else’s. 
defaultThere will be times when somebody would fit somebody else’s underwriting criteria and might be better placed
default. 
defaultThe one thing that is not going away in all of this is the fact that people need th
defaultat
default 
defaultmoney
default. 
defaultThere is a need for small cash
default&#x2011;
defaultsum loans
default. 
defaultT
defaulthat
default need is there
default. 
defaultPeople will direct them to a place that is more beneficial and more suitable for that consumer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I know the good side of your business, sir
default. 
defaultI am concerned about the bad side
default. 
defaultWe have 
defaultgot 
defaultenough reports of the bad side to know it exists
default. You, a
defaults the head of the association of payday lenders, 
defaultneed to help me 
defaultdefine who the bad lenders 
defaultare 
defaultand who you think the “friends” are
default, as
default intimated on 
defaultthe Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultLender
default website
default. 
defaultWill you do that
default? 
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Can—
defaultMr Binley:default I will come to you, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: First of all, only 16% of our members are 
defaultpayday lenders, so i
defaultt is not 
defaultthe payday
default&#x2011;
defaultlending trade 
defaultassociation
default. 
defaultIn terms of the good friends and the bad friends, that is a situation in terms of looking in terms of referral
default. 
defaultReferral is a general practice for all financial institutions
default. 
defaultIt is nothing dissimilar to 
defaultwhat 
defaultother credit granters do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultI find your defence unacceptable. Now l
defaultet me come to Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman
default. 
defaultWhat does “friends” mean?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: It is a kind of branding for us
default. 
defaultWe hold a consumer credit licen
defaultce with a broker licence and a lender licenc
defaulte
default. 
defaultWe probably facilitate one loan out of every 100 people that apply to us
default. 
defaultWe have very strict lending criteria
default. 
defaultIf we cannot lend to a customer, we will pass it to other lenders.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default And who are they?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: It would be on a broker model, so we would actually give it to a broker to push through to other lenders.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultSo w
defaulte are not talking about those people who work in the shadows of your industry, then
default. 
defaultSomebody considers them to be friends; you are saying it is not you.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: I see your point.
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultOh good;
default I am glad about that
default. 
defaultNow answer the question.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: I see your point
default,
default and I see why you are making the point
default, but 
defaultwe are very strict at lending
default. 
defaultWe literally lend to one in 100 people.
defaultMr Binley:default This is not about you; it is about your friends.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultThat is right. And my friends, or 
defaultMr Lender’s friends
default,
default are obviously people that will 
defaultfacilitate
default people
default who
default are working part
default&#x2011;
defaulttime or 
defaultare 
defaulton benefits
default. 
defaultWe will not lend to people like that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Do your receive commission for it?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultSometimes;
default sometimes not.
defaultMr Binley:default This is the loophole.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Can I ask—can we ask—what am I 
defaultmissing?
defaultMr Binley:default You do not ask the questions; we do.
default              
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Fair enough.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Coming back to affordability, which is 
defaultabsolutely 
defaultcrucial, you all say
default, as companies,
default that you have rigorous affordability criteria
default. 
defaultYou have just said you only approve about one in 100 people, which seems extraordinary
default. I think 
defaultWonga have said that about 60% of people do not get through that particular— 
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 80%.
defaultMr Walker:default Thank you
default. 
defaultThe charter says you will 
default“C
defaultarry out 
defaulta sound, 
defaultproper 
defaultand 
defaultappropriate affordability assessment 
defaultand credit vetting 
defaultfor each loan application
default and before the loan is extended (
defaultrolled over
default)”. 
defaultAs the Chairman poi
defaultnted out
default earlier, the OFT figures rather contradict that
default. May I ask 
defaultthe three businesses on this panel, do you do th
defaultat
default on every loan and every rollover individually?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes
default. 
defaultWe have started to since the OFT investigation and since the charter.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default 
defaultSo you did 
defaultnot 
defaultbefore the OFT investigation?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes, but it is a lot more intense now
default. 
defaultWe speak to every single customer that we will lend to
default. 
defaultWe will go through income and expenditure
default. 
defaultThere is one downside in it at the moment, which I am sure 
defaultthat 
defaultwe will come to: not knowing in real time
default. 
defaultThat is 
defaultprobably 
defaultour biggest downside as a lender: not knowing in real time what other loans a customer will have at the time of applying with us.
defaultMr Walker:default I want to come on to that.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: I am sure you will.
defaultMr Walker:default defaultIt is a very important point
default.defaultAdam Freemandefault: We do everything we can
default. 
defaultIf someone has an income of £1
default,
default500 and their expenses are £900, leaving £600 disposable income, we are not going to lend that customer £600
default. 
defaultWe would probably go up to
default a threshold of about
default 50
default% to 
default60
default%—maybe £300 to £35
default0.
defaultAs a lender, what we do not know at the time is, “Have they just gone to QuickQuid or Wonga and got a loan with them
default?” 
defaultI would love that information, because I like to lend to people who can afford to pay me back.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default I will come back to that, if I may
default. 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultLapointe, does QuickQuid do individual assessments for every loan and rollover?
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: QuickQuid does an affordability assessment and creditworthiness check with each and every loan and rollover
default. 
defaultWe do a credit report, an over
default&#x2011;
defaultindebtedness report and we query a number of other databases
default. 
defaultAt the time of a rollover, a customer is going to be asked a series of questions to determine whether or not the rollover is suitable for them and nobody would be guaranteed to have access to any rollovers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default In what circumstances would a rollover not be suitable
default? 
defaultIf someone cannot afford to pay back the princip
defaultal
default, how would you 
defaultthen 
defaultdecide 
defaultthat 
defaultthe rollover was not suitable for them?
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: If a customer went to roll
default 
defaultover a loan and advise
defaultd
default us that he had just lost his job, 
defaulta
default rollover would not be suitable
default; a
default forbearance arrangement would be suitable at that point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default How often does that happen?
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: I
default think i
defaultt happens fairly frequently.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default It would be interesting to see some figures on th
defaultat
default.
default 
defaultComing back to Wonga on this, I saw that you were nodding in terms of saying 
defaultthat 
defaultyou do 
defaultan 
defaultassessment on every loan and every rollover.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: The way Wonga started was by doing everything online and buying as much data 
defaulta
defaults we could
default. 
defaultThat was the differentiating factor in our model
default. 
defaultEarly on, we worked with Callcredit
default,
default 
defaultin particular, 
defaultand 
defaultwith other bureaux
default to 
defaultdevise as much data as we could. 
defaultWe buy all the raw da
defaultta from the
default bureau
defaultx
default; we do not buy reports
default. 
defaultWe buy the raw data and crunch it ourselves
default.
defaultWe also look at lots of other factors
default. 
defaultThere is a lot of public data you can buy in the marketplace t
defaulto
default assess people’s affordability
default. Obviously, our algorithm has got better
default the more we have lent, because you learn about people
default. Without going in
defaultto too much detail, we also look at how people interact with the sliders and how they interact on the screen in terms of whether they are appropriate for the loan.
defaultIn terms of rollovers, we have always checked
default. 
defaultLess than one in 15 customers at Wonga ever rolls over a loan once
default. 
defaultRollovers have not been a big feature of our business
default. 
defaultIndeed, when we started we did not offer extensions at all
default. 
defaultCustomers
default kept phoning up and saying, “It
default is my due date; can I extend for another five days?
default”
default and we had no mechanisms to do it, so we introduced the limited concept of extensions, whereby you could extend for how long you want, i.e
default. 
defaultyou do not have to extend the whole loan for the whole amount
default. 
defaultYou can extend £20 for 10 days
default. 
defaultThat is what we do.
defaultClearly, the big challenge for us
default, which is why 
defaulta number of us here are working together on this with the bureau
defaultx, 
defaultis 
defaultto find
default the best method of getting all data from all lending on a real
default&#x2011;
defaulttime basis
default. 
defaultFor us, as I said, the majority of our customers are coming from bank products and credit
default&#x2011;
defaultcard products, so it is vital we unders
defaulttand their whole credit history, 
defaultnot just whether they borrowed from QuickQuid or Mr Lender
default. I think 
defaultreal progress 
defaultis 
defaultbeing made on that
default. 
defaultGiven that they will be FCA
default&#x2011;
defaultregulated, the CRAs give us a real opportunity to do something
default about
default that
default. 
defaultReciprocity is key, 
defaultobviously—
defaultputting data in and getting it out.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: It is helpful to
default note,
default 
defaultfor context, that the OFT report wa
defaults
default published
default some time ago
default. 
defaultSince that point, lenders were given a 12-week window in which to put in some additional measures
default. 
defaultWe are still waiting on a response
default from that, but i
defaultt included affordability checks
default.
defaultWe are already limiting the number of rollovers, putting in clear costs, reducing the use of con
defaulttinuous payment authority, putting
default clear cost
defaults i
defaultn adverts, 
defaultand 
defaultworking with debt
default&#x2011;
defaultadvi
defaultce agencies
default referring people to
default free debt 
defaultadvice
default. 
defaultAll of those things have happened
default,
default and are happening
default,
default 
defaultpost 
defaultthe OFT report
default. 
defaultWhile the OFT report is an important point
default of reference, the industry has
default moved a long way forward since that time.
defaultWe recently surveyed the customers of the businesses I represent using YouGov
default. 
default93% of them said that their lender asked them about their income, employment and other financial details before approving 
defaulta
default loan
default. 
default90% felt they were offered a fair loan based on the employment and financial information they provided.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default There are still significant numbers
default of people,
default even in those surveys
default,
default who feel 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are not going 
defaultthrough the assessment, 
defaultand that is a 
defaultmatter of 
defaultconcern
default. Returning to th
defaulte OFT figures 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Chairman spoke about earlier, only 23% of people responding to that survey said 
defaultthat 
defaultthey were reassessing at the time of rollover
default. 
defaultThat does seem a matter of concern
default. 
defaultI accept that is 
defaultin the past; it may have improved
default.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: What is going on behind the scenes is not necessarily transparent to the customer either
default. 
defaultThey
default just
default ask whether they can have a rollover.
defaultMr Walker:default This was lenders giving information to the OFT, not customers.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultAnd their answers were b
defaultased on the way 
defaultthat 
defaultthe question was phrased, 
defaultand 
defaultthe lenders were being honest in the way 
defaultthat 
defaultthey were responding to some of those questions.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Coming back to
default the
default point 
defaultthat 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman raised
default, which I think is very important,
default about the transparency of knowing whether people have borrowed, Wonga has said that you pay 
defaulta lot of money for data, 
defaultor you invest in data
default. 
defaultDo you not think the industry should be able to pay for a sharing system or some form of database, which shows all the short-term loans that people have out there, so 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can get that greater picture of affordability?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultI think w
defaulte are working on that
default. Obviously, f
defaultar be it from me to dictate anything; I am not a member of the industry bodies
default. I think w
defaulte are working with a number of industry players and Callcredit to develop a system with a recognised CRA.
defaultAs I said before, if I
default may pick up this
default point, it is more than a payday
default&#x2011;
defaultlending database
default. 
defaultIt does not mean we should not do it, by the way, but 
defaultthe challenge is that 
defaultwhat we are looking at here is a 
defaultsignificant
default amount of people having other short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm financial products, which are causing them financial difficulty
default. 
defaultWe need to be able to get hold of as much data as we can
default,
default on a reciprocal basis
default. 
defaultObviously, for the larger lenders, there is a downside: 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are putting more data in and getting less out
default. 
defaultYou may find a situation where
default,
default for some of the smaller lenders
default,
default the economics simply do
defaultes not work for them 
defaultand the technology does not work
default. 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultStevens may have a view on that.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: I participated in a number of meetings with the credit
default&#x2011;
defaultreporting agencies to get this built and to push it
default,
default so that it does happen
default. 
defaultOne of the advantages of using an actual credit
default&#x2011;
defaultreporting agency is 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can take account of all types of credit
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultUnited
default&#xa0;
defaultStates
default has certain databases that only keep track of payday loans
default,
default and they do not k
defaulteep track of log
default&#x2011;
defaultbook loans or pawn 
defaultloans or instalment loans or anything else.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default 
defaultI believe 
defaultCanada
default has quite a developed system in terms of registering loans and sharing that information
default. 
defaultIs that one 
defaultthat 
defaultany of you have looked at?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: There is one main 
defaultcredit 
defaultreference agency that the vast majority of lenders use
default. 
defaultI was in a meeting around a year and a half ago when this company was talking about real-time sharing
default. 
defaultAs I said before, the problem we have is that the data could be up to 60 days old, because if you are doing loans towards the end of the month and you have to report at the end of the next month, you basically have to wait 60 days back.
defaultAbout a year ago, they identified payday loans as a product
default. 
defaultIt received its own code, which was “Advance Against Income” or AAI
default. 
defaultThis is specifically related to payday lending
default. So 
defaultI know if a customer has settled payday
default&#x2011;
defaultloan accounts before
default, and 
defaultI know if they have any open payday
default&#x2011;
defaultloan accounts
default. 
defaultYou can choose not to lend to that particular person with open payday loans, but the data is 30 or 60 days old
default. 
defaultIf I knew today 
defaultthat this
default customer has a loan with QuickQuid and Wonga,
default there is no way I
default would lend to them
default. 
defaultAs I said, I like to lend to people who can afford to pay me back
default. 
defaultThere might be a £50 or £100 loan, because they still have £200 disposable income, 
defaultbut 
defaultif I had that information, I would be the first to share it and I would be the first to use it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Improving this information is clearly crucial in making sure 
defaultthat 
defaultpeople are
default not 
defaultbeing lent money if they cannot afford it, there are
default still concerns. 
defaultOne of the lines in the OFT report 
defaultpicked up on this. It 
defaultsaid that even where bank accounts were being scrutinised and people could
default see fro
defaultm the bank accounts
default that
default borrowers 
defaultwere 
defaultalready making payments to payday lenders, they were still being given loans
default. 
defaultWould you all accept
default that
default, from your business
default’s
default perspective, this should not happen?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: If we knew 
defaultwithin a few days 
defaultthat they had a
defaultn open loan with another lender
default, we would never lend to them
default. That
default is not a good business model, because you are not going to get your money back.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: That
default is why we prefer using automated systems to using live people reviewing bank statements and documents.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default If I may 
defaultturn to the question of rollovers, gentlemen, the three companies before us today have all admitted that they were part of the OFT investigation
default. 
defaultCould you confirm whether you were censured on the issue of rollovers?
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: Yes, we were
default. 
defaultAnn McKechin:default defaultMr Freeman?
default defaultAdam Freemandefault:
default What did you say? 
defaultAnn McKechin:default defaultWere you censured on the issue of rollovers by the OFT?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultWhat do you mean? Are you asking whether we were doing anything 
defaultwrong with them
default, or—? 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Did they raise concerns with your company about the issue of rollovers?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: No, they did not.
defaultAnn McKechin:default defaultMr Raine?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: I am happy to answer that: no
default. 
defaultIf I may say
default—
defaultit sounds rather pejorative
default—w
defaulthat the OFT did was
default, they
default investigated the 50 largest payday—
defaultAnn McKechin:default defaultI will come back to that later; thank you very much, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine. I have—
defaultHenry Rainedefault: They investigated the largest
default payday lenders in the market.
defaultChairdefault:default Please do not interrupt a question.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default May
default I follow up on an issue 
defaultthat 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman raised
default? 
defaultY
defaultou stated that you rejected
default a significant number of people
default who applied
default 
defaultto you 
defaultfor 
defaulta loan, but in turn, you referred
default a percentage of these to other lenders.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultC
defaultorrect.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default I am 
defaultjust
default 
defaultwondering to what extent that commission income is a percentage of your 
defaulttotal turnover.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: It is minimal
default. 
defaultIt would probably be less than 1%.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Is that 
defaultpractice know
defaultn to any of the other gentleme
defaultn
default? Is this known amongst the trade members of 
defaultthe two
default associations, or 
defaultto Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultLapointe and Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: May I intervene
default? 
defaultWe give this to a broker
default. 
defaultWe have cont
defaultracts behind the scenes, where
default they make sure all of our lenders actually—
defaultAnn McKechin:default I am focusing on the issue about this particular type of trade where you are referring a borrower from one lender to the next and how that is regulated
default. 
defaultI am just trying to clarify that
default. 
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: The OFT did say that we should change
default certain
default of our processes to make sure 
defaultthat we ga
defaultve out less rollovers.
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultOkay, but y
defaultou do offer the alternative of another lender to some of the people who apply.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: No
default.
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine
default?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: No.
defaultAnn McKechin:default Are either of the two trade associations aware of any of your members being people who refer people 
defaulton 
defaultto other lenders?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: I have already said that it is a general model in the market
default. I
defaultf 
defaultsomeone
default do
defaultes
default not fit their underwri
defaultting criteria, they will pass that person
default on
default. 
defaultIt is most prevalent in motor finance
default. 
defaultUnderwriting criteria vary massively
default; therefore, 
defaultleads do move around.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultHamblin
default&#x2011;
defaultBoone, the Consumer Finance Association has introduced a limit of three rollovers for loans
default. 
defaultCan you confirm 
defaultthat 
defaultyour members are 
defaultcurrently 
default100% compliant?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: They are 100% compliant inasmuch as they are independently monitored
default. 
defaultI cannot confirm
default this; nor could anybody. I imagine that e
defaultven Marks
default&#xa0;
default&amp;
default&#xa0;
defaultSpencer could not say that all of their staff were 100% compliant with something
default. But it
default is 
defaultthe
default policy
default. 
defaultIt is independently monitored
default. 
defaultWe do know that the average
default length of a loan of one of my
default members’ customers is now 41 days, which suggests 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are not rolling over their loan anywhere near that
default amount.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultIf 40
default days is the average, that implies 
defaultthat 
defaultquite a number of 
defaultpeople are well over that 40
default days.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 41 days is the average length.
defaultAnn McKechin:default Yes
default. 
defaultIf you are saying that the bulk pay on time within 30 days
default,
default and the average is 40 days, 
defaultthat would suggest it is
default much longer.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 85% pay on the due date
default. 
defaultOf the remaining 15%, two
default&#x2011;
defaultthirds of them roll over their loan at least once
default. 
defaultBased on the 41 days, the majority of them roll over just once.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultIn respect of when
default a borrower has missed a repayment, 
defaultin their evidence the OFT said, “In our view, 
defaultthis should be 
defaultprima facie
default evidence that the customer is in financial difficulties a
defaultnd the lending is unsustainable
default”
default.
default Would that be a criterion of analysis
default for
default your independent monitoring?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: As Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine said, when the original loan product
default 
defaultfirst came to market, 
defaultthere was no
default ability to extend the loan
default. 
defaultThere are all sorts of reasons for rollovers
default. 
defaultWhether this is due to late payments, people not getting the cheques through or people needing to delay their payments in order to pay other debts that are more priority debts, we need to have the flexibility to grant people at least one or two extensions.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default The specific question I am asking is
default whether, 
defaultif someone has missed a repayment, according to the OFT, that would be 
defaultprima facie
default evidence 
defaultthat 
defaultthe lending is unsustainable.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultNo, 
defaultI disagree.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default If someone comes to you and says, “I have missed a repayment,” would they automatically then be allowed to roll over?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultNot automatically;
default nobody is allowed to roll over automatically
default. 
defaultIt is important that there is some flexibility for 
defaulta short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm loan,
default and 
defaultthat 
defaultwe do not immediately put someone into default, affect their credit score and not give them any options.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default You are carrying out this independent analysis
default. 
defaultPresumably, you have only just started
default,
default so the figures will not yet be available
default. But 
defaultif you are starting it, 
defaultpresumably 
defaultyou will be able to find out on how m
defaultany occasions, and for
default 
defaultwhat 
defaultpercentage of people
default,
default 
defaultloans 
defaultare ro
defaultlled over on the basis that 
defaulta payment
default has been missed, so you w
defaultill be able to provide those statistics in the p
defaultublic domain in the near future. Would that be the case?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: People missing a payment would be contacted by the lender.
defaultAnn McKechin:default No, I am asking 
defaultthat 
defaultyou reveal the actual figures of how many missed repayments then roll over, so we can have an indication of how many of these loans would be deemed, 
defaultprima facie
default, to be unsustainable.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: If someone misses a payment and the lender makes contact with them
default,
default or they make contact with the lender and say
default,
default “My circumstances have changed,” “I have lost my job,” “My partner has left me,” or whatever it may be, that person 
defaultis deemed to be in financial difficulty.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultOkay, so y
defaultou are not going to provide this evidence.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: That person is deemed to be in financial difficulty
default. 
defaultIn that circumstance
default, that
default definition does apply
default. 
defaultWe will immediately freeze the—
defaultAnn McKechin:default I am not asking how you deal with the process
default. 
defaultI am asking how you record the process and how you are transparent about the process, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultHamblin
default&#x2011;
defaultBoone
default. 
defaultThank you very
default much for that.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: You have asked me to define whether one rollover is someone in financial difficulty or not
default. 
defaultIn some circumstances, it absolutely is and we take action
default. 
defaultIn other circumstances, there
default is a reason they want to extend
default the loan
default that 
defaultis not financial difficulty.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultSo y
defaultou do not think the OFT can work out what is and is not financially unsustainable and what is and is not financial difficulty.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: The OFT report was some time ago.
defaultChairdefault:default May I intervene at this point
default? 
defaultWe are short of time
default. 
defaultYou will have the opportunity, if you feel 
defaultthat 
defaultyou need to add to any response you have given, to do it in the form of supplementary written evidence after this 
defaulti
defaultnquiry
default. 
defaultIt will be taken into con
defaultsideration when we produce our R
defaulteport
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default According to the OFT, 17 lenders actively promoted rollovers in marketing material at the point of sale
default,
default and 15 proactively alerted customers to the rollover 
defaultoptions prior to the loan due 
defaultdate
default. 
defaultDo any of you support those practices
default? 
defaultIf not, how ca
defaultn that
default promotion be stopped effectively?
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: QuickQuid does not promote rollovers
default,
default and our call
default&#x2011;
defaultcentre representatives are not allowed to present rollovers
default. 
defaultWe do qu
defaultality assurance monitoring to make 
defaultsure 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are not doing so.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultS
defaultame here
default, with us. 
defaultBefore the OFT, we did actively promote
default them, but since the OFT review and audits,
default we do not actively promote them.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: Our practice has never b
defaulteen that. In monitoring, a
defaults Andy says, one of the key issues is looking at call
default&#x2011;
defaultcentre training
default—t
defaulthat is a challenge for all of us—as well as what is on the website
default. 
defaultOf course, t
defaulthere is no 
defaultone here from the storefront sector, so we do not know what goes on in terms of people going into stores.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default What is your 
defaultcompany’s policy on limiting the number of rollovers?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultWe have always had a limit of three
default, and as I say, less than one in 15 ever extend a Wonga loan once.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Mr Stevens, we all want to get rid of the unsavoury element to your business, which we all know exists
default, and it seems to me the reference area that you referred to, saying that it was reasonably widespread, is a 
defaultway of 
defaultsort of 
defaultoperating outside of the charter for some people
default. 
defaultDo you accept that particular point?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: 
defaultI think people who are—
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultIt is a simple question: yes or no?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default You do ac
defaultcept the point. Then let me ask you this: if you do feel that there is a loophole here, where 
defaultpeople 
defaultare operating
default in a way 
defaultthat all of us, you included, would not want to happen, h
defaultow might we close that loophole?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: As an industry, 
defaultwe have been trying to close several loopholes, certainly with regard to lead-generators, who are not 
defaultunder the OFT
default. 
defaultOne of the problems is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe marketplace 
defaultexists on the leads being generated. It 
defaultdepends on 
defaultthe acquisition of those leads to drive the business forward. I
default do not think enough credit is being given 
defaultin terms of the work the OFT has done and the work that is going to be done by the FCA. Even the actual consultation report from the FCA 
defaultwill drive people from the business
default. You will get the thing you want.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultFine; wonderful, but 
defaultyou have already admitted that the loophole exists
default. It is surely in the interests of the decent side of the business to close that loophole. 
defaultIt is also within your area of action to ensure 
defaultthat 
defaultyour memb
defaulters do not operate in that way. 
defaultI repeat my question: what will you do 
defaultto ensure that the loophole that you say exists is closed from the 
defaultperspective
default of your membership
default?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: 
defaultWith regard to the worst cases, w
defaulte have reported thos
defaulte organisations to the Ministry
default&#xa0;
defaultof
default&#xa0;
defaultJustice
default. 
defaultIt comes back to 
defaultthe fact that those companies are not regulated by a regulator that covers consumer credit. This is where a lot of the problems occur. I
defaultf you go on
default 
defaultto the 
defaultinternet, 
defaultthe first 
defaultfew pages of websites are lead-generators; they are 
defaultnot lenders
default. That is how consumers get confused.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Why do you not simply get your members to outlaw the 
defaultpractice?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: 
defaultIn what way do you mean?
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultIn terms of referrals. Why do you not simply say, “It 
defaultis outside o
defaultf the remit of this association; if you are a member of this association, we do not think you should be involved in that particular process”?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault:
default I am talking about acquisitions.
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultI am talking about something else.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault:
default I am not talking about referrals.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultI want you to recognise that y
defaultou are a trade body and have
default some role in policing the well
defaultbeing of the trade
default. 
defaultYou have admitted 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a loophole in terms of the referral system
default. 
defaultWhy do you not 
defaulttake action and ensure your members are not involved in 
defaultany referrals, so that we know 
defaultthat 
defaultthe company we are dealing with does not pass information 
defaulton 
defaultto companies that do not act as credibly as 
defaultyour members do?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: It happens in every market. This 
defaultis not specifically about payday lending
default. I have already made the point twice: e
defaultverybody has their own unique underwriting criteria.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default You are being very evasive. Why do you not simply say that you can or cannot act as a better regulator, as an association, 
defaultin this respect?
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: 
defaultAs I have said before, w
defaulte are not a regulator
default; we are a trade association.
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultI think w
defaulte have probably pursued this line
default. 
defaultWe understand 
defaultyou are not taking responsibility for that, and we may wish to comment on that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default You were asked by my colleague, 
defaultAnn
default&#xa0;
defaultMcKechin, about the OFT and censure. O
defaultnly QuickQuid said 
defaultthat they had to change the criteria for rollover 
defaultprocedures
default. To Adam and Henry, have you had 
defaultto 
defaultchange anything since the OFT investigation into your businesses?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultWe did change the rollover process after the OFT investigation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultSo the OFT investigation found that 
defaultyo
defaultu were basically behaving badly and you had to change.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultNo, it was not badly. 
defaultNo
default 
defaultone 
defaultactually 
defaulttold us what to do at any point
default, so I would not say we behaved badly. We did what we did as a business. 
defaultAt the beginning, we were assessing people on 
defaultaffordability over two or three months, because that is what we were doing. T
defaulthe OFT 
defaultca
defaultme in and 
defaultsaid, “You have to do it on your own merits. If someone wants to 
defaultroll ove
defaultr, at the
default point of rolling over 
defaultyou have to assess their affordability then.”
defaultWe spent a lot of money on 
defaultsystem changes and 
defaultstaff 
defaulttraining
default,
default and we changed our process
default. One of the options is, “I am in financial difficulty and cannot afford to repay in full”. That is literally an option on a drop
default&#x2011;
defaultdown
default menu. 
defaultAs soon as that happens, we will not 
defaultroll over that customer. We will put them on a frozen
default&#x2011;
defaultinterest payment plan and work with them over a month, three months, six months or a year—whatever works for them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Is that the onl
defaulty change you were asked to make by the OFT?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: There were about 30
default. Some were tiny text changes. We had to make our representative APR
default slightly bigger
default. I have to say that I was surprised at the opening comment, because I think the 
defaultOFT have done 
defaultquite a good job. 
defaultI have seen people exit the market that should exit the market
default. I am all for regulation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultCould you let the Committee have those 30 things you have had to change?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes, of course, 
defaultif I am allowed to share
default them
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultHenry, did you have to make any changes following the OFT report?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultCan I just make 
defaultone comment?
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultBefore you make it, could you say whether you had to make any changes? 
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultYes, w
defaulte 
defaulthad to make a number of changes to our website.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultWhat were those changes?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultThey were about more disclosure. There were some issues about the size of the APR on various 
defaultpages
default. 
defaultMost of the OFT work with us was more on 
defaultthe information-gathering side, i.e. they 
defaultwanted to 
defaultunderstand more about how we do certain things, which was very helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultI understand what they wanted to understand, but what were the changes they asked you to make?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultWe had to highlight risk factors slightly higher up on our home page, and other things like that.
default&#xa0;defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default 
defaultW
defaultill you let us have 
defaultthose changes that you made?
defaultChairdefault:default Could you submit, in written evidence, details of the changes that you had to make, arising from the 
defaultOFT?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultYes. A
defaultssuming 
defaultthat 
defaultthe OFT is happy with that
default, of course
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultStill on the issue of rollovers, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine, you described a rather benign process where 
defaultyou would not have dreamt of having rollovers if it was not for customer demand. There is a question here, is there not? Actually, a
defaultt the point where people are unable to pay, you do no
defaultt need to roll over their loan, doubling their interest and imposing a punitive penalty charge. You have an option of sitting down with them and saying, “You are clearly in financial difficulty. Shouldn’t we 
defaultnegotiate an afford
defaultable repayment plan?”
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultFirst of all, we do not double their interest. 
defaultPeople can choose to extend
default; we do not force them to extend and always credit-check them again before approving an extension. 
defaultLess than 
defaultone in 15 people ever do. In the majority of cases like that, people are able to reschedule their debt and make an online repayment. 
defaultFor some people, an extension suits them 
defaultbetter. It may be that they are getting the money.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultIn what way are they suited by having a penalty charge for rolling over their loan?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: It may be that we have people who are sole traders, who are 
defaultgetting the money next week, 
defaultwho would rather pay us and delay payment for a few days rather than go on to a 
defaultrepayment plan.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Do you perhaps understand why people are 
defaultmore likely to listen to the OFT’s concern that a 
defaulthigh
defaulter
default proportion of profitability 
defaultin your business actually 
defaultcomes from
default rolled-over loans than those that are repaid within the
default original terms?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultI agree. One of the—the number of the—
defaultPaul Blomfield:default You agree with that.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultNo. T
defaulthe OFT’s point was 
defaultthat in some cases 50% of revenue wa
defaults derived from rollovers
default. In Wonga’s case, because only one in 15 ever roll over—
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine, you keep trying to distinguish Wonga from the rest of the sector.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultI can only answer on behalf of Wonga.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultYou certainly can. 
defaultWhy were you 
defaultcensured by the OFT as well, then?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultOn rollovers? We were not.
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultNo, but in general, in terms of your business model and your conduct. 
defaultHenry Rainedefault:
default 
defaultWe were not censured. No 
defaultone has been censured by the OFT
default. We have been asked to make various changes. 
defaultThe 50 t
defaultop lenders were all visited by the OFT. All of us have been asked to make changes. It is not a case of censure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultNo, but your practice was criticised.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: No, we were asked to make changes to various things.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultPresumably, that was because your practice was not 
defaultsufficiently good
default,
default i
defaultn terms of the OFT’s assessment in the first place.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultThat is an open issue that we still have with them. But m
defaultany of the changes they recommended 
defaultwere not about censure; they were about making things clearer for customers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultTo go back to my original point, y
defaultou are saying that rollovers are there to assist the customer
default. 
defaultWould it not be 
defaultof more assistance to a customer in financial crisis to sit down and say, “You are in difficulty; let’s have an affordable repayment plan,” rather than punitive additional interest and a penalty charge?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: 
defaultOf course we agree with that, which is why we have a whole hardship plan.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default It is not what you do, is it? 
defaultHenry Rainedefault: Less than 
defaultone in 15
default people ever get an extension from Wonga
default. The vast majority of people who cannot pay back their loan move on to a repayment plan. 
defaultThere are some people 
defaultfor whom an extension obviously works, and that is a 
defaultsmall minority
default.
defaultIf I may say so, i
defaultn terms of rollov
defaulters and extensions, Wonga is in a very different position from the rest of the sector. 
defaultI cannot answer on behalf of the 
defaultrest of the sector.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultMay I jump in? Just because someone rolls over a loan, it does not mean that they are in financial difficulties. It is circumstantial.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Do you think they 
defaultwould voluntarily want to take on the punitive additional charges if they were able to afford to repay?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: It is like a cred
defaultit card. You get a credit card bill through for £500. In that month you have had to buy some food and clothes, so
default you cannot clear your credit card
default. You are going to pay £250 plus interest. 
defaultJust because someone rolls over a loan, it does not mean 
defaultthat 
defaultth
defaultey are in financial difficulty.
defaultThis is on behalf of Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultLender. 
defaultIf that customer 
defaultis saying, “I cannot afford to pay this loan in full this month or next month, because I have 
defaultlost my job,
default” we are 
defaultnot going to roll over that loan
default. We are not going to charge any interest. There will be no more fees.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultWhat about Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultLender’s friends?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Exactly, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultMay
default I press
default all of you
default on the issue of rollovers
default? The FCA are proposing a limit of two rollovers. Do you agree with that: simply yes or no?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultIt is detrimental to the consumer. You need to give the consumer the option. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Would the option of an affordable repayment plan not be better?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: It is circumstantial and you cannot predict your circumstances in the future.
default 
defaultThey might need
default one, two or three months, where they are low on cash, to pay it back. J
defaultust because someone has rolled over, 
defaultit does not mean they cannot pay capital towards their loan as well. They do not have to pay you the interest. They might say, “Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultLender, we are g
defaultoing to pay you £50 capital and the pro rata interest.” It is not an additional charge; it is pro rata interest.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default If you roll over a £100 payday loan just three times, you are paying about 
default£120 in interest alone
default. In what way is that in the interest of the consumer?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultIt is £75, actually. It is £25 per £100. If it is a good customer and they are our friends, it is £20—it is £20, £20, £20, which is £60.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultI have allowed you to distract me, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman. My question is whether 
defaultyou each accept
defaulted
default the 
defaultrecommendation of the FCA for a two
default&#x2011;
defaultrollover limit. Your answer was no, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFreeman. What do other members of the panel say?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultWe are looking at the 
defaultdata of our members
default’ customers. As I said, t
defaulthe average loan there is 41 days
default. 
defaultWe have not 
defaultreached a position yet, but there is an 
defaultindication that 
defaulttwo 
defaultrollovers may be 
defaultan option.
defaultGreg Stevensdefault: The figure is arbitrary; we do not know how they have arrived at it. Obviously, we are in the middle of the consultation
default&#x2011;
defaultresponse
default period, and we are asking for more information. Our view has been the same right the way through: in 
defaultcertain cases, one rollover is too many
default. It is about looking at affordability. Affordability is the question that should be asked, not the number of rollovers.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: 
defaultQuickQuid has a limit of two.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: T
defaulthis is 
defaultnot the big issue, frankly, in terms of how the industry needs to be regulated.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default If 
defaultthe limit of two is introduced, 
defaultwhat guarantees can you give and what procedures will you put in place to ensure that debt that might otherwise be rolled over is not 
defaultsimply repackaged as a new loan?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: In Wonga’s case, y
defaultou cannot get a new loan until you have paid off your old one
default. We will not be repackaging anything at all. You can check the website. Of course, the FCA will be able to investigate all of this so that it does not happen.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: The FCA’s guidance says that 
defaultthey are not just going to be a tick
default&#x2011;
defaultbox regulator
default. What they are saying is, “I
defaultf 
defaultthe outcome is bad, it does not matter how good your processes were.” That would fall into that bucket, and we would have to 
defaultdesign our 
defaultloan 
defaultproducts accordingly.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultThe consultation makes clear that this applies to rollovers and refinancing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultI would like to quote what the charter says about advertising, but it does not say anything about it at all. 
defaultCould I have your views on whether there should b
defaulte something about advertising in it?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultAs I said, t
defaulthe charter commitments are incorporated into a broad
defaulter code of practice that we use. I
defaultt requires the lenders to comply with all 
defaultof 
defaultthe marketing and advertising 
defaultlaws that exist. We work very closely with the Advertising
default&#xa0;
defaultStandards
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthority, and we have just 
defaultset up some workshop
defaults with them to work on how short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm lenders should be 
defaultmarketing and what their adverts should look like. 
defaultCustomers are in control of marketing, fo
defaultr example. They can opt out of marketing. 
defaultWe will not 
defaultallow people to be spammed.
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultI will come on to marketing in a minute; I am talking about advertising.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultThe other point to make about adverts is that n
defaultobody buys directly from an advert
default. 
defaultAn advert will 
defaultdirect you to a website, and there is a lot of information—all of the information you need.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultYou will be directed to a website, 
defaultwhich the OFT has described 
defaultlike this: “Most websites made claims we consider 
defaultpotentially misleading
default”. The information on the website is not going to be the best.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault:
default The OFT report was some time ago. A
defaults 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultRaine has pointed out, he has made changes to his website and, as the other lenders have pointed out, 
defaultthey have
default made changes to their website. They look very different to when that report was written.
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultThere are no more examples of things like, “No credit checks,” or, “No credit, no problem,” or, “Loan guaranteed, no questions asked”.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default None of you would have 
defaultanything like that on your website. There are still things out there like that, are there not?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultThere absolutely are. 
defaultWhen we find them, we report them to the regulator.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultI have had a look at particular websites this morning. The OFT talked about
default 
defaultone of the most misleading things being
default the promise of
default money within a very short time, which effectively was a marketing ploy. All 
defaultthree of the companies represented today 
defaultadvertise
default, in quite prominent places on all three, the fact 
defaultthat loans can be made 
defaultwithin 
defaultfive or 10 
defaultminutes
default.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: That is from approval
default. 
defaultIf someone 
defaultcomes in to apply for a loan and they require manual checking, it might take us three hours to 
defaultclear them
default. 
defaultThe five minutes is indicating 
defaultfrom the time that they are approved.
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultAbsolutely, so let us look at the QuickQuid website, where, 
defaultin 
defaultthe largest text, at the top, it says, “Cash sent within 10 minutes after approval” 
defaultand there is a little 
defaultstrange symbol beside it. If we go down to the FlexCredit part, it says, “Get cash sent within 10 minutes of approval”, and there is the same strange symbol. It says, “Short-term loans, g
defaultet cash sent 
defaultwithin 10 minutes after approval”, and there is another symbol. You have to go right down to the bottom and look in really small text,
default in the midst of 
defaultlots of other little symbols, to find out what that means. Is that a 
defaultfair way of portraying things?
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: Our responsibility is to do the credit checks
default. 
defaultSome of the credit 
defaultchecks are done quickly; some customers have red flags in the approval process, which means they remain there for manual processing.
default 
defaultThis is something we have to do.
default 
defaultIt is accurate of our processes.
default 
defaultI am not going
default to say the OFT approved that; it 
defaultwas one of the things that we changed in light of the OFT review.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultWe are talking about speed of delivery there. 
defaultWhen you are transferring money 
defaultelectronically, you can do it 
defaultvery quickly
default. If you apply for a credit card, the 
defaultapplication process 
defaultwould 
defaultbe as long as 
defaultif you were applying for a short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm loan. The difference would be that you have to wait a few weeks for your 
defaultcredi
defaultt card to come through, as opposed to lenders, who are able to transfer money directly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default For all three of the companies represented here, which you are saying are at the better end of the scale of 
defaultpayday lenders, the speed of getting the money is a major 
defaultselling point.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: That is the value of the product
default. In fact, the London
default&#xa0;
defaultMutual
default&#xa0;
defaultcredit
default&#xa0;
defaultunion has just invested in technology in order to be able to get money into people’s accounts quickly, 
defaultrecognising that
default,
default if you need to get your washing machine repaire
defaultd or you need a short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm loan urgently, you do not 
defaultwant to wait to apply for a credit card, because you need the money now. It is what the circumstances demand, and that is why even the 
defaultcredit unions are 
defaultrecognising that this is a need of the customer and a value of the loan.
defaultChairdefault:default It is completely misleading to make a comparison with credit unions, where you have to be a member
default and there will be 
defaultsome record of that person’s creditworthiness and credit history, 
defaultcompared to the approach that is used by payday lenders
default. 
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: 
defaultNo. C
defaultredit unions do not 
defaultdo the level of checks that we do. Some of them do have longer
default&#x2011;
defaultterm relationships with customers, but, with respect, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultChairman, I was not making that point
default. I was making the point that t
defaulthe process of delivery 
defaultof the product, based on speed, is something the credit unions—
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultW
defaultith respect to you, I do not think the process of delivery is really the 
defaultissue at stake. It is the lack of examination of creditworthiness there and the use of this that is made 
defaultin marketing.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: The question was
default, “How quickly after approval can the money go into the account?” That is 
defaultwhat the lenders advertise.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: 
defaultWhen the OFT came to us earlier in the year, this was one of the main things they said. I would not say it was their recommendation, but everything forward
default&#x2011;
defaultfacing was 
defaultbeing audited. We have got to a place where we have been told
default that 
defaultthis is what we are allowed to put across. We
default are only doing what we are allowed to do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultWe are running over quite a bit. I will try to keep my questions short, but if you could keep your answers even shorter, that would be great. 
defaultObviously, 
defaultwith 
defaultusing the speed of getting the money as a tool to draw people in comes the recommendation or regulation that you have to promote the APR as prominently as you possibly can.
default 
defaultLooking at Wonga’s website this morning, it is there: 5,853% APR.
default 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultLender, you manage to beat that with 4,849% APR.
default 
defaultInterestingly
default, QuickQuid, you need to have a serious look at your website, because the page which launches and fills the window is not actually the full page. To get to the point where you see the APR, you have to resize.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: What is the system of that device that you are using?
defaultMike Crockart:default It is an iPad. It is a fairly well-used thing you might have heard of.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: You have not asked the lenders how much the customer has to pay, because I think that is probably more important than the APR.
defaultMike Crockart:default The regulation is to do with the promotion of the APR, so that is what I am dealing with at the moment.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: Our intention with putting it on the side there is that it would be easy for the customer to see, because there are devices that cut off the bottom. If you put it on the bottom, people do not see it. That was placed there for prominence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default It is not, then, a deliberate attempt to hide it from customers.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: No. Every time that I have seen that screen, that is right there, rather than having to pan down to the bottom, which is more common, especially on handheld devices.
defaultMike Crockart:default Perhaps I can show you this afterwards and you can take it away and deal with it.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: No, I trust what you are saying.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default If we can turn then to the calling that you do, which is a particular interest of mine, first of all looking at existing customers, do you follow any guidelines? You have the right to phone them. You have a relationship with them. It is a first-party consent that you will have received from them. Do you have any guidelines about the way in which you contact them, the number of calls that you make over a period of time, or where you phone them? We have heard some fairly horrendous stories about people being hounded by large numbers of calls, sometimes made to places of work. Do you have guidelines that you follow about the contact that you have with your customers?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Again, since the OFT—we were quite good beforehand—if we phone a customer and the customer says, “Do not phone me at work,” we will not phone the customer at work again—period. We are not allowed to. It is treating the customer fairly. If a customer says, “Do not call me at work,” we will say, “Do you have an alternative number?” or an e-mail address or something, but we are not allowed to contact that customer at work again.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default What about the number of calls that you would make to them?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: We would only need to say 
defaultthat once, would we not?
defaultMike Crockart:default No, I mean generally, not about phoning them at work.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: You would only need to say it once to the customer, so I do not know how many times they have to phone.
default 
defaultIt is probably once or twice; I do not know.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Again, we had some fairly horrendous stories about people being phoned 10 times a day to be chased for payments.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes, but we would not phone someone 10 times a day.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default That is why I am asking. Do you have any guidelines?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes, treating the customer fairly. That is not fair, so we would not do that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Treating the customer fairly can be taken to mean a number of different things. Do you have guidelines?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes, we have policies and guidelines
default in place, of course. I can send those to you as well afterwards, because I think they will be quite helpful.
defaultMike Crockart:default That is great.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: We do not 
defaulthave people’s employment details.
default 
defaultWe do not have a way of contacting them at work.
default 
defaultThere are regulations, which I am afraid I am not entirely on top of, that we follow about when you can call people, what times during the day you can call them, and what happens.
default 
defaultThe vast majority of our interaction is online with customers, because that is how they have come to us, so we do not have a lot of phone contact.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default When you say that there
default are guidelines, are you talking about your guidelines or the guidelines of someone else?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: No, the debt collection guidance of the OFT, which we all follow. I am afraid I do not know it, but it is all part of our systems, and I suspect the other lenders’ too. That stipulates how you can contact people and how often, and also, I think, only in certain hours of the day. If people are being contacted by lenders or by representatives outside those hours, then it is clearly in breach of the OFT guidelines, but, as I say, we do not do it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default If I can turn to generating new customers, what do you do in terms of cold-calling? Do any of your organisations cold-call to find new customers?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: No.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Do you use lead-generators to come up with new customers?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default You cold-call by proxy, then, effectively.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: No, we never cold-call. We never cold-call new business.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default If you are using lead-generators, you are effectively cold-calling, but getting somebody else to do the hard work.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: No, not at all. This is all online. Sorry, maybe there is confusion. This is online lead generations, where someone has gone to a broker’s website and applied for a loan, and we have purchased that lead. That customer knows they are a Mr Lender customer. It is not a cold call. We know that they are a customer. We can facilitate them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default May I just suggest, where you have guidelines, can you send them to the Committee for them to examine, and we can make a judgment on them?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Definitely.
defaultMr Binley:default Sorry, Mr Chairman, may I add: we do not want your rules; we want your talk guides as they appear on the screen and we want continuation lines.
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Yes, of course.
defaultChair:default If we are not satisfied with what they cover, then we will come back to you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Do you use texts in your marketing, to new or existing customers?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: We would never randomly text somebody, “Do you need a loan? Come to Mr Lender.” No, we have never purchased lists or done anything like that.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: We do not text people as a way of getting business. The day before payment date, we will use a text to text them to say, “Just to remind you that your money is due,” so it is not a PPI-type situation where we are all getting texts the whole time. We do not do any of that.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: You would have to opt in to receive texts from us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default On that issue, you will know that, on “Newsnight” last night, there was an example of somebody, I think, being texted for a loan during the course of an evening. Are you saying that that does not apply to Wonga?
defaultHenry Rainedefault: Yes. I am sorry; I did not see “
defaultNewsnight
default” but no, as far as I am aware—if I am wrong, I will confirm to the Committee—we do not do text-marketing.
defaultChair:default I think that needs to be clarified, and if you could send evidence that would clarify that, I think the Committee would be grateful.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: I can confirm it or not.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default I just want to talk about what the current industry practice is around continuous payment authorities. We had a bit of a discussion earlier on about the 3% who default and whether they were the people who were caused real pain. Some of the evidence we have seen is that it is people who have money taken through continuous payment authority who suffer the real pain and who have, therefore, defaulted on their mortgage or been unable to pay a utility bill. My first question is: why do you use continuous payment authorities rather than other forms of payment?
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: The simple answer is that, with a continuous payment authority, if a customer has a failed payment, they do not have any penalty. Their bank is not going to charge them a fee. If you use a BACS payment or a cheque, and that is returned, the customer is charged a fee. That is the primary reason why a continuous payment authority is a good thing for the customer for collections.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default Are you aware of any better alternatives to a continuous payment authority?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: I do not think there is. If you do it properly, it is a good way and it works. I think it is the best way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default For the lenders or for the customer?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: Both—for the consumer. I think there is a massive misunderstanding about CPA. There is a technical issue there, going back to the roots of Visa. You cannot just dip into someone’s account and take 50 lots of £5 to get £250 from them on a day when the loan is not due, so I think there is a big misunderstanding or misconception of what CPA actually is. It is a date where you agree with the customer to take a payment from them. As long as you are transparent with that, it is perfect for the product, and both the consumer and the lender, if used properly.
defaultAndy Lapointedefault: You can cancel a CPA at any time. We have a 24/7 call centre, which is open 365 days a year. You can call them up and they will cancel it at your demand. You can also cancel it by e-mail at our company, so it is not something where people are just stuck or trapped using it. They do receive a notice ahead of time that we are going to be debiting, so it should not be a surprise and it does give them the option to cancel.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default Are you confident that customers are pre
default&#x2011;
defaultnotified, do know when money is going to be taken and have an opportunity to contact you?
defaultAdam Freemandefault: I do not think it is about the CPA; it is about the transparency. This is going to be a bit of a problem with the FCA as well, because I think they are preliminarily saying you can have two CPAs. Personally, I think that is detrimental to the borrower, because you do not know when a borrower is going to get paid their money. They might say that, on 31 October, they are going to earn an income of £1,500. You do not know whether that company is going to pay them at 1 o’clock in the morning or 3 o’clock in the morning; you do not know. If you try to take that money from the customer at, say, 1 o’clock in the morning and it fails, you cannot then, with what the FCA are putting out there initially, try to get that money from the customer, so that customer is now going to become a defaulting customer because you cannot take the money from the customer.
defaultThis is why there is confusion with the CPA. If I tried 10 times that day to get £250 from that customer as £250, what is the difference to the customer? There is no detrimental effect to them. It is not costing them anything. It is not costing us. I have said, ‘On this date, 31 October, I am going to take £250 from you.’ Why should it be that they are the ones that cop out from that because the FCA have said you only get one attempt, and I try at 3 in the morning? A percentage of our customers will not get paid until the following day, because they work for a small company with one person on payroll who is off ill. They are now a defaulting customer. Do we report them to the credit reference agencies as a default? There is a large grey area. We will never—and never have done—go into an account and take seven lots of £50. We will take £350 or we will take the interest amount. I think that is an area that really needs to be looked upon and studied properly, because it is more detrimental to the consumer than the lender.
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: If there are insufficient funds for priority debts like mortgages or rent or council tax, or things like that, the lender will not go into the account. If they do go into the account and it has caused somebody difficulty like that, there is the option to refund. If it is proven that it has put someone in financial difficulty, they will refund the money immediately.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Has that happened?
defaultRebecca Harris:default Yes, has that happened in practice?
defaultRussell Hamblin-Boonedefault: Yes, that happens in practice. We asked customers a slightly different question to recent surveys. We asked them, “Did the lender explain to you how your bank details would be used to take the money from your account?” 85% of those people said that that was a clear explanation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Very quickly, on the Chair’s point, the industry’s code says very clearly that if people do get into financial difficulties as a result of a CPA, you will refund them. You said that happens. Would it be possible for you all to furnish the Committee with detailed information of how often that happens? We have all, in our constituency surgeries, had lots of examples of people who have presented with problems as a result of CPA administration. If you could all give us full details of how often you have refunded customers and how often your members have refunded customers as a result of financial difficulties they have created.
defaultHenry Rainedefault: Of course. I think the issue there also is about them contacting the lender. Clearly, that is the other thing, which is why we work very closely with a lot of the debt-advice charities, because they have to make contact with the lender to establish that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We will be talking to them. May I thank you for answering our questions? May I just emphasise that we could probably have spent three hours on this session? We have been constrained by time. It is almost certain that we will want to table supplementary questions to you, and we would welcome your responses and we will take them into account before we do our Report with its recommendations. Equally, I am conscious of the fact that you may feel that you have not had the opportunity to answer in full every question that has been put to you; feel free to submit anything in terms of supplementary evidence. I would say, anyway, that you can do this but I would emphasise that a number of issues have been raised where we have not felt that you have had the evidence that this Committee would require to come to a robust conclusion, and we would expect you to provide that evidence as we requested.

default 
defaultGillian Guydefault, Chief Executive, Citizens Advice, 
defaultMartin Lewisdefault, moneysavingexpert.com, 
defaultPeter Tuttondefault, Head of Policy, StepChange, and 
defaultRichard Lloyddefault, Executive Director, Which?, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good morning, and thank you for agreeing to address the Committee’s questions. I apologise for having you in rather later than intended, but I felt it was important to explore some of the issues with the previous panel. Could I just, first of all, ask you to introduce yourself for voice transcription purposes, starting with you, Gillian?
defaultGillian Guydefault: Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: Martin Lewis of moneysavingexpert.com.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: Peter Tutton, Head of Policy at StepChange Debt Charity.
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: Richard Lloyd, Executive Director of Which?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ112 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are short of time, so do not feel that all of you have to answer every question, if you feel that the issue has been covered by another speaker. I am going to start with a general principle: are you against payday loans in principle or just the way they work? Who would like to lead on that?
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: I am happy to kick off on that, if colleagues agree. I am not against people having access to short-term emergency loans that are provided on the basis of proper affordability checks and where the cost of that is absolutely clear and fair. People do need and often say to us that they sometimes are in need of that kind of credit. They are sometimes able to manage that credit properly and it is not a problem. It is for the vast majority of people for whom payday lending is a problem—in our surveys, half—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ113 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Okay. I just wanted to establish your general position on this. You will get plenty of chance to elaborate.
defaultGillian Guydefault: I absolutely agree with Richard, but what we do not agree with is that people are force-fed this opportunity when it is not necessarily the solution to their problems, and they should be directed towards debt advice.
defaultChair:default Thank you, but you agree that there is a place in the market for them.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: They struggle to have a place. The advertising, marketing, operational structures, cost and the inappropriate way they are sold are all problems for me. People often say, “There is a time for a payday loan.” I find that very difficult when there are not alternative, cheaper forms of credit. There are two big problems, if we divide it this way: first of all, there are many people who take payday loans when they do not know how they will repay them in a month. If you do not know how you will repay it in a month, it is not for you, so let us wipe those people out first of all, or get rid of those; that is quite easy.
defaultPoint No. 2: the people who take payday loans and can repay them in a month. My suggestion—forgive me sounding a bit daytime television, but that is what I do—is you get a credit card, even a horrible 56% interest credit card. You put it in a bowl of water and put it in your freezer. Then, when you need it, you are going to have to smash it open, and if you pay that back in a month, which is what payday lenders want, you do not pay any interest on it, so it is interest-free. So when you ask me to answer, on a nerdy basis, “On what occasions is a payday loan the right choice for someone?” I struggle to give you a right answer. So do we really need them? I think we would all be a lot better off without them, and maybe it is worth the sacrifice for the small number of people who do find them rather convenient.
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: Could I just add, Chair, there are some credit unions that are now offering payday loans, so we need to be focused on the product—not necessarily the institution but the behaviour of the different kinds of lenders that are offering short-term, high-cost credit.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ114 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default There are a variety of opinions there but, in effect, Richard, there is a role for them but the process is what is wrong. Would that be a reasonable summary?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: If you take 100 people who get payday loans—and I am making the number up—I would suspect 99% of them would find a cheaper and better alternative doing something else or not doing them. The problem is they are used by far too many people and they are not fit for the purpose they are being used for.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ115 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default There has been concern raised about the increasing number of people seeking debt advice after taking out payday loans. What does this reflect, do you think? Is it just the 
defaultincrease in the number of people seeking them, changes within the industry, failure of the charter that the industry introduced, or what?
default 
defaultWho would like to lead on that?
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: We have seen really explosive growth in the number of people seeking help, who have got payday loans amongst their other debts as well.
default 
defaultIt is not just about the growth of the market.
default 
defaultAccording to the OFT figures, the market has grown about double in the last four years; the number of people we are seeing with
default payday loan debts has grown eightfold, so we are seeing a much bigger growth in the problem than just the growth of the market
default. 
defaultAs well as that, we are seeing more people with multiple payday loan debts, and the size of their payday loan debts getting bigger
default. 
defaultThe average pa
defaultyday loan debt of a StepChange Debt C
defaultharity client is now 
default£16,000. Their average income is £12,000. The problem is irresponsible lending and ineffective affordability checking.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ116 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You have partly answered my question
default. You said that, in effect, d
defaultebts have increased hugely, but 
defaultso has the number of people applying. How far would you say, in rough terms,
default that
default is
default a change in the increasing levels of poverty, or the marketing of payday loans companies
default? Could you give any sort of weighting to that?
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: It is hard to di
defaultsentangle the two. Certainly, the people we are
default seeing
default are poorer, and lots of households are struggling. The question there, to turn it a bit,
default 
defaultis, “I
defaults the payday lending industry, in a sense, taking advantage of people
default who are struggling and in financial difficulty?” Our evidence suggests that they are. For instance, people we see with payday loan debts are more likely to have debts with council tax, rent arrears
default and 
defaultfuel bills. So, far from being emergency cash to get people through a period of financial difficulty, what we are seeing is that payday loans put people on a cycle of using high-cost credit
default to make ends meet
default. It
default makes the problem worse
default and worse and worse. 
defaultIn a sense, people are 
defaultin a hole, and a payday loan is helping them dig that hole deeper.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ117 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Very briefly,
default I want to know whether 
defaultyou think there is a connection between payday loans and
default the more unsavoury area of
default business, and whether that connection operates 
defaultthr
defaultough what they call “friends.” We know, on one website, they talk about, “If we cannot service you, we have friends who might be able to”. Does that connection disturb you, or should we not bother too much about it?
defaultGillian Guydefault: I think we have to bother about 
defaultany situation that is exploiting people’s difficulty. At Citizens Advice, we have seen a ten
defaultfold growth in the number of people coming to us
default in the last four years with payday-lending issues. 
defaultJust to hark back to t
defaulthe previous point, that is people who are already in debt, so they are topping up their debt. They are trying to pay off 
defaulttheir debt by further credit, as opposed to getting adv
defaultice to manage that. We do have concerns about people laying off details to others. If the
default risk is too high for one company, it may be th
defaultat they lay them off elsewhere, and then the concern we have is exacerbated about how those people are treated, because t
defaulthey then fall under the radar 
defaultand we are not necessarily monitoring how those people are doing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ118 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultThat is my concern. 
defaultIs there a con
defaultnection with loan 
defaultsharking
default in given localities
default?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: 
defaultI am not sure any of us necessarily have that data, but t
defaulthe problem 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have here is
default that
default we hav
defaulte a desert of regulation. When you have a desert of regulation, and when it is so easy to get a licence to do this and set up a one-man band to do it, then the slippage
default—
defaultthe read-acr
defaultoss towards loan sharks
default—
defaulti
defaults not that far away. Of course, we are not talking here about the big, high-budget advertising companies that you have probably just
default taken evidence from
default. 
defaultThey have their own ra
defaultft of problems, but we are talking about the one
default­
defaultman-band lack of regulation. We have been given a glass of water
default in the form of w
defaulthat the FCA is doing next April. It should be welcomed, but
default 
defaulti
defaultt is
default a glass of water, not an oasis, to continue my analogy. We need a lot more.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ119 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Jus
defaultt picking up on that, and taking it in a direction back to the people we took evidence from
default—
defaultsome of the bigger players
default—
defaultthis question is really for the whole panel, but Martin is an entrepreneur and
default understand
defaults
default some of these business models
default. 
defaultThey claim that they do everything in their power to
default try to ensure people are not effectively borrowing from different sources, and be
default as 
defaultrigorous as 
defaultpossible
default at the moment in the process
default, and the reason 
defaultthat 
defaultthey claim that is
default that
default it is not in
default their interest to have the 3% of people who are in pain, who end up failing
default to pay
default. 
defaultWould yo
defaultu say that claim is legitimate? Can I put it to you that actually it is part of their business model and they do not really care that much about
default that 2% or 3%, and
default therefore
default that model still churns out lots of profit, lots of cash, even though 
defaultthey get a number
default—
defaultwhatever it was we had them admit
default; 40,000, in Wonga’s terms
default—
defaultof 
defaultpeople who do get in real difficulty and real pain
default? A
defaultre they being serious about their intention,
default or is it just part of the business model anyway, that they take this on?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: W
defaulte have to 
defaultdifferentiate between wanting to lend to people who will not repay you, and wanting to lend to people who cannot afford to repay you but
default will repay
default you. 
defaultThat is the subtle difference
default. Yes, 
defaultI fundamentally 
defaultbelieve they do not want to lend to people who will not pay them their money back. That would be a very
default stupid
default thing for them to do, and I believe that 
defaultthey do their best to 
defaultensure that that does not happen. 
defaultI am not convinced of the
default ethics of the model
default. You called me an entrepreneur; I might have to clean myself afterwards, having been put in
default an analogy with that type of entrepreneurship
default. It is not something I would ever dream of doing. 
defaultI am not 
defaultsure of the ethics of that model, and saying, “We do everything we can,” is a bit like 
defaultme saying I will do everything I can in a fight against Mike Tyson to beat him
default. I know I will not. I know the information is not out there. I will say, “I will do what I can, in this nice easy marketplace where
default credit scoring is not being done
default and we do not have real-time data. 
defaultWe 
defaultare not able to find out where you have 
defaultborrowed through somebody else, and we do not have that much detail on you, but I will f
defaultind out what I can
default.” 
defaultI think it is a nice, easy answer 
defaultto say, “We are doing what we can”, and I suspect they are within that bracket.
defaultGillian Guydefault: 
defaultI would like to take some difference with that, in a sense, because 
defaultI do not think that we can 
defaultsustain an argument that these people are doing what they can. T
defaulthey are not in the art of the possible
default. 
defaultThey are doing 
defaultwhat they feel they want to do in order to make their business model work. Our evidence comes from a 
defaulttracker survey
default that
default we carried out of 3,000 people to date, and that 
defaultwas from 
defaultwhen the voluntary code came into being
default. According to that
default—
defaultwhere, incidentally, 
defaultwe think 76% of those people 
defaulthad a case 
defaultfor a complaint 
defaultwith 
defaultthe Financial Services Ombudsman
default—
defaultover 60% of those people 
defaultdid not have adequat
defaulte affordability checks for their first loan, and when they sought extensions and rollovers, or had them forced upon them, 94
default% of them did not 
defaultthen 
defaulthave affordability check
defaults. To say, as we have heard on numerous occasions, that they have to fill in boxes online and therefore say whether they can afford it or not
default is not all that they can do
default. They can do a lot more.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ120 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default We had quite a bit of discussion about rollovers and whether they
default should be limited, and the industry were 
defaultquite keen to tell us that sometimes a rollover
default 
defaultcould be a very sensible, 
defaultrational decision by a borrower in ter
defaultms of their temporary ongoing need. What sort of information do you think we could provide that would
default distinguish between 
defaultwhat was 
defaulta rati
defaultonal decision by a borrower to take a rollover, and what was a sign that someone is in really serious
default debt problems?
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: That would be a more credible assertion for them to make if they were doing proper
default affordability checks at the outset
default. From our survey
default—
defaultwe
default have all done a lot of surveys on this
default—
defaulth
defaultalf the people 
defaultthat we have surveyed who have taken out
default 
defaultpayday loans said that they have taken out credit that they could not afford to repay. Now, i
defaultf they are not carrying out proper affordability checks, you have 
defaultgot 
defaultto 
defaultquestion whether, at the time at which someone requests a rollover, they are not simply compounding the problem. As Martin said, there is no real
default­
defaulttime data 
defaultsharing between high-cost credit lenders, and I think it just is not credible to 
defaultsuggest that they as lenders are somehow acting responsibly to allow people to roll over
default their loans
default. 
defaultThis is where the FCA are absolutely right to limit that nu
defaultmber, because the lenders have just proved with their behaviour
default—
defaultboth at the beginning of the term and at the time that people are requesting
default a rollover
default—
defaultthat they are not properly checking
default whether people can afford to manage that ongoing loan.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: The follow-up to what you are asking fits in with what you said before. I
defaultf you ask me to run a business and say
default, “How am I going to do this effectively to ensure that it is a rational consumer decision?” I am going to need to get on the phone with you or sit down and have a long conversation, like Citizens Advice or StepChange would do,
default about 
defaultyour affordability criteria and about 
defaultthe fact that you have £2,000
default definitely 
defaultcoming in
default, and you have a letter to prove it, so you are going to be able to repay it. 
defaultThat does not fit the business model of payday loans
default. They are never going to do that. That is just never going to work. It would not make financial sense with the
default amounts 
defaultthat we are talking about, so there is a real problem there. 
defaultYes, there is a point where 
defaultyou could decide whether it is reasonable to do a rollover, but how you do that within the business models that they have got—I am not sure I could see a way around it without increasing the 
defaultcost drastically.
defaultGillian Guydefault: 
defaultWhile we are talking about business models, b
defaultear in mind that a 
defaultlarge amount of the revenue comes from rollover. 
defaultIt would be counter
default-
defaultintuitive to 
defaultstop rollovers. Again, from the same survey of those 3,000 people, 70% of them said they were
default under pressure to take an extensio
defaultn or a rollover, as opposed to trying to find a way to perhaps go and get some advice and manage that debt out of being. W
defaulte do not think, from our evidence, that the incentive is there at all
default. Indeed, there is pressure to take on more debt, and no consideration as to whether the person can afford that. 
defaultWe have an exampl
defaulte of someone who took out £100 last Christmas, for example, and every month took a rollover until such time as
default £700
default was taken out of their account on a continuous payment authority. They cannot pay their rent, they cannot pay their council tax, and they have just come to see us.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: We have heard about affordability checks, but we see a gap between
default that and the reality. We heard that the average payday loan debt in the market was about £250, but for our clients
default—
defaultwho, on average, have abou
defaultt
default £10,000 
defaultof other debts as well
default—
defaultthe averag
defaulte they owe on an individual payday loan is over
default £500
default. 
defaultWhat we are seeing is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe people in the most financial dif
defaultficulty are being lent more to, rather than being checked. That is because those loans are getting bigger because of rollovers, fees and charges, and multiple loans. Of the 
defaultpeople we see with payday loans, nearly half have three or more payday loans
default. How, therefore, is there affordable checking going on consistently?
default              defaultChair:default 
defaultMay I interrupt? 
defaultWe are moving into areas that other 
defaultquestions are on. I would like the questioners to take the
default answers they have already received into accou
defaultnt, but equally, when answering, could you not repeat it subsequently, because we are very
default short of time
default? 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ121 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default W
defaulte 
defaultwere talking about the industry model and what is in their interest. In your experience
default—
defaultyou have seen people with debt problems, and we get them as MPs as well
default—
defaultdo you think this is across the board in the industry, or are 
defaultsome companies or groups of companies
default better than others
default? I do not want you to mention any names, but are some doing a better job than others?
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: Both things are going on
default. What you see
default—
defaultand this is typical in this and other credit industries, which often focus on people in financial difficulty
default—
defaultis
default problem
defaults
default rig
defaultht across the market, problems like multiple loans, lack of affordability checking, and people having money taken from their account through a CPA, leaving them not enough to live on. T
defaulthese are right across the sector
default. 
defaultIt is true that there is 
defaulta tail in the industry where there are really egregious practices, where we see
default default c
defaultharges massively inflate debts and 
defaultdebt collection practices that 
defaultwe thought we had got rid of 10 years ago. This is something that we see across credit markets, and it is one of the problems with regulation not working well. It is a systematic problem, but also, particularly in the tail of the market, there are some really roguish practices that have been allowed to go on for too long. 
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: The answer to your question is yes: there are 
defaultsome lenders who are better than others. I have a guide on my site to payday loans. It basically
default details all the th
defaultings you should do rather than getting a payday loan, and at the end, we have a section that I refuse to call “best buys.” We call it
default 
default“least worst lenders”;
default 
defaultit is the “least worst” section, and there are six lenders in there. 
defaultWe judge them on a number of 
defaultcriteria. Again, this is “least worst”: I do not want anyone to get them, and the whole article is actually designed to try to
default put people off gett
defaulting them. It is a decision tree, if you like. “Are they registered with the OFT?” We hope so. “Have they signed up to the good practice charter?” 
defaultIt is not pe
defaultrfect, it is not fully working, but it is better than nothing. “Do they do a credit check?” We
default have
default got
default six lenders 
defaultin 
defaultthere that do that. Some of the bigger lenders
default, if you are going to do it, are not as bad as some of the 
defaultnearly criminal lenders out there, but I still would not touch it. I will not swear, but i
defaultn an 
defaultindustry of baskets, some baskets are a little worse than the other baskets.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default 
defaultWe have touched on affordability in a lot of the questions, but I would like to ask the panel: h
defaultaving seen what the FCA is 
defaultproposing, having seen the various regulations and approaches from the OFT in the pipeline, are there
default 
defaultother affordability criteria that
default you think are essential to be taken int
defaulto account? I will come back to the question of multiple loans, because I think that is very important, but is there anything else in terms of the affordability of the loans that you would like to see as a check before people are allowed to take them out?
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: It would not be impossible
default. 
defaultThere is no reason why 
defaultthe lenders cannot do real-time data sharing to check people’s credit backgrounds. Martin was talking about whether lenders do a credit check; there are lenders that today, on their websites, are promoting their service as not requiring a credit check. It is
default extraordinary
default. 
defaultAs a minimum, 
defaultwe need to know
default the behaviour that is 
defaultgoing on. If the industry wants to demonstrate that it can behave responsibly, it needs to get itself in a position where in real-time, or at least in quick-time, it can do
default checks on whether people have got loans 
defaultwith other players within the industry. That 
defaultwould be a minimum
default. 
defaultThe FCA’s plan, more broadl
defaulty, is welcomed, but we want the FCA
default to go further
default. 
defaultWhat is the 
defaultproof that is being got of affordability, and particularly on the income side? Now,
default of course, this will slow down the granting of a loan, bu
defaultt surely that is the point. This
default needs to be done based on 
defaultcredible evidence that people can afford to repay it.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: I agree
default. 
defaultWe are
default looking at the FCA rules, and there are many that copy over from what the
default OFT have done
default. 
defaultNow, these are the responsible lending things that 
defaultare very high-level, and repeatedly we see in credit markets that high-level lending rules
default have not worked
default. 
defaultYou give 
defaultfirms some guidance, and then come back and look later. As well as real
default­
defaulttime data sharing, because these products have got such a short-term duration and the risk can build up so quickly, 
defaultmaybe the regulator also needs to be getting its 
defaultdata in real time so it can spot wrongdoing as it is happening and intervene, rather than coming back months or
default years later
default. 
defaultThe other thing is looking at how these
default products work. If the average income of our clients with a payday loan is about £1,250, can they
default afford to repay £500
default? 
defaultThat is nearly 
default50% of your net household income a 
defaultmonth
default. 
defaultHow is that affordable
default? 
defaultIf you have got people offering up to £1,000, there is 
defaulta question of how the regulator will ensure that those products are not unsuitable from the start, because they are such an amount of people’s income that people will never comfortably be able to 
defaultrepay
default it
default.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: I am not sure it quite counts within affordability, but one of my greatest concerns about payday lending is that people often think of this as a financial play. When the Archbishop came out and said we will have credit unions
default in churches, that is a wonderful thing, but it is not the same thing
default. 
defaultThis 
defaulti
defaults
default a technology play, in many cases; this is instantaneous mobile phone technology. This allows you, while you are pissed and want to gamble at 11.30 at night, to
default get a loan in half an hour
default. For me, within affordability is actually the personal responsibility of affordability. I
defaultt just needs to be slower
default. 
defaultIt needs to be slow
defaulter to allow time to reconsider, and while there is a cooling-off period you pay interest if you decide to change your mind, so you are effectively still getting the loan. W
defaultithin affordability, 
defaultyou have the controls that need to be put on the lender, but then, to allow the individual
default to take 
defaultsome more control of their own af
defaultfordability, the instantaneous, high-technology nature of the way these operate is very dangerous. It is a feeding mechanism, very close and akin to gambling
default, and there are many people who use them for gambling
default. I do not know whether that counts within your question.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default I think it is a useful point
default. Did you want to add anything from the CAB?
defaultGillian Guydefault: I was just going to reinforce the 
defaultpoint about proof. We have heard a lot about being able to tick boxes in
default technological ways of applying for loans, and they are never checked
default. 
defaultPeople are almost 
defaultencouraged to put the right answer in the box in order to get a loan. The business model
default itself, which preys o
defaultn rollover and the unaffordability inherent in that, needs much more
default focus from the regulator on just how secure those checks are
default. 
defaultThe other 
defaultpoint in the business model is that it is competition on speed. It is not competition on price or on any of the other points, and that really has to be taken out of that product.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default 
defaultI strongly agree with that. 
defaultComing back to this po
defaultint about multiple loans, I think, StepChange, you said that a third of your people who are coming to you about payday loans have 
defaultthree or more, which is an extraordinarily high proport
defaultion. Surely, that can be relatively straightforwardly dealt with through a central
default database of loans
default. We had a little bit of theological debate in the previous session as to whether it needs to be a central database of
default payday loans or all loans
default. 
defaultSurely, that is something that a relatively small charge on this sector could
default pay for, to be run by a regulator. Do you think that might be the way forward?
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: 
defaultIt seems a sensible way forward. 
defaultI remember, about two years ago, rep
defaultresentatives of payday lenders and consumer groups met with BIS
default across the road, and this was discussed
default. Now, t
defaulthere has been no movement since then, so 
defaultI think that for a while, the argument has been, “How do you know what other loans and other payday loans people have got? Surely you should have real-time data.” 
defaultThe industry
default, as you heard earlier,
default 
defaultis moving 
defaultextremely slow
defaultly towards that. I guess
default 
defaultw
defaulthat we need 
defaultnow is something to make them move much, much more quickly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default We heard evidence in the last session that 
defaultsome in the industry are spending a lot of money on credit data. Surely,
default if they are spending that individually, it would 
defaultperhaps 
defaultbe more efficient
default to spend it together as an industry and get that transparency across the board.
defaultGillian Guydefault: It depends on motivation, does it not? If the m
defaultotivation is to 
defaulttake the problems out of the industry and not put people into
default 
defaultspiralling 
defaultdebt and situations 
defaultthat 
defaultthey cannot afford, 
defaultthen 
defaulthow hard can it be?
default              defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default We 
defaultshall come on to advertising later, but as you say, this is competition about speed. If you look at the advertising, it is very much how quickly you can get money that is the selling point for a lot of these operations. Obviously, a lot of people that are looking to get a payday loan
default feel desperate, and they are not necessarily looking properly 
defaultat 
defaultall the i
defaultnformation about interest rates, which perhaps could be more prominent. However,
default 
defaulteven if we regulated to make it more prominent, it still will not necessarily be the main thing that people 
defaultwill look at. Do you think we need to regulate
default interest rates, and do 
defaultyou 
defaultthink 
defaultwe 
defaultnee
defaultd to have a maximum interest rate, which is something they do in other countries?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: I am not a fan of 
defaultan interest-
defaultrate
default cap. I always use the example that if we were in a pub and I said, “I will lend you 20 quid, but you buy me a pint next week,” and the pint cost £3, that i
defaults 
default143,000% APR. That shows that, on short-
defaultterm loans, APRs are not that re
defaultlevant. The one thing I like about APRs on payday loans is that it is the one thing
default that puts people off
default. I quite like that it is there, even though it is irrelevant, if I am really honest, and
default I admit the logical inconsistency in that
default. I like it because it puts people off. I am in favour of a total-cost cap.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just following up t
defaulthat point, if they were capped at a lower level, do you actually think there might be an increase in
default take
default-
defaultup of payday loans?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: I do not t
defaulthink it is about interest rates, and that is why I think you have to protect people from the cost. I am in favour of a total-
defaultcost cap
default. In very simple terms
default—
defaultand 
defaultI am not setting a number
default—
defaultif
default I 
defaultborrow £100 in total, including rollovers, fees,
default charges, everything, 
defaultI
default should not have to pay more than 
default£150. That is an explanation of the structure, not the actual cost I am looking to be set. I have not got
default that far yet, to be honest
default. That is a market-condition thing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default In effect, that is 
defaultregulating interest rates. It may not be a maximum cap.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: Technicall
defaulty, it is not. It is regulating
default cost
default. 
defaultIf you regulate 
defaultinterest rates and say, “100% interest rate”, what you are actually doing is regulating
default the term of the loan
default. 
defaultTherefore, you cannot lend over one day and ask 
defaultpeople to pay back the next day, but you can lend over a month, so you would actually elongate
default the loan term
defaults if you did it that way. It is a subtle difference, but it is not quite the same thing.
default              defaultChair:default 
defaultI think we understand.
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: 
defaultChair, 
defaultI have got a slightly different point of view on this 
defaultto Martin, and it is a nuance on what he has said. We think what gets people into difficulty the most is the fees and charges—that half of people that are borrowing, who I 
defaulttalked about earlier
default,
default that find that they cannot 
defaultafford to repay the original loan, are then late with a payment and get charged
default £25
default,
default and that gets added on and on
default and on. W
defaulte think 
defaultthat cycle 
defaultis 
defaultthe biggest part of the problem in terms of affordability and the spiral into debt. Our view is to put
default a cap on the cost of 
defaultthe 
defaultfees and charges 
defaultthat people are being hit with first. The evidence about what would happen to
default the market if there were a cap on the total cost of credi
defaultt is inconclusive, and we were talking earlier about the linkages between payday lending and other forms of high-cost credit and illegal lending. I think we have got to be
default really careful here
default. In our view, the FCA
default—
defaultand it has the p
defaultowers
default—
defaultshould attack the thing that we have identified is most often getting people into the most difficulty. It is the
default fees and charges,
default not necessarily the total cost, although I would not rule that out.
defaultGdefaultillian Guydefault: 
defaultMay I add that there should be some charges that are looked at in terms of a ban? When we are looking at total cost, that means things like charging for failed continuous payment authorities on a continuous basis.
default              defaultChair:default We are going to talk about those in a second.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:defaultMr Lewis, y
defaultou mentioned the connection with gambling
default. Do you know what percentage of payday loans are related to that? That is an interesting point.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: There is no way to know.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultAre there any checks on those people who have two, three, four, or even
default five payday loans and 
defaultare doing treasury accounting by doing that? 
defaultEvery time
default they get a loan, they pay off the other loan, so from the loan-giver’s point of view, it is a self-fulfilling increase.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: Yes, and that goes back to 
defaultwhen we are thinking about default rates and things like that. We 
defaultsaw this before in the past
default, with credit cards, and the issue of only looking at people who have actually fallen over and not looking at people whose problems are getting bigger and bigger. W
defaulthat we see with credit cards
default and some of the mainstream credit
default is
default that
default they pay much more atten
defaulttion to looking at information suggesting that people may be in more financial difficulty. That is clearly not happening with
default payday lenders.
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: Our research suggests that a quarter of payday
default&#x2011;
defaultloan borrowers are
default using those loans to repay other credit.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ131 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Is th
defaultere any way of the debt-advice charities represented here alerting credit reference agencies when they are coming across
default these multiple
default payday loans? Do you have any process for contacting the appropriate reference agencies and making them
default 
defaultaware 
defaultof this, or would you welcome such a process
default, if it could be made available
default?
defaultGillian Guydefault: 
defaultThe difficulty there is that t
defaulthat
default is about personal information that is brought to us on a confidential basis to help people out of a situation, so i
defaultt is quite difficult to do that
default. We have to have generic information that we then would pass on, and w
defaulte are very open 
defaultto passing on data to show where the problems arise.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault:
default More particularly, of course, by the time they come to us, people are coming for help with serious debt problems. W
defaulthat we need to do is preve
defaultnt those serious debt problems. By the time they come to us, it is trying to remedy a bad situation. The lenders have to be doing this earlier to prevent people taking out unaffordable loans, rather than us being informed when people have a problem.
defaultGillian Guydefault: T
defaulto be fair, given the amount of surveys that we have done and the amount of data and evidence that we have got, we have
default passed on a lot that would say this business model needs 
defaultre-
defaultlooking at
default and the practice needs to be changed
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ132 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default We have spoken quite a bit 
defaultabout
default rollovers today, b
defaultut I just wanted your views on the FCA proposals to limit the number of rollovers to
default two per loan
default. 
defaultDo you agree with the lim
defaultit, and if not, what would you like to see in its place?
defaultGillian Guydefault: It is good to have a limit, because w
defaulte see people getting into that spir
defaultal, and it has no end. I have got cases here with 11 or 12, and they just keep going and going and then, as I say, finding the money taken;
default 
defaultthey just 
defaulthave not got it in their account, but it is not in isolation, really
default. 
defaultT
defaulthose people cannot be left to be told, “There is no solution for you,” because they may go to other places that are even less salubrious, 
defaultor get into worse and wors
defaulte 
defaultsituations. So they must be sign
defaultposted to 
defaultget some help, advice and support to get them out of the situation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ133 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultDoes anyone have any alternative views?
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: We think a limit of
default two is a sensible place to start, but we think 
defaultprobably the FCA would ne
defaulte
defaultd
default to move to one
default. 
defaultIn our 
defaultview, one rollover is reasonable. You might need to take out a payday loan because of
default some unexpected expense one month, and
default the same may happen again. We should look very hard at whether two is effective and is tackling the
default problem properly
default, but two is a good place to start
default.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: I am with one as well, but I do worry about the rollover loophole: “We will give you another loan to repay the first loan that you had with us,” and
default—
defaultyou were discussing it before
default—
defaultwhat 
defaultI call 
defaultthe collective rollover, where
default you 
defaulteffectively roll over with another firm or another operator by doing the same thing, and there are 
defaultno data checks
default. 
defaultI am not sure how 
defaulteffective it really will be in practical terms for an individual. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ134 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Do you have quite a bit of experience of people taking existing loans and putting them into an alternative package?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: 
defaultThat 25% figure is, effectively, that.
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: 
defaultThat is what we have had.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: That is what we are seeing with people, spinning round and round and round and round.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ135 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default 
defaultSo it is repackaging that is going on?
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultA 
defaultlimit of one makes sense to us, but there is also this point about dealing with multiples. The FCA has to have a package that deals with the whole thing of people getting stuck in this spiral.
default              defaultQ136 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default What restrictions on advertising do you think should be introduced
default to stop inappropriate lending
default?
defaultGillian Guydefault: I think we need to look at a whole raft of things on advertising, and an analysis of exactly
default what the market segment is that companies 
defaultare targeting. We do hear that they are not targeting the people that we are talking about, and yet they are on daytime television; they use cartoons; 
defaultth
defaultey put it at times when people that we see with multiple debts might be at home, because they are
default unemployed
default. 
defaultIt is that kind of targeting
default. 
defaultThere is no clarity 
defaultin them about what the consequence of taking it on is. It all looks like a good thing, a quick fix, and something that is attractive. T
defaulto be honest, it reminds me of the ol
defaultd days of cigarette advertising, where it was all very sexy and a good thing to be doing, and we did not worry about health warnings. 
defaultThere are no health warnings on 
defaultthese adverts. There is nothing about the dangers that they could present,
default or
default,
default indeed, that they are not 
defaultthe
default solution to
default all things and there might be some other way out of a debt situation, rather than more debt.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: 
defaultWe are in danger of grooming a new generation towards
default this t
defaultype of borrowing. If you think we have got problems now, you wait until 10 years’ time. G
defaultrooming 
defaultis the right term
default. 
defaultWe are talking about 
defaulta market that did not exist five years ago, and you have had people in arguing that this is how people
default like to use i
defaultt. They have created the demand,
default the
defaulty have created the operational structure, and now they are saying it is what people want. I
defaultt is deliberately contrived and controlled
default. 
defaultLet me give you some stats that we are coming out with today. 
default14% of 
defaultparents of under-10s, when they have said,
default “No, you cannot have
default your toy,” or whatever they have asked for, have had a payday loan company quoted to borrow the money from. 30% of under-10s, in a poll of their parents that we have done on the website,
default are joking about these slogans, and laughing and repeating s
defaultlogans of payday lenders. We have normalised this. This niche lending of last resort has become normalised to a mainstream form of credit by 
defaultthe use of advertising
default. 
defaultI would have a blanket ban
default. These adverts go on children’s television channels and children’s television programmes. 
defaultWhere would I start? A full ban on any children’s
default TV and advertising
default. It is a disgrace, and
default I use the term 
default“
defaultgrooming
default”
default quite deliberately
default. Once we have done that, we need to look at the style and nature of the advert. There are
default 
defaultcartoon puppets that make it seem fun, and deliberately fly in the face of the messages we know we want to get out there. They say, “It is easy;” they deliberately try and say, “T
defaulthe other messages you are hearing are wrong
default.” It is inappropriate propaganda. 
defaultWe need
default,
default when these adverts come on
default,
default all the health
default warnings that we are saying today to be part of those adverts. 
defaultI am close to saying that
default I would just ban the whole lot of them, but that is not a market economy, and we have to accept that
default we do not do that
default. They have to be far more responsible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ137 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Have you any figures for the percentage of those who have payday loans, grouped by age?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: No, I do not
default. 
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: We can dig that out, with the people that we see who have come to us for help.
defaultChair:default Could you provide us with that evidence?
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: Yes
default. 
defaultAnother thing is that I agree with what Martin said there
default. 
defaultParticularly, from our point of view, there is a normalisation of using high-cost credit as a way of dealing with financial difficulties
default. 
defaultAs I said before, we see people using payday loans in a way that makes their financial difficulties worse
default. 
defaultOne part of advertising, which was talked about in the previous session, is unsolicited marketing
default. 
defaultWe did some polling a couple of weeks ago, and I think something like 1.2 million people said they had been tempted to take 
defaultout 
defaulta payday loan by unsolicited contact
default. 
defaultOur clients tell us they are being bombarded by texts and phone calls
default. 
defaultThese are people who are at their lowest
default ebb
default; they are massively financially vulnerable
default. 
defaultThey do not know how they are going to g
defaultet through the end of the month;
default they ar
defaulte completely stumped, cash-
defaultstress
defaulted. Then
default people are contacting them saying, “We have 
defaultgot the solution to your problem;
default here is a high-cost loan
default.” 
defaultWe know that, very often, those loans make the problem worse
default. So w
defaulthy is it that unsolicited marketing of what can be a very high
default­
defaultrisk product is allowed
default? 
defaultWe do not argue for banning many things, but one of the th
defaultings that maybe 
defaultthe FCA should consider
default 
defaultis 
defaulta ban on 
defaultunsolicited marketing
default of payday lending
default.
defaultGillian Guydefault: One of the things that we have to bear in mind, as well, is that we are now increasing the market
default for these adverts. With 
defaultthe costs of living going up and people being unable to meet their priority debts, they are looking for solutions, and they are right in front of their eyes
default. 
defaultIn a way, there is a more vulnerable situation that we have to deal with here
default. 
defaultWe look at welfare reform, and we see monthly budgeting coming in and people being unable to manage on that basis
default. 
defaultWhat is the answer to that
default? A
default quick fix, a quick loan, and there is your advert waiting for you.
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: On the demographic question, Chair, our research suggests that across the board, 4% of households take out a payday loan each month
default. For 18 
defaultto
default 
default29
default-
defaultyear
default-
defaultolds, that is nearly double, 7%
default. 
defaultMartin is quite right: there is clearly a growing problem here in terms of younger people being engaged with this market at an increasing rate, relative to the others
default. 
defaultThe other thing I would do with advertising is make it really plain what the cost of a loan is, and I would express that in pounds per £100 borrowed, rather than in APR
default. 
defaultPeople, we know, tend not to understand APR, tend not to be able to engage with that metric
default. 
defaultI would force the lenders to explain much more clearly the costs, and as Gillian said, the consequences of default in terms of cost as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ138 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default May
default I ask for a bit more detail
default? 
defaultI am a big supporter of the “Got Their Number” campaign that was launched last week
default, and, of course, “Calling Time”, that Which? have
default been running for nuisance calls
default. 
defaultWhat is the evidence that you have on who is making these calls
default? 
defaultI questioned the big players that were here just a m
defaultinute ago, and they are adamant:
default “We are not doing any of this
default.” 
defaultIf they are not doing it, who is
default? There seem
default to be so many of them.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: It is a good question
default. 
defaultOne of the difficulties is that people are not often sure, because there are lead-generating firms
default. 
defaultThere is a shadow market of consumer data, so part of the thing about passing i
defaultt to your friends is that if a consumer
default contact
defaults
default a website, does that consumer know who their details are being passed to
default? 
defaultPeople are being run
defaultg
default up, and they do not know who they are being called by
default. T
defaulthat open
defaults
default people up 
defaultnot only 
defaultto perhaps taking an inappropriate payday 
defaultloan, but also to fraud. We see types of advance-
defaultfee fraud that are based on cold-calling
default. There is a problem, 
defaultbecause people do not necessarily really know who their data is being passed to and who is ringing them up, and it is very hard for us to trace that back again
default. 
defaultPeople tell us they are bombarded by calls and texts
default. 
defaultWe are getting people to send us those texts, and we can find out who is doing it, but it is very hard
default. 
defaultThat is part of the problem: there is little control, and there seems to be massive non-compl
defaultiance with things like the data 
defaultprotection legislation
default. 
defaultIt is hard for consumers to know where their details are going and who is contacting them
default. 
default              defaultChair:default I think we get the point
default. 
defaultIf there is anybody who wishes to submit any
default further
default evidence on that, feel free to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ139 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default We are all deeply aware of the problems with the use of continuous payment authorities
default. 
defaultThe FCA are proposing a limit of two unsuccessful applications of a CPA
default. 
defaultIs that enough to tackle the problem that you have experienced, and if not, what would you do?
defaultGillian Guydefault: I do not think it is just about how CPAs are administered
default. 
defaultPeople do not, in the first instance, understand either that they have signed up to a CPA
default, which is very often the case, 
defaultor how it differs from a direct debit, or that it does differ
default. 
defaultThey do not get notice when a 
defaultpayment is about to be taken out, and the timing in people’s accounts is extremely impo
defaultrtant when they are living hand
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultmouth and if they have priority debts coming in
default. 
defaultNone of that is taken into account
default. 
defaultWe have had some struggle, as well, to make it clear to people that they can stop those CPAs, and it is within their rights to do so
default. 
defaultThat has not been made clear enough.
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: To follow up from that,
default the real struggle is, since November 2009, you have had a right to go to your bank and cancel a CPA, but you call up the bank and the bank staff do not know that, and they tell you that you cannot
default. 
defaultPeople are right to say
default,
default “I cannot cancel it
default,”
default because they try
default to
default cancel
default,
default and they do not
default. 
defaultWe have a real problem
default—
defaultnot just within payday loans; CPA is an issue right across the board
default—of being 
defaultun
defaultable to cancel 
defaultthat type of payment
default. 
defaultSometimes the public are right: you cannot cancel it, even though you have a right to.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ140 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Briefly, on that one, we heard from the panel previous to you
default—from Mr Lender—
defaultthat CPAs
default can be a really good thing for the customer
default. 
defaultIt took me about 30 seconds to get something up here from 
defaultthe 
defaultConsumer Action Group: “I currently have a loan with Mr Lender
default. 
defaultAnyway, that aside, I was recently made redundant; rang, e
default-
defaultmailed NatWest to cancel CPA, cancel my bank card; told Mr Lender I had been made redundant
default. 
defaultThey of course asked for 
default£
default75 to set up a repayment plan, which I refused
default. 
defaultMr Lender has still managed to take one payment, £75, and another payment, £145
default. 
defaultMay I add, my bank was already overdrawn before Mr Lender’s payments
default. 
defaultThese show up on my statements
default. 
defaultThe bank account I have with NatWest has no overdraft on it, and is £252 overdrawn
default. 
defaultWhere do I go from here
default?” 
defaultIs this typical of what is happening in the industry?
defaultMartin Lewisdefault: It is certainly not shocking
default or surprising
default. 
defaultI think “typical” is perhaps too strong a term
default. 
defaultInterestingly, if that money has come out, this person has a right to go to the Financial Ombudsman and ask the bank to pay it back, because they should not have allowed it to come out
default. 
defaultThis all flicks ba
defaultck to your earlier question to m
defaulte, about the difference between trying to do everything to make sure people do not repay, and being willing to lend to people you are going to get to repay when they cannot afford it
default. 
defaultIf you have got the CPAs working in the right way, and people have £10 in their bank account and every day you are doing a CPA for £10 on a fishing expedition, people are going to repay
default. 
defaultIt does no
defaultt mean they can afford to repay, but
default they are going to repay
default. T
defaulthat is the subtle difference in the language that we are hearing: “Will I get my money back
default?” 
defaultIf it is a “no”, they do not want it, but if they will, regardless of the moral concerns of whether it is right to get it back, that is where they are pushing
default. 
defaultRichard Lloyddefault: This must be about giving people control over their finances, and the way to do that is to require the lenders to give you notice that they are going to use a CPA
default. 
defaultIf they do not do that, you are not in control.
defaultPeter Tuttondefault: It is also about not pushing people further into difficulty
default. 
defaultCharging £75 to set up a repayment plan is not good, responsible lending
default. 
defaultIt is taking someone who is clearly in financial difficulty and taking another fee out of them
default. 
defaultHow can that be justifiable
default? 
defaultThe thing with CPA is that we would expect lenders to start thinking, if CPA fails once, “Okay, why has that failed
default? 
defaultWhat should we do as a lender to try 
defaultto
default make sure, if this person is in financial difficult
defaulty, we are not making it worse?”
default rather than, “
defaultI
defaultf we have not heard from them, we will just take the money anyway and maybe we wil
defaultl add some more charges.
default”

defaultChair:default I have got to finish here
default. 
defaultWe have got the Minister here, and other bodies; we need to question them
default. 
defaultIf you feel that you have not had the opportunity to answer a question as fully as you like, please submit it in written form as supplementary evidence, and it will be fully considered in our report
default. 
defaultEqually, we may well have further questions that we would like to ask you, and we would be grateful for your responses

default, Office of Fair Trading, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ141 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you for agreeing to answer our questions, and in particular, Minister, can I thank you
default? 
defaultI think this is the first time I have ever known a Min
defaultister actually ask to attend a Select C
defaultommittee inquiry, and I do apologise for having you in rather later
default. 
defaultI hate doing that, but as you can understand, the scale of the issues there provoked 
defaultsuch 
defaulta lot of questions that it was very difficult to manage within the time
default 
defaultscale available
default. 
defaultHowever, we have you now
default. 
defaultCould I just ask you to introduce yourselves for voice transcription purposes, starting with you, Minister?
defaultJo Swinsondefault: I am Jo Swinson
default. I am the Minister for c
defaultonsum
defaulter a
defaultffairs, and 
defaultam 
defaultvery pleased that the Select Committee is returning to this important issue.
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: I am Lesley Titcomb
default. I am the Chief Operating O
defaultfficer of the Financial Conduct Authority, and the executive responsible for the transition of consumer credit regulation to us.
defaultNadege Genetaydefault: I am Nadege Genetay

defaultI am David Fisher
default. 
defaultI am the senior director responsible for consumer credit and anti-money laundering at the Office of Fair Trading.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ142 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I will open with a fairly general question
default. 
defaultThe industr
defaulty has produced its own customer 
defaultservice charter
default. 
defaultHow do you think the undertakings there match up with the compliance review that you published earlier this year
default? 
defaultI gather, Minister, you wish to respond.
defaultJo Swinsondefault: Absolutely
default. 
defaultIt was helpful that the industry indicated that they wanted to clean up their act and have their own charter, which they created last summer
default,
default and 
defaultthat
default came into force last November
default. 
defaultUnfortunately, we did not find that the compliance with the industry’s own charter was what we would have expected
default. 
defaultInitially, the industry had committed that they would review their own compliance on that, but when it came to the crunch, unfortunately, not all of the industry was prepared to undertake that review
default. 
defaultAs the Department, we initiated our own surveys to try to test the extent to which there was compliance with the industry’s 
defaultvoluntary codes, and what we found was pretty disappointing in terms of compliance
default. 
defaultOne in five customers reported that the lender did not ask about their finances when they were taking out a loan, and this rose to 60% when they were actually rolling over that loan
default.
defaultIn terms of CPA, which I know you heard about in previous sessions, again, one in three customers reported it was not clearly explained, and nearly 60% of people were not told how to cancel 
defaulta 
defaultCPA
default. 
defaultSo our surveys were a snapshot in time, but certainly gave u
defaults significant cause for concern
default about the levels of compliance, which is why I was so delighted to see really tough rules proposed by the FCA, given that I think the industry has had a significant chance to get its own house in order and has failed in that challenge
default. 
defaultThat is why the regulators will be able to make sure that that is indeed what happens.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ143 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Minister, could I just extract one element of your answer there
default? 
defaultYou implied 
defaultthat 
defaultthere was actually resistance from sectors of the industry
default. 
defaultMy next question was, “Is this a result of a quickl
defaulty 
defaultexpanding market, or are there deep-seated problems
default?” 
defaultWould you agree that that seems to point to the latter?
defaultJo Swinsondefault: I think so
default. 
defaultThere are four main trade bodies within the industry, one of whom had basically said that they would undertake the compliance review as they had all signed up to do
default. So a
defaultt least in one part of the industry, they had indicated that willingness, but it was very disappointing that the rest of the industry did not do likewise or indicate that they would do, despite having previously agreed that that is what would happen.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ144 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would it be fair to say that there were at least some elements within the industry that looked at its o
defaultwn charter as, if you like, 
defaulta smokescreen?
defaultJo Swinsondefault: I certainly think that it was not taken as seriously as it should have been, because the customer experience backed up that it was not properly being delivered
default. 
defaultAt the end of the day, it is
default the customer experience that is
default most important
default. 
defaultActually, the issue about whether or not the industry wanted to review their compliance might not have mattered had
default we found
default, when we tested it, 
defaultthat 
defaultthe customers were saying that there was compliance
default. But the combination of a
default lack of interest in charting whether that code had been complied with and the fact that customers were then reporting significant problems certainly suggests, very strongly, that the industry was not taking it anything like as seriously as it should have been
default,
default in general terms.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ145 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default I have a
default couple of questions for Mr Fisher
default. 
defaultYou
default have the power to revoke licenc
defaultes in extreme cases
default. How many licenc
defaultes have 
defaultyou 
defaultrevoked following your compliance review?
defaultDavid Fisherdefault: Since the compliance review, we have revoked the licen
defaultces of three consumer-
defaultcredit companies, and we have a further two investigations that are at quite an advanced stage at the moment, so I would expect more would follow.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ146 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Thank you for that
default. 
defaultGiven the number of failings that have been highlighted in your review
default—
defaultvery extensive failings, right across all sectors of the industry
default—w
defaulthat other sanctions are available to you, and have you used any of them since the publication of that report?
defaultDavid Fisherdefault: “Sanction” is perhaps not quite the right word
default. 
defaultThe work 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have done putting pressure on the 50 leading lenders that have been referred to earlier, accounting for 90% of the market, is not formal enforcement action, but we 
defaultgave 
defaulteac
defaulth of those lenders 
defaulta very, very detailed dossier of their failings
default. 
defaultLet us be frank: 
defaultthat is exactly what they were—
defaultfailings
default. 
defaultWe gave each of them a 12-week period in which to satisfy us that, in short, they had put their house right
default. 
defaultWe have been following up on that since
default. 
defaultThat has had a direct effect on the market, in that
default, as has already been mentioned, 
default19 of the payday lenders chose to exit the market
default. So y
defaultou can say that 
defaultit is 
defaultnot formal enforcement action or 
defaulta 
defaultsanction, but the pressure we have put on the payday lenders has resulted in some of the more undesirable ones leaving immediately.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ147 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Yes, but 19 out of 50 is actually removing competition
default. 
defaultThere is less competition in the market as a consequence of that particular endeavour
default. 
defaultI am sure we do not criticise you for it, but that is an inevitable consequence.
defaultDavid Fisherdefault: 
defaultI
defaultndeed
default. 
defaultObviously, we are the 
defaultUK
default’s leading competition authority as well, but you must remember that it is not competition for its own sake
default. 
defaultOur motto is about making markets work well for consumers
default. 
defaultWe have had real concerns about how competition operates in this market, very fundamental concerns, which led us to make a reference to the Competition Commission in the summer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ148 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Can I ask you one point
default? 
defaultYou stated that if a borrower has to roll over a loan because of a missed payment, it is prima facie evidence that it is financially unsustainable
default. 
defaultToday, when we took evidence from the industry, they appeared to find great difficulty in defining what was financially unsustainable
default. 
defaultDo you consider that still remains a problem with the industry?
defaultDavid Fisherdefault: Yes, it does
default. 
defaultAbsolutely, it remains a problem
default. 
defaultMay I just make a point that we do not have the power to make rules, but we do issue guidance, and we were ve
defaultry clear about this in our debt-
defaultcollection guidance
default. I
defaultt is not the use of continuous payment 
defaultauthority that has bothered us; 
defaultit is the misuse of it
default. 
defaultIt seemed to us that if you have made one or two attempts to recover a loan
default,
default and the person just simply does not have the money in their account to repay it, then you should stop and ask, “What is going on
default?” 
defaultYou should assume that there is a problem there.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ149 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default I am just going to ve
defaultry quickly ask the rest of the p
defaultanel whether they agree with the OFT’s analysis.
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: Yes, and that is why we have made the rules we have, or are proposing to make the rules we h
defaultave around rollovers, CPAs
default and so on
default. 
defaultHowever, it is also important to understand that as the FCA, we will have available to us 
defaulttools that the OFT has not had—
defaultauthorisation supervision and so on.
default              defaultAnn McKechin:default We will come to that later on
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ150 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default 
defaultMay I ask the p
defaultanel what the reasons are for your referral of the industry to the Competition Commission
default? 
defaultWhat were the most specific reasons that you really wanted to get down to?
defaultDavid Fisherdefault: The compliance review that we conducted
default—
defaultand you have referred to it, and you have obviously been drawing on our report when preparing for this
default—showed 
defaultnon
default­
defaultcompliance across all parts of the industry
default. 
defaultWe did not find that there was a long tail of people who were failing to comply with the law and the OFT’s guidance; we found non
default­
defaultcompliance across all payday lenders
default. 
defaultThat is not what you would expect to see in a properly working market
default. 
defaultYou would, in a properly working market, naturally expect to find some people who were not complying with the law
default; t
defaulthat is just the way the world works, but you would expect to find the majority broadly compliant
default. 
defaultWe did not find that
default. 
defaultThat was the big trigger that said to us that there was something wrong with this market
default. 
defaultWe were concerned that, actually, non-compliance is a competitive tool in this market
default. 
defaultIt gives a competitive edge
default. 
defaultWe were concerned about the lack of transparency that has been discussed in earlier sessions: do consumers actually understand what they are getting into with a payday loan
default? 
defaultDoes the consumer understand the implications of a rollover
default? 
defaultDoes the consumer understand what a continuous payment authority is
default? 
defaultWe were concerned about low price sensitivity
default. 
defaultAs one of the previous witnesses said quite clearly, and I agree, these people compete on speed and convenience; they do not compete on price, so there is low price sensitivity on the consumers
default. 
defaultWe were concerned about barriers to switching from one lender to a
defaultnother, and high concentration:
default we estimate that the three leading payday lenders account for about 70% of the market
default. 
defaultThose were the core reasons for referring to the Competition Commission.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ151 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default We heard earlier from the
default professional body organisers
default that they did not seem too concerned about the interface between the legal and credible part of the business and the illegal, and often incredible, black area of the business
default. 
defaultDo 
defaultyou see that as a real concern—
defaultthat blurred dividing line between what we consider to be not only indecent, but often illegal, and what the companies consider to be legal
default? 
defaultIt seems that there is an interplay there that we are not getting hold of.
defaultDavid Fisherdefault: There is a clear distinction between that which is legal and that which is illegal
default. 
defaultTh
defaultere is the law on illegal money
defaultlending; for example, you do have to be regulated in order to provide a loan
default. 
defaultThere is a clear distinction between what is illegal and legal
default. 
defaultWhat we were concerned about was not so much what is legal, as how the law is being interpreted and applied
default. There
default you have a broad range of business practices, some of which are not illegal but are highly undesirable.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ152 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default What about references to “friends”?
defaultDavid Fisherdefault: Yes, I was struck by the reference to a “friend”
default. 
defaultThe friend in question, of course, would be another provider of short-term, high-cost credit
default. 
defaultIf I am such a lender, and I decide that you are not a good credit risk but I refer you to a friend, what do you think they are going to charge you
default? 
defaultTo call them a “friend” is a clear misnomer
default. 
defaultIt would be another payday lender.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ153 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default 
defaultW
defaulte are all concerned to get both regulation and enforcement right
default. 
defaultIt was clear from our exchange with the industry earlier that both were not right at the moment
default. 
defaultSelf-regulation had failed and there was no effective enforcement
default. 
defaultNow, within the proposals that the FCA has published
default—
defaultor alongside those proposals
default—
defaultwhat are your views on 
defaultenforcement, and in particular, on the sanctions that can be taken
default? 
defaultYou talked about the new tools at your disposal.
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: I will kick off on that
default. 
defaultWe all tend to think of the enforcement and the sanctions that tend to grab the headlines, but it is important to understand the whole regulatory process and the range of tools available to us
default. 
defaultFirst of all, there is the authorisation gateway
default. 
defaultFirms that want to continue in this sector will have to go through the full FCA authorisation process
default. 
defaultThere is then ongoing supervision and monitoring, which will be tailored to the level of risk posed by the particular type of firm that we are talking abo
defaultut, and payday lenders are high-
defaultrisk and therefore can expect an increased supervisory focus
default. 
defaultThey will 
defaulthave to submit data to us, 
defaultetc
default. 
defaultThen, of course, where we do have the offenders, there is a much wider range of enforcement sanctions available to us than there has been to the OFT
default. 
defaultWe, for example, could instruct a firm to stop doing certain types of business or to not take on new business
default. 
defaultWe can fine them
default. 
defaultWe can, in certain cases, tackle the individuals who are responsible for the firms
default. 
defaultWe can ban certain adverts
default—
defaultthat type of thing
default—
defaultand also, of course, we can ultimately take away a firm’s authorisation.
defaultJo Swinsondefault: I would echo some of what Lesley said, but say that I think it is really important to recognise that the OFT has taken enforcement action that has led to the exodus of 25 firms from the market, th
defaultr
defaultough a combination
default of voluntary leaving and licenc
defaultes being revoked
default. 
defaultHowever, they did not have the strength of powers that it has become clear are needed within this industry to tackle some of the very significant non-compliance
default. That is why the Government have
default made sure we have given the FCA
default, 
defaultas the new regulator
default from next April
default, 
defaultvery significant and robust powers
default. Lesley ha
defaults outlined the whole process, and whether it is fines, which of course can be unlimited, 
defaultor 
defaultwhether it is banning products or getting redress for consumers, these really are much, much more significant powers
default. 
defaultThis means that the FCA will be a regulator with
default—dare I say it?—perhaps more teeth than the OFT was equipped with, to be able to
default clamp down on payday lenders and any unscrupulous lending behaviour.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ154 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Just following on from Paul’s question, it is very reassuring to hear about the extra powers and the extra enforc
defaultement that we can expect to see
default from the FCA
default. 
defaultI have heard some worrying suggestions that the EU consumer finance directive and the creation of a common market in consumer credit could mean, though, that companies operating outside the 
defaultUK
default regulatory system would be able to sell products into the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultDo you have powers to address that, and make sure that 
defaultUK
default consumers are protected from that type of approach?
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: We have faced this situation already in a number of areas
default. 
defaultWe do have a certain number of powers, but they are limited, obviously
default. 
defaultWe are left with host country powers, effectively, so inevitably it is more difficult
default. 
defaultIn any case where this type of business is mobile, it can move offshore, either to other parts of the EU or even outside the EU as well
default. That is an issue, 
defaultit is more difficult for us
default,
default and we are more limited in what we can do
default. 
defaultJo Swinsondefault: On the consumer credit d
defaultirective specifically, while it can be helpful in some cases to have EU-wide regulation
default, 
defaultwhich can mean uniformity of protection across the EU
default, 
defaultone of the issues that my officials are exploring with the Commission at the moment is that of how information can be provided
default. For very sensible reasons, the consumer credit d
defaultirective says that credit has to be expressed in APR, but I know that 
defaultthis Committee in its previous R
defaulteport has highlighted some of the failings of APR in helping consumers to understand the costs of taking out a short-term loan
default. 
defaultObviously, when a borrower gets to the stage of taking 
defaultout a loan
default, we can 
defaultalso 
defaultrequire the total cost of credit to be provided
default,
default in pounds
default. 
defaultThe maxim
defaultum harmonisation nature of the d
defaultirective means that there is perhaps more of a grey area about whether that can be required in advertising, or whether it can be as prominent as the APR
default. 
defaultThat is an issue that we recognise is probably an
default unintended consequence of the consumer credit d
defaultirective
default. 
defaultI have written to the Commission, and that is something that we are currently very engaged with the Commission on, to try to get some clarity on that so that the regulators know exactly what they are able to demand of lenders without falling foul of the European law
default. 
defaultIf that ultimately does need to be changed, then I would hope the Commission would look positively at that, for this new type of credit that perhaps was not envisaged when the initial rules on APR were put together.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ155 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default I do think it is an important area to engage, and to try
default to
default make sure 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have as much control as possible to protect 
defaultUK
default consumers
default. 
defaultJust moving on from that, we have talked a lot today about affordability, and obviously the sector’s charter itself talks a good game on affordability but it is not something that appears
default, 
defaultparticul
defaultarly from the OFT investigation, 
defaultto actually be checked
default as often as it should be
default. 
defaultThe figures were disappointingly low for initial loans, and even lower for rollovers
default. 
defaultWhat difference will the new regulations make, in terms of making sure that affordability really is put front and centre?
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: You have come, really, to the crux of the proposals in our consultation paper, which are to ensure proper affordability checking and that loans are only made to those who can afford to repay them
default. 
defaultWhat we are looking at here is a package of measures to drive that
default. 
defaultThere is obviously the proper assessment of affordability
default—what are people’
defaults incomings, outgoings, etc.
default—
defaultbut there are measures on top of that
default, such as
default limiting the number o
defaultf CPA attempts that can be made. The CPA
default is
default,
default in our view
default,
default one of the incentives that drives firms not to carry out proper affordability assessments: they have no need to, because they know they can dip into a bank account to recover their money
default. 
defaultThat is why you have to think of it as a proposal
default. 
defaultThe key thing, from our point of view, is that we can make rules on this, whereas the OFT has only been able to make guidance underneath the principles that we have that people should be treating their customers fairly, anyway
default. 
defaultWe are also able to devote more resources to monitori
defaultng against those rules, and taking
default enforcement action where appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ156 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default In terms of the monitoring, real-time data collection and shared information around credit would obviously make a huge difference here
default. 
defaultThis is something that we have heard from the debt charities that they would like to s
defaultee. 
defaultDo you think that is something that is achievable, either on the basis of the industry working together or something that y
defaultou as a regulator should
default be looking into bring
defaulting
default about?
defaultNadege Genetaydefault: Clearly, this is an area where we have said we have an interest
default. 
defaultWe will be looking to the industry; that would be a good reason for the industry to develop real
default­
defaulttime data 
defaultsharing amongst them
default. 
defaultWe will also be looking at the results of the Competition Commission investigation into the structure of the market
default. If we find that
default we are the people who would be best placed to mandate in this area, that is something we would be prepared to look at.
defaultJo Swinsondefault: May
default I add to that
default? 
defaultObviously, this is an area that works quite well already within the rest of the credit market
default. We are all familiar with the likes of Experian,
default Equifax and Callcredit, and the fact that when you apply for a credit product, normally you will go through a credit checking procedure
default. 
defaultIt is set up by an industry committee, called the Steering Committee on Reciprocity, or SCOR
default. 
defaultNow, it would be great if they were able to embrace the need for much more dynamic data and information under this very different type of lending, 
defaultand
default,
default as I say, they have got a good track record in other parts of the industry
default. 
defaultLast autumn,
default BIS officials convened a round 
defaulttable on that matter with different people from industry, but it is probably fair to say that there has not been the kind of progress and speed that we might have wanted from 
defaultthe 
defaultindustry on this issue
default. 
defaultIt is definitely something I am pleased that the FCA is
default going to look very seriously 
defaultat, and if it transpired that the FCA was in need of any further powers in order to mandate that, then obviously, 
defaultG
defaultovernment would be very sympathetic to any powers that the independent regulator needed that they feel that they do not have currently.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ157 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default I am glad to hear you say that, Minister
default. 
defaultWe did hear from StepChange earlier that they had lob
defaultbied your predecessor 
defaultin your role about this
default,
default and felt that there had not been enough progress, so it is certainly something we would like to see more rapid action on
default. 
defaultThere is a debate, I understand, as to whether the existing 
defaultcredit
default reference agencies can actually achieve this, and whether the industry can achieve this without regulatory intervention, but I am reassured to hear the regulator say that they will consider stepping in if necessary
default. 
defaultIt would be useful
default—and 
defaultperhaps this is something that could be followed up in written evidence
default—to hear about what sort of timeline you see for when that would be needed
default. 
defaultHave we looked at other jurisdictions 
defaultthat 
defaultare looking at using real-time data
default? 
defaultCanada
default, I think, is one example; 
defaultFlorida
default is another one where this has been achieved
default. 
defaultHave you made any analysis of what that does to the market, and how it helps to improve?
defaultNadege Genetaydefault: We are certainly looking at the experience in other countries
default. 
defaultIndeed, we are making contact with the regulators in those other jurisdictions
default. 
defaultThere is a variety of mechanisms, including enforcement databases as opposed to real-time data
default 
defaultsharing between lenders, and we are interested in understand
defaulting
default those where they exist.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ158 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Just one final question: we heard 
defaulta lot of evidence from the debt-
defaultadvice charities about the problems of people with multiple payday loans, and the fact that that puts people in a completely unsustainable position
default. 
defaultIf this information were available
default—
defaultif we had real-time data 
defaultsharing, and you could see whether people already had a loan
default—
defaultwould you support actually banning payday loans being made to someone who already had a payday loan out?
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: Again, what we say is it has to be a proper affordability assessment
default. 
defaultWe hear that people’s individual circumstances can vary hugely
default. 
defaultCertainly, multiple loans are a problem
default. 
defaultIt is difficult to see how the second or third loan to somebody who is already having trouble repaying the first is really being lent to someone who can afford to repay
default. 
defaultIt is certainly a very, very strong indicator that the person is in trouble
default. 
defaultSo, should they be going 
defaultthere? 
defaultI would very strongly doubt it
default. 
default              defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Good morning, Minister
default. 
defaultThe OFT found that 28 of the 40 lenders using continuous payment authority failed to explain how it operated, or that borrowers have the right to cancel
default. 
defaultGiven this evidence, should the continuous
default payment 
defaultauthority mechanism be stopped?
defaultJo Swinsondefault: It obviously very much backs up, or is backed up by, the BIS research that we undertook 
defaultas well in our consumer surveys;
default what was supposed to be happening, in terms of information for consumers about CPA, was not happening
default. 
defaultAs an initial step, I was very pleased to see the FCA getting the banks around the table to make it very clear, so that they understand that if a consumer rings the bank to cancel, then that is one way of doing it
default. I 
defaultthink 
defaultthe continuous payment authority is at the crux of many of the problems within this market
default. 
defaultLesley has already outlined the link to the issues of affordability, which has basically given many payday lenders much less of an incentive to be thorough in their affordability checks, because they have had that ability to dip into customers’ bank accounts and get paid first, almost like a preferred creditor
default. 
defaultI think that the proposal that the FCA have put forward is a very welcome one, because by limiting it to two CPA attempts over the course of the whole loan and it having to be the full amount of the loan that is requested, that rather removes the word “continuous” from “continuous payment authority
default”. It is still a payment authority but
default it is suddenly much more like a direct debit or a one-off payment, because the lender is then incentivised to make sure that they know 
defaultthat 
defaultthere will be 
defaultenough 
defaultto repay that when they take that payment
default. 
defaultWhen you couple that with the limits on rollovers, so that they cannot have a loan that is going on ad infinitum and building up interest charges, suddenly the business model that some payday lenders have been working on is very much changed indeed
default. 
defaultObviously, the Competition Commission might ha
defaultve more to say on that business-
defaultmodel point.
default 
defaultI think the CPA restrictions, as proposed, are incredibly welcome.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ160 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default The real concern, of course, is that this industry has proved very difficult to control, has it not
default? 
defaultOne of the problems is that we are always behind the curve
default. 
defaultWill you do more with regard to regulation, to ensure that we get closer to the curve?
defaultJo Swinsondefault: It is a really important point that you are making
default. 
defaultIt is a very fast
default­
defaultmoving industry.
default 
defaultIt has grown hugely in the last few years, and one of the difficulties around the sometimes cumbersome nature of putting legislation in place is the time that it takes from the consultation point to actually getting legislation in place
default. 
defaultThat is why, by having giving very strong, robust powers t
defaulto the FCA, they are much better 
defaultplaced to respond quickly to any changes within the marketplace
default. 
defaultThey can introduce new rules, if necessary, much more quickly than we could introduce legislation
default. That
default gives us a much more flexible way of dealing with the industry.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ161 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I take the point about regulation, but it also needs policing.
default 
defaultAre you sure that the policing powers or resources are in place to ensure that we are closer to that curve, as I said?
defaultJo Swinsondefault: I am very confident that, in the FCA, we have a robust regulator with the resources and the tools and the powers that it needs in order to make sure they are on top of this industry
default. Further to that, obviously, G
defaultovernment wants the independent regulator to be very successful, so if the FCA were to come and say, “We feel that we would need an extra power in this area or that area
default,”
default then 
defaultclearly that is something that G
defaultovernment would 
defaultbe very positive about.
default              defaultMr Binley:default So we have really got a regulator that regulates
default. 
defaultThat is a novel and welcome thought.
default              
defaultQ162 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I wonder if I could briefly follow up on that question of CPAs
default. 
defaultThe proposals that the FCA are making are very welcome
default. 
defaultWhen we had a debate back in July, the Minister also made the point that it would be helpful if there was a requirement for three 
defaultdays’ notice of CPAs, and
default 
defaultif, 
defaultat that time, 
defaultan awareness of the right to cancel was drawn to the attention of borrowers
default. 
defaultIt would be helpful if that ended up in the FCA rules
default. 
defaultAre you planning to do that?
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: We have not made a specific proposal to that effect at the moment
default. 
defaultObviously, it is out for consultation, and that is one of the things that I know a number of bodies have different tweaks on, that they would like to see
default. 
defaultThat is one that we have heard, for example
default. 
defaultWe will have to weigh those up
default. 
defaultWe absolutely understand that there is a need to make it clearer to people that they have a right to cancel these, and the point that was picked up earlier about the bank’s staff then acting on that
default. 
defaultAlso, there are various triggers we have put in our rules where the lenders have to refer people for debt advice as well, and also we are very clear that they have to be up-front with people about how the CPA is likely to work and when it is likely to be withdrawn, but we have not put the three-day specific point in yet
default. 
defaultDo you want to elaborate on that?
defaultNadege Genetaydefault: We have certainly carried forward the idea that there needs to be transparency around when the firm is going to take a payment from the consumer
default. 
defaultThe specific right to cancel is not a prominent tool, apart from the broader transparency point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ163 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default The one point I will make on rollovers
default—there were a number that I could have made—
defaultis that we heard concern from the consumer and debt organisations about the way in which the industry repackages debt into new loans
default. 
defaultThe representatives of the industry that we spoke to denied 
defaultthat 
defaultthat happened at all
default. 
defaultWhat measures will you take from the FCA to ensure that that does not happen in the future
default? 
defaultClearly, there is widespread concern
default. 
defaultIt is all very well to limit rollovers to two, but if that debt is then simply repackaged, you have solved nothing.
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: We are very clear as a regulator that there are always people who can and will game the rules that we make, and seek to get around them in precisely that sort of way
default. 
defaultThat is why we recognise that 
defaultongoing 
defaultmonitoring and supervision is so important
default. 
defaultWe will be making aspects of what we have heard about today a supervisory priority when we take on regulation next April; for example, concern has been ex
defaultpressed around fees and charges
default as well
default. 
defaultWe recognise that the rule itself is not the answer here
default. 
defaultIt has to be accompanied by strong supervision, monitoring and enforcement where that is necessary
default. 
defaultWhat I can offer you is increased resources and focus on the supervision and monitoring of those rules to prevent precisely that sort of thing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ164 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default The FCA proposes that all advertisements and other
default promotions must be clear, fair
default and not misleading
default. 
defaultHow will this b
defaulte monitored, policed, evaluated
default and enforced?
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: I will hand over to Nadege on part of this, but
default may
default I also say that we are also proposing that there has to be a risk warning on adverts, as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ165 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default So a sort of cigarette warning notice?
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: Absolutely, which starts, “Think
default: 
defaultIs this loan right for you
default?” 
defaultThat is specifically because the research has shown us that when people are watching these ads, thinking of taking a loan, they are not thinking about their ability to repay in the longer term
default. 
defaultThey are just thinking about the here and now
default. 
defaultThat is why we really want to focus them at that particular point.
default              defaultMr Binley:default Particularly as we have heard that some of these loans are offered to people in casinos, with the money received in quarter of an hour.
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: Yes, that was a new one.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ166 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default That seems frightening to me, quite frankly
default. 
defaultCan I go on to ask a supplementary
default? 
defaultMartin Lewis suggested restrictions on advertising, such as banning adverts on children’s TV
default. 
defaultWhat is the rationale for advertising on children’s TV
default? 
defaultI do not understand that one
default. 
defaultI understand the casino one, but not the children’s television one.
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: I am speculating here
default—
default              defaultMr Binley:default You are the expert
default. 
defaultI am looking for advice.
defaultLesley Titcombdefault: I am speculating here that there are two reasons
default. 
defaultOne is that mothers will be watching with their children, and the other is the one that Martin quoted, which is pressure from the children on the parents.
default              
defaultMr Binley:default Thank you for that
default. 
defaultThat is interesting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ167 default&#xa0; 
default              defaultChair:default I need to finish now
default. 
defaultI was going to ask the question, “The OFT highlighted a number of phrases 
defaultthat
default it considered misleading; how will the use
default of such phrases be monitored?”
default and also include in that
default 
defaultthe context of text messages
default. 
defaultI think this could be answered in a written form
default. 
defaultObviously, that is directed at the OFT, but if others have opinions on that, that would be welcome
default. 
default              
defaultOn that note, I am conscious of the fact that there are a lot of frustrated questioners, and you may well feel frustrated that you have not been able to have full opportunity to answer everything
default. 
defaultOf course, please feel free to submit further written evidence
default. 
defaultEqually, if we realise that there are questions that we should have asked but did not, we will write to you and ask for a response
default. 
defaultCan I thank you very much
default? T
defaulthat is very helpful, and we will report as soon as we can on this
default. 
defaultThank you
default.
