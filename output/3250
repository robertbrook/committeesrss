defaultWritten Submission from Paul McDowell, Chief Executive, Nacro VEP 0054default&#xa0;defaultI am writing with reference to the committee evidence session on Prisoner Voting on Wednesday 16
defaultth
default October. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring the session I was questioned by committee members on a letter signed by various campaigners and criminal justice charities on prisoner voting. During questioning the basis of Nacro’s position was called i
defaultnto question due to an evident 
defaultcontradiction with the letter.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would like to formally confirm that Nacro did not sign the letter in question and that the views expressed in it do no
defaultt reflect the charity’
defaults position. As I stated in my evidence we do not believe the ban on prisoner voting “undermines efforts to help prisoners reform their lives and take responsibility”.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrior to the committee Nacro explained to the Clerk that we did not campaign on prisoner voting and it was not seen as a priority, however, we are not against prisoner voting and would be very happy to speak to the committee about the wider potential benefits of voting, civic engagement and rehabilitation. I am therefore concerned that the inaccurate briefing provided to the committee on Nacro’s position has lead to unfounded conclusions about the evidence base for our work.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a leading provider of crime reduction services, I want to assure the committee that Nacro services are underpinned by a robust evidence base and we work hard to continually assess our effectiveness and impact on the ground.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith regard to prisoner voting we do believe it has potential rehabilitative benefits and as part of a range of interventions it could support work to reintegrate offenders back into their community. We are absolutely clear that this requires testing and is not a panacea. Nacro has long argued that there can be no “one-size-fits-all” solution for rehabilitating offenders.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever we do know that the success of rehabilitation interventions often depends significantly upon offenders being able to integrate or reintegrate into society. This is supported by a large body of evidence, which suggests that desisting from offending is part of a journey and where success is crucially underpinned by the ability to build a new social contract between ex-offender and their community through changed attitudes, employment and housing. It is from this perspective, along with substantial evidence that connects social exclusion to crime that Nacro bases its position on prisoner voting.
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope this letter clarifies Nacro’s commitment to an evidenced approach to criminal justice services. I would be very happy to meet with you in person to discuss this further or arrange a visit for you and committee members to our services across the country.
