"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSurrey County Council\n (LTD0016)\nWhat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?\nThe benefits of local decision-making include:\nThe disa\ndvantages include:\nBetter models:\n&#xa0;Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?The capacity to deliver local transport schemes varies considerably from authority to authority.\nMost will struggle to deliver enough schemes at the higher levels of funding possible under the new local growth deals. Local authorities are being force\nd to reduce the size of their teams because of overall reductions in levels of funding in particular revenue.\nWe can increase capacity, but we need time and revenue funding to do this. We also need reassurance that any extra capacity we do acquire will not\n be wasted if the Government changes its mind about levels of funding. A successful approach would commit capital and revenue funding over a 15 to 20 year period which is the gestation period for the larger major schemes.\nThe optimum client delivery body w\nould have sufficient technical capacity to ensure value for money through feasibility and modelling.  It should be able to deliver transport improvements quickly and flexibly.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?There are two methods:\nHow effectively do local bodies work with each other and with government departments and national transport agencies?On the whole, there are good working relationships between different local bodies. The biggest problem is the interface between \nlocal and national. All too often, \nthe \nGovernment introduces new initiatives and changes its approaches too quickly.\nDo the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?Too bureaucratic. We spent a long time creating local transport bodies only for these to be mostly superseded by growth deals. We don’t yet know how the new arrangements will work.\nThe old arrangements also had their problems including slow decision-making by \ng\novernment.\nIt did not make sense that the Hindhead \nT\nunnel had to be funded from the old regional pot. It was much too expensive (£371 million) and strategically important to be\n suitable for regional funding. Should have been a national scheme.\nMost LEPs will struggle to get agreement to pool funds for worthy schemes above £100\n million \nparticularly when local authorities find that other smaller improvements with benefits are esse\nntially shelved for many years.\nIn order to ensure delivery post 2015 LEPs should be advised to allocate revenue funding to promoters with approved programmed schemes to develop robust business cases.  \nWhat impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?A huge amount of extra work for everyone. A list of deliverable schemes needs to be developed following many years when limited funding was available for schemes development\n.\nHuge pressure on revenue budgets to develop the schemes at a time when \nl\nocal \na\nuthorities are facing budget pressures and staff cuts from an already low staff position.\nUnrealistic expectations from \ng\novernment about the amount of local contributions that \nare possible.\n&#xa0;\nHow can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?The challenge is to find a mecha\nnism which will give a financial return. The private sector will occasionally fund transport infrastructure that has a direct bearing on their business - eg \nthe A3 \nhospital roundabout\n in Guildford\n. But it is a lot harder to attract funding for more general\n infrastructure - eg a strategic junction.\nAlternative funding streams such as section 106/ CIL are possible, but there are many calls on them (\nsuch as the \nrising need for more school places).  \nHow clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?At the moment, not very! We do not know how the new growth fund governance arrangements will work, or how they will relate to local transport bodies.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
