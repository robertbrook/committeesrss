default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe definitive response to this question needs to come from
default Departmen
defaultts
default’ setting out their policies and practices.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is very difficult to address this
default question 
defaultfrom an external 
defaultperspective
default; it is surely 
defaultmore productive to ask
default 
defaultDepartment
defaults to specify the studies they have been involved in over the last 7–10 years
default,
default 
defaultand to
default report on what actions were taken as a consequence. An alternative
default way to get a good answer 
defaultwould be
default to poll 100 experts wh
defaulto have been involved in studies to ask if they can see any changes 18
default 
defaultm
defaultonths
default or so after they completed their work.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople who have been involved in Foresight reviews have noted the additional vigour regarding follow-up and regular 
defaultpost hoc 
defaultmonitoring when a Minister has been involved as 
defaultPrincipal 
defaultClient.  There has been very uneven practice regarding publicity and the 
defaultopportunity for open debate on studies and their findings
default.  Indeed
default,
default the allegation that
default for many 
defaultstudies the
default 
defaulta
defaultnalytic
default 
defaultcommunity has enjoyed the chase rather than the capture is probably correct.
default  
defaultThe Committee might find it useful to review the
default short-term 
defaultand long-term reviews of many of the Foresight projects to determine
default the
default impact of the work
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are a number of perceived shortcomings with the current position and it is not clear that the Day Review has recognised them
default,
default let alone addressed them.  The recommendations of the review seem to concentrate almost exclusively on the commissioning and governance processes.  
defaultGovernance
default is at best 
defaultof 
defaultacademic 
defaultinterest 
defaultand the problem with 
defaultcommissioning
default is the apparent reluctance to
default act at a very early stage.  To be effective
default,
default horizon scanning
default genuinely has to operate at the horizon and look forward; not wait until issues are 
defaultvisible and 
defaultbeginning to smoulder.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBut perhaps the weakest elements of the review are implementation and fol
defaultlow-up
default.  The interpretation of senior customers as Permanent Secretaries 
defaultet al
default is too narrow and
default 
defaultthere is no 
defaultmention of the need to
default link horizon scanning to the work of the Technology Strategy Board
default.  There is also a
default gap regarding the non-public sector
default –
default  
defaultt
defaulthe delivery of policy for many Departments (Health, 
defaultDefence
default, 
defaultTransport for example) rests heavily on public and private industry and it would seem sensible to expand the 
defaultmembership of both the CSAG and HSOG to reflect this.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2010 Science and 
defaultEngineering Assurance Review (SEA) of how the DfT used science and engineering evidence in its policy making showed that there were some significant dysfunctional disconnects in this process that would inhibit horizon scanning and subsequent strategic poli
defaultcy making.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is very difficult to address this
default question 
defaultfrom an external 
defaultperspective
default; it is surely more productive to ask 
defaultDepartment
defaults 
defaultor the Cabinet 
defaultOffice?
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSee also response to Q1.  Government has frequently been t
defaultoo slow and too privat
defaulte
default,
default not least because Chief Scientific Advisers are only loosely tied in to top level strategy and planning i
defaultn many Departments. There is a general flaw 
defaultwithin
default Departments
default of
default having too few external advisory bodies
default.  These tend to be 
defaultrelatively
default informal bodies operating at about Deputy Director level
default,
default discuss
defaulting
default technology movements, 
defaultindustry 
defaulttrends and
default 
defaultscientific developments and thus acting as the very early 
defaultdetectors of issues where a more structured approach would be justified.  There are particular
default problems in Transport where the fact that delivery rests with Local Authorities and Industry has been s
defaulteen as a reason to justify too much inactivity regarding tactical technology thinking.
