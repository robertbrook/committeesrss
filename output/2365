[normal]IET members’ 
[normal] 
[normal]involvement, both e
[normal]xternal
[normal]ly
[normal] and internal
[normal]ly
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with some studies 
[normal]s
[normal]uggests 
[normal]that:
[normal](a)
[normal]              
[normal]there is reluctance to 
[normal]consider commissioning 
[normal]work at the horizon because 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 
[normal]perceived 
[normal]lack of detail especially on costs and timing
[normal];
[normal](b)
[normal]              
[normal]what 
[normal]can be seen at the horizon is too easily ridiculed by cynics or the media
[normal],
[normal] so studies 
[normal]tend to be
[normal] 
[normal]launched somewhat later and are 
[normal]thus 
[normal]on issues that have already 
[normal]appeared
[normal] 
[normal]over the horizon
[normal];
[normal] and
[normal](c)
[normal]              
[normal]successful 
[normal]adoption and utilisation of
[normal] a study 
[normal]depends
[normal] 
[normal]on the extent to which the work was locked in to internal strategic thinking and option analysis and also the degree to which there was a political involvement either directly or 
[normal]via
[normal] Special Advisers.
[normal]In our experience, many
[normal] Departments are less than enthu
[normal]siastic about publicising their 
[normal]Horizon Scanning 
[normal]/ Foresight studies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The best examples have been 
[normal]when Departmental
[normal] stakeholders appoint champions from the Civil Service to push forward the studies and 
[normal]have 
[normal]an enthusiastic 
[normal]Minister
[normal] 
[normal]who 
[normal]endorse
[normal]s
[normal] it
[normal], for 
[normal]example the
[normal] Foresight 
[normal]“
[normal]Intelligent Infrastructure
[normal] 
[normal]Futures
[normal]”
[normal] study that reported in 2006 had this in terms of a Departmental lead 
[normal]from DfT 
[normal]and an interested Minister (Dr Stephen Ladyman
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The definitive response to this question needs to come from
[normal] Departmen
[normal]ts
[normal]’ setting out their policies and practices.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is very difficult to address this
[normal] question 
[normal]from an external 
[normal]perspective
[normal]; it is surely 
[normal]more productive to ask
[normal] 
[normal]Department
[normal]s to specify the studies they have been involved in over the last 7–10 years
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and to
[normal] report on what actions were taken as a consequence. An alternative
[normal] way to get a good answer 
[normal]would be
[normal] to poll 100 experts wh
[normal]o have been involved in studies to ask if they can see any changes 18
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]onths
[normal] or so after they completed their work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]People who have been involved in Foresight reviews have noted the additional vigour regarding follow-up and regular 
[normal]post hoc 
[normal]monitoring when a Minister has been involved as 
[normal]Principal 
[normal]Client.  There has been very uneven practice regarding publicity and the 
[normal]opportunity for open debate on studies and their findings
[normal].  Indeed
[normal],
[normal] the allegation that
[normal] for many 
[normal]studies the
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]nalytic
[normal] 
[normal]community has enjoyed the chase rather than the capture is probably correct.
[normal]  
[normal]The Committee might find it useful to review the
[normal] short-term 
[normal]and long-term reviews of many of the Foresight projects to determine
[normal] the
[normal] impact of the work
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are a number of perceived shortcomings with the current position and it is not clear that the Day Review has recognised them
[normal],
[normal] let alone addressed them.  The recommendations of the review seem to concentrate almost exclusively on the commissioning and governance processes.  
[normal]Governance
[normal] is at best 
[normal]of 
[normal]academic 
[normal]interest 
[normal]and the problem with 
[normal]commissioning
[normal] is the apparent reluctance to
[normal] act at a very early stage.  To be effective
[normal],
[normal] horizon scanning
[normal] genuinely has to operate at the horizon and look forward; not wait until issues are 
[normal]visible and 
[normal]beginning to smoulder.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]But perhaps the weakest elements of the review are implementation and fol
[normal]low-up
[normal].  The interpretation of senior customers as Permanent Secretaries 
[normal]et al
[normal] is too narrow and
[normal] 
[normal]there is no 
[normal]mention of the need to
[normal] link horizon scanning to the work of the Technology Strategy Board
[normal].  There is also a
[normal] gap regarding the non-public sector
[normal] –
[normal]  
[normal]t
[normal]he delivery of policy for many Departments (Health, 
[normal]Defence
[normal], 
[normal]Transport for example) rests heavily on public and private industry and it would seem sensible to expand the 
[normal]membership of both the CSAG and HSOG to reflect this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 2010 Science and 
[normal]Engineering Assurance Review (SEA) of how the DfT used science and engineering evidence in its policy making showed that there were some significant dysfunctional disconnects in this process that would inhibit horizon scanning and subsequent strategic poli
[normal]cy making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is very difficult to address this
[normal] question 
[normal]from an external 
[normal]perspective
[normal]; it is surely more productive to ask 
[normal]Department
[normal]s 
[normal]or the Cabinet 
[normal]Office?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]See also response to Q1.  Government has frequently been t
[normal]oo slow and too privat
[normal]e
[normal],
[normal] not least because Chief Scientific Advisers are only loosely tied in to top level strategy and planning i
[normal]n many Departments. There is a general flaw 
[normal]within
[normal] Departments
[normal] of
[normal] having too few external advisory bodies
[normal].  These tend to be 
[normal]relatively
[normal] informal bodies operating at about Deputy Director level
[normal],
[normal] discuss
[normal]ing
[normal] technology movements, 
[normal]industry 
[normal]trends and
[normal] 
[normal]scientific developments and thus acting as the very early 
[normal]detectors of issues where a more structured approach would be justified.  There are particular
[normal] problems in Transport where the fact that delivery rests with Local Authorities and Industry has been s
[normal]een as a reason to justify too much inactivity regarding tactical technology thinking.
