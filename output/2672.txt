[[[&#xa0;]]]The evidence I submit below is my opinion and recommendations relating to the ‘winding down’ of the Code for Sustainable Homes.&#xa0;I have worked for various architectural practices in Essex, as an Architectural Technician since 1986 (27 years). In 2007 my business partner and I set up a company called AA Energy Consultants, for the sole purpose of providing Code assessments. I have been a full time Code Assessor since 2008.&#xa0;&#xa0; 23 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
