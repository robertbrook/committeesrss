"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by WaterAid &#xa0;1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverview&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWaterAid transform\ns\n lives by improving access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in the world’s poorest communities. We work with \nlocal \npartners in 27 countries \nacross \nAfrica, Asia, Central America and the Pacific region, and influence decision-makers to maximise our impact. \n&#xa0;1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWaterAid believes that those responsible for \nensuring the delivery of \nWASH \nservices \nhave a key role in\n remov\ning\n societal barriers\n (access in the built environment, negative attitudes and a lack of consultation and involvement).  \nNo\n \none\n should be discriminated against \ndue to \nan \ni\nmpairment.\n&#xa0;1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGlobally, 2.5 billion people lack access to adequate sanitation, and over\n 76\n8\n million lack access to safe water\n. Th\nis \ncrisis \nparticularly affects \ndisabled people\n living in poverty\n. \nDisparities\n are even larger when\n disability\n combines with more than one form of exclusion, such as gender, remoteness, ethnicity, chronic illness and ageing\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisabled people in poor communities often lack WASH services because 1) facilities are not inclusive, 2) there is a serious lack of accessi\nble information available on low-cost, low-tech adaptations for WASH facilities, 3)\n negative attitudes lead\n to exclusion\n, and 4) \nthey \nare rarely meaningfully consulted or involved in \ndecisions about \nWASH \npolicy and \nprogrammes.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore research is needed to better \ndemonstrate\n \nhow a lack of WASH affects disabled people \nliving in poverty \nand their families, as well as the benefits of inclusive WASH approaches at scale. To help fill this knowledge gap, \nWaterAid, \nthe Water Engineering D\nevelopment Centre (WEDC) \nand \nLeonard Cheshire Disability (LCD) \nare collaborating on the \nUndoing Inequity \nproject. This is a DFID funded project through the Sanitation and Hygiene Applied Research for Equity (SHARE) consortium\n. \nT\nhe project\n \naim\ns\n to understa\nnd the barriers and opportunities that disabled\n people\n, \nolder persons \nand \nthose \nwith a chronic illness \nface \nin \naccessing WASH services in \none ward in \nZambia and \ntwo districts in \nUganda. \n&#xa0;1.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWaterAid’s response to this inquiry \nwill \ndraw on our\n knowledge of developing and delivering ‘inclusive WASH’ \nthat meets the needs of everyone through\nout their life.\n  This \nsubmission\n \nexplains the \nbarriers that disabled people face when accessing WASH services, how these can be addressed and recommendations f\nor DFID.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are the barriers that disabled people living in poverty face when accessing WASH services? &#xa0;Lack of access&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInaccessible WASH designs \ncan mean \nphysically disabled people \nare forced \nto crawl on the floor to use a toilet or defecate in the open. These difficulties are compounded when disabled women and girls have no facilities to manage menstruation. \n&#xa0;2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the \nUndoing Inequity\n project, over 40% of vulnerable household members in Uganda and Zambia \nsaid they \nwait for help to ‘go to the toilet’\n. In some cases\n,\n disabled people soil themselves while waiting. This \nheightens the risks of \nloss of dignity\n and \nself \nrespect\n, increased st\nigmatisation\n,\n \nand \nintensifie\nd\n burden on \ncarers. To reduce the need to relieve themselves, many disabled people limit their consumption of food and water. These issues have implications for their health and safety, and negatively affect their self esteem.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf water sources are too far away or inaccessibly designed, or water containers in the household are not accessible, disabled people rely on others to collect water for them. 26% of respondents \nfrom\n the\n \nUndoing Inequity\n \nresearch\n in Uganda said they do not have enough to drink because there is no one to help them access water\n. \nStigma and discrimination2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\ntigma and discrimination\n lead to exclusion from \nWASH services. For instance, \nin Uganda, the \nUndoing Inequity\n project revealed \nthat \n19% of\n \ndisabled \npeople\n were told by non-disabled people not to touch water because they \nwere\n ‘dirty’\n. Many disabled people \nhad been \njeered at when attempting to use a public toilet\n.\n&#xa0;\nLack of consultation and involvement&#xa0;2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nisabled people’s needs are largely absent from WASH \npolicies\n and standards.\n Existing information is rarely accessible, so \nthey \nmay be unaware of their rights and \nfeel unable \nto raise complaints.\n&#xa0;2.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA lack of accessible information on low cost, low tech adapt\nations for WASH facilities is a major barrier to WASH for disabled people\n. Materials used and methods applied to mobilise communities are rarely accessible for people with sensory impairments, so they do not receive the same information as non-disabled \npeople\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nisabled people are often excluded from decision-making processes that can directly affect their lives, and are rarely consulted or involved in WASH programmes. In Uganda, where adaptations to household toilets were made to make them more accessi\nble, only 50% of disabled people were consulted\n. This can \nlead to inappropriate design\n,\n \nmean\ning\n that disabled people remain un-served. \n&#xa0;2.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nWorld Health Organisation/Unicef Joint Monitoring Project (\nJMP\n)\n household surveys hide disparities within the hous\nehold.\n \nSHARE\n-\nfunded research in Uganda and Zambia clearly demonstrate\ns\n this\n.\n \nWhen asked if ‘everyone uses the same household toilet’\n in Uganda\n, 88% of household heads answered positively.\n \nThis compared to 73% when disabled\n people\n, older \npersons \nand \nthose\n \nwith a chronic illness were asked.\n \nIn Zambia the positive response dropped from 96% to 84%. To understand the situation fully\n, data must be disaggregated and \ndisabled people within the household \nneed to \nparticipate in \nsurveys.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;3               What are the solutions to address the barriers that poor disabled people face when accessing WASH services? Improving accessibility&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe most cost-effective way to improve accessibility for disabled people is to \ninvolve \nthem\n in the design \nprocess \nand \nincorporate inclusive \ntechnology\n \nfrom the outset, rather than making expensive changes later. WEDC research shows that the additional cost of making a \nnew \nschool latrine accessible is less than 3% of the overall cost of the latrine\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWaterAid and WEDC are \ndeveloping low tech, \nlow cost inclusive WASH adaptations and designs for the household and public places (eg schools, market places, health centres) to ensure people with disabilities are able to access them. These include safe and secure toilets with ramps, wider entrances, r\noom inside to allow a wheelchair user and a carer to enter and turn with ease, simple handrails, and movable wooden toilet seats that can be placed over pit latrines. Simple adaptations to water points include clearing the path to the water apron, putting \nin ramps, allowing room for a wheelchair user to turn easily, incorporating a water container resting stand, and fitting a t-handle bar to the handpump.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInstalling rainwater harvesting jars near disabled \npeople’s homes\n can reduce reliance on others to col\nlect water from handpumps that are far away. The rainwater can be used for washing, supplement\ning \ndrinking water collected from \nprotected \nwells. \n&#xa0;Challenging stigma and discrimination3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nToo often WaterAid hears \n‘\nthere are no disabled people in our community\n’\n or \n‘\nthere are no disabled children in the school\n’\n. This demonstrates that disabled people and children are being excluded and we challenge this.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy working with \nd\nisabled \np\neople’s \no\nrgani\ns\nations \n(DPOs) \nand assisting disabled people to realise their rights\n, \ndiscrimination and s\ntigma\n can be overcome\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nccessible information on inclusive WASH designs, including information on menstrual hygiene management, and running awareness-raising campaigns to highlight the issue of disability in relation to WASH and hu\nman rights\n is critical\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWaterAid \nencourages the local par\nt\nner organisations we invest in to work with disabled people’s \norganisations\n,\n and to include disabled people in decision\n \nmaking. We \npromote participatory community mobilisation\n and \nmonitoring and \nevaluation\n \nto \nenable\n different groups to take part, including those with less power. In the \nUndoing Inequity \nproject, more meaningful \nparticipation has led to increased social interactions between disabled and non-disabled people in Zambia\n. This in turn h\nas challenged stigma and improved disabled people’s self esteem and dignity\n.\n&#xa0;\nImproving consultation and involvement&#xa0;\n3.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsuring services can be used \nby \nall requires c\narrying out accessibility audits \nwith a range of people, including disabled people, to \nevaluate the accessibility of existing WASH facilit\nies\n and identify possible changes or improvements during planning and construction\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclusive WASH designs \nshould be \nshared in accessible formats (pictures\n for people who cannot hear\n or read\n and audio\n fo\nr people who cannot see\n) and \nlocal languages\n, so that \neveryone has access to relevant information about WASH technology options\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloping the\n capacity of practitioners to design inclusive WASH interventions can be improved over several stages. Awareness-raising can be carried out using mechanisms such as participatory \n‘\nbarrier analyses\n’\n including disabled people and DPOs at the community, distr\nict and national levels\n.  This also increases people’s awareness about the requirements and rights of disabled people\n.  T\nechnical training \nis \nthen \ngiven to address these barriers. Results show that disability \n‘\nspecialists\n’\n do not need to be employed to ma\ninstream inclusive WASH in development\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMulti-sectoral collaboration between disability, education, WASH and health stakeholders can help ensure that disability is mainstreamed within development.\n \nIf this is not done\n,\n we risk duplicating efforts \nand\n continuing to develop WASH solutions that are not accessible for \nall\n.\n&#xa0;3.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough the \nUndoing Inequity \nproject\n \nwe are working with the disability sector to generate rigorous evidence about how a lack of WASH \naffects \npoor \ndisabled people and their families.\n \nD\nPOs\n and disability service providers are providing specialist advice and guidance to ensure we encourage meaningful participation of disabled people in the total project cycle so that services are fully inclusive.\n DPOs\n are also \nhelping\n us \nrecognise \nthe political actors and \nunderstand the \nstructures in the disability sector\n, so we can collectively \nlobby for the realisation of \ndisabled people’s rights, including the right to water and sanitation.\n&#xa0;\n3.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough the \nUndoing Inequity \nproject\n, \nw\ne are developing\n data collection tools to gather information on WASH disaggregated by impairment (using the Washington Group categories of disability).\n \nOur household surveys identify family members \nwith additional access requirements, \nand \nask \nwhether or not everyone in th\ne household can use the public and private WASH facilities in their area.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations for DFID in order to mainstream inclusive WASH&#xa0;4.1. \n              \nUse the findings from the DFID-funded \nUndoing Inequity \nproject to mainstream\n inclusive WASH within DFID’s policy and practice, and encourage others to do the same. \nT\nhis means to:\n&#xa0;4.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPromote low cost, low tech accessible WASH designs\n, including \nmenstrual hygiene management facilities\n.  These must be \npart of school and hospital design\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure that investment in \nWASH \nthrough bilateral\n or\n multilateral aid or NGOs stipulates that \ninclusive practice and design is a core component\n of \nthe \nwork\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure \ninformation on inclusive WASH is communicated in an accessible way\n and community mobilisation methods can be understood by everyone.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRun accessible awareness-raising campaigns \nto highlight the issues of disability and WASH, facts about menstrual hygiene management, the rights of disabled people, including the right to w\nater and sanitation, as well as mechanisms for th\no\nse claiming rights\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure meaningful participation of disabled people throughout the total programme cycle.
