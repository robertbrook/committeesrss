AOAD is very keen in the implementation of the CRPD Convention along with the Afghan law for the \nwell-being\n of P.W.D, recent war victims and others in the country.  \n&#xa0;\nPersons with disability are challenged with \nPhysical\n barrier \nalso\n very limited rehabilitations\n facilities available only in the main provincial capital. U\nnemployment and barrier to education \nconfront access barriers on a daily basis\n for equal participation \ntheir life \nis not improved yet\n.\n There is general agreement that \nfinancial support for collection of \nbetter data\n with implementation is \nrequired to provide a basis for action and policy to address challenges to access\n comprehensively\n. However, basic prevalence data do not provide guidance to those who seek to dismantle barriers, and there is a lack of \nempowered disability organization \nbecause, currently they are \nlacked shortage of \nfunding\n for such activities for disability development activities \nin Afghanistan to proceed with data collection\n \nand analyst the situation and improve\n the\n activities.\n&#xa0;\nSituation of Rehabilitation of persons with disability in Afghanistan:Thousands of persons with disability both women/men and children lacked mobility problems there is no wheelchairs distribution\n free of charges\n including the crutches\n. I\nCRC has producing every month\n around\n 27 wheelchairs but\n it\n is only for their registered patients.\nHealthcare of persons with disability is a challengeable issue in Afghanistan. There are no free medical systems for free and accessible medical or surgery treatment for persons with disability only ICRC has some facilities but they \nare only operating\n mainly in Kabul, Mazar, Jalalabbad, Hirat. Theses provinces cannot say yes to the solution of the whole Afghanistan\n people with disability\n. ICRC has no limitation from others provinces\n they say yes to any Afghan with disability,\n but for persons with disability \nit \nis difficult \nfor coming from one province\n or far district to another long distance due to their poverty it is difficult to afford the expensive rent of bus with huge challengeable physical accessibility before receive artificial limbs or outhouses.\n&#xa0;\nEmployability of persons with disability in Afghanistan:Employment is an \nparts of the life for every one\n also it is basic rights\n \nof the human being,\n but people with disability are the poorer of the poor because, of their \nhaven\n-gone skills due to their disability\n, discrimination\n and\n lacked\n skills\n prevent them \nfrom\n work\n in the labor market\n lacked unemployment\n.\n \nIn Afghanistan, \nPersons with disability is always the last\n to\n be hired and the first to being \ndischarges.\n&#xa0;\nSustainability: Steps toward the elimination of all the above problems will be prevent\ning\n through sustainable development activities for inclusion of persons with disability in the job markets and providing equalizations are the followings:\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNeeds assessments \nsurvey \nfor persons with disability with \ndata \ncollection \nwith\n interest\n of P.W.D for interest\nable\n vocational training\n for \nsustainable jobs\n.\n  \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLobby and\n advocacy for implementation\n the Afghan law in general public\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding sustainable rehabilitations services with durable Artificial limbs and Outhouse’s\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMicro-Credit for self/help socio economical business.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAssistive technology such as wheelchairs, White Can and Crutches\n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImprovement of the physical accessibility with Ramps constructions and adaptation of classes and doo\nr\n steps\n schools\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n DFID activities in Afghanistan:As far as I know DFID\n in Afghanistan,\n they are spending\n for supporting the government,\n and\n also providing\n \nhuge support\n to \nInternational Organization as implementing partners for developmental and humanitarian’s\n affair\n. For Afghan disabled people NGOs,\n \nthey have very limited support to persons with disability in Afghanistan.\n I several time knocked the door of DFID in Afghanistan\n,\n they\n only\n said that we are supporting the International Organizations not have so far plan to support local NGOs. \nThere are very limited NGOs running by persons with disability \nworking \nfor \nthe \nmission and vision to support persons with disability\n in Afghanistan\n. I\nn the present context\n, many of the Afghan disabled people organization are collapsed\n due to the 2014\n alarm of the media. \n \nThe Afghan government has no systems to support the \nAfghan \nCSOs, DPOs and NGOs\n. Several Afghan NGOs working for persons with disability has \nshortage of\n funding for \ntheir \nactivities and administrative support \nbecause;\n the \ndonor’s\n agencies are not interesting to support disability development activities\n in Afghanistan because, it is not related to politics\n.\n&#xa0;\nDFID must take the responsibility to capacit\nat\ne the Afghan NGOs for expandable support to persons with \ndisability\n in the following systems:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMainstreaming disability as top agenda\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding long term developmental project with sustainable mission and vision\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnhance \ne\nmpowerment\n program to persons with disability for their equal participation as decision makers\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnhance disability equality\n program\n through leadership\n, \nmanagement\n program in the country and abroad\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEradication of poverty of the persons with disability through \nours \nowns decisions\n with \nself-help\n activities\n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntegration of children with disability to education with accessible schooling and provide schools fee \nfor their\n transportation as scholarships.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding support to improve the physical accessibility to change mindsets of general public regarding the equalization of persons with disability.\n&#xa0;\nOnce again thank you very much \n&#xa0;\nAbdul Khaliq zazai\nAOAD Director and founder\nCountry Rep of GAATES Canada for Afghanistan\nWeb: aoad-af.org \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
