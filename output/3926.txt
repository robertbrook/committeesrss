[[[Further submission from Sheffield City Council]]]

[[[Moor Market, Sheffield ]]]

[[[Note on EU Procurement Issues]]]

[[[Background]]]During the mid 2000’s, SCC treated with RREEF with a view to RREEF developing a new market building for SCC on block 6 to be purchased by SCC on completion of the building. RREEF appointed its own design team and worked up various schemes for the new market. However, partly because of RREEF’s main interests being as an investor rather than a developer as well as the property market crash of 2008 and, ultimately, its intention to dispose of its interest, the scheme did not progress.
