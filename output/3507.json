Is that right?\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\nChair: \nY\nou were in a key position of responsibility for the whole of the period that we are looking at?\n \nBarry Tootell: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ488 &#xa0; \nChair: Would you consider Project Verde to have been yours; that is, something that you primarily had responsibility for?\nBarry Tootell: Given the significance of the Verde opportunity, it was, quite rightly, something that the group had a major hand in. The group board, together with the bank board, had concluded that it wished to pursue the opportunity that was represented by Verde.\n&#xa0;\nQ489 &#xa0; \nChair: Mr Marks tells us that this was a matter primarily for the bank and not for the group board. Who is right?\nBarry Tootell: Mr Marks said it was primarily for the bank to decide whether it was able to complete the transaction. I think Mr Marks also said that he was\n a driving force behind it as he\n had the full support of the group board to consider the opportunity.\n&#xa0;\nQ490 &#xa0; \nChair: Where does primary responsibility lie for handling Project Verde?\nBarry Tootell: Project Verde or the acquisition of a major new business is a matter reserved for the group board. As the shareholder of the banking group, the bank could not acquire a major new subsidiary or a major new undertaking without the approval of the group board. However, it would be for the bank to decide whether it was able and wished to do the transaction. So primarily the bank, but if the bank wished to pursue the transaction it would have had to have sought approval from the group board.\n&#xa0;\nQ491 &#xa0; \nChair: We know the legal position here. We are trying to establish which individuals were driving the attempt to do this deal. Were you one of those?\nBarry Tootell: I was, yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ492 &#xa0; \nChair: Were you uneasy about the deal?\nBarry Tootell: I was concerned at various stages about the economic viability of the transaction, culminating in April 2013 when I recommended to my \nboard\n and to Peter Marks as group chief executive\n,\n that we should not pursue the transaction because of the lack of capital strength to do so. \nA\ns the group chief executive\n—\ngiven the key strategic importance of this initiative for the group\n—Peter Marks was also \nthe key driving force behind us exploring the opportunity.\n&#xa0;\nQ493 &#xa0; \nChair: \nSo y\nou were uneasy about it at various points?\nBarry Tootell: Rightly so. Given the size of the transaction, it would be—\n&#xa0;Q494 &#xa0; \nChair: When did you first become uneasy?\nBarry Tootell: \nAt\n the end of 2011, \nbeginning \n2012\n,\n we were going through the consideration of our indicative offer to Lloyds\n. W\ne were very clear that we had to make this economically viable and we were doing a lot of analysis to make sure that it did do just that\n, and then\n,\n d\nuring 2012\n,\n we continued to \nhave a \ndebate with Lloyds about the do-\nability of the transaction. That is not to say I was concerned and wished to pull the plug on the transaction, but it was quite right that I was concerned that it was the right thing for the group to do and I was challenging of our ability to do just that.\n&#xa0;\nQ495 &#xa0; \nChair: Did you discuss your uneasiness with Neville Richardson?\nBarry Tootell: No, I did\n not\n. Neville had left the business in July 2011.\n&#xa0;Q496 &#xa0; \nChair: But you said you first had concerns towards the end of 2011. You never discussed it with him?\nBarry Tootell: No.\n Could I just clarify, Chair?\nChair: He never had any influence over your views on this?\nBarry Tootell: \nA\nbsolutely not\n, no.\nBut to\n clarify what I mean there by “concern”\n:\n c\noncern that i\nt\n was the right transaction for us to do\n; c\noncern that we approach it with appropriate diligence to make sure it was the right transaction. \nTha\nt was not a concern that we could not do the transaction in 2011, it was merely a duty of care and detailed diligence over our capability. Concerns did emerge in 2012 \nabout\n the economics of the business that we were acquiring and the cost of integrating that business into our business\n,\n \nbecause \nt\nhe bank would have been acquiring the undertakings of the Verde business\n. Ou\nr ability to integrate that\n,\n together with the economics of the business that we were acquiring\n,\n w\nere\n a concern \nat that time and w\ne had those discussions with Lloyds about our lack of willingness to proceed.\n&#xa0;\nQ497 &#xa0; \nChair: I understand. One further question. Did you leave o\nf\n your own accord or were you eased or pushed out? I do\n not\n want to question with respect to employment law. I am asking you a question with respect to exchanges that you will have had.\nBarry Tootell: That is fine. If I could clarify the terms on which I came into the role in the first place. I was \na\ncting \nc\nhief \ne\nxecutive from mid-2011 at the point when Mr Richardson left the business. I was brought into that role to consider whether the transaction of Verde was viable for the group\n,\n and then the group would have to decide who the chief executive would be going forward. So in a way I came into the role to assess the Verde transaction. In January 2013\n,\n \nI had a discussion with my chairman\n,\n \nand with my chairman of \nr\nemco\n. I said\n I did not see myself staying on in the role even if we did not do the Verde transaction.\n&#xa0;Q498 &#xa0; \nChair: You had already decided to go\n.\nBarry Tootell: I had had the conversation in January 2013. I would say the timing of my departure was as much in the hands of the new group chief executive—\n&#xa0;Q499 &#xa0; \nChair: \nJ\nust remind us\n who that conversation\n was with\n.\nBarry Tootell: I had three conversations. I had a conversation with my chairman in January 2013 about my medium-term future with the business. I had the same conservation at the same time with my \nc\nhairman of \nthe r\nemuneration \nc\nommittee\n. T\nhen in early May, after the arrival of the new group chief executive, Euan Sutherland, I had a similar conversation with Euan about his plans and my plans for the future.\n&#xa0;Q500 &#xa0; \nChair: \nB\ny the beginning of 2013\n,\n \nyou had made up your mind \nthat you were looking to go\n?\nBarry Tootell: At some stage.\n Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ501 &#xa0; \nChair: I am not pressing this point. I am trying to clarify whether you were pushed out or whether you left on your own accord\n. Y\nou are giving us a very clear steer that you had already made up your mind and you were thinking about this \nfor many\n months, perhaps up to a year, before you did go.\nBarry Tootell: Yes, indeed, and I made that point clear with my chairman.\n&#xa0;\nQ502 &#xa0; \nChair: One last point before I hand over questioning to colleagues. In the overview to the Co-op’s 2012 financial statement you said, “Our balance sheet remains strong\n”.\n Were Moody’s already in \nthe \nCo-op by that time\n,\n looking at your papers?\nBarry Tootell: \nNeither Moody’s\n nor Fitch were ever in the business looking at our papers.\n&#xa0;Q503 &#xa0; \nChair: They never asked you for papers? They never asked you for any information in order to do their assessment?\nBarry Tootell: Yes. They were not in the business. It is common practice for banks to brief the rating agencies on\n the\n—\nChair: I am using that metaphorically.\nBarry Tootell: Okay, sorry.\nChair: They obtained briefings\n.\nBarry Tootell: Yes, we had \nbriefed \nthe rating agencies\n.\nChair: \nO\nn privileged terms.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;Q504 &#xa0; \nChair: I am asking you whether they were already engaged in those privileged briefings.\nBarry Tootell: We \nhad \nbriefed them at the time of the March 2013 announcement of the 2012 results. We had briefed both rating agencies at that time and\n,\n when I say the balance sheet was strong, we had—\n&#xa0;Q505 &#xa0; \nChair: I just want to clarify this role of Moody’s. They were already engaged with you at the time that you have said, “Our balance sheet remains strong”, or not? That was on 20 March 2013.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\nChair: They were?\nBarry Tootell: They were engaged and they had been engaged for years gone by. This was not an immediate engagement.\n&#xa0;Q506 &#xa0; \nChair: This is not a continuous engagement by rating agencies, is it? At specific periods when they look at specific questions\n,\n they have a heightened level of involvement\n.\nBarry Tootell: They do and they take the—\nChair: We will agree that they do. \nT\no say that they were continuously involved could have been misleading, but we have cleared that up.\nBarry Tootell: Sorry, if I may cla\nrify?\nChair: They were at a heightened level of engagement at the time?\nBarry Tootell: At the time.\nChair: At that time\n, r\night.\nBarry Tootell: Typically \nthey would \nmeet \nme\n and the chief financial officer\n every six months,\n and they did so in March 2013.\n&#xa0;\nQ507 &#xa0; \nChair: Six weeks later they downgraded you\n.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;Q508 &#xa0; \nChair: A £1.5 billion capital shortfall was exposed. Is that correct?\nBarry Tootell: The £1.5 billion shortfall was announced by the PRA to the markets in June 2013.\n&#xa0;Q509 &#xa0; \nChair: Yes, so only a few weeks after that. Within a few weeks\n,\n not only had you been downgraded but the regulator had \nalso \nsaid you need\ned\n a \nlot more capital—a huge\n amount more capital\n—\nbearing in mind your size in relation to your balance sheet, core tier 1.\n \nIs that correct?\nBarry Tootell: Correct.\n&#xa0;\nQ510 &#xa0; \nChair: In retrospect\n, would you think that\n saying, “Our balance sheet remains strong” was misleading?\nBarry Tootell: We continued to have a 9.2% core tier 1 ratio in March 2013. We had had 9.6% CT1 in year-end 2010 and 2011 from memory, but certainly 2011 was 9.6%. \nD\nespite the difficulties the business was facing\n,\n in terms of impairment emerging through the \nP\n and \nL\n and hitting the balance sheet clearly, CT1 remain\ned\n at 9.2%. We were very careful not to mislead the markets by using words such as “strong’ too glibly. Nevertheless\n,\n CT1 at 9.2% was regarded as being \nbroadly \nconsistent with the CT1 we had previously had, despite taking the hit.\n&#xa0;\nQ511 &#xa0; \nChair: I will quote another line, “The bank’s underlying financial strength remains intact\n”.\n It is a bit difficult to square with a £1.5 billion capital call, isn’t it?\nBarry Tootell: That was referring to the analysis of the business between core and non-core\n. I\nf you look into the year-end financial statements\n,\n you will see the core profitability of the business remaining at a viable level and the losses essentially emerging out of the non-core business, which is the asset deterioration in the non-core portfolio, together wit\nh the one-off hit for the write \noff of the intangible assets and the provisions for PPI. The underlying business still remain\ned\n profitable\n,\n and that was what that statement referred to.\n&#xa0;\nQ512 &#xa0; \nChair: While you \nsay \nthat \nthat \nremark and the remark\n that\n, “The balance sheet remains strong\n”\n, were carefully thought through\n—\nwhich is what you are telling me now\n—\nwhen you were doing that thinking through\n,\n you already had in mind the risk that there might be a downgrade and \na\n need to handle the £1.5 billion capital shortfall. Is that correct?\nBarry Tootell: It was, but it was not a £1.5 billion capital shortfall in the way in which the PRA announced it in June. What we had was a future capital requirement, which we had been discussing with the PRA during \nquarter one\n \nof \n2013 as a medium-term requirement for us to achieve a certain level of capital for regulatory purposes. That is not a hole in the balance\n \nsheet in the year-end 2012. That is a requirement on us to increase our capital on a go-forward basis. At that time, certainly by March 2013, we had announced our intention to sell our general insurance business and we were already in the process of completing the transaction to sell our life and savings business. The capital from both those transactions was to be redeployed into the bank\n,\n and that was intended to offset the deteriorating capital base because of the non-core business.\n&#xa0;\nQ513 &#xa0; \nChair: You were already well aware of the things that Moody’s might find and that the PRA were finding, but you felt that that was consistent with being able to say that your balance sheet remained strong?\nBarry Tootell: Yes, but there was nothing for Moody’s to find. We had been very open with the regulator and with rating agencies\n,\n in terms of the asset quality of the balance sheet. Moody’s assessment of our credit rating was based upon their look-forward basis of assessing that asset credit quality and the means by which they thought we would accommodate that\n,\n and their judgment was a multi-notch downgrade of the business way beyond that which we anticipated.\n&#xa0;\nQ514 &#xa0; \nChair: I know I have asked this question before\n,\n but it will strike some as something of a surprise that saying that your balance sheet remain\ned\n strong was not in any way misleading the market, bearing in mind that you have said you were already fully aware of the concerns that led to the £1.5 billion capital shortfall at the time \nthat \nyou made it.\nBarry Tootell: We were comfortable with that statement, yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ515 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nThat flows into the questions I want to ask you. \nYou are a qualified person with respect to \na \nfinancial services business. On the one hand you are saying you went out to the market and you said, “Yes, our balance sheet is okay”, when clearly you were holed below the waterline in some way. I am curious\n, d\nid you rely a lot on your accountants to make that judgment call\n,\n or where did that judgment call come from in terms of saying, “Our balance sheet is okay”, when subsequently it was\n not\n?\nBarry Tootell: The point refers to the balance sheet 9.2 status, which is the ratio of our core equity to our risk-weighted assets.\n&#xa0;Q516 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nNo, \nI understand that\n.\n \nB\nut clearly there was a problem\n though, right?\nBarry Tootell: \nT\nhere was a problem that we were addressing. This is the requirement for us to increase our capital still further, which we were doing\n,\n by divesting other aspects of our business within the broader Co-operative Banking Group and redeploying it into the bank to face off against what we saw as the deteriorating capital base in the underlying non-core business.\n&#xa0;\nQ517 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: Who were your accountants at the time?\nBarry Tootell: Our auditors were KPMG.\n&#xa0;Q518 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: What feedback were you getting from them to give you the confidence to come out and say what you said with respect to your balance sheet? I don’t want to tread on Mr Love’s territory, but I \nam\n just curious.\nBarry Tootell: Extensive discussion in terms of the wording of the statutory accounts for the year-end 2012. That review takes place within my finance community, in dialogue with the auditors, ultimately into the audit committee and to the board itself. It is a board statutory account approval process.\n&#xa0;Q519 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nW\nith the benefit of hindsight, \ndo you think their advice in the end \nwas a little dodgy or not at all?\nBarry Tootell: No, there was discussion around the appropriateness of wording, as there always is in any statutory accounts process\n. W\ne were comfortable that that statement, together with the plans that we had in place, was appropriate to address the go-forward capital requirements of the business. \nA\ns I say, it reflects the fact that we had a 9.2% core tier 1 ratio for the year ended—\nMr Newmark: \nYou \nkeep repeating that.\nBarry Tootell: It is very appropriate for the accounts that we were commenting upon.\n&#xa0;\nQ520 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: But from the market’s perspective, it did not \nsubsequently \naddress the fact that you had a huge problem with your balance sheet. No?\nBarry Tootell: There is a differen\nce\n between the year-end statutory accounts and the regulatory requirements that we had for the future that we were doing something about.\n&#xa0;\nQ521 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: Neville Richardson’s written evidence suggests that\n,\n in May 2008\n,\n \nBritannia was approached \nby David Anderson, chief executive officer of Co-op Financial Services, to broach the subject of a merger between the two organisations. Is this your recollection, namely that the Co-op was the activist partner in seeking a merger?\nBarry Tootell: I know Mr Richardson has said that. My first recollection or awareness of the opportunity to acquire the Britannia business was David Anderson announcing to our executive committee that he had had a discussion with Neville. I honestly do not know who approached who.\n&#xa0;\nQ522 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: Do you think that he was the driving force behind the merger or who was?\nBarry Tootell: I think both parties were keen to explore the opportunity that the merger or the acquisition presented. I honestly don’t know whether Neville approached David or vice versa.\n&#xa0;Q523 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: In board minutes there was nothing in there giving any sense of which direction the pressure was coming from?\nBarry Tootell: We could check, but I am not aware of such.\n&#xa0;\nQ524 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: What was the rationale from the Co-op’s perspective of seeking to merge with Britannia?\nBarry Tootell: We were a £15 \nb\nillion banking business with only 90 branches and, therefore,\n sub\nscale in distribution reach\n,\n and \nsubscale\n in balance sheet size in order to serve our customers and our members better\n. I\nt was always the intention of the business to seek to expand its reach to our customers. Therefore, the 250-branch network of Britannia was of significant interest to us because it would broaden and deepen our reach within the \nUK\n. In addition to \nthat\n,\n we were a clearing bank\n,\n but we had a relatively small savings and mortgage business, yet Britannia complementarily had a very significant mortgage and savings presence.\n&#xa0;Q525 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: You reckoned between the two management teams you had the management depth to make sure that was all integrated and everything fine?\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;\nQ526 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: Who else within the Co-op was pushing for a merger between the two organisations\n,\n and was the group or the bank pushing more strongly for a merger?\nBarry Tootell: It was an interesting opportunity that was presented to us. We were not trawling the market looking for targets. I believe\n it was\n through David Anderson’s previous relationships with chief executives of building societies, given that he used to be the chief executive of the Yorkshire Building Society—\nso \nhe knew many of his counterparties in the industry on the mutual side—that that meeting came about. It was not because we were searching \nfor \na\n target and who within our business was supportive—\n&#xa0;Q527 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: It sounds like Mr Anderson was the one pushing a little bit more\n,\n in that it is \nsort of \nimplicit \nfrom\n what you sa\ny\n.\nBarry Tootell: I could\n not\n say. I am suggesting that they knew each other through\n that relationship.\n&#xa0;Q528 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nNo, I know \nthat element of a relationship\n. We all know loads of people\n. B\nut somebody is taking a more activist approach. I am trying to get to understand who was taking the more activist approach in this.\nBarry Tootell: I am sorry, I could\n not\n comment. I don’t know who was driving more so than the other. My understanding at the time was that both parties were keen to explore the opportunity.\n&#xa0;Q529 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nRight\n. B\nut they did\n not\n suddenly wake up one morning\n,\n each independently\n,\n and say, “Gee, it would be a great idea if we got together”. Somebody must have approached one or the other.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed\n, o\nne of them must have made the first contact\n.\nMr Newmark: So who was it?\nBarry Tootell: \nI don’t know the answer to your question, I am afraid.\nMr Newmark: Come on. Okay, fine.\nChair: Are you sure about that?\nBarry Tootell: Yes. I would have told you, Chairman, if I had known the answer.\nChair: Okay.\nMr Newmark: It would be interesting to see if there were any board minutes or anything.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;\nQ530 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: I will let Mr Chairman figure out if we can get hold of those. Peter Marks told us that\n,\n while he voted for the Britannia deal as a non-executive director, he was not driving the Britannia deal. Is that the case and, if so, what does it say about group oversight of the activities of the bank?\nBarry Tootell: At the time\n,\n the governance structure of the business was a little different. David Anderson did not have a direct reporting line to Peter Marks and Peter Marks was not as involved in the banking group business as he has been for probably the past two or three years. Yes, David Anderson was the driver of the transaction from within the banking group or from within the Co-operative group. You are right with your summary of the situation, which was that Peter Marks was supportive of the transaction as a non-executive of the bank\n. I\nndeed\n,\n he spoke in favour of the transaction\n,\n in his capacity as the group chief executive\n,\n in the group board meeting that finally made the decision to progress the transaction.\n&#xa0;Q531 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: But based on information that he received during the board meetings as opposed to any other ambitions for the group or anything like that?\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;Q532 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nOr did it tie in with his ambitions for the group?\nBarry Tootell: Strategically\n,\n it was the right thing for the banking group\n,\n and he supported it for that reason. He was not involved in detailed day-to-day conversations with David Anderson\n that I am aware of,\n in the way that he has \nbeen \nmore recently with me in the context of the Verde transaction.\n&#xa0;Q533 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nY\nou would not say that\n,\n once he was sold on the idea\n,\n he was championing the deal in any particular way internally?\nBarry Tootell: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ534 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: How did Britannia react to the approach from the Co-op?\nBarry Tootell: Again, I do\n not\n know whether Co-op approached Britannia. How did Britannia react to the opportunity? They were optimistic \nabout \ncompleting the transaction and, again\n,\n from their point of view \nthey thought \nthat it was a very complementary transaction. If I look now at the Britannia business, what didn’t they have that they would benefit from by a transaction with the Co-operative\n? T\nhey did not have bank clearing capability. They did not have internet capability. They did not have \nthe \ngeneral insurance and life assurance manufacturing capability that we had. \nSo t\nhe complementary nature of the transaction was appealing to both parties.\n&#xa0;\nQ535 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: It might have been complementary\n,\n but do you think it was more of a rescue operation of Britannia or was it a merger of some sort of equals in your view?\nBarry Tootell: An incredibly interesting question in the context of what we have seen happen over the past years with hindsight, but, no, at the time—\n&#xa0;Q536 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: You thought it was a merger of equals\n,\n not a rescue operation?\nBarry Tootell: We were very clear to make that sort of comment to the marketplace\n,\n and we genuinely believed that from within the bank and in all the discussions that we had with Britannia. There was no sense from Britannia or from our business that this was a rescue of Britannia. \nIt was n\never discussed in our boardroom\n,\n and to my knowledge\n was never\n discussed in the Britannia boardroom and never discussed between parties and never discussed with the regulators. This was a bringing together of two businesses that were complementary.\n&#xa0;\nQ537 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: In putting the two businesses together, there was nobody internally saying, “\nT\nhis is not a merger of equals; these guys could be in a bit of trouble here and we have leverage in this merger”? It was truly a sense of \nthe \nmerger of equals?\nBarry Tootell: No.\nMr Newmark: \nNo\n?\n \nY\nes?\nBarry Tootell: No as in, no, we did not think\n that.\nMr Newmark: \nNo\n,\n you didn’t see it.\nBarry Tootell: The only comment to that end is a comment made in the final group board meeting\n,\n when one of the directors noted, “Perhaps Britannia need this a little bit more than we do”\n. A\npart from that passing comment\n,\n there was never \nany \ndiscussion.\n&#xa0;Q538 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: I am curious\n,\n what led that pers\non to make that comment?\nBarry Tootell: Just the assessment of the relative capital strength of each business. Capital was slightly more constrained at Britannia\n,\n because \nat the time the FSA was encouraging them to improve \ntheir capital planning capability and was asking them to hold back capital because of that. So they were slightly more constrained. That was an issue that was removed on acquisition or merger because\n,\n under our capital planning oversight and stewardship\n,\n that capital planning issue was waived by the FSA. In standalone terms, perhaps Britannia needed the transaction slightly more because they were slightly more constrained, but this was never ever discussed as a rescue in any way, shape or form within the business.\n&#xa0;\nQ539 &#xa0; \nMr Newmark: \nSo t\nhere was no pressure \nf\nrom the regulatory authorities or even the Government to encourage this—I view it as a rescue operation of Britannia—merger with Britannia? There was no pressure from either the regulator or the Government to do this?\nBarry Tootell: Not at all to my knowledge. I did\n not\n have any such conversations with regulators or Government.\n&#xa0;\nQ540 &#xa0; \nMr Love: I draw the Committee’s attention to my designation as a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament\n.\n Mr Tootell, what role did you play in the due diligence that the Co-op conducted on Britannia?\nBarry Tootell: The due diligence was undertaken under my area of responsibility as \na\n CFO\n.\n \nI\nt was undertaken by KPMG working with my risk officer who reported directly to \nme\n, s\no it was my responsibility.\n&#xa0;\nQ541 &#xa0; \nMr Love: \nW\nhen he appeared before the Committee\n, Peter Marks told us that\n the Co-operative Bank had relied very heavily on the fair value and due diligence work that was done on its behalf by KPMG. Would you agree with that statement and do you think you were overly reliant on the advice and work undertaken by KPMG?\nBarry Tootell: That is a very interesting question, again\n,\n with the benefit of hindsight. If I refer to even more recent publications\n from\n the \nParliamentary Commission on Banking Standards\n, which has a real focus on responsibility of officers and directors. I take responsibility for the due diligence that we had undertaken\n.\n I do not blame KPMG for any retrospective view of the shortfall in that due diligence work. Yes, we took comfort from it, but I \ndo not\n believe that management abdicates responsibility by engaging consultants or advisers to assist them in their work. \nSo, y\nes, we did take comfort from the KPMG work\n—\njust as I took comfort from the work that my risk team and my finance team had done\n—\nbut ultimately it was the board’s decision to do the transaction based on that input.\nIf I could just comment for a moment, Chairman, on the content of that work or the timeframe within which that work was done. This was done in late 2008\n,\n when the \nlevel of arrears in the Britannia business was\n relatively low. We identified the areas of risk within the Britannia business and, notably, \nthey were the non-conforming\n,\n self\n-certified mortgage books in the platform intermediary portfolio\n,\n together with the distress\ned\n books that they had acquired from General Motors or GMAC, together with the level of exposure that may sit within the corporate book. We made sure that we focused on those areas when we did the due diligence work and we assessed them based on our understanding of those areas. We stressed them based on our future economic outlook for the \nUK\n economy.\nThat future economic outlook accorded with Bank of England publications at the time in terms of where we as a \nUK\n economy thought the economy was going. The board assessed that and took comfort from that and, even in the board meeting where we finally made the decision to proceed with the transaction in January 2009, there was commendation for KPMG and the due diligence work by JP\n \nMorgan\n,\n for the thoroughness of the due diligence, the rigour within which we assessed the stress areas of the book\n and\n the capital planning of the business.\nI look back with the benefit of hindsight and think that we have had a lot more credit risk exposure from the Britannia business than we ever thought possible. At the time we genuinely thought we had put appropriate fair value in place to protect ourselves. We put almost £700 million of fair value in place beyond that which the auditors of Britannia\n—\nwhich is PwC\n—\nand the Britannia management and board felt \nappropriate,\n based on their provisioning work that they would have done in the natural course of business. We put an additional £700 million away. \nW\nith the benefit of hindsight, \nthat has proved \nnot to be enough. Do I think that KPMG let me down at that time? My personal view is, no, they did\n not\n. Based upon the economic circumstance at the time\n,\n I think they did a very, very thorough high-quality job\n that \nI took comfort from\n,\n as the chief financial officer, as did my board.\n&#xa0;\nQ542 &#xa0; \nMr Love: We will come to the emergence of impairments in a moment, but let me ask you\n this\n. You mentioned all the risky aspects of the Britannia balance sheet. I understand KPMG did all the work in projecting various scenarios, but did they throw up any concern that the level of risky assets on their balance sheet might cause problems in difficult economic circumstances?\nBarry Tootell: Yes, because otherwise we would not have put £700 million of fair value protection aside to protect ourselves. They did not raise issues beyond that which we could afford within the capital plan for the combined business and, therefore, the business was a viable and attractive proposition for the Co-operative business. They raised several areas that were insightful and helpful to management in considering the transaction.\nInterestingly, with all that we have seen more recently in terms of the emergenc\ne\n of significant losses from the non-core business of the Co-operative, which almost exclusively contains the Britannia assets—there is some Co-operative asset in there, but it is mainly Britannia assets—much of that exposure that has come out in 2012 and 2013 has related to the corporate business and not the intermediary business. At the time\n,\n we were much more concerned about the intermediary business and we did extensive work on that. That is not to say that we did not look at the corporate business, but that was not the major area of concern at the time. It was the intermediary business that was the major focus for us.\n&#xa0;\nQ543 &#xa0; \nMr Love: Who do you hold responsible for not looking at what turned out to be a very risky area? Do you accept responsibility yourself on behalf of the Co-op Bank or should KPMG, carrying out their functions as regards the due diligence, have thrown this up as a possible problem area? What I am trying to get to is \nthat \nyou accept that KPMG did the best it could. I am trying to figure \nout \nhow reliant the Co-op was on the judgments made by KPMG \nin\n the negotiations over the merger with Britannia.\n \nThat is what Peter Marks said, but you seem to be suggesting that the responsibility lay with the Co-op\n,\n rather than the advice given by KPMG.\nBarry Tootell: To be clear, we did not blindly make a decision based upon the evidence of KPMG. We took comfort from KPMG’s input to us. If I look back, do I take responsibility? I take responsibility as the CFO, with oversight of the due diligence process\n,\n for the support I gave to my \nchief executive\n and my board in an important decision\n.\n I took comfort, as my board took comfort, from the support of advisers. Do I look back and think of the economic circumstance at the time\n,\n and do I think that they missed something? \nT\nhey were working on the basis of economic project\nion\ns that were consistent with Bank of England and market consensus\n;\n they were doing that assessment of the business only three \nor\n four months after the FSA conducted a supervisory review of Britannia and reaffirmed, give or take, a £30 \nmillion \nor £40 million—I think it was\n from\n memory—increase in their capital requirement\n. B\nroadly speaking, the FSA reaffirmed the capital requirements of Britannia, having done a thorough supervisory review process.\n \nAs I say, \nwe and \nKPMG did a review of the risk areas of Britannia, based upon current and stressed economic projection\ns\n. I can think of no individual or committee or board or firm—in the sense of KPMG—that did not exercise the utmost professional care in pursuing what was an important transaction for \nthe group\n. Were we right in hindsight? \nSelf-evidently\n,\n no. \nA\ns we have seen over the past three years, the \nlevel of losses from that business far exceeds\n that which we reasonably thought could come to pass.\n              \nChair: We are going to move on, Andy. One very last quick question and a quick reply, please.\n&#xa0;\nQ544 &#xa0; \nMr Love: One last question\n. I\nt is in relation to KPMG as auditor, \nwhich has \nvery specific responsibilities. How important a role do KPMG have in relation to the statements that have been made through this recent period, where you have gone from having limited impairments to having significant impairments and a deterioration in the capital position? Did KPMG authorise all the statements that were made or did they advise that these statements might be inappropriate at any particular time?\nBarry Tootell: No, we had no disagreement with KPMG in terms of our published financial statements.\n&#xa0;\nQ545 &#xa0; \nMr Love: \nAs the auditor,\n they approved all the statements that were made?\nBarry Tootell: Yes, they did. It is not really for them to approve, it is for the board of the business to approve. It is not for the auditors to approve, but they gave appropriate \nconfirmation\n to the shareholders and the directors as a combination of their audit work on the accounts.\n&#xa0;\nQ546 &#xa0; \nMr Love: \nT\nhere were no discussions that the statements \nmight\n be misleading the market from your auditors, KPMG?\nBarry Tootell: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ547 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Mr \nTootell\n, I am grateful for the clarity of your responses so far, thank you.\n              \nSo \nKPMG \nwe\nre the auditors to the Co-op at the time of the Britannia transaction, PwC \nwe\nre the auditors \nto\n Britannia\n. Can you remind us w\nho \nyour financial advisers were\n?\nBarry Tootell: The financial advisers for the transaction on the Co-op side were JP Morgan.\n&#xa0;\nQ548 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Yes, and who on the Britannia side?\nBarry Tootell: I\n believe i\nt was Citigroup.\n&#xa0;\nQ549 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Very quickly, what were the terms of the merger?\nBarry Tootell: The \nterms of the merger were\n a zero consideration transaction. There was no payment made.\n&#xa0;\nQ550 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: From the point of view of if you were a Britannia mutual member and you became a mutual member of the enlarged whole; if you were a Co-op member, you became a Co-op member of the enlarged whole, there was no other form of recognition of value as between the two groups?\nBarry Tootell: Interesting perspective then, because members of the Co-operative are not members of the banking business\n. T\nhey are members of \nthe group\n, so—\n&#xa0;\nQ551 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Yes, but you had that exposure to the banking business through the Co-op.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed, but the Co-operative members do not become a member of the enlarged business. They remain members of the Co-operative Group. \nW\ne enabled and accelerated a process by which all members\n of Britannia\n—and bear in mind \nthat \nnot all customers of Britannia were members of Britannia—were to become members of the Co-operative movement on an accelerated basis. \nT\nhe terms of paying \na \ndividend to members was different from a Co-operative versus a Britannia\n. I\nt was not a dividend in the Britannia world, but as a mutual they paid something called \na \nBritannia Member\nship\n Reward, BMR\n. W\nhat we did was accommodate the members of Britannia with a transitional arrangement whereby we would enable them to earn a dividend within the Co-operative movement\n, which \nwas no less than they would have otherwise earned as a member of Britannia. That was the only concession made.\n&#xa0;\nQ552 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: From your point of view then, this has been a disaster from the Co-op members’ side, because they have had an exposure to a Britannia book that has turned out to be vastly worse than anyone could have anticipated. Britannia members have done remarkably well, because they have come into the Co-op Group as accelerated mutual members of the whole. Is that right?\nBarry Tootell: Yes, in broad terms.\n&#xa0;\nQ553 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Because otherwise the Britannia members would have been forced to have the share of their own mutual\n. T\nhey would have had to bear the full value of the £1.5 billion shortfall that we found in the Britannia balance sheet.\nBarry Tootell: Yes. In hindsight, \nI find it hard to envisage \nwhat the future of the Britannia business would have looked like on the emergence of the losses from \nits \ncommercial book, as we have now seen it. \nT\nhen again, in isolation, neither can I predict what the management of Britannia would have done to accommodate that emerging issue.\n&#xa0;\nQ554 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: But it is a reasonable assumption that Britannia would have been wiped out if it discovered the size of this without the capital strength of the Co-op to keep it afloat?\nBarry Tootell: Or they would have sought other means of addressing their issues. If I may just diverge for one second, Chairman—\n              Jesse Norman: Very quickly, if you do not mind, because I have a very short period of time to ask questions.\nBarry Tootell: \nI\nf I look at what has caused the demise of the Co-operative business in the here and now, it \nhas\n essentially come out of two major things, one of which is the cost of redress on PPI, together with the asset decline of the business\n,\n and a significant part of that is the non-core assets that I have discussed.\nI\nn terms of our means of accommodating those issues, there are two means available to a business. It is either \nto \ngenerate profits to increase retained earnings and\n,\n therefore\n,\n capital\n,\n or \nto \nraise new capital. As a co-operative, we cannot generate new capital because we do not have market access in the way others do\n. I\nnterestingly, taking you back to the Britannia analysis, a building society does have market access because it can\n—\nas Nationwide has announced this year\n—\nissue CCDS as a means of raising capital. That is not available to the Co-operative.\n&#xa0;\nQ555 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: \nTherefore,\n if anything, the Co-op board\n—\nboth the board of Co-op \nF\ninancial \nS\nervices and the board of \nCo-op Group—\nwas under a special obligation to ensure that there was nothing bad about the Britannia assets because they had limited other recourse to raising other forms of capital?\nBarry Tootell: Yes.\n \nWe have seen\n \nthat \nthe model of \nthe \nCo-operative is very conservative, notwithstanding what you see as being the difficulties the business has just faced here and now, partly because of that, because it cannot raise capital.\nChair: Not conservative enough\n,\n though.\nJesse Norman: It is conservative enough to have been wiped out by this incautious acquisition.\nChair: \nYes,\n exactly.\n&#xa0;Q556 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Mr Tootell, Neville Richardson stated to us that he opposed proceeding with the Verde transaction in July 2011. He said mounting pressures were facing CFS, putting it at unacceptable risk because the merger had not achieved full integration. Is that your recollection of events?\nBarry Tootell: It was one of the transitional programmes that we would have to face as a business. Neville’s main debate with the board—and I think he is on record in this Committee—was the Unity programme, but the Verde opportunity would have been yet another transitional or change programme that we would have had to face.\n&#xa0;\nQ557 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: \nD\nid you share Mr Richardson’s position that this was the right deal at the wrong time?\n              Barry Tootell: We ha\nd\n undoubtedly been busy, to say the least, considering the Verde opportunity, in and among managing the BAU business.\n&#xa0;\nQ558 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: So you were being massively stretched at that time?\nBarry Tootell: We were stretched, but that did not stop us doing the right thing by the business and at the same time considering the opportunity, and at the same time embracing the Unity programme.\n&#xa0;\nQ559 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Did he express concerns to you at the time about the Verde transaction and the Unity transaction?\nBarry Tootell: We had no extensive debate on the Verde opportunity at that time. It was an interesting opportunity, which\n,\n by the time that Neville left the \nbusiness;\n we had done very limited work on Verde. The main debate—and indeed, Neville is correct with what he said to this \nCommittee\n—that he had in the boardroom was with regard to the Unity programme rather than Verde.\n&#xa0;\nQ560 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: But he is overstating the concerns he had when he spoke to us about the concerns he had and was presenting to the board\n. H\ne \nhas\n overstat\ned\n it, is that what is happening?\nBarry Tootell: No, he mentioned both matters in this Committee room and he ment\nioned both matters in the board\nroom, but of the two, his major area of concern was the Unity programme, at the same time as completing the integration of the Britannia business and commencing or completing the IT transformation programme.\n&#xa0;\nQ561 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: But the point is you s\nupported the Verde bid yourself?\nBarry Tootell: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ562 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: So you were in disagreement with your \nchief executive\n?\nBarry Tootell: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ563 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: That is why\n,\n when he presented his concerns to Peter Marks, he had to go\n,\n because he was not supported by his own management team and Peter Marks was driving the transaction from within \ng\nroup?\nChair: Is that correct?\nBarry Tootell: I cannot speak to why he left the business because I was not in the boardroom when that debate was had by the board, at either the banking group board level or the group board level. I would not suggest\n—\nto repeat your words, Mr Norman\n—\nthat he had to go because he did not have the support of management. I think Neville’s own evidence to this Committee was that he left because he was in disagreement with the board in terms of strategic direction.\n&#xa0;\nQ564 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Right, but you then became \nchief executive\n, you disagreed, \nand you\n backed the bid. He did not have the support of his own \nchief financial officer\n. He was the man who had come with Britannia. You had been at \nthe \nCIS before that. The Co-operative is deciding to reject this person who is not agreeing with their strategy.\nBarry Tootell: It was not part of the debate as to Neville’s departure from the business.\n&#xa0;\nQ565 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Was it your understanding that he stepped down because the CEO and the board of the Co-op Group did not accept his warnings about this transaction or \nProject \nUnity?\nBarry Tootell: I do not wish to be pedantic, but I would reverse that sentence and put much more emphasis on Unity. The debate was not a severe disagreement on Verde. There was a much more severe disagreement on the ability of \nthe bank\n to embrace Project Unity, but Verde was presented as another example of stretch and working on many fronts that Neville talked about.\n&#xa0;\nQ566 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: A final question. You complete the transaction, by which the Co-op merges with Britannia in April 2009. By that time, you have already seen not merely the collapse of Northern Rock, but the disastrous results of the Lloyds/HBOS merger, which came out in February 2009. It now turns out that the assets you acquired were grievously compromised, to the extent that, had it continued with them, \nBritannia \nwould almost certainly have been wiped out and had to seek some kind of emergency financing or partnership. \nDo you not feel that the writing was absolutely on the wall at that time? The combination of decline in the economy and decline in the financial sector\n,\n and the specific examples of the wreckage of HBOS and Northern Rock\n,\n should have given you pause as to the quality of the assets that you were acquiring?\nBarry Tootell: You are absolutely correct \nto \nsuggest\n that \nit gave us pause. Interesting insight, we were the clearing bank for Northern Rock, so we were unique in the \nUK\n marketplace \nin \nseeing just what happens with a run on a bank, so we understood exactly what that felt like.\n&#xa0;\nQ567 &#xa0; \nJesse Norman: Sorry, I am being delicate about it. It should have given you screaming cause for concern. You are responsible for this transaction and you are acquiring a bunch of assets while the asset quality all around you is being degraded visibly in front of you. Why don’t you act on it? Why don’t you call off the transaction and preserve that £1.5 billion of your mutual members’ capital?\nBarry Tootell: That would suggest then that no bank should do a transaction, as opposed to\n,\n if you are going to do a transaction, you make jolly sure that you do appropriate levels of due diligence to protect yourselves. We genuinely thought we had done the latter. We were absolutely aware of the consequences of hurried due diligence, and that was what the market perceived to be the issue with the Lloyds/HBOS transaction\n—\nthere was not enough due diligence done on the HBOS assets. We genuinely thought we had done extensive due diligence.\nAs I say, it was commended in our boardroom in January 2009 just how much quality due diligence we had done. In Northern Rock’s case, that was the consequences on liquidity management of a run on a bank and we were clearing that bank. We understood explicitly what that felt like and\n,\n again\n,\n modelled that extensively.\n&#xa0;\nQ568 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: Can I take you to December 2012, when \nAntónio Horta-Osório\n of Lloyds Bank told us that he first identified this capital shortfall with the Co-op, and he approached the Co-op to discuss their concerns about this. Peter Marks says he remembers the approach but does not remember any details of the conversation, and he also tells us that it was you who carried on these conversations with Lloyds Bank. Can you give us a flavour of what was going on in those conversations at the time?\nBarry Tootell: Okay. I do not believe he said it was me who had that conversation, but I do recollect the conversations.\n&#xa0;\nQ569 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: This is Peter Marks last week, “Barry Tootell, \nwho was \nthe \nchief executive\n of \nthe bank\n and who I believe will be here next week, was the main person supervising the day-to-day running of the process”.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed, but that does not mean that I had the meeting. Let me tell you what happened. Peter was right in his suggestion that the meeting was not with him\n. W\ne completed a three-year planning exercise that went through our board in November 2012\n,\n in which we projected forward the level of arrears that we were seeing emerging from our non-core portfolio\n. W\ne had had a discussion with the regulator in late 2012 to suggest that the capital requirements for \nour bank\n were likely to increase\n. F\nrom that meeting\n,\n we imputed how much that might be. They did not give us a number at that stage, but we built that into our planning process.\n&#xa0;\nQ570 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: How much did you think at the time? Were you identifying this £1.5 billion?\nBarry Tootell: For me to answer that with specifics, I am going to have to disclose the internal capital guidance and capital planning buffer of \nthe bank\n, which is market\n \nsensitive and \na \nvery private factor between the regulator and each individual regulated bank.\n&#xa0;Q571 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: I will not press you. Presumably we should not press for market-sensitive information, should we, Chairman?\nChair: I cannot ask you for something that is still market sensitive.\nBarry Tootell: Let me try to give you an answer that is more helpful.\n&#xa0;\nQ572 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: What I am trying to find out is\n,\n at that point\n,\n \ndid you \nknow that you had a £1.5 billion potential shortfall in your budget?\nBarry Tootell: No, we did not.\n&#xa0;\nQ573 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: But Lloyds were beginning to come to this conclusion themselves?\nBarry Tootell: To be clear, because we had an earlier discussion with the regulator and because we were seeing in 2012 a greater level of impairment from our non-core book, predominantly corporate, together with continuing provision for PPI, we were looking at a capital position for \nthe bank\n that was tighter than it had been previously. We factored that into the plan\n. W\ne rolled it forward appropriately\n,\n and we shared that with Lloyds on an open basis after the board had approved that in November 2012. So Mr \nHorta-Osório\n did not discover that we were having greater difficulty on capital; we shared it with \nAntónio \nand his team.\nA\ns he has suggested to the Committee, \nhe came back \nvia one of his senior managers to one of my senior managers, who were the nominated people to have active, ongoing day-to-day dialogue on the deal. They raised their concerns. Why was that not a point at which we raised the flag and pulled the plug on the deal? It was\nn’\nt the appropriate time because we had a plan that suggested capital was tighter, and this brings me back to the point on the strong capital position in the year-end accounts. We had a capital plan that looked like capital was tighter and below the risk appetite of our own board, and clearly therefore \nnot where we \nwished to be for the future, but we had plans to address it.\n              \nWe were then determining the possibility of selling our general insurance business\n. W\ne were already in the process of selling our life business\n,\n and we had committed in that planning process to deleverage more aggressively the corporate portfolio. Those three things gave us a capital position that would still make the deal \nviable;\n otherwise we would have pulled the plug on the deal\n. T\nhat was the emerging position that we shared with Lloyds in December 2012 that they raised their concerns about.\n&#xa0;\nQ574 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: \nSo Operation Pennine now became key. \nI\nf I remember, \nthis \nwas a way to look at raising more capital. \nOperation Pennine was now key to this deal, going forward. \nI am trying to get a flavour of the dynamics that were going on, because certainly the impression that we have been getting in this Committee from the evidence so far is that it was Lloyds approaching you to say they were uncertain that you could go ahead with this deal and that absolutely the dynamics were \nthat \nthey were initiating this conversation. Now it sounds \nas if \nyou are suggesting that that was not quite the case\n. I\nt was a two-way dialogue\n and y\nou were saying, subject to Pennine going ahead, that things were going to be fine, you as an organisation were less strong than they perhaps originally thought but\n,\n nonetheless\n,\n \nyou \nwere still strong enough to go ahead with it.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed. Believe me, we were doing a lot of work to ensure that we were strong enough to operate on a day-to-day basis as well as undertake a transaction \nwith \nthe significance of Verde\n. W\ne did not leap into action because Lloyds prodded us to do so. We were already working extensively on the capital plans to bring our capital to a position that the board had set as its risk appetite for the future.\n&#xa0;\nQ575 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: You were telling the regulator about your findings as well?\nBarry Tootell: Gosh, yes\n, t\nhe regulator was completely engaged.\n&#xa0;\nQ576 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: What were they saying to you about this? Were they comfortable with what you were doing? Did they agree you had a problem? Did they say, “Don’t worry, chaps. They are doing fine”?\nBarry Tootell: They agreed we had a capital position to be worked upon. Andrew Bailey—apologies, I forget whether it was his evidence to the Committee or whether it was his written letter more recently—said that he had never approved the transaction. Indeed, they did not. They were never asked to approve the transaction, but they were consulted on our progress towards pursuing the transaction on a very, very regular basis, both in terms of the transaction itself but also in terms of our underlying capital planning for the underlying standalone business, so extensive conversations with them. Each of those conversations continued to reaffirm that the regulator was \nopen-minded\n \nabout \nconsidering the opportunity of Verde, provided we were putting in place the capital plan that would make that feasible.\nIn 2011, Andrew Bailey came to our boardroom and set out the things that he would expect us to address\n. T\nhat was in a letter to me \nI think \nin November/December 2011, reaffirmed in writing, and they were the things that the Committee went through in the weeks gone by. One of those was capital adequacy. Clearly\n,\n we had to maintain a level of underlying capital that demonstrated our strength as a bank before we continued to assess the transaction that was Verde. I am sorry, but a weak bank does not do a transaction like Lloyds in order to make itself a bit stronger. A weak bank that is a bit stronger is still a weak bank and\n,\n therefore\n,\n we were committed as \na \nboard that we would not consider the transaction unless we could convince ourselves that we had the adequate underlying capital strength to do so. Our board \nwa\ns very, very clear on that.\n&#xa0;\nQ577 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: Did Lloyds interpret your financial modelling differently from the way you did?\nBarry Tootell: I do not believe so. I never had such a conversation, nor am I aware of such a conversation\n with Lloyds\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ578 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: It is quite an important point. You thought things were okay to go ahea\nd and they did not at that time?\nBarry Tootell: We had not shared with them the detailed options that we were considering, such as the general insurance disposal and so on, because that would have been market-sensitive information. We had shared more of an underlying \nplan \nwithout some of the remediating actions that we were considering.\n&#xa0;\nQ579 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: Let us be clear about this. Lloyds were not aware that you were looking to sell the insurance services\n \nin\n this December 2012 conversation?\nBarry Tootell: I do not believe so.\n&#xa0;\nQ580 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: So at that point they were highlighting the fact that they did not think this deal could go ahead and they were seriously worried about it?\nBarry Tootell: The choice of words is slightly different to the reality at the time. They wanted more information from us to evidence why we thought the capital of the combined business, and standalone, was appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nQ581 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: \nT\nhis is not including the fundraising from Operation Pennine?\nBarry Tootell: Yes. Project Pennine was not in progress at that time. There were certain events in 2013 that precipitated me establishing Project Pennine, which I can come on to if the Committee wishes me to.\n&#xa0;\nQ582 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: I am still slightly confused by this. \nA\nt the time of these conversations with Lloyds, you were not proposing to raise any money from the sale of the insurance services and the other stuff?\nBarry Tootell: Yes, we were. That was in our plan.\n&#xa0;\nQ583 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: That was in your plan, but you did not tell Lloyds about that?\nBarry Tootell: I would have to check. I do not believe we did. The plan was presented in two parts. One was the underlying plan and then the mitigating actions and I \ndon’t\n think we shared the full detail of the mitigating actions with Lloyds. We shared the underlying planning assumption, the roll-forward of our business into the future, and on that basis the capital would have looked weaker without remediation.\n&#xa0;\nQ584 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: The remediation was selling the insurance services, that which then became known as Project Pennine?\nBarry Tootell: There were three primary remediation points. One was delever\nag\ning the corporate asset by taking risk-weighted assets off the balance sheet\n;\n secondly\n,\n it was selling the general insurance business\n;\n and thirdly, it was completing the life and savings sale. The L&amp;S—life and savings—and general insurance sales would have allowed our parent company, which is Co-op Banking Group, to inject capital into \nthe bank\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ585 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: When you had the conversation with Lloyds,\n was there\n an assumption that you were going to inject? Were Lloyds aware that there was going to be an injection of capital one way or the other into \nthe bank\n?\nBarry Tootell: As I say, I do not recollect whether we told them about those remediating actions in December.\n&#xa0;\nQ586 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: This is very, very important. There is an awful lot of sort of corporate amnesia about this. Having spoken to Peter Marks last week, he was amazingly—\nChair: Amnesiac.\nMark Garnier: \nA\nmnesiac\n, t\nhank you, Chairman. I am slightly worried that this is catching among the board of Co-op, so I am going to press you on this. It is really \nimportant: did Lloyds know full \nwell that there was going to be a capital injection or not? You must be clear about this.\nBarry Tootell: I am sorry, I do not recollect, and I think your challenge is a little unfair.\nMark Garnier: I think it is very fair.\nBarry Tootell: I have been extremely open with the Committee\n but—\n&#xa0;\nQ587 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: This is the difference between a deal going ahead and not going ahead. This is the difference between a bank being solvent and effectively not being solvent. This is very\n, very\n important stuff. I genuinely cannot believe that you would forget the importance of that conversation at the time.\nBarry Tootell: This was not a major milestone in the negotiation or the engagement of Lloyds.\nMark Garnier: Really? It was not a major milestone?\nBarry Tootell: This was an ongoing sharing of information with Lloyds\n, \nan iteration\n. I\nn the iteration that we shared with them in December, \n“T\nhere will be a level of capital\n, which \nis not an insolvent bank but is a bank that requires additional capital\n”. T\nhe comment to Lloyds was, “\nand w\ne are working on that” and we were continuing to do just that.\n&#xa0;\nQ588 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: Can I summarise how this is coming over? So you run a full projection model and you realise that you have a problem with your bank. Part of your process of resolving that is to sell off a couple of assets and then inject capital into that bank. You have a general conversation with Lloyds. Lloyds sa\ny\n they initiated it but you say it was a general conversation—I do not want to be \npedantic\n about those points, just leave it at that—and within that, Lloyds come out and say, “We are not sure that this is going to go ahead. We do not think you are capable of doing this deal”. The one thing that is going to save that is this capital injection from the sale of other assets outside \nthe bank\n itself and you forget whether you mentioned that or not\n. T\nhe one deal that is going to be able to bring Co-op forward and you\n,\n kind of\n,\n forget that you have two big transactions going on that are going to save this deal, which is incredibly important to the future of \nthe bank\n. \nHow\n do you\n forget that?\nBarry Tootell: It was made clear that that would have included capital injection. I am not clear on whether we had told them which assets Co-operative Banking Group, or indeed our parent, may choose to sell.\n&#xa0;\nQ589 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: You were being a bit woolly about this a bit earlier, so thank you for clearing that up. \nY\nou are now saying that you definitely said there would be a capital injection from the parent company?\nBarry Tootell: I was not in the meeting. I would expect so.\n&#xa0;\nQ590 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: It is so important. I cannot believe \nthat \nyou guys who are running this bank cannot remember these really important details.\nBarry Tootell: This is day-to-day liaison between managers—\nMark Garnier: No, it is not\n, t\nhis is a major strategic\n transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ591 &#xa0; \nChair: Are you describing this huge deal as part of day-to-day liaison?\nBarry Tootell: The particular meeting—\nChair: This was make or break for Co-op.\nBarry Tootell: If we were not able to address the capital shortfall through the remediating actions, it would have been a showstopper for the transaction. Yes, I accept that.\n&#xa0;\nQ592 &#xa0; \nChair: But you cannot remember what was told to Lloyds?\nBarry Tootell: The information that was provided, the detailed discussion of that at that point, bear in mind our teams were meeting several times a month, several times a week, sharing information, sharing plans. They were sharing plans with \nus;\n we were sharing plans with them\n. I\nn one of those meetings, yes, we did agree we were going to share with them our underlying three-year planning assumption for the standalone business that was going to be part of the Verde transaction, but it would have shown\n—\nand it did show\n—\na lower level of capital than the deal would require and there would have had to have been a capital injection. I am not clear on whether we said\n,\n \n“T\nhat will come from the sale of the GI business\n”\n because at that time we had not made the board decision to divest. \nThat was not until quarter one 2013, but we were progressing our thoughts along those lines.\n&#xa0;\nQ593 &#xa0; \nChair: This is not long ago, we are not digging up something from a decade ago and there will be notes of comments that were or were not made, \nwon’t there\n?\nBarry Tootell: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ594 &#xa0; \nChair: Have you made an effort to look at those before coming today?\n              Barry Tootell: I have not done, no.\n&#xa0;\nQ595 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: There is a very important point to this, which is Lloyds’ due diligence on how they go about this. If you are suggesting there is going to be a significant imp\nortation \nof capital from a mutual parent, quite justifiably, \nLloyds would ask \nwhere that capital \nwould\n be coming from. \nThey would want to know where it is because, as a mutual, you do not have the easy ability to raise capital in the same way that a listed company would do.\nBarry Tootell: No. It was clear that the only means we would have had to inject capital would be the divestment of assets of the group and more likely the assets of the banking group\n. S\no\n,\n yes, general insurance and life and savings were known businesses that we could divest if we chose to do so.\n&#xa0;\nQ596 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: But you are saying you would not have told them what it was. \nA\ns an organisation, \nLloyds \nwould have to take a massive amount of trust on what you are saying. Do you think they would do that? This is a huge deal. This is a very public deal with a publicly-owned bank, with the biggest mutual in the country, with huge amounts of importance on the whole of the transaction. You cannot remember what was going on. You are now telling us you were not prepared to reveal to Lloyds what the assets were that were being sold because they were market sensitive. Lloyds would have had to \naccept, \non\n a\n massive amount of trust\n,\n the fact that as a mutual—which obviously has difficulty raising capital—\nyou could \nraise this capital. \nAre you suggesting that in all these conversations in December\n, \nwhich seem to be the key conversations that were going on\n, \nyou cannot remember what was happening then?\nBarry Tootell: I cannot remember the specific of whether we said, “We are selling our GI business”.\n&#xa0;\nQ597 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: You did say earlier that you said you were\nn’\nt.\nBarry Tootell: Yes\n, but\n I did not say we did not tell them. I cannot recollect whether we told them specifically which asset we were considering selling.\n&#xa0;\nQ598 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: You said you could not, because it was market sensitive.\nBarry Tootell: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ599 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: So what is it? You cannot remember \nwhether \nyou said\n it or \nyou \ndid not say it?\nBarry Tootell: I apologise. I said before, I do not recollect\n.\n I do not \nknow \nspecifically whether we told them that we were selling our GI business and injecting it. I suspect we would not have done because it was market sensitive, but I do not know whether we shared that mitigating plan with Lloyds. I agree with your comment that Lloyds were taking the work that we were doing on trust\n,\n because we were asking them to wait while we developed our mitigating plans and then we would share the detail of that with them\n.\n \nD\nuring the process of engagement\n—w\ne were meeting them regularly\n, \nday in, day out, week in, week out\n—we were \nsharing the emerging view of things with them.\n&#xa0;\nQ600 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: Mr Norman asked you a bit earlier about who were the advisers on the Britannia deal, which for the Co-op was JP Morgan and for Britannia it was Citigroup. I believe JP Morgan and Citigroup were the advisers to the Project Verde deal.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;Q601 &#xa0; \nMark Garnier: Do you think they knew more about your business as a result of that link with the corporate advisers of that deal than you did at the time?\nBarry Tootell: Did they know more about?\nMark Garnier: \nB\necause they had two advisers that had been party to the Britannia deal, do you think \nLloyds\n had a better insight in\nto\n what was going on in your business than you did, because they understood how to run your business better than you did?\nBarry Tootell: I would suspect not. One could argue that because I had Credit Suisse and BarCap working for me, we would know more about them than they would have told us. To suggest any of those factors was true is to suggest that the strict confidentiality over any engagement of an adviser was breached, so I would suggest not.\nMark Garnier: Okay, fair enough.\nBarry Tootell: As a corporate, JP Morgan clearly understood us in some detail.\n&#xa0;\nQ602 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: Mr Tootell, you have been very strate\ng\nically forgetful in your last few answers, so I am going to help you along. In our hearing with Andrew Bailey in July this year—you have read his evidence, I take it?\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;Q603 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: You have\n. G\nood. He says that towards the tail-end of 2011, he told the board of Co-op Bank that it was not clear to the regulator that the Co-op Banking Group had the ability to transform itself successfully and sustainably into an organisation on the scale that would result from acquiring the Verde assets. He then went on to say, “Then we set out five things, the five areas that they would have to deal with\n: capital, liquidity-\nrisk management, integration, governance and management”. That is obviously a pretty full set. He starts with that list of five things that the board would have to address as capital. What did he say about the level of capital, if anything, and what was your reaction to his flagging \na\n capital shortfall, which is implicit in what I have just read out?\nBarry Tootell: There was no implication o\nr\n indication of a capital shortfall\n I think\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ604 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: What did he mean by “capital”? What was your understanding when he said “capital” in that list of five things I have recited?\nBarry Tootell: That we had to evidence sufficiency of capital to do the transaction in order to proceed. He said that in July 2011. He reiterated that by one of his team writing to me, as I said before, I think it was November or December 2011, to reiterate those points. Those points were presented as the key criteria, the key heads that we would need to address in seeking any approval from the regulator to proceed with the deal.\n&#xa0;\nQ605 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: Let me just nail this down. I am not going to read it out again, but he said there were five things and capital was one of them. What was the response by Co-op Bank to that representation by the regulator when he says, “Areas to be addressed”\n?\n Describe to us, as best you can, what your response was. Was it in writing? What did you say to the regulator when the regulator pointed out capital \nas \nbeing one of the five areas of concern?\nBarry Tootell: It was not raised with us as an area of concern. It was raised with us as an area that we would—\n&#xa0;\nQ606 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: Hang on, hang on. \nT\nhis is serious stuff, okay\n. The regulator \nis saying, “We set out five things, the five areas that they would have to deal with”. What I am \nasking \nyou, Mr Tootell, is how did you deal with it? I am quoting the regulator here. There is no point in smirking quietly to yourself.\nChair: No, steady on. Let us\n just\n—\nMr Ruffley: Let us have an answer.\nBarry Tootell: It was not a concern about the business in 2011. It was Andrew Bailey being very clear with us as to which areas we would have to specifically address in order to proceed with the transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ607 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: We understand. What was your response? Why can’t you answer that? He asks you to deal with capital. What did you do or what did your colleagues do, to the best of your knowledge and belief, Mr Tootell? How did you respond to that capital issue? He asks you to deal with it. What did you do?\nBarry Tootell: Capital is fundamentally important to the transaction. I could also argue that the capital\n, and\n perhaps all of this—\n&#xa0;\nQ608 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: You are waffling now. What did you do in response to the regulator, and I quote, “To deal with it”? What did you do? Did you write to him? What did you show him? What did you say to the regulator?\nBarry Tootell: We had detailed dialogue on an ongoing basis with the regulator at all levels.\nMr Ruffley: On \nthe \ncapital, but what—\nBarry Tootell: In addressing all five of those things and we updated them on our progress.\nMr Ruffley: No, let us stick with capital.\nChair: Hang on, Mr \nRuffley;\n l\net us just hear what Mr Tootell has to say on that point.\nBarry Tootell: We updated them on a regular basis with our progress towards addressing the five areas that they were expecting us to evidence sufficiency or progress around in order to do the transaction. These were not challenges of things that we had to fix in 2011 because the business had a problem. These were very clearly things that the regulator was saying, “If you are going to do a transaction the size of the Verde transaction, these five things are fundamentally important”. We completely agreed with those five things and we were working tirelessly—\n&#xa0;\nQ609 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: I have been asking about capital, not the other four, but I think the record will show that you are trying to slide away from that. Never mind.\n              \nWas a potential capital shortfall ever expressed to you or any of your colleagues by Mr Bailey or any of his colleagues at the regulator, yes or no?\nBarry Tootell: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ610 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: In relation to the tail-end of 2011 discussion?\nBarry Tootell: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ611 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: Andrew Bailey told the Treasury Committee that he asked you to make clear his concerns to Lloyds Banking Group. Peter Marks claims that you did this.\nBarry Tootell: We did.\nMr Ruffley: You did it, did you?\nBarry Tootell: We did.\nMr Ruffley: Sorry, you personally?\nBarry Tootell: I do not know whether it was a letter signed by me, but we briefed Lloyds on the conversation we were having with the regulator \nand\n the key areas.\n&#xa0;\nQ612 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: When did you do this?\nBarry Tootell: I do not know the date of the letter.\nMr Ruffley: You cannot remember?\nBarry Tootell: But we absolutely briefed the Lloyds team.\n&#xa0;Q613 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: What date approximately? Give us a month.\nBarry Tootell: It was December 2011, because the letter formally came to us—\nMr Ruffley: December 2011. No, we have that.\nChair: Just let Mr Tootell reply.\nMr Ruffley: He has replied.\nBarry Tootell: The letter came to us in November or December 2011 and it would have been very quickly thereafter. It may have been as early as November 2011. It was no later than December 2011.\n&#xa0;\nQ614 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: Was a capital shortfall one of the concerns you relayed to Lloyds in late 2011?\nBarry Tootell: Again, it was not a capital shortfall, but it was the list of things that the regulator needed us to evidence in order to do the transaction. It was never voiced as a capital shortfall.\n&#xa0;\nQ615 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: Fine, okay. You are rejecting the words “capital shortfall”. Let me try this one on you. What did you say about capital to Lloyds towards the end of 2011? I am not using the word “shortfall”, by the way. What did you or any of your colleagues say\n \nin writing or verbally about the capital issue? \nI am no\nt using the word “shortfall”\n;\n what did you say to them, Mr Tootell?\nBarry Tootell: But again, it was not a capital issue. It was evidencing—\n&#xa0;Q616 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: What did you say about capital then?\nBarry Tootell: We said that there are five key areas of focus for the regulator that we will be evidencing and spending—\nMr Ruffley: No, capital. Not the other four issues, capital, Mr Tootell. Please do not slide away to the other four issues. I am focusing on capital. What did you say about the capital position and your expected capital position to Lloyds in late 2011, Mr Tootell? What is the answer to that question?\nBarry Tootell: We told them specifically that, among four other things—\nMr Ruffley: Oh dear.\nBarry Tootell: —but on capital as one of those things, but capital was a key area of focus for—\n&#xa0;\nQ617 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: What do you mean “key area of focus”?\nBarry Tootell: The regulator demanded, as we would demand of ourselves, that we evidence that we have sufficient capital to do the transaction and that was a natural thing for our board to accept. We did not need telling that by the regulator. That was absolutely what our board would have evidenced to itself before it even considered the transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ618 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: How was it proposed to evidence that?\nBarry Tootell: \nP\nrobably \nsince \n2011 we have been running with a board risk appetite\n, which \nwas to have a minimum level of core tier 1 of 10% in order to satisfy ourselves on our capital position for the future. We accepted it was a timeline to get there and it was\nn’\nt going to be an overnight fix, but 10% was our board appetite for capital adequacy. \nThat was the plan that we were working towards on a standalone basis. \nThat was also one of the underpins in considering the Lloyds transaction. \nThat was our board’s view\n. \nTherefore it accorded with the regulator’s view that capital is key, and we agreed \nand w\ne told Lloyds that.\n&#xa0;\nQ619 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: \nFinally, l\net\n’\ns move on to the second half of 2012, the regulator again. Let us see if you can do any better with this. Andrew Bailey told this Committee that the FSA’s stress-testing in the second half of 2012 confirmed the suspected capital shortfall in Co-op Bank. Did the regulator express fresh concerns to you about Co-op’s Verde bid in response to this?\nBarry Tootell: No, it did not.\nMr Ruffley: It did not.\nChair: Okay.\nMr Ruffley: \nI am not quite finished.\nChair: We \nwill\n take one more question and then we must move on.\n&#xa0;\nQ620 &#xa0; \nMr Ruffley: The \nchief executive\n of Lloyds told this Committee that Lloyds was\n “n\not approached by the Co-op Bank or the Co-op Group board\n”\n regarding the confirmed capital shortfall in \nDecember \n2012. Why not, Mr Tootell?\nBarry Tootell: There was no capital shortfall in 2012. There was an increasing level of capital that was being—\nMr Ruffley: No capital shortfall. Nonetheless—\nBarry Tootell: In 2012. The capital shortfall emerged in 2013, which was the addition of future capital requirements on top of the underlying capital guidance requirements of the FSA. What we built into our planning process was the direction of travel for the capital guidance\n, which \nthe regulator sets for all banks individually\n. \nI am afraid I cannot share it with you\n because of market sensitivity\n.\nThe issue that became the capital shortfall\n, which \nended up getting announced in June 2013 by the PRA\n,\n was the requirement of \nthe \nFPC and \nthe \nPRA that all banks build into their future capital projections the ability to achieve a level of capital requirement under \nBasel\n III arrangements but adjusted for known areas of future emerging exposure. That was announced in June 2013. We had the first indication of the scale of that in early 2013\n,\n and that created the heightened concern beyond what we were aware of in December 2012. December 2012 was about our capital guidance figure\n,\n not around future capital requirement, which was crystallised in the June 2013 announcement.\n&#xa0;\nQ621 &#xa0; \nChair: Just to be clear there\n. A\ns I understand it, what you are saying is that the goalpost\ns were\n changed slightly by the regulator\n.\n They were tightening your capital requirement\ns.\nBarry Tootell: Yes, not \njust \nfor us but for the whole marketplace because the regulator and the FPC were looking for banks to—\n&#xa0;\nQ622 &#xa0; \nChair: I understand\n. T\nherefore, because you had little margin for error\n—\nyou did not have much of a cushion\n—\nthis hit you particularly hard\n.\n Is that what you are saying?\nBarry Tootell: Indeed\n. A\ns I alluded to before, that was the trigger for Pennine in early 2013. We had done a plan based on what we thought the capital requirements were going to be, as crystallised within the individual capital guidance for \nthe bank\n, and we were doing mitigating action to that end. \nT\nhen in January 2013, we had the first indication of the heightened level of capital, which\n,\n broadly speaking\n,\n was consistent with the FPC and PRA announcement in June 2013\n. B\nut it \nwas\n that heightened level of capital requirement that caused Project Pennine to be initiated.\n&#xa0;\nQ623 &#xa0; \nChair: You would agree\n,\n though\n,\n that that does sit slightly oddly with your comment in March that \n“\nour balance sheet remained strong\n”\n?\nBarry Tootell: Indeed\n. T\nhat is why we were doing Project Pennine to remediate the action.\n&#xa0;\nQ624 &#xa0; \nChair: I am being pretty gentle about it in saying it sits oddly. Going back to the conversation \nwith which \nwe began this hearing, you would agree with that, would you?\nBarry Tootell: The accounts as a whole have an extensive area \nin them \nof risk assessment, considering not only our view of risks to the business\n—t\nhat was very clear on the scale of risks\n—but e\nffectively to support the going concern opinion of the business\n. T\nhere was an extensive section there on the potential risks and mitigants to emerging risk\n. I\nt was the combination of all of those that allowed us to make a statement about the balance sheet at the end of 2012 as being still at 9.2%.\n&#xa0;\nQ625 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThe key point is that you were right up against these limits already\n. \nYou were sailing close to the wind, and when some further demands were made of you\n,\n that was too much.\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\n&#xa0;\nQ626 &#xa0; \nChair: Therefore, it does sit oddly to say that your balance sheet remained strong because it was\nn’\nt very strong\n.\n A puff of wind could blow you over.\nBarry Tootell: It was adequate at 2012 year-end\n. W\ne were looking not so far as our own balance sheet standalone was concerned in December 2012\n,\n but looking \ngenerally \nto what the markets and the regulator were going to look to banks to address of\nf in\nto the medium-term future. It was that that gave us the significant challenge rather than the position of the year-end December balance sheet\n. B\nut I think the combined package of the going concern review\n,\n together with the risk assessment\n,\n was an adequate packa\nging of the statutory accounts.\nWe were working extensively on remediating the difficulties this was going to cause for \nthe bank\n and\n,\n from January onwards, we were doing the plan that was referred to by the FPC and PRA in June\n. A\nll banks were doing their capital plans to address the future requirements\n—\nnot a black hole\n,\n but the future requirements for the banking industry\n,\n and we were doing our own. The tipping point then for the transaction was that beyond February/March, when we were concluding our accounts process, but into April, it was me reaching the conclusion that\n—\noff the back of the capital planning work that we were doing to address the FPC/PRA papers for June\n—\nwe were not going to put sufficient remediating action\ns\n in place to address the future capital requirements. It was on that basis that I concluded that we should not pursue the Verde transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ627 &#xa0; \nChair: \nB\nut given that you were already sailing so close to the wind, would \nit not \nbe right to characterise the attempted deal with Lloyds as a rescue operation?\nBarry Tootell: I think very clearly, no\n. E\nven though we had emerging or growing concerns around our future capital requirements and the demands placed upon us, we were very clear\n that—a\nnd I was very clear with Andrew Bailey, as early as January 2013\n—\nnotwithstanding the fact that the deal could make us a little bit stronger, this was not a deal to go into if we were not strong enough to do it. Therefore, we could not count\nenance\n it as a rescue because we needed to be convinced as a \nboard\n that we had enough \ncapital strength to go into it.\nIf I take you to the 2011 comments and \nthe \nletter from the FSA, the one of the five key things that they set for us was capital. It was very clear to \nus\n and to the regulator that going into the deal as a rescue was not going to work. We would not have done it anyway\n,\n but it was not going to work because we needed to demonstrate capital sufficiency to do the transaction in the first place.\nChair: I have three more colleagues who want to come in. We had intended to hear from Mr Flowers as well this morning \nbut\n \nwe hope \nthat \nthat \nwill be rescheduled\n \nfor tomorrow afternoon. I am going to bring in the remaining three colleagues for this hearing.\n&#xa0;\nQ628 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: Thank you\n, and thank you\n \nfor clarifying about tomorrow, Chair.\nMr Tootell, \nI want to turn to a slightly different area\n \non\n these critical decisions we are taking in this structure of Co-op Bank or Co-op Financial Services with a parent Co-op Group sitting on top of it, which wholly owns Co-op Financial Services. \nI\nn his evidence last week, \nPeter Marks \nexplained to us that he did not sit on the \nb\noard of the Co-operative Group, which was an elected \nboard\n, but that he chaired the \nexecutive committee\n of \nthe group\n. Sitting from where you were, what did you regard as the key decision-making body in the \nCo-op\n Group? Was it the \nexecutive committee\n or \nthe group\n \nboard\n, given the structure?\nBarry Tootell: It was very clearly \nthe group\n \nboard\n in overall terms. Peter Marks attended each \nboard\n meeting as the \nchief executive\n and, therefore, \nprimary officer\n of \nthe group\n. H\ne was not a member of the \nboard\n itself but he attended these \nboard\n meetings. So, yes, he was a chairman of the \nrisk management committee\n,\n but I would regard the primary decision-making forum as being \nthe group\n \nboard\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ629 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: \nW\nhen it came to recommend going for the Verde transaction in the first place, who is taking that decision? Who is the key decision-maker when \nthe bank\n decides to do that?\nBarry Tootell: \nThe group\n \nboard\n needed to make the decision to support the continuation of exploring the opportunity. As with any \nboard\n, if the \nchief executive\n is not able to support a decision or a transaction, that will be a significant issue for the \nboard\n. The \nboard\n will be very minded \nof \nthe opinion of the \nchief executive\n.\n Peter Marks would \nclearly \nhave been a significant influential character in that process, but the \nboard\n is the decision-making body that would have allowed us to proceed \nor not \nwith \nthe transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ630 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: My colleague\n,\n John Thurso, when he was questioning Peter Marks on this kind of area last week, used the analogy \nof \na \nG\novernment and a \nP\narliament\n,\n with the \nexecutive committee\n being the Government and the \nboard\n being the Parliament. Do you think that is a fair way to sum this up?\nBarry Tootell: If we are talking about the \nexecutive committee\n and the \nboard\n of \nthe group\n, yes, that would be a fair way to sum up the way in which the broader \ng\nroup or the trading aspects of \nthe group\n operated\n,\n but not its oversight over the banking business.\n&#xa0;\nQ631 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: Again, going back to Verde, would this have been a recommendation made by the \nexecutive committee\n of \nthe group\n, which \nthen goes to the \nboard\n for approval\n,\n or would it have been something that originated within the \nboard\n as being a good thing \nfor the group to\n do\n?\nBarry Tootell: No, we did recommend to the \nboard\n that they allow us to continue with this opportunity, and they approved that course of action. In terms of the decision-making bodies below the \nboard\n and the support that that gave to the process, \nPeter and I\n were pretty clear that if it did not have the unanimous or broad support of the \nexecutive committee\n of my \nbanking group\n, and, similarly, if he did not have the broad support and unanimity of \nthe group\n \ne\nxecutive, it would not be something that he and I would be willing to take to \nthe group\n \nboard\n for decision. \nUnless\n the business underneath the \nboard\n is supportive of the transaction, it would not be helpful for the \nboard\n to be asked to approve something knowing that \nthe \nmanagement\n do not agree with that transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ632 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: Apart from Neville Richardson, is there any senior figure\n,\n in either the Co-op Bank or the \nexecutive committee\n of \nthe group\n or the \nboard\n of \nthe group\n,\n \nwho \ndisagreed with going for the Verde transaction?\nBarry Tootell: I would have to look back \nat\n \nthe group\n \nboard\n minutes. As I say, I am not a member of \nthe group\n \nboard\n either but we could look at the \nboard\n minutes to check on the voting. Oftentimes it is consensus and oftentimes it is a vote. We did have a vote for \nthe group\n \nboard\n decision to proceed with the transaction or otherwise. On some of those votes, we have not had complete unanimous support. There have been abstentions but we have the vast majority of the \nboard\n in favour of the transaction\n.\n I do not recollect whether that complete unanimous approval\n,\n versus the split but generally majority decision\n,\n was in relation to the heads of terms that we signed in mid-2012 or the initial decision to proceed with the transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ633 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: I am trying to get to the bottom of that. You are saying \nthere were\n other voices on \nthe group\n \nboard\n \nthat\n were uncomfortable with the Verde transaction\n?\n It was not a unanimous \ndecision?\nBarry Tootell: There was not a unanimous approval at all times. \nQ\nuite validly and quite rightly\n, there were\n questions and concerns about the capacity of \nthe group\n to do the transaction. \nEssentially, th\nat\n \nwas not a concern about the transaction itself\n. T\nhere was a concern about the financial capacity of \nthe group\n to fund the transaction because the transaction consideration was £350 million up front, which would have been financed by \nthe group\n injecting capital into \nthe bank\n and \nthe bank\n utilising that to buy the business we were acquiring. \nT\nhe group\n would have to encumber itself to the tune of £350 million\n,\n and that was a major area of focus for \ng\nroup \nboard\n directors.\n&#xa0;\nQ634 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: \nT\nhey were asking, “Can we afford this?”\nBarry Tootell: They were, absolutely\n. Y\nou would expect them to do so\n and, y\nes, they did\n. I\nt took a lot of input from \nthe group\n \nf\ninance and \ng\nroup \na\nudit \nc\nommittee in that deliberation\n,\n and you would expect them to do just that.\n&#xa0;\nQ635 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: You had a long-term involvement both as CFO and then CEO of \nthe bank\n. In that time, how much involvement did the Co-op Group \nboard\n have in the running of \nthe bank\n?\nBarry Tootell: Relatively limited. They were the shareholder and therefore responsible for their investment in \nthe group\n. They did not oversee and interfere, \nlet’s \nsay, with decision-making within the banking business. \nThe banking business was set up with some representatives of the group board on the banking group board. \nThen i\nmportantly, we recruited from the market place independent\n,\n professional non-executives with industry skills and experience in order to run the bank as a bank needs to be run. They relied and took comfort from their professionalism and did not override or dabble in the \ndecision-mak\ning of the banking group. There were occasions when the banking group needed to go to the group board for approval for certain matters because there would have been matters reserved for the group board itself\n—a\ns I said before, major acquisitions and disposals. \nFor example, t\nhe decision to sell the life business needed to be approved at the group board level.\n&#xa0;\nQ636 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: \nWhen we have this\n—\nI guess you could call it\n—\neclectic group board of these 20 elected members from various backgrounds, what you are saying to us is when it came to the running of the bank\n,\n most of the time they were pretty hands off? I am not trying to put words in your mouth, you use your own.\nBarry Tootell: \nThey were reasonably hands off. I attended the group board each month to account to my group shareholder representatives\n,\n effectively, as to how the bank was performing, talking about the major risks, talking about the major opportunities and talking about the day-to-day performance of the banking business. \nSo t\nhere was accountability and the\nre\n were appropriate \nand\n challenging questions on key issues from \ntime to \ntime\n, b\nut there was no detailed involvement in \ndecision-mak\ning.\nMay I say that is consistent with other businesses within the group? \nThere are three subsidiary boards within the group. There is one for food, one for specialist businesses and one for the bank. There is a similar approach for non-executives to be recruited from the marketplace to support each of those boards in turn.\n&#xa0;\nQ637 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: \nYes. This is important because I want to get to how the overall \nCo-op\n \nG\nroup and these subsidiaries work. Sticking with the bank, when it comes to setting strategy for the bank are you saying that is done by the bank itself or by the group?\nBarry Tootell: \nIt is done by the bank. We have a strategy session \nthat\n starts in July\n, which is more high-\nlevel strategic, culminating in November of each year with a lower level of granularity and rigo\nu\nr, financials, capital and so on. That in turn is used to inform t\nhe group board as part of group-\nwide strategy settings. The group strategy would have been the sort of discussions that Peter Marks alluded to in this room, in terms of the diversity of interests of the group\n. F\nor example\n, w\nhich businesses are we in\n?\n That is the sort of level of \ndecision-mak\ning the group would get into in group strategy setting. Not the detailed strategy plans of each individual entity.\n&#xa0;\nQ638 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: \nI \nwill \nslightly change tack here and ask you one further thing following \non \nfrom \nMr Ruffley’s \nquestions\n about\n Andrew Bailey’s list of five concerns. \nIn his evidence last week, \nPeter Marks said several times that he saw proceeding with Verde as the answer to three of those five, including the capital question that Mr Ruffley \nasked\n. You seem to be giving us a different emphasis, which is\n,\n \n“T\nhese are five things that we have to show we have answers to before we can proceed with Verde\n”\n. Which is right? This is an important difference. Was Verde the answer to Andrew Bailey’s list or was this a list of things that had to be satisfied before Verde could be contemplated?\nBarry Tootell: \nNo\n. T\no be clear\n,\n these are things that we would have to address for ourselves in order to do the transaction\n and n\not looking for Lloyds or Verde to do it for us\n. V\nery clearly\n so\n.\n&#xa0;Q639 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: \nTherefore\n,\n Verde is not the answer to Andrew Bailey’s list\n.\n The answer has to come before Verde can proceed\n.\nBarry Tootell: \nIndeed. If I take capital as an example\n. W\ne had to demonstrate capital sufficiency before we consider\ned\n the transaction. By the same token\n,\n the transaction itself will have to be compl\ne\nmentary to that, it cannot erode. Therefore, the Verde opportunity will have to help rather than hinder. There is a primary position\n,\n which is that the bank needs to evidence sufficiency of capital first. We cannot look to the Lloyds opportunity to fix the five challenges that came from Andrew as part of the transaction.\n&#xa0;\nQ640 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: That is important for us. \nF\ninally \nI will \nend with this\n. W\nhen it came to the decision to pull the plug on Verde\n,\n who took the decision?\nBarry Tootell: \nUltimately it is a board decision. It was my recommendation. It was my judgment as the \nchief executive\n. I cannot remember the sequence, whether I told my chairman first or Peter Marks first. But I told both parties that in my opinion this deal could not proceed. I told the chairman\n and\n Peter Marks\n,\n and that decision was supported by both parties. It was my judgment.\n&#xa0;\nQ641 &#xa0; \nMr McFadden: You told them and then the group executive goes to the board and says, “We don’t think we can proceed with this”, is that how it worked?\nBarry Tootell: \nPeter and I informed the group board that it was no longer the recommendation of management that we could continue with the transaction. By the same token\n,\n I did the same thing with my board.\n&#xa0;\nQ642 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYou\n have had much the same problems as an institution that most other banks have had\n. Y\nou also had a risk management committee structure in place. Were you sitting on those committees and were they flagging up concerns?\nBarry Tootell: \nI was not sitting on the committees because, in line with the pursuit of greater governance—\nChair: \nYou would be in attendance\n. Sorry, I should have used the words “in attendance”, you are quite right.\nBarry Tootell: \nI attended, yes. For example, my risk officer had a direct reporting line to the chairman of the \nr\nisk \nc\nommittee. They were challenging meetings\n. W\ne absolutely did not have an easy ride\n—\nand nor should we\n—\nwith our \nrisk committee\n and our \naudit committee\n in the management of the business on \na\n day-to-day basis.\n&#xa0;\nQ643 &#xa0; \nChair: Were they flagging up the risks on \nthe \ncommercial lending you were doing?\nBarry Tootell: \nNo more so than we were briefing them upon. We got challenging and searching questions.\n&#xa0;Q644 &#xa0; \nChair: That does not sound very challenging if you brief them to ask certain questions and then you reply to them.\nBarry Tootell: \nNo, they were asking us challenging questions on the detail \nthat \nwe were presenting. I am suggesting that they did not unearth something we had not spotted. But the insightful and searching questions that we received from those committees were very challenging\n,\n and very appropriately so.\n&#xa0;\nQ645 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut much like other banks i\nt did not stop this exposure developing, did it?\nBarry Tootell: \nIt did not stop the exposure emerging. If I take us back then to 2008\n-\n09 when the \nnow \nfateful decision was taken to acquire the Britannia business. Everything that has ensued thereafter has been the conseque\nnce of having done so. From mid-\n2009\n,\n when we completed the transaction on 1 August 2009, in a way the die was then cast\n b\necause we had the PPI exposure \nin\n the underlying \nc\no-op\nerative business. We then had the exposure in the non-core business\n, p\nredominately Britannia \na\nssets. Therefore\n,\n the challenge thereafter was one of management and mitigation and monitoring the emergence, but importantly, seeking to do something about it rather than simply watching the issue emerge. These were not new issues but these were a growing—\n&#xa0;\nQ646 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI want to ask one other question with respect to what was going on in early 2013. Did you have to give assurances to your auditors in\n 2013 to achieve the going concern\n sign\noff?\nBarry Tootell: \nYes, we did, but then—\n&#xa0;Q647 &#xa0; \nChair: What were they? What were the assurances that year?\nBarry Tootell: \nWe shared capital plans with the auditor to enable them to pass their opinion on the accounts.\n&#xa0;\nQ648 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWhat opinion did they give? What were they most concerned about at that time?\nBarry Tootell: \nThey were concerned about the eroding capital position because of capital risk weights.\n&#xa0;Q649 &#xa0; \nChair: The same eroding capital position that was taking place as you said that your balance sheet remains strong?\nBarry Tootell: \nYes. But it is \na\n future ongoing emergence that needed parallel mitigation in order to accommodate. That is what the plans said we were doing. Those are the plans that we shared with the regulator in April 2013.\n&#xa0;\nQ650 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: \nCan I go back to 2008, and first just clarify your own background\n. Y\nou are a banker by profession with fairly extensive experience in a number of commercial banks at a divisional CFO level?\nBarry Tootell: \nIndeed.\n&#xa0;Q651 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: When exactly in 2008 were you recruited?\nBarry Tootell: \nI joined on 17 December 2007.\n&#xa0;Q652 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: In other words\n,\n before anybody mentioned Britannia?\nBarry Tootell: \nYes, indeed\n,\n I joined on \nan\n interim basis, and I joined on a permanent basis on 1 April 2008.\n&#xa0;\nQ653 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: \nComing from a background in normal—it is the wrong word—but non-mutual banking, if I can put it like that, what were you recruited to do and what were your thoughts about the business you were going into?\nBarry Tootell: \nI was recruited specifically to strengthen the finance team and our finance capability in a challenging external world, where the challenge to banks to perform with greater rigo\nu\nr and the desire for finance communities to play a more significant role in the stewardship of the business was something that the \nCo-op\n had absolutely embraced and had specifically looked for me to join the business and help them achieve.\n&#xa0;\nQ654 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: \nThe reason I ask that is\n,\n of course, because my memory of that year is very clear, having sat on \nthis Committee\n with the report into Northern Rock. I remember very well going to events in the City\n,\n in June and July of 2008\n,\n where the then HBOS were complaining bitterly about being shorted and they were a very strong institution. \nOf course, i\nt was not until the meltdown \nin\n September\n/\nOctober 2008 that the real crisis started, and it did not manifest itself in corporate lending until 2009. What I was trying to get at is the interesting view that you would have had at the very beginning, because it is pre-crisis, of “What is this business I’m coming into and what is it I’m being hired to do?”\nBarry Tootell: \nIt was a business that had historically operated with a high degree of competency. I was quite impressed in joining the \nCo-op\nerative that not only did they have a culture within the business that was hugely collaborative and very\n, very\n open and non-political and a great place to work, but also with very high calibre people recruited into some of the key roles. I was quite pleased when I joined the business that they were not—it is a slightly disrespectful view—sleepy and backward looking as I might have thought they \nwere;\n b\necause I was brought in\n \nto help them get better. I was pleased that I was trying to help them get better from quite a high starting point.\n&#xa0;\nQ655 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: \nBecause in his note on the background to the Britannia merger Neville Richardson says\n,\n \n“\nCFS had a current account\n,\n corporate bank and insurance business. It lacked distribution and was badly in need of replacement IT systems, the cost of \nwhich\n would be difficult to recover over CFS’\ns\n small distribution base\n”\n. The point being that that is quite a significant identification of weakness in CFS at that time. Was that something you would agree with?\nBarry Tootell: \nI would agree with it. It was not the reason for the transaction with Britannia\n b\nut it is a fair assessment of where the \nCo-op\nerative was at the time. We did have a small balance sheet size and a small distribution network\n,\n and we did have—consistent with other banks in the \nUK\n marketplace—quite old systems that needed more work to make them more resilient. You have seen that play out in the past year or so. We were no different \nfrom \nmany other institutions and we were keen to replace or enhance our IT systems. Neville’s comment would be correct\n,\n that \nour \ncapacity to do that major infrastructure project with the scale of bank that we were would have been stretching or penal for us. Doing it once for a much bigger business would have been economically more doable. I would then suggest Britannia were in a similar position\n—\nthat they also had IT systems that required work.\n&#xa0;Q656 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: Not the new IT systems that Mr Richardson described in the note?\nBarry Tootell: \nThey had a more modern mortgage platform than the \nCo-op\nerative\n. I\nt was the same mortgage platform as the \nCo-op\nerative, but it was a slightly newer version of it.\n&#xa0;\nQ657 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: \nDavid Anderson\n,\n who was then the CEO of CFS—and tell me if this is wrong\n, \njust because it is in evidence from somebody does not mean it is right\n—\nthe evidence given is that David Anderson asked to meet Neville Richardson\n, who was running the Britannia at that time, and pointed out the synergies and the strengths that would accrue within a merger. Was that an accurate picture?\nBarry Tootell: I completely agree with the evidence that has been presented in terms of the complementary nature of the transaction. As I said before, I do not know whether David approached Neville or the other way round.\n&#xa0;\nQ658 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: There is another way of looking at this, which is that the Co-op \nwas\n in a degree of trouble going forward, with difficulty in growing\n. I\nn looking to Britannia as a merger that gave strengths and solved quite a lot of problems\n,\n it would be fair to say that it was not a question of Britannia being taken over or rescued in any way by Co-op, it was CFS seeing in Britannia a solution to its problems and a counterweight to some of the weakness that had been identified.\nBarry Tootell: I completely disagree. Aside from the fact that the IT replacement would have been economically more viable if we had done it from a much larger business perspective, the future of the Co-operative, if we had not expanded, would have been a more niche operator than we thought was the right thing for our members and our customers because we had insufficient reach.\nIn terms of the capital strength of the Co-operative at the time, and in terms of the emergence of the issues thereafter, or up until today, PPI has been a significant issue and it is probably circa £400 million of costs that the Co-operative would have had to have accommodated. \nLooking at the capital base, and the profitability of the Co-operative, that would not have been an issue for the Co-operative.\n&#xa0;\nJohn Thurso: Let me just get this straight\n,\n because a view that has been expressed today is very much one that the Britannia had all these hidden toxic assets and the \nCo-op\n went along and very nicely took it over and then suffered grievously as a result. Neville Richardson’s evidence would seem to present that these are two mutuals that have a complementary set of problems, and a complementary set of assets that\n,\n if put together\n,\n would provide a stronger thing. It is then the CEO of \nCo-op\n who is approaching Britannia and who takes it on both sides through the relevant July strategy days.\n \nYou seem to agree with the proposition at one point and then radically disagree with it afterwards. But is it not the case that it was clearly in \nC\nFS’\ns\n interests to grow and to do the deal?\nBarry Tootell: I think I am correct in suggesting that the only problem that you have alluded to there was the affordability of the IT investment for the scale of bank that we were\n. We\n would have been \nable \nto \naccommodate\n it\n,\n but it would have been more economic if we had done it from a larger base. That was the only issue that we were facing at the time\n.\n \nT\nhere would not have been the issues that we have today\n,\n if the only extra thing we had to accommodate was the emerging cost of PPI and the underlying heritage Co-operative business.\n&#xa0;\nQ659 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: So \nCo-op\n would have been able to deal with PPI on its own?\nBarry Tootell: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ660 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: This is now close to April 2008\n, so y\nou were the full\n-\ntime chief financial officer. The relationship between a CEO and CFO is the tightest in any organisation, usually. So you would have been heavily involved in this. At what point did the internal CFS discussion about \n“T\nhis is a good thing to do\n”\n move to being first of all one that the CFS board started to talk about and then the board of \nCo-op\n were brought into?\nBarry Tootell: I believe it was as early as July 2008.\nJohn Thurso: For the CFS board or the \nCo-op\n board?\nBarry Tootell: Both the CFS board and the \nCo-op\n Group board.\n              \nBy August 2008 we had engaged advisers to proceed with the exercise. Then in January 2009 we had announced to the market that we were progressing towards the deal.\n&#xa0;\nQ661 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: At the time, given the expanding size and your professional knowledge of the regulatory requirements, were you content with the corporate governance structures that were in place?\nBarry Tootell: Yes. The quality of the non-executive\ns\n that I had on my bank board at the time was impressive and they remain so today. So\n,\n yes, I had a very strong board back in 2008.\n&#xa0;\nQ662 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: Sorry, because I just do not know this\n, h\now many of those non-executives were from a banking background?\nBarry Tootell: I think we had five external non-executives.\n&#xa0;Q663 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: That is not the \nCo-op\n non-executives, but the externals?\nBarry Tootell: The external non-executives, the IPNEDs: the independent professional non-executive directors. I think two of them were. Bearing in mind we were also a multi-disciplinary business—we were a general insurance, life assur\nance \nand banking business—we had directors that covered each of those areas of our business.\n&#xa0;\nQ664 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: Do you consider that to have been an adequate structure now that you know what has happened?\nBarry Tootell: Yes. \nT\nhat is not to say we were complacent at the time. I think we have shown our desire and willingness to strengthen still further over the time that has ensued thereafter. \nT\noday we see greater banking expertise than we had at the time. That is not to say we did not have adequate banking expertise back in 2008.\n&#xa0;\nQ665 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: You intimated earlier that you had had an \nopportunity\n to read the \nB\nanking \nC\nommission’s reports. Did you read the one on HBOS entitled: \nAn accident waiting to happen\n?\nBarry Tootell: I did.\n&#xa0;\nQ666 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: Did you notice any similarity between the composition of the boards\n,\n your own and that of HBOS?\nBarry Tootell: No.\n \nThe composition of the board\n,\n at both executive and non-executive levels in\n the bank, and \nthe \nbroader financial \nservices business benefited from the detailed skills and experience from the broader marketplace.\n \nI thought you were going to ask was there \na \nsimilarity between the issues that emerged. \nThe answer to that would have been “yes”\n,\n because clearly what was identified through the due diligence process proved not to have been sufficient to identify the problems that then ensued, with the benefit of hindsight. \nA\nt the time\n,\n we genuinely thought we did an incredibly professional job.\n&#xa0;\nQ667 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: The point behind this is that you had variously 16 to 17 people on the bank board, not the main \nCo-op\n board, of \nwho\n roughly one-\nthird are from the \nCo-op\n board, who broadly do not have an\ny financial services experience?\nBarry Tootell: Indeed.\nJohn Thurso: You \nobviously\n have your executive members \nwho \nclearly do and you ha\nd\n two out of five of the non-execs who had some experience. That falls very considerably short of all the recommendations made by \nthe Banking Commission\n on the balance of a board \nin terms of the balance between\n professional banking and other experiences. Yet you are telling us you think it was hunky dory and no problems at all.\nBarry Tootell: It was felt that it was a strong board at the time, in 2008. Since 2008 we have continued to strengthen it still further. If I look now in 2013 at the Parliamentary Commission’s findings on the matter, I would say that today we have much stronger banking representation in our non-executive directors than we had then. We have continued to strengthen over the time that has ensued\n thereafter\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ668 &#xa0; \nJohn Thurso: \nU\nltimately the board you had in 2008 was as weak as the boards of a number of other banks. So at what point does the advantage of the culture of the mutual that owns the bank—but the bank is a share-structured and regulated equity-based company—become outweighed by the weaknesses of the structure that was put in place?\nBarry Tootell: I think we have genuinely benefited from the diverse opinions that we see in our boardroom. We have the represented views of the broader membership of the group sitting in our boardroom and playing a part in the debate that we have as directors. Whether that be bringing the ethical card to bear or whether that be representing the broader view of the membership, it is a helpful check and balance to some of the decision-making that we have undertaken. I do not think we have fall\nen\n short by having that broader democratic representation in our boardroom.\n&#xa0;\nJohn Thurso: I am having difficulty with this. \nYou are no longer there, but the Co-op Bank—something a lot of us would like to support, both in concept and reality—is now likely to end up as a listed company\n,\n with 30% of its equity owned by the \nCo-op\n board. \nIt is going to have to be run in the way of companies listed on the market with all the good and bad that \ncome\n with that\n,\n and it \nhas \nprobably set back the concept of mutuality in finance \nfor \nsome considerable time.\n \nI am looking to see what could or could not have been avoided in the corporate governance structures\n,\n and you are telling me\n—\nnotwithstanding the sort of cluster what-not that this has become\n—that \nit was all fine. Why should I take that as a credible piece of evidence?\nBarry Tootell: It was\nn’\nt all fine. We made the decision to acquire assets from Britannia in 2009—\ndecision-mak\ning at the end of 2008 into early 2009—based upon the economic data that we had at our disposal and shared extensively with the triumvirate of the regulators, which were HMT, Bank of England and FSA at the time.\nWe put it through \na \nrigorous challenge in the boardroom and we acquired assets. \nP\nreviously, in the late 1990s, early 2000s, \nwe had \nsold PPI products. Those two things are essentially what have brought the business essentially to the position it is in today. \nSo the governance of the business in the here and now or even back in 2008—b\nearing in mind we made that acquisition based on the available information about the future projections for the economy\n—\nI can point to no decision that was made at that time that was not made with the utmost care and professionalism.\nCould there have been more banking directors on the board? Yes, there could. Would it have changed the decision? I am not sure that it would, based on the information we had at our disposal in 2008\n/\n2009.\n&#xa0;\nQ669 &#xa0; \nChair: Your evidence there is suggesting that you were happy with the non-executive structure and with the scrutiny on risk provided from that structure of corporate governance.\n \nHaving heard what John Thurso and others throughout the hearing this morning—and it is now this afternoon—have been saying, is there anything in retrospect, with respect to the corporate governance structure, that you would want to have changed?\nBarry Tootell: Both for its own benefit and to respond to challenge across the marketplace\n,\n \nthe business has \nto continue to evolve and strengthen its governance still further\n. I\nt is continuing to bring greater banking expertise to the fore and \nis \nactually \nreducing the level of \ng\nroup democrats\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ670 &#xa0; \nChair: That is a question about the institution now. I am asking you a question\n with the advantage of hindsight, and \nI will have one more go\n. In\n retrospect, at the time that all these things started to go wrong, or a little prior to that, are there things with respect to corporate governance, ways in which this institution was being run, anything at all that you feel you would like to have altered?\nBarry Tootell: I do not believe so.\n&#xa0;Q671 &#xa0; \nChair: Nothing whatsoever?\nBarry Tootell: I have benefited from a degree of—\nChair: \nI\nt is a clear answer.\nBarry Tootell: —expertise from my non-executive directors that helped me and challenged me in the running of the business. That had been the case since 2008 and all the way through to 2013. Is it continuing to evolve and get even stronger? Yes. Was it inadequate then? I would not suggest it was, no.\nChair: I think we will leave it there. Thank you, Mr \nTootell;\n i\nt has been an extremely illuminating session. It has left many questions unanswered\n,\n as often the best pieces of evidence do in their way. You will understand if we do find aspects of the evidence you have given today disappointing\n. O\nf course it is describing a story that is itself tragic, bearing in mind what has happened to the \nCo-op\n.\n&#xa0;\n"
