[normal]I have been riding on British roads since I was a teenager, including riding to school through heavy traffic in Catford, Lewisham and Blackheath. I’ve lived in Brighton and York, both of which are supposedly cycle-friendly cities, but which suffer from 
[normal]lack of joined up infrastructure, dangerous driving by taxis and buses (the latter more in Brighton than York) and aggression from motorists.
[normal]I would like to add some more 
[normal](perhaps) 
[normal]unusual suggestions to the many excellent recommendations I’m sure you’ve 
[normal]already received.

[normal]I was impressed in Paris last year that many major junctions had had traffic lights removed and tarmac replaced with cobbles. In such cobbled areas, I’m told, the road rules are that the most vulnerable road user takes priority, so cars g
[normal]ive way to cyclists, who give way to pedestrians – and everyone must therefore move slowly and cautiously, basing their judgements upon the actions of other road users. I would like to believe that this kind of legal requirement to consider peoples’ vulner
[normal]ability may overcome much of the hostility and thoughtless behaviour engaged in by so many road users (including cyclists!)
[normal].

[normal]Generally, my experience in York has been that where there are no traffic li
[normal]ghts and ambiguous right of way -
[normal] such as a gyratory w
[normal]ith two roads feeding into it from different directions and a cyclists from a third (with no cycle path once on the gyratory) 
[normal]- 
[normal]everyone is very courteous
[normal]:
[normal] drivers often give way to me at this junction.
[normal] The general confusion is actually beneficial to consi
[normal]derate road use all round.
[normal] This is very different to where there are bike boxes at traffic lights and some drivers seem to resent cyclists using them because we move off slower than they’d like. Taxi drivers frequently occupy these boxes, presumably to pre
[normal]vent cyclists 
[normal]getting in front of them
[normal].

[normal]I heard that in Queensland they have just introduced legal guidance as to how much space to leave when overtaking cyclists. I think this is vital information that simply isn’t in peoples’ minds. A public information
[normal] film, showing what can happen when a cyclist is blown by a gust of wind or has to dodge a pothole if a driver is squeezing past with a wing-mirror’s width space would be helpful. 
[normal] Cyclists need enough space to fall off their bike for no reason. Overtaking
[normal] a bicycle is still an overtaking manoeuvre. This is rarely recognised by drivers in my opinion.

[normal]I know many cyclists who have been injured when someone opens a car door in their path. In many cases, cyclists have some responsibility in these accidents as
[normal] almost every cyclist I know rides too close to parked cars. If you try to ride a doors width away from parked cars, of course, drivers become impatient with you for hogging the lane. Again, public information films would be immensely helpful, both exhorti
[normal]ng cyclists not to ride a safe distance into the road and making it clear to car users that this is for safety and not road hogging.
[normal] Also, ALL cycle lanes which put cyclists within a car door’s width of parked cars should be removed immediately or redrawn 
[normal](or the parking spaces removed). No cycle lane at all is safer than one which puts cyclists directly at risk in this way.

[normal]There have been many deaths due to lorry drivers turning left. I do not wish to attribute blame for this: both parties 
[normal]must
[normal] be carefu
[normal]l. But stickers on the backs of large vehicles advising cyclists not to overtake on the inside – especially near junctions – might discourage 
[normal]some dangerous decisions
[normal] by cyclists
[normal]. I know such stickers have done so for me in the past. I think they should be
[normal] made compulsory on all large vehicles.
[normal] It sounds like a tiny thing, and my cycle-campaigning friends would be disgusted at me for suggesting cyclists are ever culpable, but I believe this small, simple measure could save lives.

[normal]In light of the recent spa
[normal]te of deaths in London, I think the Mayor’s Office should fund free cycle training sessions for adults. Children get cycle training at school, but many adults think they can jump on a bike because they drive a car, or know the road rules. There are a lot o
[normal]f specialised skills to learn for riding safely in city traffic, and many regular cyclists just don’t know them, as is clear when I watch people cycle along in the gutter, or close to parked cars, or signalling badly etc.
