"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Africa Network Campaign on Education For All&#xa0;\nQuality Education For All Falls Short If Children With Disabilities Are ExcludedIntroductionAfrica Network Campaign on Education For All (ANCEFA) is a voluntary, non-partisan and not-for profit network of national civil society organizations in Africa championing the cause for quality education\n for all. The membership currently stand at 35 national education coalitions, each of them constituting diverse membership including NGOs, Teachers Unions, Human Rights, Child Rights and Education Rights Activists, Media Practitioners, Researchers, Academi\na, Community Based Organizations\n and sub-thematic networks.\n&#xa0;\nANCEFA envisions a \nLiterate and Empowered Africa\n where Quality Education For All is a reality enjoyed by all children, youth and adults, without any hindrances whatsoever. In order to realize its\n dream, ANCEFA’s mandate is to enhance capacity of African Civil Society to efficiently and effectively push for universal access to quality education and development through campaign, advocacy, networking, research and resource mobilization.\n&#xa0;\nANCEFA striv\nes to support the emergence of vibrant civil society networks, coalitions and alliances that critically engage in EFA processes at the local, national, regional and international levels, among other core objectives and \ndeploys such strategies as c\noalition \nbuilding and strengthening\n, c\napacity \ndevelopment\n \nfor skills and competencies on campaign, l\nobbying, \na\ndvocacy, \nr\nesearch, \nn\networking, and\n policy analysis, information ma\nnagement\n, facilitating l\nocal, \nn\national, \nr\negional and \ninternational p\nolicy \nd\nialogues\n, p\nart\nnership building\n, and e\nlections and \nb\nudget \na\ndvocacy\n, among others\n&#xa0;\nStrategic Campaign Focus of ANCEFAIn its current strategic plan, ANCEFA focuses on \nEducation Financing and Inclusion (Working with Parliamentarians and Political Part\nies and Building EFA Champions), \nNational and Local Accountability via Public Expenditure Tracking Survey and \nParticipatory School Governance, Promoting \nQuality/Learning Outcomes with Teachers, Youth and Volunteers, Parents, and the Media as strategic part\nners\n; \nStrategic policy engagement for meaningful change in policy and practice around ECCD, UPE, Out of School Youth, Girls Access, Retention and \nCompletion, and Adult and Continuing Learning\n; \nEFA Monitoring through Education Watch\n; and \nOverseas Developmen\nt Aid Agenda\n tracking\n&#xa0;\nWhy Inclusion is the way to go for governments and donor aid should target this&#xa0;\nFor the period of 2009 – 2012, ANCEFA with the support of Save the Children UK, undertook an action-oriented survey in the ECOWAS region of Africa to underscore the significance of the inclusive Education and how it would accelerate the access to quality E\nducation by children with disabilities. \nMany children whom most are psychologically or physically disabled are prevented from going to school simply because no one thought about integrating adapted learning, teaching and construction facilities to accommod\nate them. \nNot less that 5% of the total children population in the countries of the region has been projected to have one disability or the other (\nANCEFA \nReport ECOWAS, 2013)\nThe first shocking revelation is that there is absolutely no reliable data \non a d\nisaggregated manner showing\n the statistics of the disabled children, more so on the nature of disability. ANCEFA and partners thus heavily rooted for an inclusive Education process that would ensure that EVERY child is in school\n and LEARNING. Development p\nartners have thus been called upon to support the process with governments being asked to take the lead since delivery of INCLISVE EDUCATION should be the top priority of every government\n&#xa0;\nFurther, disabled children and girls in rural areas do not go to sc\nhool and in urban areas, special schools are insufficient. Consequently, most disabled children are totally excluded from the educational system.\n&#xa0;\nInclusive Education relates to all children accessing and meaningfully participating in quality Education in \nways that are responsive to their individual needs. Inclusive education is therefore expected to meet EVERYONE’s rights to Education.\n&#xa0;\nIt is universally agreed that every child has a fundamental right to \nEducation and that every child CAN Learn. Further \nevery stakeholder and lead agencies including governments and donor aid agencies should acknowledge and respect differences in children. Education structures, systems and methodologies must meet the needs of every children, and where \nhistorically disabled \nchildren have been discriminated against, schools have to accommodate children with special educational needs and redress the past imbalance\n&#xa0;\nIncreasing awareness and vigilance among communities, enhancing capacity building of MPs and journalists on inclus\nive education, budget tracking and child rights, advocacy on inclusive education and increased budget allocations, popularization of instruments and texts on children rights, sensitization and lobbying using diverse means should help address the problem\n&#xa0;\nNational and international partnerships need to be enhanced to tackle the perennial exclusion of the children with disability from Education. A call to all international aid agencies to promote this would be a welcome move\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n International instruments governing Education e.g.\nUDHR, UNCRC, African Charter on the Rights and Wellbeing\n of the Child\n&#xa0;\n"
