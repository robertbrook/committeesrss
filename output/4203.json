"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from Network Rail\n (SLC \n045)\nFurther\n \nto my a\nppearance before the committee on 4 November in connection\n with the above inquiry I am w\nriting to follow up on a number of issues raised during\n the oral evidence session.\nUfton\n \nNervet\nThe Committee asked about the progress of plans for a bridge at \nUfton\n \nNervet\n to replace the automatic half barrier crossing currently there.\nAs the Committee may be aware, the crossing at \nUfton\n \nNervet\n pro\nvides access from the A4 to \nUfton\n \nNerv\net\n village. This means that the closure of the crossing to facilitate the construction of a bridge\n on the same \nalignment\n as \nthe road is \nnot possible without effectively cutting the village off.\nThe lo\ncal council and local community\n have been\n \nclear that this\n \napproach\n \nwould not be acceptable and this means that we will need to purchase land in order to build the bridge\n \nadjacent to the crossing.\n \nAt this stage we are actively engaged\n \nin dialogue with\n \nthe\n \nlandowners\n \nregarding\n \npurchasing\n \nthis\n \nland\n \nand\n \nthe\n \noutcome\n \nof\n \nthese discussions\n \nis essential to enable us to establish the location of the proposed bridge.\nIn terms of the bridge construction itself, we have issued an Invitation to Tender with a programme to award a contract\n \nin the coming weeks.\n \nThe appointed designer\n \nwill then complete a detailed option selection\n \nreport that we envisage\n \nsubmitting early in Control\n \nPeriod\n \n5\n \n(2014-19).\n \nThe\n \nindicative\n \ndelivery\n \ntimescale\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nbridge\n \nis therefore\n \nby\n \nthe\n \nend\n \nof\n \n2015. If\n \nnegotiations\n \nover\n \nthe\n \nland\n \npurchase\n \nproceed smoothly it is possible we may be able to bring this date forward. \nAs I am sure you will understand it is incumbent\n \non Network Rail to demonstrate why the bridge is our strongly preferred option given there is likely to be some potential for objection.\nThird party contributions towards level crossing closures\nDuring the evidence session the Committee also asked for examples of where development in\n \nclose\n \nproximity\n \nto\n \nlevel\n \ncrossings\n \nhad\n \nenabled\n \ncontributions from third parties towards crossing closures.\n \nA number\n \nof brief examples\n \nare below.\n \nAs mentioned in the evidence session we often find it very difficult to secure these contributions but are keen for councils to continue helping us do so wherever developments\n \nsignificantly\n \nimpact\n \nupon\n \ncrossing\n \nusage\n \nand\n \ntherefore\n \nthe\n \nlevel\n \nof safety risk.\n \nIf the Committee would like further details on any of these examples\n \nthen we would be happy to assist.\nHawkes\n Lane, Suffolk\nA new\n \nstepped\n \nfootbridge\n \nat \nHawkes\n \nLane\n \nis scheduled\n \nfor installation\n \nby\n \nMarch\n2014 and is being funded entirely by Suffolk County Council.\n \nThis is the result of the increased\n \nusage\n \nof\n \nthe\n \ncrossing\n \nexpected\n \nfrom\n \nthe\n \nlocal council's\n \nnew\n \nacademy which is under\n \nconstruction\n \nadjacent\n \nto the railway\n \nat this location\n \non the grounds and\n \nNetwork\n \nRail's\n \nobjection\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nplanning\n \napplication\n \non\n \nthe\n \nbasis\n \nof\n \nsafety concerns.\n&#xa0;\nCottingham\n, Yorkshire\nA\n \nproposed\n \ndevelopment at \nCottingham\n \nis estimated\n \nto increase\n \nrisk\n \nat the\n \nlevel crossing by 20% because of increased usage.\n \nThe developer\n \nis therefore making\n \na\n \n20% contribution of £200,000 contribution towards a footbridge which will enable\n \nthe closure of the \nBingham, \nNottingharnshire\nA supermarket development is contributing £650,000 towards a new footbridge at the station and improvements to a level crossing.\nSleaford, Lincolnshire\nA level crossing at Sleaford is being closed with a developer\n \npaying the full cost of a new road bridge over the railway.\n \nThe developer\n \nis also contributing £450,000\n \nfor a footbridge nearby, with the local council contributing\n \nthe remainder\n \nin recognition of the development's\n \nregeneration potential.\nFinally,\n \nthe\n \nCommittee\n \nasked\n \nabout\n \nthe number\n \nof non-compliant level crossings. We carry out a number of relevant\n \nlevel crossing\n \nrisk management activities\n \nduring routine maintenance\n \nand operations.\n \nThis includes scheduled risk assessments and scheduled\n \ninspections\n \nof asset\n \ncondition\n \nthat\n \nidentify\n \ndefects. \n              \nWhen\n \ndefects\n \nare identified, a work order\n \nis issued.\n \nAs of 26 November\n \n2013\n \nthere were 793\n \nlevel crossings with overdue work orders.\n \nI would\n \nhowever like to offer my assurance that identified\n \ndefects\n \nare assessed and managed\n \nbased\n \non their\n \nrisk\n \nrating\n \nwith high priority, high risk\n \ndefects\n \nresolved\n \nimmediately or very quickly\n \nwithin mandated timescales.\nI hope the above information is of assistance to the committee.\nRobin \nGisby\nManaging Director, Network Operations\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
