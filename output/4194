[normal]Written evidence from the 
[normal]Sevenoaks Cycle Forum (CYS0088)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Debate continues to be based on the
[normal] widely shared but erroneous 
[normal]assumption that road safety is accurately defined by crash and casualty statistics.  
[normal]During its 2012 inquiry
[normal] your
[normal] committee notably failed to ask the basic question ‘What is road safety and how 
[normal]should it be measured
[normal]?’ The current inquiry should make amends
[normal] by revisiting this question
[normal] and should make clear that road safety includes 
[normal]much 
[normal]more than just casualty reduction
[normal].   The 
[normal]exclusive 
[normal]reliance on 
[normal]Stats19 data
[normal] 
[normal]to measure safety for cyclists and pedestrians 
[normal]is flawed for at least three reasons: a) it leads t
[normal]o an assumption that an absence of crashes and casualties 
[normal]on 
[normal]a particular road means that 
[normal]road 
[normal]is ‘safe’
[normal],
[normal] when in fact 
[normal]it is 
[normal]often 
[normal]so unsafe that pedestrians and cyclists are forced to avoid it. 
[normal]b
[normal]) crashes involving cyclists are often un
[normal]der-
[normal]reported 
[normal]c
[normal]) ann
[normal]ual reductions in 
[normal]overall 
[normal]KSI figures owe
[normal] more to improved
[normal] NHS casualty treatment and
[normal] better
[normal] vehicle design to protect motorists
[normal] than to real improvements in road safety 
[normal] for vulnerable users
[normal].
[normal]  Road safety is a complex area of social policy, like public he
[normal]alth
[normal], child protection
[normal] or community safety, but 
[normal]the conventional wisdom among road safety professionals does not reflect this.  Nobody would measure public health
[normal] outcomes
[normal] by looking solely at statistics for acute episodes such as heart attacks and strokes
[normal].  Nobody would measure crime by looking solely at murders and serious assaults. 
[normal]Nobody would measure child welfare by counting only children who are taken to hospital.
[normal] But road safety is 
[normal]still 
[normal]measured solely by looking at KSI statistics.  The DfT should 
[normal]copy the Home Office which supplements police statistics of recorded crime by publishing the British Crime Survey.  A British Road Safety Survey using opinion sampling would be an overdue innovation and your committee should recommend it.  
[normal]It is not enough
[normal] just to tell people that cycling is statistically safe; for inexperienced cyclists and potential cyclists, an individual risk assessment based on their own perceptions
[normal] 
[normal]is what counts.
[normal] 
[normal]This is 
[normal]particularly important 
[normal]when parents are deciding whether or not
[normal] to let their children ride bikes on the road.

[normal]I think these recommendations would help give your report a broader national perspective on the issue of cycle safety outside major cities.  
[normal]That is not to say that the issues emerging from the London debate (HGV safety, segregation, cycle training and redesign of junctions)
[normal] are not also relevant in rural and suburban areas.  We would just like a tiny fraction of the attention (and the generous
[normal] funding) which is being directed towards cycle safety in London to be channelled in our direction as well.
