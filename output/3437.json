"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by University College London (UCL (AMR0039)&#xa0;\nUCL has recently convened an AMR network to bring together cross discipline research and expertise in this area from across the university. We are pleased to make a short submission into the Select Committee’s inquiry into antimicrobial resistance drawn from the network, and these issues will be addressed in detail at the upcoming meeting ‘\nA response to the Department of Health Antibiotic Resistance Strategy’\n.\n1\n \n&#xa0;\nHow has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n \nD\netails at\n: \nhttp://www.eventbrite.com/event/9047052979\nnationally coherent manner, with little interest from pharmaceutical companies and limited routes for the development of lead compounds developed in academic settings. We note the contribution of various Research Council schemes and the IMI initiative; however, whilst important these are not sufficient: sustained investment in all stages of the pipeline is required to ensure the flow of new compounds from concept to medicine. \n&#xa0;\nIs there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?\n&#xa0;\nBehaviour change\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\nStone, Fuller, Savage, Cookson et al, BMJ, 2012.\n3\nFuller, Michie, Savage, McAteer et al, PLoS One, 2012.\n&#xa0;\n engagement. We emphasise that changing behavior requires interventions at many levels (population, community, individuals) and which are simultaneous and consistent. Whilst the AMR \nstrategy mentions a number of interventions which represent a positive way forward (such as education, training, encouragement, audit, and guidelines), it is not always clear how the strategy will ensure that the appropriate interventions are made on a multi-level, concurrent and consistent basis. The strategy should ensure that behavioural change interventions are designed on the basis of a thorough diagnosis of behavioural ‘problems’ and are applied in a clearly targeted way to address specific diagnoses – \nie\n there is unlikely to be a ‘blanket’ behaviour change intervention. There should also, as the strategy does recognize, be recurrent evaluation of the impact of such interventions.\n&#xa0;\nEngagement with the antibiotic development pipeline\n&#xa0;\nResources to support implementation\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n \nInnovative trial designs are practical solutions for improving the treatment of tuberculosis.\nPhillips PP, Gillespie SH, Boeree M, Heinrich N, Aarnoutse R, McHugh T, Pletschette M, Lienhardt C, Hafner R, Mgone C, Zumla A, Nunn AJ, Hoelscher M. \nJ Infect Dis\n. 2012 May 15;205 Suppl 2:S250-7. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jis041.
