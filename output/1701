[normal]Written evidence submitted by Pier Logistics And Cardiff University (WSC052)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Overview[bold]The recommendations established 
[normal]herein derive
[normal] from
[normal] our
[normal] experience as 
[normal]academic 
[normal]researchers whose critical lens has focused on issues of gender in science or STEM in educational and work-placed contexts. Our recommendations therefore are 
[normal]directed at 
[normal]addre
[normal]ssing
[normal] what we perceive as
[normal] persistent inconsistency and inadequacy
[normal] in the
[normal] experience and
[normal] treatment of women in STEM
[normal] domains 
[normal]predominantly associated with gender-based discrimination.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our interpreta
[normal]tion in respect of retaining women in STEM is that 
[normal]retainment
[normal] is inextricably linked
[normal] and contingent upon a policy of effective enga
[normal]gement and 
[normal]recruitment. Strategies for retaining 
[normal]women in STEM
[normal] should
[normal],
[normal] in our opinion, not be limited and/or bound to 
[normal]intervention at the stage of Higher Education or employment. Retaining women in STEM is a process which ought to begin long before such juncture. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Crucially, we interpret a process of retaining women in STEM at higher levels, as that which begins with the
[normal] appropriate selection of candidates – but concurrently the widest and most extensive selection process
[normal] linking science to the most heterogeneous and diverse cross-section of scientific ‘
[normal]prospectives
[normal]’
[normal]; that which furnishes candidates with 
[normal]the 
[normal]requisite tra
[normal]ining, knowledge and skills to be the best scientists (regardless of gender) and which renders gender obsolete in the context of scientific excellence; that which does not conceal but makes explicit the harsh reality of the STEM professions
[normal] through the bes
[normal]t guidance and advice; and which is underpinned by the mobilization of positive female identities in STEM. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Primary[bold] recommendations[bold]1.1 
[normal]For purposes of
[normal] stabilizing and ameliorating the part
[normal]icipation of women in STEM, primary stakeholders including
[normal] the HE
[normal] sector, Government, industry and b
[normal]usiness must assume 
[normal]joint
[normal] responsibility in enabling women in STEM: 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]broaden their scientific imagination and powers of envisaging themselves as 
[normal]equal, self-efficacious and entitled 
[normal]learners and professionals
[normal] in STEM cont
[normal]exts through:
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]by enlarging
[normal] their capacity to emulate yet concurrently elaborate (or build upon) the scientific exc
[normal]ellence of existing research ‘stars’
[normal] thr
[normal]ough for instance, mentorship or
[normal] shadowing schemes
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]by drawing on cross-
[normal]sectoral
[normal] and cross-disciplinary experiences: learning from outside STEM
[normal] – women in industry and business.
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]by segmenting STEM and considering each
[normal] STEM discipline in re
[normal]lation to issues of gender bias and thereby also learning what specific approaches have been deployed across the variety of contexts – in other words, a more precise and bespoke approach to identifying and responding to the needs and 
[normal]concerns of women in STEM
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 
[normal]Fundamentally
[normal],
[normal] all these aspects require 
[normal]greater linkage and 
[normal]integration in a more joined-up, nuanced and reified discourse
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]Higher Education[bold] and STEM[bold]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]Retainment
[normal] of women graduates in the Higher Education (HE) sector 
[normal]begins with universities becoming more cognisant
[normal] and self-conscious
[normal] of, and proactive in, their role as catalysts in a supply chain of female science minds. Much of this depends on the strategy of universities in
[normal] continuously
[normal] speaking with and learning from the experience not only of 
[normal]their staff and 
[normal]existing student cohorts but prospective
[normal] students
[normal] and thereafter
[normal] past staff and
[normal] alumni.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal] Universities and the Higher Education community more generally, must develop a more pro
[normal]active and sustained response to issues of gendered 
[normal]disproportionality
[normal] within the 
[normal]professoriate
[normal] and across the academic hierarchy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]Subscription to the kinds of gender-rebalancing/neutralizing initiatives such as 
[normal]Athena Swann 
[normal]is definitely useful in te
[normal]rms of encouraging greater promotion of the female voice in Higher Education settings. Similarly universities engaged in recruitment policies focused on redressing the balance of gender in their workforce are advantageous. How much however is the implement
[normal]ation of this kind of gender-promotion ever more than ceremonial and furthermore, how much does intervention of this kind level the playing-field? How much also, might this kind of policy intervention backfire, where a women-scientist is recruited and perc
[normal]eives her recruitment to be on the basis of her gender, less her expertise and excellence as a researcher and/or teacher. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal] The role of the non-STEM based disciplines, such as the social sciences are crucial in leading necessary discussion (and critiqu
[normal]e) of issues and challenges indigenous to STEM and in addressing fundamental questions about identity, equality and democracy which scientific innovation 
[normal]problematize
[normal]s
[normal]. Social scientists must therefore 
[normal]become
[normal] more conspicuously involved – in 
[normal]inter or trans
[normal]-disciplinary ways.
[normal]   
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]Early initiation in STEM[bold]3.1
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is not only universities that play an integral part in the 
[normal]retainment
[normal] and proliferation of women in STEM. The mantle of responsibility in this instance falls just as much to schools: primary and secondary; teachers; parents and indirectly, peers and othe
[normal]r sources of influence and/or inspiration found in informal contexts: museums; science centres; and mainstream media, stimulating and safeguarding the supply chain 
[normal]of women in STEM – building instructional and cultural bridges connecting STEM to everyday l
[normal]ives; providing relevance and raising a sense of belonging, ownership and aspiration. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal] 
[normal]Retaining the supply of women in STEM is inseparably linked to ensuring supply is fluid, fertile and unimpeded. Strategies for retaining women in STEM must therefor
[normal]e focus not only in responding to the needs of those in STEM employment or even those enrolled in STEM university courses, but have a life-course vision which begins with the early initiation of prospective female scientists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal] 
[normal]Early exposure to and imp
[normal]lantation of the idea of science as a realistic career choice is indivisible from more women being impassioned with science. Cementing a passion for science begins with early cultivation, almost from 
[normal]‘
[normal]year-one
[normal]’
[normal], where juvenescent minds begin to engage with
[normal] the plurality and 
[normal]diversity of science in its multiple contexts and iterations, and where a robustness and resolve against the many inequities and gender disparities found in STEM is forged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4. [bold]Building critical mass[bold]4.1 
[normal]The gendered construction of S
[normal]TEM may only fully destabilize, where sufficient numbers of women combine to contest and defeat prejudice and processes which delimit and/or deny their participation, ascent and acceleration in STEM careers.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]The persistence of unequal gendered repr
[normal]esentation in STEM, results not only from a lack of consistency in terms of occupational conditions and opportunities by gender, but by the very fact that a lack of female representation in STEM diminishes the audibility and authority of the counter-claim.
[normal] In other words, a culture of resistance that might disrupt discriminatory practice in STEM
[normal] 
[normal]depends on the mobilization of a collective and unified voice of objection. In this context, we believe it 
[normal]erroneous 
[normal]to isolate and/or quarantine young female learn
[normal]ers of STEM from the realities of their potential/chosen profession. Female learners should instead be made explicitly aware of issues of unequal and discriminatory gender practice in STEM, yet concurrently, be provided with the necessary tools with which 
[normal]to combat and hopefully, overturn all forms of prejudice and inequity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]It is, in our opinion, albeit well-intentioned, a misplaced strategy to insulate, protect and conceal from female learners and aspirant women scientists the harsh realities of 
[normal]their occupational futures. A more pragmatic approach is in providing female learners
[normal] and early career scientists
[normal] with th
[normal]e right kinds of emotional and intellectual scaffolding
[normal] 
[normal]that will allow them to pre-empt, circumvent or counter the inevitability of ex
[normal]posure to forms of work-based gender discrimination. The female collective in science is an essential part of early career support; a key weapon in the armoury against gender discrimination; and the platform from which to fight for and further the rights o
[normal]f women in STEM. Quintessentially, the 
[normal]retainment
[normal] of women in STEM demands increased recruitment in STEM where a critical mass and the power 
[normal]of many enables
[normal] and enforces
[normal] change. 
[normal]     
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]Whilst, important to provide scientific 
[normal]prospectives
[normal] with an hones
[normal]t and open account of STEM, care and sensitivity is needed in ensuring that candidates are not
[normal] discouraged or
[normal] ‘put-off’ and 
[normal]that emerging ambitions and aspirations are neither quashed or derailed. This may only further damage numbers of girls electing STEM
[normal] subject choices.
[normal] Nevertheless, 
[normal]prospectives
[normal] should not assume that a career in STEM will be in any way easy. It will not. False advertisement of this kind is 
[normal]perhaps even more deleterious to
[normal] the science community. Crucially, science is not for everyone. N
[normal]ot every girl
[normal], nor for that matter
[normal] every boy
[normal],
[normal] will be well suited to science career. For that matter STEM is not ‘the be all and end all’. Whilst STEM is massively important and provides an indispensable skill set for all learners, we should not presume th
[normal]at every child will have interest in science or necessarily want to be a scientist. This is the more tacit danger when pursuing a STEM agenda, not least one among girls. We should not lose sight of the multiple other kinds of occupations outside of STEM 
[normal]no
[normal]r become so infatuated with its promotion, that we find ourselves recruiting into STEM the kinds 
[normal]of individuals whose talents and
[normal] skills are far better aligned to other subject and occupational contexts.
[normal] Nevertheless, increased opportunity-for-learning and
[normal] consideration of a career STEM will redress the existing gender imbalance in STEM careers.
[normal]4.5 
[normal]Physics is one STEM discipline well publicised for its lack of specialist teachers. Subject specialism in STEM is identified as analogous with the quality of cu
[normal]rriculum-delivery and thereby the extent to which learners are engaged and a positive learning experience ensures. A correlation is made between effective curriculum-delivery and the specialist as someone with ownership of, investment in, and passion for, 
[normal]teaching her/his subject area. 
[normal]Those with a passion for their STEM subject will be more likely able to transfer the same kinds of enthusiasm for their subject, than those with a cursory interest. 
[normal]However, it is also worth considering that specialists may 
[normal]b
[normal]e prone to overly influence, prejudice or manipulate students’ subject choices and aspirations, where their persuasiveness is acute and where their promotion of their subject is more evangelical than enthusiastic.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. [bold]Dialogue[bold]5.1 
[normal]The provision by universities and STEM employers of neutral, supportive and safe spaces for dialogue is a key component of ensuring that where female scientists encounter difficulties in their professional 
[normal]lives;
[normal] 
[normal]these are identified and resolved as quickl
[normal]y and with as little fuss as possible.
[normal] Dialogue in such
[normal] terms can only help to accentuate a culture of transpar
[normal]ency, where instances
[normal] of work-place and gender-based discrimination, prejudice, bullying and harassment are
[normal] disclosed, censured,
[normal] 
[normal]averted and/or e
[normal]xpunged.
[normal]   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 
[normal]Dialogue and consultation may 
[normal]also be interpreted
[normal] as interventions which intersect in the context of 
[normal]research. 
[normal]Unequivocally
[normal], more research, or be that action-research, is required in responding to many of the unanswered or unsatisfactoril
[normal]y answered questions related to why women’s participation in STEM continues to be problematic; for the purpose of producing indisputable evidence which policy cannot ignore and must act upon and with; and research which unites all those common to 
[normal]the exper
[normal]ience 
[normal]of gender inequity
[normal] across disciplines and sectoring: empowering and 
[normal]forti
[normal]fying through collective discourse and shared identity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3 
[normal]For the purposes of attracting, retaining and replenishing greater numbers of women in STEM and generally for great
[normal]er representation of women in STEM at all levels, the perpetuation of a common discourse uniting and permeating all levels of the education and training sector; Government; and industry is pivotal. The promotion of common intelligence and a shared vision f
[normal]or women in STEM within/across the ‘triple-helix’ is essential: ensuring that sufficient in-roads are being made not simply in balancing the gender equation in STEM in all domains, but that the best possible candidates are recruited from an equal talent-po
[normal]ol. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6. [bold]Careers-guidance[bold]6.1 
[normal]Whilst most, if not all, universities are equipped with infrastructure and internal service dedicated to supporting the student experience in pastoral and professional terms, these may in practice tend to be more generalist or ‘catch-all’ in orientation an
[normal]d in tackling more rudimentary or procedural concerns. For instance, student 
[normal]‘
[normal]inquiries
[normal]’
[normal] may focus more on issues surrounding accommodation, financial support or payment of tuition fees.
[normal] Issues pertaining directly to concerns or grievances in respect of st
[normal]udents’ taught experience or professional development are largely 
[normal]outwith
[normal] the remit of these kinds of services – though of course university counsellors, NUS officer
[normal]s
[normal] may play their part. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 
[normal]The seem
[normal]ingly most obvious location for the kinds of advice th
[normal]at might facilitate, not only those enrolled on course in STEM disciplines, but students from across all disciplinary domains, are university careers services or professional careers counsellors working within university contexts. 
[normal]Careers advice and guidan
[normal]ce is however potentially compromised by two intervening factors: 
[normal]i
[normal]) the degree of confidence and esteem with which students holds such advice ii) the degree of specialisation or lack thereof of the careers counsellor in respect of STEM careers for which t
[normal]here are evidently myriad – STEM counsellors may tend to be more generalist advisers than dedicated specialists iii) the degree to which a counsellor is fully connected with STEM industry partners and therein the involvement of STEM industry graduate recru
[normal]iters. Issues in the provision of STEM guidance, which may be correlated to issues of 
[normal]selection, 
[normal]retention
[normal]/attribution at university and labour-market levels, are not exclusive to universities, but at an early stage of learners’ choice-making. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3 
[normal]There 
[normal]is strong evidence demonstrating that the provision of quality advice/guidance enabling students to make the right careers choices in STEM is pivotal. However, the kinds of professional careers advice on offer to many of the UK’s school-children is limited
[normal] and fragmentary and increasingly exported to an online (more cost-effective) interface. One of the major issues in the digitalisation of career guidance is that the interactional basis of a student talking through and thereby thinking through her options 
[normal]is lost with a careers counsellor is lost. The misconception of careers guidance is that it is a one-way relationship, with the counsellor engaged purely in 
[normal]transmissional
[normal] and 
[normal]uni
[normal]-directional terms. Careers guidance however is or at least should be a
[normal]n open
[normal], unbiased
[normal] dialogue.  What is needed then, are professional careers counsellors, able to engage and dialogue with 
[normal]individuals involved in 
[normal]early, intermediate and 
[normal]on-going
[normal] 
[normal]creative imaginations
[normal] about
[normal] their personal/professional identities, aspirations etc. 
[normal]The careers counsellor is th
[normal]erefore a key component of such
[normal] deliberative exercises that focus and orient an individual’s formative development as a learner, accruing new knowledge and skills and a heightened awareness of the opportunities and obstacles tha
[normal]t might expedite or impede 
[normal]their maturation as STEM learners or scientists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. [bold]Role models[bold]7.1 
[normal]Much has been made of the use of successful female scientists as role models for the purpose of attracting and retaining greater numbers of women in STEM. 
[normal]Same-sex role models or ambassadors in STEM are advocated for their contribution in
[normal] rescuing,
[normal] rehabilitating and mobilising the mind-sets of those contemplating STEM subject choices/careers governed by misassumptions regards to their suitability for a STEM
[normal] career, purely on the grounds of gender. 
[normal]Senior STEM role models offer evidence that women can achieve real success in STEM contexts and rise to positions of authority and high office. The effectiveness of senior role models may also however be potentiall
[normal]y compromised by a lack of 
[normal]aspirational
[normal]-proximity or in other words a sense that their achievements, when contextualized amidst the paucity of their numbers, appear even more exceptional, out-of-reach or through the more sceptical lens, 
[normal]serendipitous
[normal]. In t
[normal]his context, senior role models whilst offering ‘proof-of-concept’ also demonstrate the arduousness of the STEM career for women, and a sense that even limited success will be hard-fought – and not according to principles of meritocracy or 
[normal]a 
[normal]level playing 
[normal]field of opportunity between the sexes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2 
[normal]Where role models
[normal]’
[normal] powers of persuasion in convincing younger women of the potential of a career in STEM are in such way enervated, the role model concept itself should
[normal] not
[normal] necessarily be abandoned but rethought
[normal] and revised. 
[normal]One immediate thought is in reconsidering the 
[normal]‘
[normal]pedestal
[normal]’
[normal] approach, moving away from the elevation of the role model as a star – the exceptionality of this approach being alienating less enticing. Whilst remaining faithful to recognising and e
[normal]xploiting the achievements of women in
[normal] STEM for the purpose of good public relations
[normal] – role models might exist at every level of the academic hierarchy and not only the 
[normal]professoriate
[normal]. This would require a flat-hierarchy system of rewards and recognition sy
[normal]stem designed to identify and celebrate the successes of the entire academic community from undergraduate to postdoctoral researcher to professor. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3 
[normal]Female STEM champions across all academic hierarchies would serve to magnify the focus of female succes
[normal]s in STEM and concurrently provide improved accessibility – through localised and proximal 
[normal]experience ‘between’ and ‘across’ researcher/teacher cohorts
[normal]. In another sense the proliferation of female STEM champions across a flat hierarchy will contribute to 
[normal]the visibility and prominence of critical mass as opp
[normal]osed to the isolated champ
[normal]ion
[normal] – externally to STEM 
[normal]prospectives
[normal].
[normal] Internally, b
[normal]olstering a sense of 
[normal]collective identity and 
[normal]community of 
[normal]women in STEM, will 
[normal]ameliorate a sense of legitimacy and credibilit
[normal]y
[normal] and foster a sense of affiliation and thereby ownership.
