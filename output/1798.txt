[[[How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including ]]]

[[[rural and urban areas and island communities)?]]]&#xa0;2.1. As context, a complete network redesign and recast of services would carry a high risk of losing many more current passengers than those it may gain. Given that people often make decisions on where they live and where they work based on current provision, there is a need to produce a degree of stability in the provision of the public transport network if we wish to avoid taking away the means of getting to work for these people. &#xa0;2.2. Identifying unmet demand in a way that can result in significant passenger flows is not easy, and a service designed for this will often take a long period of operation to translate into significant passenger flows. &#xa0;2.3. In addition to identifying how current services meet demand, unlike for new housing or business development areas, new demands in rural or isolated areas tend to be more limited and of relatively small flows. The common means of identifying demand are through:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers ]]]

[[[(e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?]]]&#xa0;3.1. For people with disabilities, the increasing proportion of services operated by low floor accessible buses is improving accessibility for many. Dial a Ride/ Ring &amp; Ride  services for the “frail elderly and disabled” can provide for those who cannot physically access conventional bus services either due to boarding difficulties or due to distance from the bus stop. Other services can also be provided, e.g. to provide bespoke transport to health services/hospitals.&#xa0;3.2. The degree to which Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services are actually able to cater for access to work, as opposed to access to town centre and other essential services, needs to be questioned. They are not always well-suited to catering for regular journeys to/ from work by workers, given constraints that long term pre-booking ahead cannot be guaranteed where routeing has to compromise to take account of all users across an area. &#xa0;3.3. Engagement with young people suggests that they tend not to favour pre-booked DRT services as they feel better served by regular timetabled services given the “turn-up-and-go” nature of much of their travel patterns. Fare levels can also be a barrier for young people’s travel.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associated ]]]

[[[with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?]]]&#xa0;4.1. It is difficult to generalise on specific solutions given geographical differences across the country in both urban and rural areas where isolation is an issue: terrain, road pattern/ density, the various ways different towns can act as a draw for people to visit and work, etc. Barriers to travel can occur in urban as well as rural areas.&#xa0;4.2. A one size-fits all approach in relation to service type is unlikely to be beneficially applied to all rural or urban areas. Different service types, and different mixes at times of DRT and timetabled services, will suit different areas.&#xa0;4.3. Rural passenger flows are frequently diverse and often cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes. Where there are different needs - in different directions, at different times, or at interchanges onto or from a train service – it is has to be a pre-requisite of public transport planning that priority tends to focus on “the greatest benefit for the greatest number” or on needs that can be met cost-effectively. Inevitably therefore other needs may not be met - and rural transport cannot always be all things to all people in an area; many people may feel that it serves their needs badly if at all, even if the predominant needs are catered for.&#xa0;4.4. Rural employment is often characterised by many small &amp; medium enterprises (SMEs) in widely scattered locations. Significant and established flows to work are therefore often difficult to provide for.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?]]]&#xa0;5.1. Community transport (CT) often primarily focusses on the needs of the frail elderly and disabled, and less well on the needs of people who need transport to get to work, or the travel needs of young people. &#xa0;5.2. The sector is very diverse, from some larger community transport groups that act virtually as commercial operators in tendering for large contracts, through to many small groups, often with just one or two vehicles, for whom the Community Interest Company model may be seen to be both less beneficial and less relevant. &#xa0;5.3. The difficulties in serving isolated areas are the same for community transport as for commercial operators and councils: services will always tend to require significant subsidy to meet the shortfall between operating costs and fares revenue from relatively small numbers of passengers travelling. &#xa0;5.4. Community transport best serves its own community: many rural council funded bus routes are unsuitable for CT operation as they serve a number of communities across relatively long distances. Other barriers to CT operation of these services may include:&#xa0;5.5. The view, that community transport will simply back-fill bus services cut by councils, is unlikely to become a reality. Most services for isolated rural areas that are council funded are likely to continue to require revenue support; that is why they are supported and not commercial in the first place. The injection of kickstart funding is unlikely to provide lasting long-term improved viability and is felt to be generally of limited value, in certain circumstances only, such as for services that are relatively close to financial sustainability and just need a push to achieve viability.&#xa0;5.6. There are clearly exceptions where geography etc. may help enable a more viable operation, but on the whole there is little scope for making services serving isolated communities, or even many rural areas generally, sustainable. We need therefore to understand that it is unrealistic to suppose that:&#xa0;(i) if only council supported services were managed or operated in a different way they would not need support;&#xa0;(ii) council funded bus services will be routinely operated by the community transport sector if the council funding ends. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?]]]&#xa0;6.1. Taxis are seen as universally available, but the cost is clearly prohibitive for regular use for many people, and wheelchair accessible taxis are not universally available in rural areas. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (2010) identified that Transport Poverty is a greater factor in rural areas than Fuel Poverty, but we still hear more about the latter. &#xa0;6.2. DRT services are often unsuitable for regular commuting to work. Often schemes only allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs. DRT can be seen to provide better for off-peak accessibility needs to shopping/ town centre facilities and services.&#xa0;6.3. DRT often has higher costs per passenger than conventional bus services. A number of DRT services promoted as a cost-effective way to provide access in rural areas have in recent years been terminated due to high costs. It cannot therefore be assumed that there is a continuum of reducing service levels in line with reducing cost (per passenger), from high frequency buses to low frequency buses to DRT: when replacing low frequency buses with DRT costs per passenger are frequently found to rise. &#xa0;6.4. The cost of off-peak rural services is often lower by using resources more fully, i.e. using buses - on the margin - that are fully used in the peak for commuting etc., as opposed to less efficient use of resources such as these buses being parked up in the off-peak and using other smaller vehicles for off-peak DRT services.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can ]]]

[[[these services be made more affordable?]]]&#xa0;7.1. Many public transport services serving isolated communities can never become sustainable, given the low revenue compared to costs; the aspiration to make these services affordable in terms of financial viability may be largely unobtainable. The degree to which the level of financial support needed can be seen to be acceptable is determined by a number of factors. &#xa0;7.2. ENCTSThe continued high cost of the ENCTS public transport spend acts as a barrier to continuing spend on supporting rural public transport services. Given the pressure on budgets, many councils may understandably feel they are already spending too much on public transport. &#xa0;7.3. Cross-sector Benefits and ChallengesFor most councils their funding of bus services is probably the greatest single positive impact (compared to any other initiative) on each of the following key policy aims:&#xa0;7.4. Whilst this is felt to be often generally unrecognised across councils and central government, If these cross sector benefits could be levered into funding services, these services are likely in many cases to become affordable.  &#xa0;7.5. The cross-sector benefits of bus services are significant. This has been recently evidenced in many national reports from a wide range of bodies (Appendix 1) and yet continues to be largely unrecognised in government policies.  &#xa0;7.6. A significant element of this value of bus services lies in other organisations, e.g.:&#xa0;7.7. However with services under pressure and the need for short term cost reductions, there appears to be little incentive to consider longer term benefits from working across organisations. It also requires these other agencies to decide to spend money other than within their areas of professional expertise, by diverting funding to transport. In the absence of central policies on these lines, councils have a pivotal, but culturally very difficult, role to play in facilitating this if the best long-term decisions are to be made.&#xa0;7.8. It is felt to be not constructive for government to leave these decisions to local government when council finances are being reduced to such an extent that non-statutory services, no matter how worthy or recognised those services may be within a council, provide the main scope for cuts to meet the budget reductions set by central government under the Spending Review. &#xa0;7.9. Competing with other Services for Shrinking BudgetsThe high cost per passenger of services in isolated or rural communities compared to lower cost/ passenger urban and inter-urban services is bound to disadvantage these services when competing for funding in reducing budgets. Cost per passenger is a prime assessment tool, as a means of minimising the number of people affected by service reductions. The fact that rural services in the main are unlikely to ever become financially sustainable can lead to these services being seen as both inefficient and as a funding “bottomless pit”.&#xa0;7.10. Rural public transport is further at risk, given shrinking budgets, through what is often seen as a lack of understanding of passenger needs or assumptions that “they will find other ways to get to work”: decision-makers tend to be car drivers. More research is needed on the reliance of those who need the bus to get to work, and whether they could get to work if the bus service stopped.&#xa0;7.11. Affordability has to reflect Benefit as well as CostOnly by centrally reassessing how public transport should be funded, and aligning the funding stream with policy areas and agencies where transport provides benefits, will the real financial and societal net overall benefits, that transport networks provide, be safeguard into the future. Unless government departments are sufficiently joined-up, on funding transport through the benefits it provides those departments, it is unlikely that the locally based public sector, who take their cue and targets from central government, will generally work together with councils on this. &#xa0;7.12. ATCO believes that there is a current state of national paralysis on this that needs to be urgently addressed. The imbalances need to be resolved between (a) the risk to council public transport funded services, and (b) the growing evidence of the undoubted benefits of public transport to the economy and national policy aims. Without government action on this as a matter of urgency – with the Spending Review taking funding out of the system year by year for a further three years - the country’s rural and isolated areas face the likely prospect of large scale withdrawal of any or all public transport except those that do not requires financial support.  &#xa0;--------------------------------------------------------------------&#xa0;
