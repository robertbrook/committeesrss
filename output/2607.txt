[[[xamples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs? ]]]Collaboration and formal partnerships with global and regional conservation NGOs have shaped Rio Tinto’s global and regional biodiversity strategies and objectives on “net positive impact”. Our learning from NGOs has contributed to the development of tools and methodologies used in this field. In mid-2010 Rio&#xa0;Tinto signed a three year relationship agreement with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This partnership includes the design and implementation of an assessment process that will be used to assess how Rio Tinto is doing is achieving its “net positive impact” goals. Other biodiversity partners include: BirdLife International, Fauna &amp; Flora International and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
