[[[The Future of the BBC]]]

[[[What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The BBC should represent the very best in British broadcasting providing access to a wealth of knowledge, education and entertainment. The BBC achieves this very successfully at the moment and will hopefully continue to do so in the future&#xa0;Coming from the arts and heritage sector, we believe the BBC should help provide access to the arts for the widest possible public. It should help cultural organisations make their collections accessible to people via imaginative programming. The BBC has already shown how it can take some of the finest music performances and theatrical productions into our homes, experiences which for some would be prohibitively expensive. More of this should happen so that people across the country realise there is fabulous talent in all parties of the UK, not just London.&#xa0;With headquarters in London, Salford and Glasgow the BBC is in a strong position to make a difference regionally so that access to arts and culture can be shared across the country.&#xa0;Public service broadcasting should provide for quality programming which would not be made on commercial channels. There should be a mix of popular programming and those which target smaller, niche audiences. The BBC is good at sharing different voices and opinions, not just those of the critics and professionals, and should continue to do so to ensure that viewers continue to feel part of the BBC. &#xa0;Above all standards in news and documentaries must be maintained; with the BBC retaining its role as provider of in-depth, reliable and well-researched content.&#xa0;

[[[How well has the BBC performed…?]]]&#xa0;The move to Salford has resulted in a tangible difference in terms of regional arts coverage. Among national media outlets, the BBC is outperforming many others in its attempt to break down the traditional London-centric bias.&#xa0;There is still much more to be achieved. BBC Salford has started to develop strong relationships with some of the leading cultural organisations in the North - this approach is welcomed and should be built upon. The museums and galleries across the UK house the most amazing treasures from across the world - collections which could be made far more accessible through the medium of television and radio.  &#xa0;

[[[Should the BBC’s output and services be provided t]]]

[[[o any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? ]]]&#xa0;The BBC should be truly national in remit, covering stories from around the country and giving equal weight to issues/stories from the regions as well as the capital. &#xa0;The BBC is in a class all of its own in terms of children’s television and should continue to expand this. There could well be advantages in developing commercial partnerships with public and private sector partners so that the characters and stories brought to life on television can be translated into exhibitions (look at the success of the Harry Potter experience) which tour the country and potentially generate new income streams which can be shared between partners through ticket sales and merchandise. There is a large market for such attractions in Europe, the Far East, the Middle East &amp; China&#xa0;Maybe there are opportunities for further collaboration between the BBC and different publicly funded organisations. The BBC might consider working more closely with the NHS for example to tailor programmes for those who suffer from conditions like dementia.&#xa0;

[[[hat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?]]]The BBC is full of some of the most creative and technical talent which exists in the UK today. It would be madness for the BBC not to channel this into developing new ways of delivering and distributing content. It is the technological development which is incredibly important in terms of widening access as it is the language of the next generation.Maybe in this area and others, the BBC has a role to play in training and mentoring, sharing its knowledge and experience with others in the region.&#xa0;Fiona PhilpottDirector of Exhibitions &amp; Design, National Museums LiverpoolDecember 2013&#xa0;
