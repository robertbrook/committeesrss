&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the Highways Term Maintenance Association (HTMA) (SRN 013)&#xa0;I am responding on behalf of the Highways Term Maintenance Association (HTMA) to your invitation to comment on your call for evidence on the strategic road network.&#xa0;The HTMA is the trade organisation which represents service providers who currently maintain around 80% of the highway network within the United Kingdom.  The Association aims to deliver high quality maintenance and asset management services, whilst seeking to drive positive change within the industry, for the communities within which we work.&#xa0;The Association welcomes the acknowledgement in the government’s command paper, Action for Roads, of the importance of road maintenance to the economic and social growth of the United Kingdom.  It is for that reason that we would stress the importance of striking an appropriate balance between investment in new infrastructure and maintenance of the existing asset.&#xa0;The Association wishes to comment on Issue 4 of your call for evidence,
