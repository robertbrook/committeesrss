[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Professor Steven Barnett[bold], University of Westminster[bold] [FBB0078][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am submitting these comments as an independent academic and commentator on communications policy at the University of Westminster. 
[normal]I have been involved in research and policy analysis on media issues for 
[normal]over 
[normal]30 years, specialising in broadcasting, regul
[normal]ation and journalism. I have acted as 
[normal]specialist advis
[normal]e
[normal]r to the Hous
[normal]e of Lords select committee on 
[normal]Communications for 
[normal]four inquiries over the last six years, 
[normal]twice gave oral evidence to the 
[normal]Leveson
[normal] Inquiry, 
[normal]and have written several books and numerous book 
[normal]chapters and articles on media policy issues. My book on the BBC and its future, published in 1994, is still relevant to today’s debates
[normal].
[normal] My 
[normal]latest book discusses, in particular, the
[normal] BBC’s vital role as a benchmark for quality, trust and impartiality in b
[normal]roadcast 
[normal]journalism.
[normal] This submission follows the order of questions posed by the committee in its call for evidence.
