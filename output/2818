defaultWritten evidence from defaultIAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists)default (WRT 016)default&#xa0;
defaultThe IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists) directly influences the driving and riding of more than 135,000 UK road users every year (full members, associates and commercial clients).  
default&#xa0;
defaultEstablished in 1956, the IAM is best known for the advanced driving test and the advanced driving course.  The IAM has grown to become the UK’s largest road safety charity, dedicated to raising driving standards, engaging with the road-using public and inf
defaultluencing road safety policy.  IAM Drive and Survive also provides a range of occupational driver training courses to the commercial market.  In January 2007, the IAM Policy and Research division was established to undertake consultation responses, campaign
defaulting and research to assist in the understanding of road safety issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur response is laid out below in the paragraph numbers supplied.
default&#xa0;defaultOverviewdefault&#xa0;defaultThe IAM welcomes this independent review and believes
default 
defaultthe vast majority of road users, householders and bus
defaultinesses would like to exercise their sense of personal responsibility when dealing with weather related issues.  The role of government, central and local, should be to allow them to make informed decisions and safely contribute to keeping the country movi
defaultng.

defaultWhat has been your own practice about salt stocks, and your experience of the salt supply chain?  What views do you have about the operation of the Salt Cell?
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IAM believes that a ‘just in time’ approach
default (
defaulti.e.
default only holding a 7 day reserve)
default to something as crucial as salt stocks is not appropriate.  Stock should be held to deal with extreme weather conditions even if this requires the provision of more storage facilities alongside the road network.

default2.5
default              
defaultWhat action would you like to see taken by others – whether in relation to 
defaultsalt supply and use or to other matters?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IAM supports the provision of more local salt bins and salt supply points to allow d
defaultr
defaultivers to clear their own drives and local roads.  Salt should be freely available and supplied in suitable bagged containers
default. 
default 
defaultIt is not acceptable that salt is made available but often must be collected in your own container.  Salt bins at key locations should be replenished on a more frequent basis during periods of heavy use.

default              
defaultHow could the system be improved?
default   
default&#xa0;
defaultWeather forecasting is accurate but remains too 
defaulthigh level
default to be useful in the very localised conditions found in many parts of the UK.  The general public should have free access to short term weather forecast and other ice condition information 
default(such as ice alert temperature detectors) 
defaultbeing used to inform grit
defaultting decision making.  The public pays for this information to be collected by public bodies and the IAM can see no reason why it should not be available in a suitably understandable graphic and standardised form on 
defaultthe internet
default.  
defaultForecasting and road cond
defaultition information must be consistent no matter what the source – police, road operators, or Met office.

default              
defaultHow does severe winter weather impact on critical aspects of people’s daily travel needs, 
defaultand on the mobility of goods and services?  What lessons have been learned in business, public service and other organisations about forecasting and mitigating the transport effects of severe winter weather?  How effective have winter resilience measures b
defaulteen, and what other measures should be taken?
default         
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our view last winter’s snow and ice had little 
defaultprolonged 
defaultor 
defaultmajor economic impact.  
default&#xa0;
defaultBut, e
defaultxtended periods of snow and ice will almost certainly have 
defaulta high cost associated with it in terms of 
defaultdisruption and lost productivity
default.  
defaultThe UK grinds to a halt at the first fall of snow and that is an unacceptable 
defaultoutcome
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultMore research is needed on the individual and societal costs of bad weather delays. 
default 
defaultUntil loss of earnings, damage to vehicles, cras
defaulthes and loss of output can be fully quantified by research we will not have a clear understanding of the costs and benefits involved
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAny analysis should include the cost of 
defaultdaily impact on travel, finding alternatives, if available, and the delays and di
defaultsruption caused by cancellations, traffic jams etc
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCritical functions 
defaultshould be prioritised 
defaultsuch as daily care of the elderly, NHS patients, 
defaultand heat
default and power 
defaultgeneration. Over
default a prolonged period food production and distribution would assume more importa
defaultnce and priority.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOrganisations must include bad weather issue
defaults
default in their disaster recovery and Business Continuity planning.  Best practice guidelines should be prepared by leading trade associations for each sector and the Government should ensure they 
defaultare widely disseminated and adopted including within the public sector.  The cascading of decisions to close offices, allow staff home or to remain at home is critical and should be teste
defaultd 
defaultand updated on a regular basis
default in a similar way to fire or evacuation drills

defaultbeing prepared for, and dealing with, severe winter weather?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IAM believes that keeping traffic flowing is a key economic and safety function of road authorities and budget constraints should not have a part to play in winter maint
defaultenance decisions.  British drivers
default already pay
default 
defaultsufficient tax on their motoring to 
defaultfund a winter maintenance operation geared up to the worst conditions.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent training offerings are focused on 
default‘stopping’ but our experiences from the public is 
defaultthat the main problem is actually 
default‘how do we get going, 
defaulthow to we keep going, 
defaultshould we be
default travelling, what is the best method and how do we prepare ourselves and our vehicles’
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultfailure to deal adequately with such weather?
default        
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main costs of delays due to bad weather accrue to individual
defaults,
default drivers and companies and more research is needed to better quantify them in relation to the expense of an up rated winter maintenance operation
default or proposals to fit different tyres etc.  The IAM can see no case for the 
defaultcompulsory fitment of snow chain as 
defaultour winter maintenance procedures are not based on driving on hard packed snow.  Winter tyres can offer extra traction but the ‘hassle and cost’ of changing tyres on a seasonal basis is too high for most occasional bad weather episodes.  The tyre industry 
defaultshould continue to explore new rubber technology to 
defaultgive its all year tyres more useful winter properties.
default&#xa0;

default.3
default              
defaultDuring the recent winter weather large parts of the country experienced icy footpaths and icy conditions on minor roads for longer periods than 
defaultusual.  What were the consequences of this, in terms of traffic accidents, higher-than-expected injuries due to slips and trips?  Should the public and local communities be able to take a more pro-active role (eg in clearing public and private paths and mi
defaultnor roads) and what issues are raised by this?
default        
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IAM has no information on injuries and the number of incidents.  
default&#xa0;
defaultMany local authorities actually met their published targets for snow clearance but the public as a whole have little understandin
defaultg of winter maintenance priorities and often felt helpless and abandoned.   
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils must be more explicit on how long they will take to
default clear side roads and footpaths and what the priorities are and the ‘order’ of clearance
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultPoor footpath clearance can lead to 
defaultpedestrian injuries, 
defaultisolation and less inclination to attempt journeys which may actually be possible if main roads are accessible.  
default&#xa0;
defaultA
default 
defaultnew approach which encourages m
defaultore personal responsibility for footpath cleaning 
defaultby local residents/shopkeepers/businesses
default,
default combined with a higher priority for local salt bins and a clearer timetable of footpath clearance would be the most effective way forward.  Urban myths regarding the law on personal liability due to snow clearing 
defaultshould be addressed as a matter of priority and local guidelines agreed and communicated to house holders and businesses.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultWhat can we learn from the experience of and approach taken by other nations who have similar weather to the UK, in terms of pla
defaultnning and managing winter resilience?
default                   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK climate is relatively unique.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe latest developments in Ice alert, snow clearing equipment and chemicals should be monitored but the I
defaultA
defaultM is unaware of 
defaultany 
defaultnew thinking in winter maintenan
defaultce policy as a whole that would revolutionise our approach.  
defaultIn our view the most important area for technological advances would be techniques that do not require the passage of traffic to ‘work in’ salt and the ability to clear roads and deal with large 
defaultnumbers of stranded motorists at the same time.
default&#xa0;
defaultRoad user behaviour in Scandinavia does suggest that additional training in dealing with ice and snow can lead to over confidence and a rise in serious collisions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuick, reliable and personalised/localise
defaultd 
defaultinformation
default in an often fast changing weather situation is the key.  Access to more CCTV cameras off the trunk road network would help to give real time information on what is actually happening at key pints on the network.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a member of the 
defaultF
defaultIA, the 
defaultability to surv
defaultey motoring clubs across Europe
default we would be happy to do this as part of the winter resilience review.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.default              defaultCommunications and public expectationsdefault&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultWhat can the public reasonably expect in terms of the winter resilience of roads and 
defaulttransport services, and communication about this in severe weather?
default    
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public must 
defaultbe allowed to 
defaultexercise a high
defaulter
default degree of personal responsibility and 
defaultbe 
defaultencouraged to play a more positive part
default in the safe use of roads in the winter.  Information is the key and it is not yet tailored to the individual needs of drivers.  Blanket warnings about 
default‘
defaultessential
default’
default journeys are of little value 
defaultwithout a full definition of ‘essential’.
default  Highways authorities
default should actively encourage feedback from drivers on local trouble spots and micro climatic conditions.
default  The government should zero rate or exempt from VAT products directly linked to snow and ice clearance such as rock salt.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultAre there ways of enablin
defaultg the public to be better prepared for future severe winters?
default       
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IAM does not believe that compulsory training in snow and ice driving is feasible, deliverable or would actually reduce delays or crashes.
default  Current training is geared to controlling 
defaultskids or stopping safely as opposed to how to start on slippery roads, maintain momentum up hills or how to make informed decisions about which conditions make travel impossible.  
defaultHowever, p
defaultractical tips on how to cope with snow and ice can be useful and the IAM is well positioned 
defaultand willing 
defaultto deliver such advice through the media.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IAM supports the idea of an informal ‘
defaultcontract
default’
default between dr
defaultivers and authorities 
defaultto clarify each role and
default agree who should do what, by when and for who
defaultm
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example
default;
default&#xa0;
defaultDdefaultrivers defaultcould;
default&#xa0;
defaultHighway Authorities defaultwould agree to;
default&#xa0;
defaultDrivers make no distinction between road operators and one operator 
default(
defaulte.g.
default the Highways Agency) 
defaultsuggesting roads are open when local routes are still poor
default is 
defaulta recipe for 
defaultconfusion and un
defaultnecessary trips.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultRoads will remain choked with traffic attempting to make what they see as their own 
default‘
defaultessential
default’
default journey u
defaultntil drivers have access to comprehensive real time travel information, know what their employers policy is on stayi
defaultng away from work and can 
defaulthave ‘trust’
default 
defaultthat the 
defaultauthorities 
defaultare 
defaultdoing their utmost to keep road
defaults and pavements clear.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultRecognising the uncertainties and probabilistic nature of weather forecasting, what further information
default or assessment is available about the likely trends in UK winters – their nature, duration and severity - over the next 10-15 years.  And how might these most effectively be communicated to those who may need to act on them?
default&#xa0;
defaultMost climate commentators predict an increase in extreme 
defaultand unpredictable 
defaultweather events over the coming decades.  
defaultThe IAM would welcome a wider debate on extreme weather provision and 
defaultthe 
defaultpolicy relating to it.
