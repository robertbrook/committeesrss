"&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the\n British Transport Police (SLC 029)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA.\n              \nLevel Crossings represent a substantial safety risk.\n&#xa0;\nB.\n              \nBTP works with other agencies to enforce the law around Level Crossings. In particular \nthere is a close and growing partnership between Network Rail and BTP in this area.\n&#xa0;\nC.\n              \nThe law on Level Crossings is in need of reform and consolidation, and needs to be clearer.\n&#xa0;\nD.\n              \nEach Level Crossing is different and the mitigation of risk requires a m\nulti agency approach.\n&#xa0;\nE.\n              \n              \nBTP is committed to playing its part in promoting safety at crossings.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGeneral\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nLevel Crossings are a nineteenth century solution to a nineteenth century problem.  Ideally they would have no place in a modern high speed \nrailway.  The railway industry (particularly Network Rail) is left with the task of managing, what will always be, an unsatisfactory interface between road vehicles and the railway network.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nBritish Transport Police (BTP) is the national police service \nfor the railway, including the London Underground.  We have the responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law and the investigation of offences committed on the railway networks.  The Force exists in its current form under the provisions of the Ra\nilways and Transport Safety Act 2003.   Previously the Force operated under the British Transport Commission Act 1949.  Railway police officers have been dealing with incidents on Level Crossings since the mid nineteenth century.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nOther agencies, includ\ning Her Majesty’s Inspectors in the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) have a role in investigating incidents at Level Crossings.  BTP seek to work in partnership with these agencies and with Network Rail to e\nnforce the law and to promote safety.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nDespite the best efforts of Network Rail Level Crossings remain a potential source of a significant railway accident.  History has shown that a collision on a Level Crossing can be catastrophic.  Numerous accidents\n have occurred at these locations.  In modern times we seek to draw lessons from events such as Hixon (1968), Lockington (1986),  Ufton Nevet (2004) and Little Conard (2010)  (1). \nHowever \nnumerous smaller incidents occur every \nmonth\n on Level Crossings, som\ne resulting in loss of life and or derailment (2).\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nThere \nare \nmany different types of Level Crossing.  These vary from crossings on ‘A’ roads through to ‘user worked’ easement crossings between fields.   Each type poses its own issues.  There are often \ndifferent names for the same type of crossing.  The total number of Level Crossings is not clear but is given by Network Rail as being around 6,500.(3).  The ORR estimate that the total number (Network Rail plus others) is around 8,000 (4)  At times the id\nentification of individual crossings is difficult and we have been working with Network \nRail to ensure that we have a common understanding of the identity, location and access arrangements for each crossing.  Level Crossings bisect all types of railway lin\ne from the West Coast mainline through to freight only single track lines.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nSafety at Level Crossings is a worldwide problem.  The recent incident in Canada (18\nth\n September 2013) which killed six people is a reminder of the international nature of this \nissue. There were nine accidental fatalities at Level Crossings on the Network Rail system in 2012/13 (5).\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nBritish Transport Police works closely with Network Rail, both to improve safety at crossings and to enforce legislation where possible.  Network\n Rail has, over the last two years, funded fifteen Mobile Safety Vehicles for BTP use.  These state of the art vehicles are deployed to pubic road crossing throughout Great Britain to detect offenders. (6). Their use is accompanied by local publicity desig\nned to raise awareness of the dangers of misusing Level Crossings.  Wherever possible BTP participates in community safety events around the country \nto promote the safety message. \n Offenders detected using the Mobile Safety Vehicles are, subject to certain\n conditions, offered the option of attending a training course on the dangers of Level Crossing misuse as an alternative to a penalty.  This is a relatively new project so the data set is small – however the available evidence suggests that there is a very\n low re-offending rate by drivers who attend one of these courses. \n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nI\nn recent months BTP and Network Rail have been seeking to improve the flow of information regarding patterns of crossing misuse to ensure that BTP assets can be deployed in the most e\nffective way.   Engagement continues to take place with ORR.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n              \nBTP sits on various groups with Network Rail, including its strategy group on this subject.  At a Headquarters level BTP meets with Network Rail at least every six weeks to keep abreast of de\nvelopments.  BTP is worki\nng with Network Rail around \ntheir plan to install fixed detection cameras at high risk locations.\n&#xa0;\n10.\n              \nBTP ran an operation to co-inside with the last International Level Crossing awareness day \nin \nMay in 2013 (5).  This day is co-o\nrdinated by the International Union of Railways (UIC) who estimate that 359 people were killed at Level Crossings throughout the European Union in 2010. (\n7\n).  \n&#xa0;\n11.\n              \nBy far the majority of incidents at Level Crossings can be attributed to user misuse.  Howe\nver each incident much be approached carefully to ensure that the collection of evidence takes place systematically and impartially.  BTP Crime Scene Examiners have particular skills in this process and where road vehicles are involved the expertise of loc\nal force Roads Policing speci\nalists is also used \nto examine the vehicle etc.  In some cases it becomes clear that Network Rail and/or their staff may have caused the incident.  The tragic incident at Moreton-on-Lugg (2010) provides an example of this and r\nesulted in the conviction of Network Rail and one of their employees for serious Health and Safety offences.  The investigation of \nLevel Crossing\n incidents is complicated, time consuming and expensive.  It is essential that each investigation is led entire\nly by the evidence and not based on assumptions of cause.  In the event of fatalities BTP will always investigate in combination with other agencies and on behalf of HM Coroner (in England and Wales). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ1              Are Current Safety Measures at Level Crossings Adequate?  How Should They Be Improved?&#xa0;A1\n              \nOther organisations are much better placed than BTP to comment on the technical aspects of Level Crossing Safety.\n              \nWhat is clear however is that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to the question of improvin\ng Level Crossing safety.  Each crossing presents \nindividual challenges.  Road layout, user profile, time of day and the nature of the railway being crossed all influence how crossing\ns\n are used.  \n&#xa0;\nThe way in which crossings are used can cha\nnge.  An obvious example is the \nuse of User Worked Crossing\ns\n in rural areas during harvest time.  New developments of houses o\nr\n shops can change the pattern of use dramatically.  This is not a new issue (\n8\n) but one that requires constant monitoring.  For t\nhis reason it is pleasing to see that Network Rail have appoint\ned\n local Level Crossing Managers.  We look forward to working with these managers to ensure that policing activity is based on accurate and up to date assessments of misuse.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ2                            In Addition to Bridges and Underpasses What Other Cost Effective Measures Can Be Introduced to Replace Or Improve Safety at Level Crossings?&#xa0;A2\n              \nSee A1 Above.  BTP would support further research should this thought to be necessary.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ3              How Should Expenditure On Improving Safety At Level Crossings Be Prioritised in Relation To Other Demands On The Rail Budget?&#xa0;\nA3\n              \nThis is largely a question for other respondents.    But in general terms the fact that Level Crossings represent such a major risk to the safety of the railw\nay is likely to be a major factor in determining priorities.  \n&#xa0;\nThe policing of Level Crossings represents a sig\nnificant and growing commitment \nfor BTP.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ4                            Is Network Rail Giving Sufficient Priority to Improving Safety At Level Crossings?&#xa0;A4\n              \nIn recent \nyears Network Rail’s commitment to this subject has been unquestionable.  The company has pursued the improvement of safety in this context with passion and dedication.  This comment is made from the point of view of a close partner with visibility only of\n central efforts around a few work streams.   There is nothing to suggest that this energy is not operating throughout the whole Level Crossings project.  Network Rail has appointed the parent of a victim of an accident at a Level Crossing as their Level C\nrossings ‘Champion’.  This was a brave move and a bold statement of commitment.  Nobody who has listened to her lecture on the subject of Level Crossing safety can be left in any doubt that there is still much to be done or that this work is of the greates\nt importance.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ5              Is Government Policy and Regulatory Action By The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in Relation to Safety at Level Crossings Adequate?  What More Should The Government and ORR Do?&#xa0;\nA5\n              \nBTP is not in a position to assist with this question. \n The Force works closely with ORR, particularly in the aftermath of incidents.  In this context the working relationship between ORR and BTP is good and highly valued.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ6              How Should Legislation Governing Level Crossings Be Updated?&#xa0;A6\n              \nBTP awaits the pub\nlication of the Law Commission’s\n report on Level Crossings.  We submit that the Law Commission’s comments in Part One of their consultation paper on this subject (2010) provides a good summary of the current legal position,\n (9)\n viz:\n&#xa0;\n              \n“\nThe legislation gove\nrning level crossings is complex and antiquated, much of it dating back to the nineteenth century when the main railways were constructed. The provisions relevant to level crossings are difficult to access. This arises partly because they are spread across\n legislation relating to a number of different subject areas – railways, highways/roads, health and safety, planning and criminal law. Furthermore, the provisions are contained in a combination of public general Acts, private Acts, bye-laws, and subordinat\ne legislation in the form of Orders and Regulations, many of which have been amended heavily in recent years.\n3 \nSome of the Acts have been partially repealed and some of their provisions have become spent or obsolete, causing confusion as to which \nprovisions still apply and which are redundant. Many of the Acts of the Victorian era contain terminology that is no longer in use such as “turnpike roads” and “statute labour roads”. Such terminology is unhelpful when trying to interpret the law in a mode\nrn context. There has been no attempt at consolidating the legislation in this area.” (P1 Para 1.2)\n&#xa0;\nOne particular legislative anomaly is currently cau\nsing considerable difficulty in \nrespect of enforcement of Road Traffic Act provisions at Level Crossings\n.  Recent work revealed that the Chief Constable of British Transport Police probably does not have powers under s172 Road Traffic Act 1988 to require the registered keeper of a motor vehicle to supply the details of the driver of the vehicle at the time o\nf a suspected offence.  The problem is a technical one that arises from the construction of this section.  The Department for Transport (DfT) are aware of the problem and are working on a solution.  In the meantime the co-operation of geographic police for\nces is being employed via the good offices of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).  What is disheartening is that this lacuna was first identified over thirty years ago and was corrected by the British Railways Act 1986.  However the principal \nlegislation at the time, the Road Traffic Act 1972, was replaced shortly afterwards by the Road Traffic Act 1988 and it appears that the changes brought about by the 1986 Act have been lost.\n&#xa0;\n              \nThe legislation on railway trespass is also unclear.  The princ\nipal piece of legislation creating an offence of criminal trespass on railways is s55 British Transport Commission Act 1949.  This provision largely recreates the offences that previously existed in the Acts of Parliament that governed the individual railw\nay companies.  What is uncertain is whether or not it is possible for the offence to be committed on a level crossing when it is ‘closed’ for the passage of a train.  This issue is acute at crossings without physical barriers.  Pedestrians passing in front\n of trains at crossings are a serious problem.  S55 requires that a  trespass warning notice is displayed at the nearest passenger station – not at Level Crossings.  The relevance of this requirement is hard to see and is itself an anachronism.   The Law C\nommission consultation discusses this offence at useful length (Part 13 2010).  It notes: that  “ A particular feature of the section 55 offence is its obscurity”  (\n10\n)  We therefore agree that this area of law should be subject to review with the intentio\nn of making the offence clear, both generally and specifically in relation to Level Crossings.\n&#xa0;\n              \nThe rai\nlway industry and occasionally \nthe Force are called to deal with gates that have been left open at User Worked Crossings.  The law covering this problem\n is to be found in the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 and in the Railway Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845.  These Acts create a penalty for failing to close a gate.  To enforce this the individual who fails to close the gate has to be iden\ntified.  We would suggest that consideration is given to the creation of a duty on the landowner to ensure that gates are shut. \n&#xa0;\n              \nA case could be made for Level Crossing offences to attract higher penalties than those for equivalent offences on other road\ns (failure to comply with a road traffic signal for example).   \nThis would require a detailed assessment of the potential for a deterrent effect if such a change were not seen to be punitive.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ7                     How Should Public Awareness of Safety at Level Crossings Be Improved?&#xa0;A7\n              \nThis is an area that would benefit from continued specialised research.  There could be possible opportunities to increase the amount time given to Level Crossings in initial \ndriver training and testing, both for new drivers and for specialist driving qualifications (Good Vehicles etc).\n&#xa0;\nThere is a fundamental problem that road vehicle drivers will take risks at Level        Crossings when they would hesitate to do so at other \npoints of traffic control.  The ‘human factors’ aspects of this behaviour may benefit from further research.\n&#xa0;\nNotes\n&#xa0;\n(1)\n              \nHixon Level Crossing Accident 6\nth\n January 1968.
