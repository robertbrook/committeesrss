&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the Airport Operators Association (WRT 036)&#xa0;The Airport Operators Association (AOA) is the national voice of UK airports. We are a trade association representing the interests of UK airports, and the principal such body engaging with the UK Government and regulatory authorities on airport matters. &#xa0;In recent years, UK airports have taken significant steps – and made major investments in specialist snow clearing equipment – to improve winter resilience. For example, Manchester Airport has invested around £6 million, Aberdeen £1.3 million and Heathrow £32.4 million on new snow fleet equipment and staff. An AOA Snow Planning Survey, conducted in winter 2012, shows good practice around UK airports, and is co-signed by AOA and the British Air Transport Association, the trade body of UK airlines, which is enclosed below. &#xa0;We would therefore advise that AOA member airports have a high state of preparedness for the forthcoming winter period. While it is almost inevitable that very severe winter weather will cause disruption to all modes of transport, UK airports have:&#xa0;In addition to the above, you may also wish to note that CAA led a trial during the last winter period concerned with the reporting of runway condition during winter conditions which involved both airports and airlines. Industry is currently awaiting the publication of the results of this trial but we believe that this further demonstrates our desire to continually improve our overall winter resilience.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[SUMMARY OF FINDINGS]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]The UK in recent years has seen increased interest by a number of stakeholders in the issue of how civil aviation copes with the disruption exceptional weather events can cause. Such exceptional events – such as snow – can impact airports, airlines, surface access transport to airports; and ultimately this affects aviation personnel, freight operations and, of course, passengers.&#xa0;In early 2012, the CAA asked the aviation sector to produce a brief report which details the work UK aviation conducts to address exceptional weather events like snow. In response, on behalf of the UK airports sector, the Airport Operators Association (AOA) has liaised with a number of its network of members to produce the following overview of the positive steps taken by airports in readiness for winter operations. In producing the report, AOA has worked with the British Air Transport Association (BATA) and several of its member airlines to ensure the findings reflect efforts made not only by airport operators but also by UK airlines. Other stakeholders – including national and local government and their agencies – also have key roles to play in ensuring airport and airline operations can continue to function during challenging winter weather conditions.&#xa0;Please see in the pages to follow a list of examples of the work airports and airlines undertake to address snow events which can affect their winter operations. When reading this document, it is important to bear in mind that there should be no expectation that these activities are being done by all airports or airlines or indeed are appropriate for all airports and airlines – the list merely highlights the work and initiatives undertaken to deal with adverse winter weather.&#xa0;The document details examples of recent changes and good practice conducted by UK airports and airlines in three sections: operational; management; and passenger communications and welfare. Its purpose is to provide an indicative précis of some of the work UK airports and airlines perform where appropriate t to address the impact of snow on winter operations.&#xa0;We thank the following airports for their assistance: Aberdeen, Belfast City, Birmingham, Blackpool, Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds Bradford, Liverpool, London City, Luton, Manchester, Newcastle, Newquay Cornwall, Norwich, Prestwick, Southampton, and Stansted.&#xa0;
