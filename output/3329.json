"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by  the European Herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association (EHTPA) (AMR0008)The EHTPA is an umbrella body which represents professional associations of herbal/traditional medicine practitioners offering variously western herbal medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, \nAyurveda\n and traditional Tibetan medicine. The EHTPA is dedicated to the development of herbal/traditional medicine, preserving and enhancing the legal basis of practice across EU Members States and promoting best practice throughout the traditions. \nDeclaration of interests\nThe EHTPA is dedicated to the appropriate use of herbal medicine, the development of herbal/traditional medicine, promoting best practice across the various herbal traditions. The EHTPA is a not-for-profit association.\nHerbs to combat the threat of microbial resistance to antibiotics\n&#xa0;Executive Summary\nIn light of growing concerns relating to microbial resistance to antibiotics increasing attention is being given to the role that herbal medicines may play as autonomous anti-bacterial agents or as adjuvant treatments used to potentiate conventional drugs. This paper selectively reviews the evidence for herbal medicine as a valuable resource to combat bacterial resistance to antibiotics and suggests that further research is warranted.  \n&#xa0;Table 1: Herbs to help combat growing antibiotic resistanceStudy DesignPublication DetailsMain FindingsPossible MechanismsStrength of EvidenceAn evidence-based systematic review of \numckaloabo\n (\nPelargonium \nsidoides\n) by the US Natural Standard Research Collaboration.\nUlbricht C\n et al. (2010) \nJournal of Dietary Supplements\n ;7(3):283-302.\nThis comprehensive systematic review concluded that there was strong scientific evidence (Grade A) - including 4 good quality RCTs involving 933 participants - to support the use of pelargonium for acute bronchitis and good scientific evidence (Grade B) for the its use in acute \npharyngitis\n and the common cold. No serious toxic effects have been observed in any trial relating to pelargonium.\nPelargonium has exhibited a marked antibacterial action against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria.\nHighEfficacy and safety of a combination herbal medicinal product containing nasturtium (\nTropaeoli\n \nmajoris\n \nherba\n)  and Horseradish (\nArmoracia\n \nrusticana\n)\nfor the prophylactic treatment of patients with respiratory tract diseases: a \nrandomised\n, prospective, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled phase III trial.\nFintelmann\n V\n et al. (2012). \nCurrent Medical Research Opinion\n; 28(11):1799-807.\n351 participants were randomly allocated to either active treatment (Group 1), a lower dose of active herbs + placebo (Group 2), or just placebo (Group 3). The maximum duration of treatment was 84 days.\nIn the intention to treat (ITT) \npopulation excluding early infections (n = 344) the infection rates were 13.3% for Group 1, 18.4% for Group 2 and 25.6% for placebo Group 3. The statistical trend test showed significant results (p = 0.0171). The herbal combination appears to offer a prophylactic advantage which could help reduce antibiotic prescription.\nThese herbs contain several \nisothiocyanates\n which have a marked in vitro broad spectrum anti-bacterial action.\nModerateA double blind randomised control trial where 107 participants were randomised to receive either \nlicorice\n root (\nGlycyrrhiza\n \nglabra\n ) - trade name \ngutgard\n - or placebo for 60 days\nPuram\n et al. (2013) \nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n; Article ID 263805.\nThe results showed that 56% (n=28) were \nH.pylori\n negative compared to 4% (n=2) in the placebo group.  In other work by the same team, the herb extract reduced symptoms of dyspepsia and there were no adverse events reported.\nGlycyrrhiza\n \nglabra\n showed antimicrobial activity in vitro and anti-adhesive properties against H-pylori.\nModerateA \nrandomised\n, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a herbal medicinal product \nAngocin\n Anti-\nInfekt\n N\n containing nasturtium (\nTropaeoli\n \nmajoris\n \nherba\n) and horseradish\n (\nArmoraciae\n \nrusticana\n)\n for the prophylactic treatment of \npatients with chronically recurrent lower urinary tract infections (RUTIs).\n&#xa0;Albrecht U\n et al. (2007).  \nCurrent Medical Research Opinion\n;23(10):2415-22.\n&#xa0;\n129 patients with RUTIs were randomised to active herbal or placebo treatment for 90 days. The primary outcome was the number of laboratory confirmed urinary tract infections.\n The per protocol mean number of recurrent UTIs in the \nstudy period was 0.43 versus 0.77 for the placebo group. This result is statistically significant (p = 0.035). A total of 36 patients in the test group and 37 patients in the placebo group reported adverse events. Two serious adverse events were reported in the placebo group and one serious adverse event in the treatment group (not associated with the study medication).\nThis herbal product appears to be effective and safe as a prophylaxis for RUTIs.\nMustard oils (including \nisothiocyanates\n) found in these two herbs have been shown to have a broad spectrum antibacterial action.\nPreliminary (This trial needs to be repeated by independent researchers using an intention to treat \nanalysis.)\nA randomised control trial of a complex Chinese herbal medicine (San Ling \nJie\n Du Tang) in the treatment of women with recurrent lower urinary tract infections (RUTIs)\nHuang MJ. (2007). \nHubei J. of Traditional Chinese Medicine\n;29:38-9.\n300 women were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to the Chinese herbal remedy or an antibiotic. Treatment was administered for 7 days with a 6 month follow up. \n79.5% of the herbal group reported no infection in the follow up period compared with 49% in the antibiotic group. This was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).\nSeveral of the included herbs, such as tree peony bark (\nPaeonia\n \nsuffroticosa\n),\n have been shown to have a broad spectrum antibacterial action.\nPreliminary (Due to a lack of detail relating to the trial methodology.)\nA Cochrane systematic review of Chinese herbs for sore throat.\nHuang Y et al. (2012).  \nCochrane Database Systematic Review\n.\n 14;3:CD004877.\n12 studies involving 1954 participants were included in this systematic review. 6/12 studies were shown to be more effective than the control with 3 herbal remedies appearing more effective than antibiotics. The remaining 6 studies showed equivalent effectiveness to the controls.\nSeveral of the included herbs such as Japanese Honeysuckle (\nLonicera\n japonica)\n, have been shown to have a broad spectrum anti-bacterial action.\nPreliminary (Due to the poor methodological quality of the included trials.)\nComparative study \nof \nNigella\n \nsativa\n \nand triple therapy in eradication of \nHelicobacter pylori \nin patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia.  88 adults with dyspeptic symptoms and positive \nH.pylori\n test were randomised to four groups: receiving \ni\n) triple therapy (TT) comprising of \nclarithromycin\n, amoxicillin, \nomeprazole\n [n= 23], ii) 1 g \nNigella\n \nsativa\n + 40 mg \nomeprazole\n (OM) [n= 21], iii) 2 g NS + OM [n= 21] or iv) 3 g NS + OM [n= 23].  Main outcome was eradication of \nH.pylori\n.\nSalem et al. (2010). \nSaudi Journal of Gastroenterology\n. 16(3):207-14.\nH.pylori\n eradication was 82.6% in the antibiotic triple therapy group, 47.6 with 1g of \nNigella\n \nsativa\n,\n 66.7% with 2g and 47.8% with 3g \nNigella\n \nsativa\n.\n Eradication rates with 2 g \nNigell\n \nsativa\n and antibiotics were statistically similar.  \nNigella\n \nsativa\n seeds possess clinically useful anti-\nH.pylori\n activity, comparable to antibiotic triple therapy. Further clinical studies combining \nNigella\n \nsativa\n with antibiotics are suggested by the authors.\nIn vitro study showed that \nNigella\n \nsativa\n inhibited growth in all strains of \nH.pylori\n within 60 minutes of exposure.\nPreliminary&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nGibbs, R.
