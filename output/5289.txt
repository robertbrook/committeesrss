[[[Written evidence]]]

[[[ from the National Federat]]]

[[[ion of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) (CYS0121)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) would like to thank the committee for the invitation to make a written submission on the issue of cycling safety.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.&#xa0;3. The NFRN assists the independent retailer to compete more effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, training, expertise and services. It also represents its members’ interests at governmental and parliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. &#xa0;

[[[General Remarks]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4. Cycling safety is an issue that is very important to the NFRN as a majority of our members’ newspaper deliverers use a bicycle to undertake their work.&#xa0;5. The NFRN has decided to issue a submission to the enquiry on the basis that one of the proposals could impact negatively on the businesses of our members.&#xa0;5. Therefore this submission will focus solely on the following term of reference:&#xa0;-  Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.&#xa0;

[[[Declaration of Interest]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6. While many of the NFRN’s members employ newspaper deliverers who use bicycles to undertake their work, we do not have any further links or connections with the cycling industry.

[[[y centres at peak hours.]]]&#xa0;7. While ensuring the safety of cyclists is of paramount importance, the NFRN urges the committee to consider the impact HGV prohibition during ‘rush hour’ would have on businesses. &#xa0;8. Our members and their suppliers may be seriously disadvantaged if deliveries are not able to be made or take longer as smaller vehicles have to be used.9. Independent newsagents and convenience stores are already struggling in the difficult financial climate and with the competition from large supermarkets. If their suppliers are unable to receive their deliveries on time, or the size of their deliveries is reduced, this will have a knock on effect for small businesses and their product availability. &#xa0;10. While cycling safety is a matter of high importance, it is doubtful as to whether the proposal would improve cycling safety. The Freight Transport Association raises the point that one HGV will have to be replaced with approximately eight vans. As a consequence, this would actually increase congestion on the roads and provide a further risk to both the safety of cyclists and the levels of pollution.&#xa0;11. Consequently, the NFRN does not feel that this is a sensible or practical proposal that should be implemented as it undermines businesses without improving cycling safety.&#xa0;January 2014 &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.fta.co.uk/media_and_campaigns/press_releases/2013/20131121_hgv__ban_is_not_the_solution_claims_fta.html
