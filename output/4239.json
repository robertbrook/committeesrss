"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted by Centriforce Products Ltd&#xa0;Summary &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCentriforce Products Ltd is a UK based recycler and reprocessor of waste plastic materials based in Liverpool, UK.  The company has nearly 35 year experience of working with waste plastics materials  and helped pioneer ma\nn\ny of the current methodologies used to process waste plastic materials as well as having worked closely with DEFRA’s agency\n,\n \n‘\nWRAP\n’\n on application development of ‘second use’ materials over many years.  It is now one of the countries leading independent plastic recyclers serving the UK market with \n‘\nsecond use\n’\n products for a diverse range of applications within the UK as well as exporting these same products overseas.  Centriforce Products sources its feedstock both from the marketplace and also direct from some major household brands including UK \nretailers. \ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDEFRA’s Report on ‘Oxo-degradables’, 2010 concluded that “….the incorporation of additives into petroleum based plastics …..does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects” \nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Environment Agency  ‘Life Cycle Assessment of supermarket carrier bags 2011’ recognised that the ‘single use’ carrier bag  performs well in relation to alternative materials when considered from a full life cycle perspective. \niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA report commissioned by European Plastics Converters (EuPC), 2013 indicated that ‘quantities as low as 2% degradable plastic films cause significant detrimental impact on the quality of plastics recyclates  owing to reduced mechanical properties and significant visual impact on newly produced films\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSortation is not currently possible in the recycled plastic supply chain.  Centriforce Products knows from its own experience that contamination levels of 10% + are common in the output levels of UK MRF’s at the current time \n. \n We are firmly of the belief based on many years of experience of having worked in the UK recycled plastic marketplace that it will not be possible to remove degradable plastics from the \n‘recyclate \n chain\n’\n. Even a small residual percentage of degradable materials in the feedstock would have far reaching and potentially devastating effects on customers for recycled materials.    \nv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecycled plastic products are often designed to have a long application life and in fact their unique selling proposition is often their ability \nto \nbe used to replace traditional materials (\noften timber\n) for applications where the timber would be expected to decay or rot in a short period of time \nvi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLittering and environmental persistence.  Incorporation of degradable plastic bags at retailers would only serve to confuse the consumer.  For many years, the consumer has been encouraged to either prevent materials from being wasted or\n,\n if the\ny\n must be disposed of then they should be recycled. There is evidence to suggest that in recent years the consumer has started to respond to these messages\n. \n \nG\novernment has set stretching targets for the coming 5 year period for plastic packaging recycling rates.  Assuming a degradable bag was exempt from a levy, what should the consumer then do with these bags?  The recycling market does not want degradable materials f\nor\n the reasons stated earlier.   The composters do not want degradable plastic in their feedstock as they contaminate organic\n,\n compostable materials and do not break down sufficient\nly\n quickly. Hence for most consumers, this would mean the material being added to their \n‘\nnon recyclable\n’\n waste bin and therefore would directly oppose The Government’s targets for recycling of plastic packaging.   \n9 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
