"&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Disabled People Against Cuts (JRR 0004)Who we are:DPAC is a grass roots campaign body. It was formed by a group of disabled people after the first mass protest against the austerity cuts and their impact on disabled people held on the 3rd October in Birmingham 2010, England. It was led by disabled people under the name of The Disabled Peoples’ Protest. DPAC has over 15,000 members and supporters and works with many of our own local groups, other anti-cuts groups, Universities, Disabled Peoples’ Organizations, and Unions. We are involved with the Justice Alliance campaign to save legal aid. Prepared and submitted by Disabled People against Cuts (DPAC) November 2013Introduction\nDPAC believes that access to legal aid is vital for disabled people to be able to have access to justice and to challenge through \nour judicial system violations of disabled people’s human rights. We feel strongly that the judiciary play a vital role in liberal-democratic states to provide a way in which the power of the state is lawful and regulated.\nThe judicial review process is a \nvital tool in allowing disabled people to challenge – often through public interest cases rather \nthen\n just in relation to individual circumstances - situations where the decisions, acts or omissions of public bodies may not be lawful. These types of cases \nin particular are invaluable in ensuring disabled people’s human rights are upheld.\nDPAC made a joint submission to the consultation on Judicial Review with Inclusion London and agree with the view that several of the proposals set out will erode basic hum\nan rights of disabled people to access justice, particularly the proposals to change the rules on ‘standing’, the proposal to use methods other than judicial review for resolving Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) disputes and several of the proposals unde\nr ‘\nRebalancing Financial Incentives’\n. \nBeing able to enforce the upholding PSED is vitally linked to disabled people’s rights guaranteed under UNCRPD in particular articles \nart.4.1 a, b, c, d, e, 4.2,and 3: art 5.2. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe tests which apply to being able to seek a Judicial reviews are already stringent and the process of  gaining access to legal aid to get legal representation is also stringent. DPAC believes that to make access to \njustice any more difficult would seriously erode disabled people’s human rights.\n&#xa0;\nThe government have said that the Judicial Review process is unmeritorious and being used by activists to attack government policies. We would argue that government policy mu\nst meet PSED outlined in the Equalities Act, rights established in UNCRPD, \nEcHR\n and HR Act and be open to challenge legally if policy and legislation fail to meet these criteria. \nUnfortunately\n public bodies as well as the government do make unjust decision\ns that do not take into account reasonable adjustments for disabled people and judicial reviews are one of the few avenues disabled people have to correct these unjust decisions.\n&#xa0;\nBelow are examples of successful or on-going challenges in key areas for dis\nabled people:\nCouncil care services: A successful challenge was made to the decision by Birmingham City Council to cut care service so that only individuals with ‘critical’ needs received social care.\n&#xa0;\nWCA: A judicial review case was recently won against t\nhe Department of Work and Pensions on the inadequacy and discriminatory nature of the Work Capability Assessments for those with mental health conditions.\n&#xa0;\nSize Criteria In Local Housing Allowance and Bedroom Tax: The Court of Appeal decided that the local\n housing allowance size criteria discriminated unlawfully. The government then changed the criteria so that some disabled children now do not have to share a room and withdrew its Supreme Court appeal.   \n&#xa0;\nTen more cases are challenging the \nbedroom tax through judicial reviews, five on behalf of disabled children and five by disabled adults. \n&#xa0;\nAs the examples above show, judicial reviews are extremely important because they allow disabled people \nto challenge public bodies, and help ensure that public bodies fulfil their duties and act within the law, as Michael Fordham QC stated:\n&#xa0;\n‘It (judicial reviews) constitutes a safeguard which is essential to the rule of law: promoting the public interest; p\nolicing the parameters and duties imposed by Parliament; guiding public authorities and securing that they act lawfully; ensuring that they are accountable to law and not above it; and protecting the rights and interests of those affected by the exercise o\nf public authority power’.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe are also extremely concerned about plans to limit third party interventions as these are most often made by EHRC who intervene in cases where the government or other public body have failed to meet their PSED or other duties\n. EHRC’s interventions are designed to guide both the court and the others involved in JR pro\ncesses in how best these \nduties\n should be met\n. \nOther third sector interventions are often made by well –respected organisations working in a particular area of con\ncern to support not only individual cases but whole groups of people being disadvantaged by any changes being put forward. \nWe can see no justification in changing the rules about this and again feel that to do so would result in grave violations of disable\nd people’s human rights.\n&#xa0;\nThe recent court case around the closure of the Independent Living Fund where the way in which the minister for disabled people, Esther McVey, was condemned by the Court of Appeal for failing to meet her PSED and where the decisio\nn to close the fund was quashed is one example of how important an intervention by EHRC can be in the judicial process.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDPAC is opposed to the proposal to only pay lawyers for work on judicial reviews if a case is granted permission to proceed to a full hearing, for the following reasons: \n&#xa0;Judicial revi\news are a crucial mechanism that enable disabled people to challenge the policies, decisions and actions of public bodies, for example a public body may be challenged because of the failure to consider the impact of a law or a decision on disabled people a\nnd their human rights or because they have failed to consult properly regarding changes to a service.\n&#xa0;\nLawyers prepare cases in discussion with claimants so it can go to court. Once at court a judge will decide whether the case has sufficient merit to proc\need further, giving \n‘permission’ for the case\n to proceed to a final hearing. The judge makes this decision based on the papers or oral evidence prepared by lawyers. However, when lawyers threaten to bring legal action or begin proceeding, public bodies oft\nen settle before a judge has made a decision on whether to grant a case permission to continue to a full hearing.  \n&#xa0;\nR\nesearch by the Public Law Project (PLP), suggests that thousands of cases are settled with a positive outcome for the claimant but before \na full hearing: \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nafter the claim was issued but before the permission application was determined \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nafter permission was refused on the papers but before the oral renewal was heard \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nafter permission was granted but before the substantive hearing. \n&#xa0;\nIf this \nproposal goes ahead lawyers have said:\n&#xa0;\nThese changes will be disastrous for disabled people who need legal aid to challenge public bodies.  \n&#xa0;\nThe government says that there are two overarching reasons for their proposals: the need to cut costs; and to restore what it describes as ‘public confidence’ in legal aid.  \n&#xa0;\nThese proposals will not cut costs because if legal aid is restricted disabled p\neople will \nhave no other option but to \nrepresent themselves in court. This will be more time consuming, the backlog of cases will increase and ultimately this will be more costly.\n \n&#xa0;\nGiven the high number of legal challenges made by disabled people in attem\npts to protect their human rights there does not seem to be any evidence that disabled people have lost confidence in the use of legal aid for the type of challenges that disabled people have brought against public bodies e.g. legal challenges to the bedro\nom tax.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDPAC believe that this proposal in particular would have a disastrous impact on disabled people’s human rights and their access to justice. It is of immense importan\nce that public bodies can be forced to meet their PSED legally. We believe replacing the court mechanism for this by a non-judicial mechanism would water down the legislation to the point where it would be useless as a means of upholding disabled people’s \nhuman rights. Again the recent court case regarding the Independent Living Fund ruling \nillustrates the importance of this legal process. We already have EHRC who are supposed to regulate human rights but who in actual fact have little statutory power to do\n so. We know from experience that when EHRC express concern to the government about their actions that without legal backup from the courts this is ignored and no action to redress any problems is taken by government.\n&#xa0;\nTo leave the right to challenge publi\nc bodies who fail to meet their PSED to EHRC or any similar kind of non-judicial mechanism would we believe be disastrous for disabled people.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n"
