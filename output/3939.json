"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Dr Es Miller (GMC0008)&#xa0;\nI am concerned about GMC procedures for appraisal-revalidation-Fitness-To-Practice (FTP).  \n&#xa0;\nI am aware of a number of colleagues who have been subject to GMC-MPTS FTP sanctions resulting from “sham” peer review. “Sham” peer review is “an abuse of medical peer review to attack a doctor for personal, or, other non-medical reasons”.  It often includes fabrication of evidence against a doctor because of professional envy or private practice (see 1.2). \nRevalidation contains mandatory elements, including annual appraisal and 360 degree feedback, that may be particularly susceptible to “sham” peer review.  They depend more upon the \"goodwill\" of a doctor's colleagues than on the doctor's medical ability and performance. \n \n&#xa0;\nI am aware of reliable reports of one Clinical Director who has maliciously-damaged, or, destroyed the careers of up to 8 consultant colleagues (locum and substantive consultants in two units) using “sham” peer review. That Clinical Director continues in clinical practice in a flagship, NHS Trust.  The GMC has received notification though has taken no action. \n&#xa0;\nThe devastating impact of Fitness to Practice procedures on individual doctors is evidenced by the present internal inquiry by the GMC into those doctors who have committed suicide whilst being investigated by the GMC. Between 9 and 15 doctors have died each year since 2004 while under investigation. If such doctors have been subject to “sham” peer review then this adds weight to this continuing tragedy.\n&#xa0;\nI have submitted this letter through your on-line system, and, sent it to other members of your committee. I have also sent a copy to Mr Niall Dickson, Chief Executive, GMC so that he has notice of these concerns. \n&#xa0;\nBackground&#xa0;1.1               “Sham” peer review is the name given to the abuse of a \nmedical peer review\n process to attack a \ndoctor\n for personal or other non-medical\n \nreasons. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nAmerican Medical Association\n conducted an investigation of medical peer review in 2007 and concluded that while it is easy to allege misconduct and 15% of surveyed physicians indicated that they were aware of peer review misuse or abuse, cases of malicious peer review able to be proven through the legal system are rare.\n&#xa0;\n1.2              An actual NHS example:\n Two managers (one is a Medical or Clinical Director) hold a meeting with a doctor. Both managers and doctor minute the meeting. The managers change the date of the meeting, and, the content of the minutes to provide fabricated evidence that the doctor has behaved incorrectly.  The managers refer the doctor to MPTS for FTP proceedings. Because the “test of insight” is applied at first instance in MPTS FTP proceedings the doctor cannot contest the fabricated evidence of the two managers for fear of being found to “lack insight” and therefore receive a more serious sanction (para 34 “MPTS Interim Sanctions \nguidance 2009-13”). The doctor therefore receives an unmerited and unjust sanction based on “fabricated” evidence. \n&#xa0;\n1.3              Questions&#xa0;Q1              \nWhat steps are the GMC taking to minimize the impact of “sham peer review” in their appraisal-revalidation-FTP processes ? \n&#xa0;\nQ2              \nHave the GMC-MPTS detected cases of “sham peer review” in their FTP proceedings ? If so, how many ? If they acknowledge the existence of this problem then what studies or reviews, (cf American Medical Association, 2007) have the GMC undertaken to deal with this problem ?\n&#xa0;\nQ3              How does the  GMC expect to detect malicious behaviour, including “sham” peer review in their revalidation procedures – particularly at annual appraisal or during 360 degree feedback ?  \n&#xa0;\nNovember\n \n2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
