EIS 21

[[[Written evidence submitted by David Highley]]]

[[[Executive Summary:]]]Adequate supplies of minerals are essential for economic development. For its small size Britain is relatively well endowed with mineral resources and their extraction and use have played an important part in the historic development of the UK economy. The UK continues to have an economically significant minerals industry, with oil and gas, and construction and industrial minerals being important sectors. Although much diminished, coal still makes an important contribution to our energy mix. The contribution that these minerals make to the national economy may be considered in two ways. First there is the primary contribution they make in terms of added value and employment associated with their extraction and processing; and then there is the secondary contribution they make to the competitiveness of the downstream industries they support. Nevertheless, the UK also has substantial and increasing foreign dependence for mineral supplies. This not only places increasing demands on the environments of our trading partners but potentially makes us more vulnerable to supply disruptions as global demand for minerals growths driven by expanding populations and rising incomes. There will be a continuing demand for the products of the UK’s extractive industries for the foreseeable future. This submission principally responds to the following question in the BIS Committee’s

In addition, the value, in constant prices, of the principal mineral sectors from 1970 to 2011 is shown in Figure 1, and clearly portrays their relative fortunes.

The value of coal production has declined in line with steadily falling output since the mid-1980s.  The rapidly rising value of oil production up to 1984 was reversed by the slump in world oil prices at the end of 1985, and again in 1988, and also the loss of production through the Piper Alpha tragedy. Following rising oil prices since 2000, however, the value of UK oil productions has risen and was still £25.5 billion in 2011. Despite falling oil and gas production since 2000, the value of both have held up well because of high prices.  Ultimately, however, as reserves are depleted their value will decline.11.    The value of construction and industrial minerals has also fallen, reflecting the decline in the production of some industrial minerals such as kaolin, but mainly because of the recently significantly depressed state of the UK construction industry and its impact on aggregates production in particular. Although too small to show on Figure 1, the decline in the value of metalliferous minerals production is principally because of the demise of tin mining in Cornwall in the 1990s. 12.              The value to the UK economy of minerals produced from indigenous sources is, however, derived not only from the minerals themselves but also the downstream industries and employment these support. Low cost construction and industrial minerals, in particular, serve as essential raw materials for the construction, cement, asphalt, concrete products, inorganic chemicals, glass, ceramics, lime, plaster products, and castings industries were the value added may be several fold.   The economic benefits derived from the domestic extractive industries goes much further than the values indicated suggest.

Although the statistics are now somewhat dated, the principles that are presented in the report have not changed significantly, with the exception that the UK has become even more dependent on imports of minerals and mineral–based products. This report, together with a wealth of other information on the UK minerals industry, can be found on the British Geological Survey’s dedicated minerals website – www.mineralsUK.com .  In particular I would refer you to the series of Mineral Planning Factsheets, which provide succinct overviews of each of the economically important minerals extracted onshore in Britain, and also to the United Kingdom Minerals Yearbook referred to above. 14.              

[[[Conclusions]]]

[[[. ]]]Adequate supplies of minerals are essential for economic development. Whilst there has been a decoupling of economic growth with minerals consumption in recent years this may indicate that the economy is under investing in infrastructure and housing and also foregoing the value  added  by working and processing domestic (and imported) minerals in favour of importing higher value manufactured products containing embedded minerals. Moves to try and rebalance the economy and increased investment in housing and infrastructure as economic growth improves and the population expands could reverse the declining trend in minerals consumption. Britain’s resource security and its longer term access to mineral supplies, both from domestic and overseas sources, will remain a key issue for the national economy for many years to come. There will be a continuing demand for the products of the UK’s extractive industries for the foreseeable future and we should make the best use of our domestic mineral resources (and waste streams), where economically and environmentally feasible to do so.&#xa0; The Mineral Products Association estimates that the annual turnover of their industry is about £9 billion and supports over £400 billion turnover in the industries they supply.
