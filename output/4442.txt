[[[Written evidence from the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (CMI0014)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The  Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL) is a not-for-profit organisation with more than 20 years’ history of working to help injured people gain the access to justice they need and deserve.  We have more than 4,000 members who are committed to supporting the association’s aims, and all are signed up to APIL’s code of conduct and consumer charter.  Membership comprises mostly solicitors, along with barristers, legal executives, paralegals and some academics.

[[[Medical evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; road traffic claims where the only injuries are soft tissue ‘whiplash’ injuries to the back, shoulders and neck;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; road traffic claims involving all soft tissue injuries, whether caused by whiplash or otherwise (for example knee strain);c)              road traffic claims where there are mixed injuries including whiplash injuiries, such as whiplash plus a broken leg;d)              all road traffic claims up to a specified value which are covered by the current protocol, whether or not whiplash is included (such as psychological damage).                              &#xa0;&#xa0;6.  The Government favours a standard medical report form for use in all claims, butthis will inevitably mean that reporting doctors would have to confine their  remarks to a standard template or a drop-box option which will limit the amount of     information provided.&#xa0;7.                Lack of detail will not advance the Government’s objective of addressing fraud. The reporting expert must be free to describe in his own words the claimant’s account of his injuries, how they affected him and for how long. There must also be an opportunity for the expert to provide his impressions of the claimant and the account he has provided.&#xa0;8.  The Government also favours a system in which the medical report is sent simultaneously to the claimant and defendant. This is completely inappropriate as medical reports contain confidential medical information, requiring the individual’s informed consent before being passed to a third party.&#xa0;

[[[Pre-medical offers]]]&#xa0;9.   APIL has argued from the outset that offers of compensation made to claimants without a medical report should be banned, and we were therefore enormously encouraged by the comments of the Transport Select Committee and the Government in relation to this. The APIL research referred to in paragraph 5 found that half of respondents questioned believed that this practice is in itself fraudulent. We were  encouraged, therefore, to hear from the Association of British Insurers recently that “the industry is willing to consider stopping pre-med offers…” &#xa0;10.              It is unfortunate that this sentiment was conditional on other developments, but still represents welcome progress, particularly when some in the industry have expressed their disquiet publicly about the practice.&#xa0;11. It is is clear that this practice should be banned by means of legislation. There are, however, rule changes which can  be introduced more quickly which will help to change behaviour in relation to this practice and we are, at the time of writing,  in dialogue with the Government on necessary changes.&#xa0;12. A medical report should not be required at the very beginning of the claim process as a requirement to produce a medical report at the outset would generate unnecessary costs and delays in claims which do not proceed.    &#xa0;13. Once an improved system of medical reporting has been developed, it must be used.  While the practice of pre-medical offers persists in whiplash cases, fraud can continue undetected. To stop fraud, pre-medical offers must be banned, and the quality of medical reporting must be higher – the two will work in tandem.&#xa0;14. Third party capture is another route by which fraud can take place undetected. Insurers should also commit to obtaining medical evidence if dealing with people direct. Injured people must be protected from the abuses which do take place when insurers deal with them direct, including the exertion of undue influence and inequality of information and bargaining power.      &#xa0;

[[[Fraud d]]]

[[[ata ]]]&#xa0;15. Claimant lawyers can be gatekeepers against people who try to make fraudulent claims if relevant information held by the insurance industry is made available to them. Claimant solicitors could be of real value in the fight against fraud if they  have access to the number and type of accidents in which a potential client has been involved, and information about personal injury claims arising from them. This information is currently held by insurers and there is no logical disadvantage to it being made available to claimant solicitors. The date any previous injury was sustained would also be very helpful as, if the case is genuine, this information could assist medical professionals to provide the best treatment for patients. We are greatly encouraged to learn that discussions about this are ongoing in the insurance industry and that information may become available in due course. Ideally, this data would need to be available at the time of implementation of the new medical reporting system.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Small Claims Court Limit]]]&#xa0;16. The announcement that there would be no change to the small claims court limit at this time was very much welcomed by APIL. The small claims court was not designed for people who represent themselves in personal injury cases; raising the limit would have had no impact on fraud whatsoever, and this was, after all, a key purpose of the Government’s consultation; it would have had an enormous and negative impact on the courts, which would have been overwhelmed by litigants in person who would have struggled to understand the court system; and it would have led to another explosion of spam calls and texts from claims management companies who would have exploited the situation of people who would no longer be able to afford legal representation. An increase in the limit would, therefore, have been wholly counterproductive.&#xa0;17. It is to be hoped that proposals can now be developed which will assist all concerned in ensuring fair compensation for those injured people, while working to eradicate fraudulent and exaggerated claims.&#xa0;December 2013   &#xa0;&#xa0;
