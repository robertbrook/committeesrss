[[[Written submission from CRH Electrical Solutions ]]]&#xa0;I have been watching the video of the meeting of the 2nd September and I can only add how completely ridiculous the current situation is.Under Gas Safe there is a single scheme with assessments every 4 or 5 years.Under “electrical” safety there are several schemes and all of which require annual assessments, plus the annual charges are far too high.All we want is a single body, no profit making, presenting a single voice to the homeowners and sparkys.Please, please, please curb the stupidity of the current situation.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
