[[[Evidence to your Committee by Lord McNally Tuesday 5]]]

[[[th]]]

[[[ November]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I have been listening to the archive recording of the meeting of your committee on Friday 5th November 2013 and wish to put before you facts about Sark that were not brought out by Lord McNally.&#xa0;Lord McNally suggests that the lack of cooperation between Chief Pleas and the Barclays is a fault on both sides.  I certainly do not see it that way and to back up my assertion I enclose just two instances where perfectly reasonable requests from a committee of Chief Pleas to Mr Delaney of Sark Developments Ltd and the replies they received.  In one case ignoring the request made and the second the reply was just a rant against Chief Pleas and its members, unfounded accusations, and with no attempt to answer the request made.  These are typical and inhibit Chief Pleas from trying to get a dialog going.  It takes two to Tango.&#xa0;There is truth in Lord McNally’s assertion that Sark currently lacks leadership, however this is in no small measure due to the continuous vitriolic attacks in the Sark Newsletter.  Our Principle leader and Chair of our lead committee, Mr. Charles Maitland resigned as he and his wife found the constant abuse more than they should be asked to bear and to date Chief Pleas have failed to find a replacement.  Another and perhaps more sinister development is the resignation of our recently appointed Vingtenier (Second in command Constable) who worked for Kevin Delaney of Sark Estate Management.  The word on the street, which I believe to be true but cannot verify, is that Mr Delaney ordered him to disregard his oath of office and keep him informed of all information that came his way or face being given the sack; he is no longer employed by SEM.  Another facet is that SEM discourage their staff from using the Island Hall and all their mail, other than for posting the Sark Newsletter,is taken to Guernsey to post rather than give work to the Island Post Office and this year SEM have withdrawn all their advertising of their hotels and other business in the Sark Tourism Brochure and  have set up their own Tourist Office.  All the above makes the administration of Sark difficult which I presume is their raison d’être and I find the assertion that it is due as much from Chief Pleas as from SEM difficult to understand.  &#xa0;I have yet to witness any positive action made for the benefit of Sark, The nearest they ever came was in donating £200,000 towards the new Hall and School complex but in 2008 they took the trustees to court demanding their money be returned on the spurious grounds that they hadn’t realized the hall would have a bar.  Fortunately they lost or there would have been a few bankruptcies in Sark that year.  Even their so called ‘inward investment’ in hotels is of little or no help as they have upgraded them beyond the means of the type of visitor who take holidays in Sark and as a result once thriving, family run, hotels are ghosts of their former selves.  The vineyards may one day produce a little income for the Island but the cost is environmentally high for wild life, for visual enjoyment and for the considerable reduction of grazing for our farmers, shepherds and carriage owners. &#xa0;It is my view that the Barclays, after having failed to have Brecqhou acknowledged as totally independent of Sark have set their sights on Sark itself, and after having been rejected in the polls are trying to ruin the governance and economy of the island.&#xa0;J M Beaumont   Seigneurcc.  Rt Hon Lord McNally&#xa0;14 November 2013

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;ANNEX&#xa0;THE DOUZAINEPUBLIC WORKS SUB-COMMIITTEEWrote on 27 January 2011 :Dear Mr DelaneyThe Public Works sub-group has been giving much serious thought to the possibility of more re-cycling of waste generated in Sark. The plans for this year were intended to commence as soon as possible after the agreement of the 2011 budget, but due to circumstances beyond our control the ordering of new equipment was delayed.Plans were in hand for the re-cycling of cardboard but we now understand that cardboard generated by the SEM businesses is, in future, to be composted. We also understand that you plan to re-cycle used cooking oil on the Island.As the sub-group's decisions about recycling will depend on the volumes of the various materials we would be grateful if you could confirm that you will not be looking to Public Works to dispose of cardboard and cooking oil and advise us of any other plans you have for re-cycling other types of waste generated by your businesses. Any significant changes to the volumes of the various types of waste we handle may mean that we have to adjust our plans accordingly.Your full co-operation in this matter would be appreciated.Yours sincerelyConseiller Paul WilliamsChairman, on behalf of the Public Works Sub-Committee of the Douzaine&#xa0;&#xa0;The reply from the Sark Estate Management Read as follows:-&#xa0;Dear Conseiller Williams,Thank you for your letter of 276' January 2011.As regards to the issues you raise in your letter I expect to continue to receive the same level of services from Public Works that all Households and Businesses on the island enjoy.  Yours Sincerely   Kevin Delaney&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Chairmen David Mclling &amp; Paul WilliamsPublic Health &amp; Agriculture C'onztnittees Committee OfficesLa Chasse Marette SarkGY10 1SF&#xa0;&#xa0;Dear Mr Melling and Mr WilliamRe: Vineyards in Sark&#xa0;Your letter of 27th September 2013 does nothing to disguise your continued campaign of harassment of me and the businesses under me management. The fact that you use your positions as members of Sark's one-party ruling regime, in which you are collectively members of not less than l5 committees including the Douzaine, a secretive organisation that meets behind closed doors and is sworn to secrecy, to continually intimidate me as I go about my perfectly lawful business leaves you both devoid of any credibility your "dealing" with this matter. Your collective presence across so many state departments, the membership of which give you the power to both legislate and administer the law contrary to internationally accepted democratic standards, is a situation that you have consistently been willing to abuse over the past five years and as such, and in the absence of any evidence of you haying experience or qualification on the matter in hand, deservedly elicits nothing but contempt from every independent fair-minded man and woman both on and off of Sark.&#xa0;You claim to have obtained reassurance from the copper testing that you have carried out round the Island, as a result of which you found, as stated to Michaelmas Chief Pleas, that "the lowest reading we have found so far is one from a field that borders a vineyard” I note however that you offer no evidence in respect of your qualifications to undertake such tests and make no effort to report the test results openly and publicly.&#xa0;Your witch-hunt of Sark 'Vineyards Ltd amounts to nothing ,short of state-sponsored harassment and intimidation of me and the companies  represent by unqualified and inexperienced state officials. This is evidenced by both of you being part of a malicious campaign that culminates! in a mob protest against the company's perfectly lawful agricultural activity of planting vineyards on our own land. This project, based on lies, misinformation and propaganda, was attended by over half the members of dark's one&#xad; party parliament and accompanied by a petition signed by members of parliamentFdric Baker. Antony Dunks, Robert Cottle, Hazel Fry, Andrew Prevel, Andrew Cook. Karen Adams, Andrew Bache. Janet Guy. Rosanne Guille Byrne, David Cocksedge. Helen Plummer. Anthony Ventress and Elizabeth Dewe along with both of you, Messrs Paul Williams and David Melling.&#xa0;Your carefully state-managed "trial" and subsequent condemnation of the vineyards at the Michaelmas Meeting of Chief Pleas is a point in case.  Your little show, contrived as cooperation with Edric Baker proved once and for all that Sark’s one ruling party regime’s policy with regards to the vineyards is set, not in accordance with facts data and and information as it would have to be in democracies across the rest of the Western world, but rather in accordance with fictitious and malicious propaganda eagerly spread  to one party state officials who are unable to to produce any evidence of having either the qualifications or experience to qualify their position.I suggest that instead of continuing your state sponsored persecution of Sark Vineyards Ltd., you turn your attention to obtaining professional advice on the real environmental problems that people both on and off this Island are genuinely worried about, namely the indiscriminate burning of rubbish down at the harbour which produces billowing clouds of toxic smoke, the dumping of the resulting toxic ash straight into the sea, the dumping of near-raw sewage over the cliff at Les Laches, the dumping of glass waste into the sea and, importantly, the complete absence of coherent safety precautions in handling asbestos’Having obtained such professional advice, I suggest that you then act on it immediately&#xa0;Yours sincerely&#xa0;Kevin Delaney&#xa0;
