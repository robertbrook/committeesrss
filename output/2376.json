"&#xa0;\nP Negal – Written evidence&#xa0;\nMy wife and I are regular visitors to the Yorkshire Dales  National Park and have  witnessed both  the damage that motorbikes and four-wheel drive vehicles are doing to the  Green Lanes and the  noisy  disturbance that they  create in an area that is supposed to be protected for quiet enjoyment. It is quite wrong for walkers to have  to move to one side  while  these vehicles roar past, churning up  the  surface as they  go.\n&#xa0;\nWe support the submissions by-\nThe Green Lanes Environmental Action  Group (GLEAM),\nThe Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG),\nThe  Peak  District Green Lanes Alliance  (PDGLA) and\nThe Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance  (YDGLA)\n&#xa0;\nwho have  proposed that -\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nAll unsealed Byways Open  to All Traffic  (BOATS), and  all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs)  should be recognised as not  being part of the  ordinary roads network and  should be re­ classified as Restricted Byways.\n&#xa0;\n2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order  that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right  of appeal, either to an  independent inspector or a magistrate.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n2\n of \n1\n&#xa0;\n"
