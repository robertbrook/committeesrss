[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Dr John Disney (TIC 083)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Demand is currently very poorly defined despite the wealth of data now available through electronic ticket machines on buses and rail ticket sales (although some rural bus services still use manual / handwritten 
[normal]/ no tickets 
[normal]eg
[normal] Staffordshire and ma
[normal]ny do not adequately record journeys made by Concessionary Pass Holders of passengers with multi-journey tickets).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many LA’s make arbitrary decisions regarding tendered bus services based upon crude weekly / monthly / annual average numbers of passengers 
[normal]per journey and subsidy per passenger journey.  This takes no account of the patronage of specific journeys; effectively the inclusion of positioning journeys can distort the statistics and suggest that services are not being underused. Furthermore loading
[normal]s on rural bus services are seasonal; not only do many rural bus services attract tourists in the summer (and often in the weekends during the winter) but local residents make more journeys at these times as there are more employment opportunities and elde
[normal]rly people do not like travelling anywhere in poor weather.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These crude averages are also used to determine the required vehicle size, irrespective of variation in loadings between journeys, resulting in suppressed demand as passengers fear being left beh
[normal]ind by a full bus (especially as many smaller buses cannot carry standees).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Calculations of the subsidy per passenger journey often do not take account of reimbursement from concessionary fares or multi-journey tickets
[normal]; when included these are often very 
[normal]low.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rural rail services tend to remain basically unaltered even when the TOC changes as they are basically specified in the franchise agreement although some TOC’s operate additional services for operational efficiency or to cater for additional 
[normal](seasonal) demand, especially if the franchise terms allow them to benefit from the additional revenue generated. It is very rare for trains to be so full that passengers cannot board although sometimes overcrowding on lines like the Settle – Carlisle  can
[normal] exceed peak London commuter journeys.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Many LA’s make changes to rural bus services without any notification to or consultation with passengers affected; indeed revised timetables are often not available until 2 weeks or less before the change
[normal] and roadside publicity is often not changed or new timetables are displayed alongside expired ones with no dates shown; I have seen 3 different versions of timetables displayed for some services. This is despite the requirement for changes to be notified 
[normal]to Traffic Commissioners with 56 days notice. Even websites are often vague about changes despite the LA concerned being the 
[normal]funder
[normal] of the service. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Few rural bus services are commercially provided but those that are tend to be better at publicity includi
[normal]ng forthcoming changes but these changes are usually implemented for commercial reasons with no user consultation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As LA budgets are squeezed, many long tern (3 and 5 year) contracts with operators are being terminated at short notice leading to operators
[normal] being reluctant to invest in vehicles or marketing for such services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overall the needs of persons with limited mobility have been much better addressed in recent years due to DDA Regulations but this has increased operating cost by up to 25% as low floo
[normal]r buses are costly to maintain when used on poorer surfaced rural roads with adverse cambers and steep inclines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many services are designed around the shopping, health and welfare needs of older persons but give them little opportunity to socialise or par
[normal]take in activities and events in adjacent towns and villages as most services terminate around 1700 and do not operate on Sundays.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young 
[normal]persons
[normal] needs are rarely met with few evening or Sunday services despite these being precisely the times when young pe
[normal]ople are more likely to find work especially in the tourism and hospitality sectors. A lack of early morning buses can also prevent them from accepting jobs although my research has uncovered young people reliant upon family members rising early to offer l
[normal]ifts or them walking or cycling up to 5 miles on unlit roads in the early morning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some LA’s do undertake consultation when major cuts are planned but the process is complex and not user friendly and the response rate is usually low. LA’s then falsely ass
[normal]ume that the cuts will have little impact and implement them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The major challenge is to provide an attractive service and being prepared to sustain it long enough to justify a sustained marketing campaign with just minor tweaks to the timetab
[normal]le. Many services previously supported by Rural Bus Grant / Challenge and LSTF have been short term and poorly marketed, often being substantially changed or withdrawn after as little as six months. Experience shows that it takes at least two years for a r
[normal]ural bus service to become established; the most successful services are those which have an established timetable
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rural bus services should be integrated with both existing commercial bus services 
[normal]and rail services, preferably with integrated ticketing
[normal]. Connections should be guaranteed with buses waiting for trains and other buses; it is not feasible for trains to wait for buses. They should provide opportunities for both local residents to access the wider community and visitors to access the countrysi
[normal]de. An excellent example is the  daily Little White Bus Hawes to 
[normal]Garsdale
[normal] Station service, whilst most buses in 
[normal]Ledbury
[normal] are now routed past the railway station. However in Matlock the new bus station adjacent to the railway station (though it is impossible
[normal] to see if the train has arrived from the bus station) is not used by most bus services (even those operated under LA contract or by the same transport group as the TOC).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ct works well for some passengers especially the very elderly 
[normal]or disabled who appreciate “door to door” services often with an escort. However they are very limited and normally require advance booking (up to 48 hrs ahead) and pre-registration with the scheme. The latter is often limited to elderly and disabled resid
[normal]ents in the area, excluding younger people and visitors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many CT vehicles are grossly underused being on the road only 35 hours per week and they could be used to provide early morning, evening and weekend bus services as timetabled routes, Revenue earned
[normal] from this work would help to meet overheads and thus reduce the usually high cost 
[normal]of core services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CT using paid drivers and management is not a cheap option and some LA’s are cutting back on such services 
[normal]eg
[normal] Shropshire, whilst Harrogate &amp; District CT 
[normal]has recently gone into administration. On the other hand Lincolnshire Connect appears to be a viable model to benchmark against.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Both the Upper 
[normal]Wensleydale
[normal] Community Partnership (Little White Bus) and Western Dales Bus in the Yorkshire Dales have shown th
[normal]at both scheduled journeys and demand responsive journeys can be provided using volunteer drivers managed by a Board of enthusiastic and competent volunteers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many CT services are demand responsive although this term covers many different 
[normal]modes from bespoke “dial a ride” services to extensions and diversions into villages requested by passengers already onboard; the latter is often used on return market day services and the last outward journey on other rural services to avoid the need to s
[normal]erve every hamlet if there is no-one to set down.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Demand responsive services need to be open to everyone and to be able to accept “last minute bookings”. This requires consistent mobile telephone coverage and hands-free phone in the bus itself for the dri
[normal]ver to be contacted either directly by passengers or through a control centre. This works very efficiently in Upper 
[normal]W
[normal]ensleydale
[normal] but is not an option in the Western Dales due to a lack of mobile signal in 
[normal]Dentdale
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Subsidised taxi scheme are rarely provide
[normal]d in the UK yet they could be a cost effective alternative in some cases 
[normal]eg
[normal] providing connections between rail stations and their rural hinterland. The user should be expected to pay at least 50% of the cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]As LA’s grapple with dimin
[normal]ishing budgets it is all too easy for them to cut rural bus services and blame central government. Bus service cuts require no redundancies in the public sector (though they will lead to redundancies and reduced hours for bus drivers, mechanics and managem
[normal]ent in the private sector) and there are no residual costs to consider 
[normal]eg
[normal] redundant buildings.
