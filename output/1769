defaultWritten evidence from defaultDr John Disney (TIC 083)default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultDemand is currently very poorly defined despite the wealth of data now available through electronic ticket machines on buses and rail ticket sales (although some rural bus services still use manual / handwritten 
default/ no tickets 
defaulteg
default Staffordshire and ma
defaultny do not adequately record journeys made by Concessionary Pass Holders of passengers with multi-journey tickets).
default&#xa0;
defaultMany LA’s make arbitrary decisions regarding tendered bus services based upon crude weekly / monthly / annual average numbers of passengers 
defaultper journey and subsidy per passenger journey.  This takes no account of the patronage of specific journeys; effectively the inclusion of positioning journeys can distort the statistics and suggest that services are not being underused. Furthermore loading
defaults on rural bus services are seasonal; not only do many rural bus services attract tourists in the summer (and often in the weekends during the winter) but local residents make more journeys at these times as there are more employment opportunities and elde
defaultrly people do not like travelling anywhere in poor weather.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese crude averages are also used to determine the required vehicle size, irrespective of variation in loadings between journeys, resulting in suppressed demand as passengers fear being left beh
defaultind by a full bus (especially as many smaller buses cannot carry standees).
default&#xa0;
defaultCalculations of the subsidy per passenger journey often do not take account of reimbursement from concessionary fares or multi-journey tickets
default; when included these are often very 
defaultlow.
default&#xa0;
defaultRural rail services tend to remain basically unaltered even when the TOC changes as they are basically specified in the franchise agreement although some TOC’s operate additional services for operational efficiency or to cater for additional 
default(seasonal) demand, especially if the franchise terms allow them to benefit from the additional revenue generated. It is very rare for trains to be so full that passengers cannot board although sometimes overcrowding on lines like the Settle – Carlisle  can
default exceed peak London commuter journeys.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultMany LA’s make changes to rural bus services without any notification to or consultation with passengers affected; indeed revised timetables are often not available until 2 weeks or less before the change
default and roadside publicity is often not changed or new timetables are displayed alongside expired ones with no dates shown; I have seen 3 different versions of timetables displayed for some services. This is despite the requirement for changes to be notified 
defaultto Traffic Commissioners with 56 days notice. Even websites are often vague about changes despite the LA concerned being the 
defaultfunder
default of the service. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFew rural bus services are commercially provided but those that are tend to be better at publicity includi
defaultng forthcoming changes but these changes are usually implemented for commercial reasons with no user consultation.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs LA budgets are squeezed, many long tern (3 and 5 year) contracts with operators are being terminated at short notice leading to operators
default being reluctant to invest in vehicles or marketing for such services.
default&#xa0;
defaultOverall the needs of persons with limited mobility have been much better addressed in recent years due to DDA Regulations but this has increased operating cost by up to 25% as low floo
defaultr buses are costly to maintain when used on poorer surfaced rural roads with adverse cambers and steep inclines.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany services are designed around the shopping, health and welfare needs of older persons but give them little opportunity to socialise or par
defaulttake in activities and events in adjacent towns and villages as most services terminate around 1700 and do not operate on Sundays.
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung 
defaultpersons
default needs are rarely met with few evening or Sunday services despite these being precisely the times when young pe
defaultople are more likely to find work especially in the tourism and hospitality sectors. A lack of early morning buses can also prevent them from accepting jobs although my research has uncovered young people reliant upon family members rising early to offer l
defaultifts or them walking or cycling up to 5 miles on unlit roads in the early morning.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome LA’s do undertake consultation when major cuts are planned but the process is complex and not user friendly and the response rate is usually low. LA’s then falsely ass
defaultume that the cuts will have little impact and implement them. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe major challenge is to provide an attractive service and being prepared to sustain it long enough to justify a sustained marketing campaign with just minor tweaks to the timetab
defaultle. Many services previously supported by Rural Bus Grant / Challenge and LSTF have been short term and poorly marketed, often being substantially changed or withdrawn after as little as six months. Experience shows that it takes at least two years for a r
defaultural bus service to become established; the most successful services are those which have an established timetable
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultRural bus services should be integrated with both existing commercial bus services 
defaultand rail services, preferably with integrated ticketing
default. Connections should be guaranteed with buses waiting for trains and other buses; it is not feasible for trains to wait for buses. They should provide opportunities for both local residents to access the wider community and visitors to access the countrysi
defaultde. An excellent example is the  daily Little White Bus Hawes to 
defaultGarsdale
default Station service, whilst most buses in 
defaultLedbury
default are now routed past the railway station. However in Matlock the new bus station adjacent to the railway station (though it is impossible
default to see if the train has arrived from the bus station) is not used by most bus services (even those operated under LA contract or by the same transport group as the TOC).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCt works well for some passengers especially the very elderly 
defaultor disabled who appreciate “door to door” services often with an escort. However they are very limited and normally require advance booking (up to 48 hrs ahead) and pre-registration with the scheme. The latter is often limited to elderly and disabled resid
defaultents in the area, excluding younger people and visitors.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany CT vehicles are grossly underused being on the road only 35 hours per week and they could be used to provide early morning, evening and weekend bus services as timetabled routes, Revenue earned
default from this work would help to meet overheads and thus reduce the usually high cost 
defaultof core services.
default&#xa0;
defaultCT using paid drivers and management is not a cheap option and some LA’s are cutting back on such services 
defaulteg
default Shropshire, whilst Harrogate &amp; District CT 
defaulthas recently gone into administration. On the other hand Lincolnshire Connect appears to be a viable model to benchmark against.
default&#xa0;
defaultBoth the Upper 
defaultWensleydale
default Community Partnership (Little White Bus) and Western Dales Bus in the Yorkshire Dales have shown th
defaultat both scheduled journeys and demand responsive journeys can be provided using volunteer drivers managed by a Board of enthusiastic and competent volunteers. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMany CT services are demand responsive although this term covers many different 
defaultmodes from bespoke “dial a ride” services to extensions and diversions into villages requested by passengers already onboard; the latter is often used on return market day services and the last outward journey on other rural services to avoid the need to s
defaulterve every hamlet if there is no-one to set down.
default&#xa0;
defaultDemand responsive services need to be open to everyone and to be able to accept “last minute bookings”. This requires consistent mobile telephone coverage and hands-free phone in the bus itself for the dri
defaultver to be contacted either directly by passengers or through a control centre. This works very efficiently in Upper 
defaultW
defaultensleydale
default but is not an option in the Western Dales due to a lack of mobile signal in 
defaultDentdale
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSubsidised taxi scheme are rarely provide
defaultd in the UK yet they could be a cost effective alternative in some cases 
defaulteg
default providing connections between rail stations and their rural hinterland. The user should be expected to pay at least 50% of the cost.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultAs LA’s grapple with dimin
defaultishing budgets it is all too easy for them to cut rural bus services and blame central government. Bus service cuts require no redundancies in the public sector (though they will lead to redundancies and reduced hours for bus drivers, mechanics and managem
defaultent in the private sector) and there are no residual costs to consider 
defaulteg
default redundant buildings.
