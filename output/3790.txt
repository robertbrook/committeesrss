[[[151/11]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am writing to you regarding the above planning applications and my (and other residents’ long-standing battle to show that the approval of these applications were wrong – and, I believe, fraudulent). &#xa0;The Local Government Ombudsman’s steadfast refusal to investigate these matters has caused me significant financial loss, health problems and a degradation of my standard of living. I am requesting you investigate this matter.&#xa0;I attach background to the applications for your information, but the crux of the issue is the Ombudsman’s incredibly poor decision-making and judgement.&#xa0;

[[[The Local Government Ombudsman]]]

[[[’s conduct re BE/42/10]]]

[[[ ]]]I complained about the actions of the planning department to the Council. They investigated but never concluded a report and what little investigation was done was woeful, inconsistent and avoided responding to the issues. I complained to the Local Government Ombudsman. She decided that she would not investigate as I had not suffered any injustice. In coming to this conclusion the Ombudsman decided that:&#xa0;The Ombudsman made it clear that although the caravan park joined my property, because my house was some 70m away at the other end of the garden, there was no detriment to me. I find this unfair. My home is in a conservation area. The end of my garden used to look out to beautiful views of the Downs and I used to enjoy sitting in my garden. The Ombudsman tells me I have no right to a view. Whether I have a right or not, I do believe I have the right to the quiet enjoyment of my garden which has been severely limited and so I have suffered significant injustice.&#xa0;I asked the Ombudsman why she thought there was screening of the site from my garden and she said he had looked at Google maps. I sent him a photo of the ‘view’ clearly showing no such screening. I find it quite bizarre that the Ombudsman will not believe my word, but will accept what he or she thinks she sees on an out of date, fuzzy map.&#xa0;I also pointed out that the Ombudsman had made up made up this road that carried traffic away from my house – the Ombudsman admitted he had made a mistake when looking at Google maps and would reconsider the decision. The Ombudsman then issued another decision, again deciding not to investigate on the basis that whilst the traffic would indeed have to go past my house, the road was a busy one, linking two A roads together. I pointed out that the Ombudsman had again made up this ‘fact’ and misread google maps and that my road did not join two A roads. I also told the Ombudsman that the developer had told my children not to ride in the road as the road was now too dangerous – one would have thought another injustice. I also said I disagreed with the principle that there had to be an injustice to me for the Ombudsman to investigate. In my opinion whether there is injustice or not, the Ombudsman should have the power to investigate allegations of a serious nature, which, in this case, includes planning officers providing false information. &#xa0;The Ombudsman continued to refuse to accept that my road did not join two A roads, and refused to investigate. In addition the Ombudsman claimed that she was 

[[[legally prevented]]] from investigating a case where there was no personal significant injustice.&#xa0;I wrote to the Ombudsman (Ms Seez) herself to put the key points to her. She responded by saying:1. My road links two A roads and therefore the additional traffic was insignificant (can I repeat that this is simply untrue – my road is a dead end road and the caravan park is adding considerably to the traffic. I object most strongly to the Ombudsman effectively calling me a liar).2. She agreed with her officers – that she was legally prevented from investigating any case where there was no injustice “primary legislation that forbids the Ombudsman to review actions if they do not cause a significant injustice on the complainant.”3. She would entertain no more correspondence.&#xa0;Not only has the Ombudsman got her facts wrong regarding the roads, she is also unacquainted with the legislation that covers her organisation. There is NO legislation that prevents her from investigating wrongdoing if there is no perceived injustice. There is case law that says that she can decide what she investigates, but this is completely different. If the Ombudsman is using this as the reason for not investigating, she must then answer properly for failing to use her powers to not investigate a case where officers have clearly abused their positions of authority and not blame the legislation for preventing her from taking action. It beggars belief that the Ombudsman does not know this distinction. Common sense would tell you that this cannot be right. If the Council is guilty of maladministration that causes £400,000 of loss then each resident is ‘losing’ only £1 (if there are 400,000 residents) – the law does not forbid the Ombudsman to investigate such a case. &#xa0;On reading other complainants’ blogs and correspondence on websites I know I am not the first to come across the Ombudsman’s almost pathological desire not to apologise and to blame the law on not being able to investigate serious cases of maladministration.&#xa0;

[[[/1]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[ ]]]Following the inaction of the Ombudsman re BE/42/10, the developer ignored all the planning conditions set out, extended the site without planning permission, built new buildings, placed the caravan sites closer to people’s gardens and generally did whatever he wanted.&#xa0;The developer applied again BE/151/11 – trying to get retrospective permission for all the developments and trying to put right the quite appalling mistakes on BE/42/10. The application was meant to put them right, but it didn’t. For instance I told the council that the land was wrongly delineated, that there was a new road that had been built – both of which they denied, but both of which have been proved to be correct as the developer has recently put in a third application! &#xa0;I complained once again to the council – who failed to properly investigate or provide a report. In fact, after corresponding for some time with the council and giving them a final warning (I think after 6 months) that I wanted the response, they admitted that they couldn’t even find my complaint. &#xa0;I complained to the Ombudsman about the handling of BE/151/11. The Ombudsman again rejected my claim. She claimed the main points on why it was rejected were because: &#xa0;I hope you can feel my frustration. The basis of the original Ombudsman’s rejection of my request for an investigation is almost entirely based on the false premise that my lane is a link road – despite my repeated denials that this is the case.  &#xa0;I wrote to the Ombudsman to point out all the differences in BE/151/11 and to argue again that she had got her facts wrong. I copy my letter and the Ombudsman’s response. I have tabularised the points in the two letters in order to add comment.&#xa0;

[[[My complaint]]]

[[[The Ombudsman’s response]]]

[[[My comment]]]1. I asked for the primary legislation reference which states that the Ombudsman is prevented from investigating matters where there is not significant personal injustice&#xa0;&#xa0;Quotes S26(1) of the Local Government Act which gives the Ombudsman the power to investigate complaints of ‘...injustice in consequence of maladministration...’. States that it follows that there must be some personal injustice. This legislation gives the power to investigate – not to not investigate – it is being abused by the Ombudsman and I would like the Select Committee to make this clear to the LGO.2. I asked why the Ombudsman decided that the risk of someone dying on the dual carriageway was not a ‘material risk that could be directly attributed to the council’s decision’. I said it was known that the lane floods, the council knows that cars park there if they cannot get up the lane, and a young man was recently killed at the very spot where people park&#xa0;I also complained that the development has caused power cuts thus preventing me from working (and a loss of income since I work as a contractor) and causing inconvenience to my family. I was told by the Ombudsman that this could not have been foreseen by the council. I asked for the legislation that says that issues unforeseen by the council cannot be used to show significant injustice.  The Ombudsman replies that there is not a sufficiently close connection between the council’s actions and the possibility that people may park on the road if and when it floods.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The ombudsman claims that there is no legislation but that she is using her judgement and discretion to investigate or not investigate.This is ridiculous. I am being called a liar again. It is a fact that people park on the road when the lane floods – which is very regularly!&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;This argument is based on a false premise. The ombudsman firstly claimed that the inconvenience could not have been foreseen and therefore it was irrelevant. Now, given that she cannot provide any legislative evidence she is claiming that she used her general discretion to determine whether she should investigate and found there was no significant injustice.&#xa0; Whether the council could have foreseen the cutting of the electric cables is irrelevant and cannot be used as an argument under any legislation. &#xa0;The ombudsman only had authority to determine whether there was any injustice to me – which there was. She has changed her argument. I have lost hundreds of pounds in lost income due to the electricity cuts – in this time of austerity, that’s a lot of money. Given that the Ombudsman refuses to tell me what would be a ‘significant injustice’, I would be grateful if the committee would let me know how much loss I would have to have for the Ombudsman to consider it significant.3. I said the Information Commissioner has told me that he is only responsible for ensuring the authority provides the information requested not whether this is correct and that I need to take my complaint up with the LGO if I think I have been deceived.&#xa0;In addition, the ICO says he is not responsible for any consequences to the complainant regarding the lack of providing information. The council’s failure to provide me with information (and then providing me with false information) meant that I was unable to prepare the appropriate judicial review case that I would have been able to had I been provided with the information.  The ombudsman originally said that this was a matter for the ICO and so she would not investigate.&#xa0;The ombudsman has now changed her argument and says that she does not consider significant personal injustice has been done.Quite apart from the many hours I have wasted in trying to obtain evidence from the council (which all costs me loss of income), I cannot for the life of me understand why a) the Ombudsman considers that providing false information to the ICO is not worthy of investigation and b) why withholding evidence so that I am unable to present it to the court is anything but significant injustice. 4. I complained about dumping (and burying) of potentially toxic rubbish on grade 1 agricultural land next to my garden. I complained a number of times with no sensible response from the council. The ICO said that I hadn’t used the council’s formal complaints procedure and she would therefore not investigate but write to the council. I hadn’t used the council’s formal complaints procedure as doing so previously had cost me hundreds of pounds of lost income, hundreds of hours of lost time with NO final report ever being produced. &#xa0;Guess what, since the Ombudsman wrote to the council (in July) the council wrote me (and presumably copied in the Ombudsman) a very nice letter saying how concerned they were about these serious allegations and they would investigate thoroughly and properly and get back to me. Have I heard anything since? Of course not. Does the committee think (like I do) that the Local Government Ombudsman is simply encouraging bad practice amongst councils.5. I complained that the council had not responded to my complaints. The Ombudsman’s provisional statement simply dismisses my complaint saying there has been no significant injustice so whether the council can be bothered to investigate my complaint or not is immaterial.  Again, I would appreciate the committee’s view on whether the LGO is serving the public well.&#xa0;I have not made serial complaints. I have made a few, serious complaints. The one complaint that has been decided upon (by the ICO) judged that the council had failed on a number of counts. The council has failed to investigate any complaint and the Ombudsman has failed to investigate any complaint.&#xa0;I spent hours drafting the complaints, providing evidence that the council had got things wrong etc. Common sense tells you that this is a council which has lost touch with reality, treats its taxpayers with utter disdain and should be investigated – injustice to me or not.6. I made a number of points to the Ombudsman (most of which have been previously made but studiously ignored) to support my claim that the development has had a devastating effect on me and my family. For instance&#xa0;a) I rectify the Ombudsman’s view says it doesn’t matter that I have lost the view of the Downs. I clarify that I have regularly said that my point is more than this, it is that the development has a detrimental effect on the quiet enjoyment of my garden.&#xa0;b)  I restate that the lane in which the caravan site is situated is too small for the traffic and has ruined my walk up the road to the footpath across the fields and my children's ability to ride bicycles in the lane. The developer of the site has told me and my children that the lane is now too dangerous to cycle up. If you proceed with your current decision, please can you provide me with your assessment as to why not being able to use the lane for walking or cycling is not considered to be not a significant injustice to me – from my point of view I expect to be able to enjoy the countryside in which I live.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;c) I point out the Ombudsman is yet again basing the argument on a fictitious geography of the area regarding the roads.&#xa0;&#xa0;I ask for the Ombudsman’s assessment of what percentage increase of traffic she considers significant.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;d) I spent £6,000 on legal fees on a judicial review which was not heard by the courts. This a) shows the sense of injustice (and I believe it to be real) and b) shows my ‘loss’&#xa0;&#xa0;e) I noted the time I spent reminding the council of its duty (e.g. to ensure the developer actually complies with the conditions) and other points that they would otherwise have ignored. This has meant that I took time off work to write letters and STILL almost none of the conditions have been met even though the timeframes have long since expired. &#xa0;Please can I have your assessment as to how much time and loss of earnings I have to suffer before you consider I have suffered a significant amount.&#xa0;f) My health has suffered through a combination of residents (friends) leaving (they have sold up due to the injustices caused), due to the council’s lack of action (not responding to letters, not completing investigations, providing false information etc). &#xa0;Please can I have your assessment as to what is considered an injustice – I am happy to provide various letters of support if required.&#xa0;I offered to buy the field and run it as an agricultural business. Officers told councillors that the land could not be used for agricultural purposes despite the land being grade 1 and having an offer from me to buy it and use it as farmland. They support this claim by stating they had asked Langmeads (the biggest farmer in the area) if they wanted the land. Aside from the fact that the Council has refused to back up this statement with any evidence – (which is now subject to a complaint to the ICO), this is not how planning law works. This is allowing unfair trading. By failing to state that they were in possession of a letter from me that I would like to buy the land and by failing to take the view that the land could be used as agricultural land by someone other than Langmeads, I have suffered injustice. I could have run a thriving business which I am sure would have worked wonders for my health and well-being. That opportunity has been denied me.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;No response&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Ombudsman states that ‘traffic from the vehicles... does not render the lane unsuitable for walking or cycling.’&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The ombudsman says “I have removed points (iv) and (v) from the relevant paragraph in my decision statement. They do not affect my reasoning or decision.&#xa0;No response – Ombudsman doesn’t bother to reply.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The ombudsman simply says that ‘no doubt you were advised of the financial consequences of bringing and losing a judicial review application.’&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Said “I appreciate you have a strong sense of injustice and have expended money and time both with this complaint and by bringing court proceedings”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Ombudsman didn’t bother to respond or address this point.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Ombudsman didn’t bother to respond or address this point.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Ombudsman didn’t bother to respond or address this point.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Ombudsman didn’t bother to respond or address this point.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Whilst I understand that the Ombudsman, by law, needs to exercise judgement, that judgement should be based on common sense and facts.This view from the ombudsman follows on from her arguing for the past year that a) there was a northern road out of the caravan site – which was untrue b) that the road outside my house was a link road (which was untrue) and c) that my garden was screened from the caravan park by trees (untrue) ie. from a very bad interpretation of google maps. &#xa0;On the side of fact it is important to note that:&#xa0;I earnestly request the committee gives a view as to whether the LGO is properly exercising its responsibilities. &#xa0;Incredible. After two years of telling the Ombudsman that basing her decision that no injustice has been done, on the ‘fact’ that my lane links to A roads the Ombudsman finally, finally, finally... just removes the statements. No apology, no recognition that I may be right, no admission that the Ombudsman has been wrong. Simply removal of really key points – and then a statement saying that that they do not affect her reasoning anyway. I am sorry, but I hope you can see why my health has suffered under the breathtaking stance taken by the Ombudsman.&#xa0;I cannot see what business it is of the Ombudsman to know my legal advice. Nor do I see the relevance. The point is, has this decision by the council brought about significant injustice.&#xa0;&#xa0;The point I made was that I was spending time and losing income in ensuring the council did what it was supposed to do. I would like the committee’s view as to whether the LGO is simply allowed to dismiss any loss of income in such a cavalier fashion.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I think the Ombudsman has a duty to consider all the evidence I provide and respond to my valid queries.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I think the Ombudsman has a duty to consider all the evidence I provide and respond to my valid queries.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I think the Ombudsman has a duty to consider all the evidence I provide and respond to my valid queries.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;It is outrageous that the Ombudsman hasn’t bothered to consider this issue. The grade 1 farming land adjoins my own. I offered to buy the land well above grade 1 farming land price. The council reported to councillors that the land could not be used as farming land and denied the existence of a letter from me offering to buy it. I cannot see how this is not a significant injustice. It denied me the potential opportunity to enter negotiations with the landowner. I can’t see how denying me the right to run a business is not a significant injustice.&#xa0;&#xa0;As you can see from the above commentary, I think the Ombudsman is guilty of a dereliction of duty.&#xa0;

[[[The Ombudsman’s final decision notice.]]]&#xa0;1. In deciding that she would not investigate my 2nd complaint (re BE/151/11), the ombudsman cites two reasons:&#xa0;a) that ‘the ombudsman cannot look into a complaint once court action has commenced.’ I do not believe this is true. The legislation (local government act 1974, s26 para 6) says that “a Local Commissioner shall not conduct an investigation under this Part of this Act in respect of any of the following matters, that is to say... (c) any action in respect of which the person aggrieved has or had a remedy by way of proceedings in any court of law. Provided that a Local Commissioner may conduct an investigation notwithstanding the existence of such a right or remedy if satisfied that in the particular circumstances it is not reasonable to expect the person aggrieved to resort or have resorted to it.” &#xa0;Firstly, in this instance I only resorted to requesting a judicial review as the LGO had refused to investigate the original request for assistance in dealing with the matter – if the LGO had performed her duty the JR would not have been necessary. Secondly, I was unable to exercise my right as, having lodged the request for a judicial review, it became clear that I was unable to fund even a commentary on the Council’s defence. Therefore it was not reasonable for me to pursue the JR and I did not have a remedy in a court of law. In addition, the council withheld information necessary for a judicial review. This was finally extracted by the ICO just a couple of days after the judge decided not to hear the case. In refusing a JR the judge made it clear that he did so ’given the realities following the grant of the fourth application’. This would have been very different had the LGO been prepared to investigate the planning. I am a basic rate taxpayer and spent £6,000 on a very basic application. I was simply unable to afford further rebutting of the council’s untrue defence. &#xa0;My application was turned down. There was no judicial review. I do not believe I have been able to properly resort to ‘proceedings in a court of law’. I was not afforded the opportunity to present a wealth of evidence which I presented to the Ombudsman – which she dismissed as not ‘significantly different from the issues before the court’. I just do not agree. The court was not presented with the evidence that the land was in fact grade 1 agricultural land, and therefore afforded special protection. The court did not see the evidence that the council had denied the existence of a letter from me offering to buy the land. The court did not hear evidence of how the council had failed to comply with the directions of HM Planning Inspectorate nor see the pictures of farmland that the council insists is ‘built up’. I believe the Ombudsman did not take these (and other) facts into account in any way.&#xa0;b) The Ombudsman’s previous decision not to investigate the first planning application – a decision I have shown above, to be based on false premises. Bizarrely, whilst the 2nd decision eventually removes the reliance of the Ombudsman on the existence (untrue) of a link road, the 1st decision still contains this premise – and therefore is clearly a ‘bad’ decision.&#xa0;I hope you can appreciate the distress this issue has, and continues to cause, myself and my family and request your involvement. I would be very happy to present my grievances to the committee in person if this would be helpful.

[[[Brief history of the planning applications]]]&#xa0;BE/42/10 for a caravan park on Grade 1 agricultural land was approved under delegated powers by Arun District Council officers. Residents were unable to complain as none saw the application site notices. The Council claims that the notices were there and inspected – but had to guess at four different inspection dates before alighting on a date that was even possible.  &#xa0;In granting BE/42/10 officers:&#xa0;Because the applicant developed something entirely different to BE/42/10 – for instance he developed a much bigger piece of land, knocked down a screening wall, enlargened the entrance and put it right next to his neighbours and place the caravan pads within a few metres of neighbours windows – thus blocking their light, BE/151/11 was submitted.&#xa0;BE/151/11 was an attempt to regularise the previous breaches of planning permission, but in fact created more breaches. In creating and approving (the applicant claims that officers assisted with the development of the plans) BE/151/11, officers:All these errors were pointed out to planners before their presentation to councillors and councillors were told by planners that all of these statements made by residents’ were untrue.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
