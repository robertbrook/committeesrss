"&#xa0;\nWRITTEN EVIDENCE FROM THE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS IN PUBLIC LIFE [CST0006]&#xa0;1. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is pleased to have an opportunity to respond to the Public Administration Select Committee’s (PASC) call for evidence on the reporting of police performance indicators.  \nThe \nCommittee\n welcomes the decision of PASC to carry out their investigation into crime statistics\n, which was\n announced on 16\n \nOctober\n,\n as part of their wider investigation into statistics and their use in Government\n. \n&#xa0;\nBackground2. The Committee on Standards\n in\n Public Life is defined by its Seven Principles of Standards in Public L\nife which are Selflessness, Objectivity, Integrity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership. \n&#xa0;\n3. In 1994, when the Committee was established, its terms of reference were:\n“To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to e\nnsure the highest standards of propriety in public life. It was stated that “Public office should include: ministers, civil servants and advisers; Members of Parliament and UK Members of the European Parliament; members and senior officers of all non-depar\ntmental public bodies and of national health service bodies; non-ministerial office holders; members and other senior officers of other bodies discharging publicly-funded functions; and elected members and senior officers of local authorities.\n” The Commit\ntee’s terms\n \nwere extended in 2013 to include\n “anyone who works as a public office-holder. This includes all those who are elected or appointed to public office, nationally and locally, and all people appointed to work in the civil service, local government\n, the police, courts and probation services, NDPBs, and in the health, education, social and care services.\n” \n&#xa0;\n4. We have for some time been interested in the debate around the application of the Seven Principles of Public Life to policing. The Committee \nhas been closely watching ethical risks in the police. As we said in \nthe Committee’s\n Annual Report in 2012/13, the Committee will\n keep a watching brief on “Ethical standards in the police, including Police and \nCrime Commissioners.” In \nour work plan 2013/14\n we said\n, “We will continue to monitor a number of issues, including, the behaviour and conduct of the police.\n” As part of that\n \nwork plan\n, the Committee has met with\n Police and Crime Commissioners to \ndiscuss how they can best assist them in \npre-\nempt\ning\n an\ny ethical risks they may face in their new roles. \nThe Committee’s response to the consultation therefore focuses primarily on the fourth question: Has enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?&#xa0;Integrity of crime data5. It has been reported that the level of crime has fallen in recent years. The Office for National Statistics \n(ONS) \nreported on 17 October 2013 that the headline estimate for crimes against households and resident adults was down 7% compared with the \nprevious year’s survey\n. Fewer crimes are solved because there are fewer crimes\n committed\n. However, there have long been concerns about the accuracy of these crime statistics. Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) reported in 1999 on ‘gaming’ prac\ntices and their effect on statistics. \nI\nt was admitted that the recorded figures in the Office for National Statistics National Crime Survey, reported in January 2\n0\n13\n might be defective since the ONS\n relies on figures reported \nto them \nby \npolice\n forces\n. \nAccu\nrate reporting of crime data is essential in order to put in place resources to deal with crime and its effects adequately. \nAs David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary said “It is important to measure crime accurately if we are to be able to tackle it effec\ntively” (July 2001, cited in Simmons \net al\n 2003\n). Accurate statistics reporting is also vital for the Government to meet its objective of increasing transparency around data in order for the public to be accurately informed of crime nationally \nand \nin thei\nr \nown \narea. \n&#xa0;\n6. Performance management was introduced into the police force from the late 1980s and was designed to increase competency and accountability by measuring performance. There is a tradition of serious academic work which engages critically som\ne of the perverse effects of a targets culture within the police service in recent years\n. Loveday wrote that: “...the use of ‘gaming’ techniques now characterise the operation of most public service managers.” He concluded that this leads to a performance\n culture in order to meet these targets\n. Tom Winsor, \nHe\nr Majesty's Chief Inspector of \nConstabulary\n,\n \ngave evidence to \nthe Home Affairs Committee (HAC) for their report ‘Leadership and standards in the police’ that the Police Federation\n themselves\n had raise\nd concerns about the reporting of crime statistics.\n \n&#xa0;\n7. The phenomenon of \n‘gam\ning’\n statistics is widespread in public life and not just confined to the police, \nproblems have also been noted in healthcare\n. Dr Patrick nevertheless notes some problematic \nforms of ‘gaming’ particularly within the police. He talks of ‘cuffing’, so called after the magician’s act of making things disappear up the sleeve. The operation of cuffing allows some forms of crime figures to disappear altogether by, for instance, not \nrecording some types at all\n. On the process known as ‘nodding’ figures are improved by getting offenders to nod to other offences to be taken into consideration. In the House of Lords debate on police performance management indicators, introduced by the E\narl of Lytton on 19 March 2013\n Lord Condon declared\n \n“During my first few weeks as Chief Constable of Kent, I had to deal with a major discipline case involving Kent detectives who had been visiting burglars in prison. Through various inducements such as t\naking them out for the day, letting them meet their girlfriends and extra cigarettes, the detectives got them to admit to crimes they had not committed, thus fundamentally impairing the Kent detection figures.”\n Dr Patrick also speaks of ‘stitching’- the p\nractice of coercing suspects to confess crimes with threats or by offering more lenient treatment. Finally, Dr Patrick describes the practice of skewing, this involves applying resources solely to whatever targets are being measured to the exclusion of oth\ners.\n&#xa0;\n8\n. \nFurther r\nesearch supports the idea that ‘gaming’ behaviour is an organisational problem resulting from targets rather than initiated by individuals. The behaviour is also linked to scandals. For example, in 1995 when the Chief Constable in Manche\nster stopped striking deals with offenders b\nefore sentencing\n \nknown as ‘write offs’\n, the detection rate fell from 33% in 1994/5 to 18% in 1996/7\n. The noticeable impact of this action underlines how ‘gaming’ practices can undermine crime statistics and render them unreliable. \n&#xa0;9. \nThis Committee wrote that “integrity means that \nholders of public office should not act or take decisions in order to g\nain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.” Applying this principle to crime statistics therefore means that public office-holders and organisations should consistently and reliably recording statistics in a wa\ny that promotes openness, accountability and establishes robust mechanisms for detecting and dealing with wrongdoing. \n&#xa0;\n10\n. \nThe Committee acknowledges that some work in this area has already been done through the overseeing of \npolice recorded crime figures\n \nby Home Office statisticians who \nexamine data to identify anomalies or \ninconsistencies and \nrefer issues\n to the police force concerned for clarification\n. The National Crime Registrar also advises both police forces and HMIC \non the application of the rules\n. The Committee considers that there is still work to be done and two options may be considered useful solutions for increasing the reliability of crime statistics. The first is independent supervision of data and \nthe second is independent auditing of the \ndata. The first option is already taking place to some degree and t\nhe second could be considered in order to give some assurances as to the reliability of data, ensure any biases are rooted out and allow rebuilding of trust in the data. \n&#xa0;Leadership issues              11. The Committee notes with interest that Dr Patrick argues that the solution to ‘gaming’ lies in reforming current police regulatory framework and governance arrangements in relation to crime statistics\n. Several police officers have become whistleblow\ners on ‘gaming’ statistics, which could be indicative of a desire for change within the police itself. However, in order to do this, whistleblowers must be given adequate protection. Independent research published by this committee found that respondents w\nanted protection for whistleblowing and external regulators for organisations (whether public or private sector). Encouraging a culture where people are not afraid to report wrongdoing (66% for large public sector organisations and 53% for private sector) \nwas seen as particularly important for promoting probity\n. This Committee has previously said that “A culture that encourages the challenge of inappropriate behaviour at all levels requires visible, robust and effective leadership in order to ensure that h\nigh ethical standards are taken seriously.\n” \n&#xa0;12\n. \nG\nood leadership and governance is the key to ensuring integrity of crime data. \nThe Committee fully accepts that most people who work in policing are honourable, ded\nicated and hard working. Indeed\n it is our\n Public Attitudes Survey\n which shows the high regard in which the police are held.\n Over 60% of respondents reported that they trusted the police to tell the truth in 2011, with only judges rated more highly\n. A\n more recent poll conducted by YouGov has sho\nwn that trust in police is declining. The number of respondents who trust senior police officers has decreased from 72% in 2003 to 49% in 2012\nand a\n quarter (26%) of those surveyed by ComRes in 2013 said the “plebgate” affair has made them less likely to trust the police.\n \n&#xa0;\n13\n. \nAs \nwe \ndiscussed in Standards Matter\n, the p\nrinciple of leadership underlines the importance of setting a good example, promo\nting high standards and \nchallenging p\noor behaviour\n. \nWe \nhighlighted the value\n of proactive governance and visible leadership in ensuring high ethical standards in organisations when we said, “Exemplifying high standards is particularly important for those in management positions. It is even more so for those at the very top, becaus\ne it is they who set the tone for an organisation.” Lord Justice Leveson made the same point in his report: “...\nin a hierarchical organisation such as the police, the tone is set from the top, and how leaders behave will have an obvious filtering effect ri\nght through the force\n.\n \nElizabeth Filkin has previously\n commented on the behaviour of senior managers in the police: \n“I am concerned by the extent to which police officers and staff feel that some of their senior leaders abide by a different set of rules..\n. There has been no clear standard set by the senior team for police officers and staff to use as a guide for their own behaviour and in some instances the standards set have been poor and have led to consequent damage.\n”\n&#xa0;\n14. Police and Crime Commissioner\ns (PCCs) have a role in ensuring the integrity of crime data \nin their new position\ns\n as ethical leaders. As the Home Secretary has said “e\nlected Police and Crime Commissioners now provide local accountability for police forces.\n”\n \nPolice and Crime Commissioners are democratically elected leaders and are responsible for holding \ntheir local police force to account\n. We would expect that to include holding Chief Constables, who compile the \npolice \nstatistics\n,\n to account for the quality a\nnd accuracy of the information. PCCs are ultimately held accountable at the ballot box, as the public may choose not to re-elect a PCC they have lost\n \ntrust and \nconfidence\n in. \n&#xa0;15\n. \nFinally, we \nwelcome the publication of the College of Policing draft code of ethics\nand are\n pleased at the adoption of the Seven Principles of Public L\nife. We do however wish to reiterate in conclusion that the \nSeven Princip\nles, especially those of leadership\n, accountability and integrity apply to the production of crime statistics as well as to other areas of policing. \nIt appears to us that this debate must include a more express assessment of the state of play with respect \nto th\ne accuracy of police statistics.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n              \n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n \nCommunicating statistics: not only true but also fair \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpubadm/190/190.pdf\n Hansard (HC) 25 October 1994, col. 758\n http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Annual-plan-13-14\n.pdf\n http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Annual-plan-13-14.pdf\n Office for National Statistics 2013 Crime in England and Wales, Year Ending June 2013.\n Available at:\n http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_331209.pdf\n Jon Simmons, Clarissa Legg, Rachel Hosking 2003 National Crime Recording St\nandard (NCRS): A\nn analysis of the impact on recorded crime Companion Volume to Crime in England and Wales 2002/2003 Part One: The national picture.
