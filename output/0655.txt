[[[Analysis]]]

[[[ &amp; Commentary]]]The question is does man-made (industrial) carbon dioxide together with natural inputs bring about global warming or climate change? This is understood to be the case by many politicians (some) climate scientists and seemingly the public at large. Discharge to the atmosphere of CO2 gases due to the ‘burning’ of fossil fuels, thereby said to exert global warming, is known as Anthropogenic Global Warming (or AGW) in science circles - or do environmental changes occur because of other factors currently being investigated?&#xa0;Firstly, contentious claims that CO2 is the major cause for global climate change, is based on historical laboratory experiments (a closed system) carried out in the mid-1800s. Today this assertion is hotly disputed by a very large body of scientists commonly referred to as climate sceptics. The conclusion arrived at is that AGW is a false hypothesis derived from years of geophysical understanding of the scientific modus operandi, and scholarly interactions with leading scientists in the field of climate physics. This also stems from observational evidence that CO2 is a minor heat radiating trace gas common to the atmosphere, yet curtailed by a relatively short residency times (two to five years). Hence it is highly unlikely to affect global temperatures in the manner proposed. Additionally CO2 comprises a negligible quantity of the molecular mass in our atmosphere, and currently amounts to 0.0396.8 parts per million by volume (ppmv - CO2.Org Feb 2013). But it is still alleged to constitute the prime so-called ‘greenhouse gas’ (GHG) thereby engendering a so-called global ‘greenhouse effect’ (GE), said unequivocally to be responsible for climate change regardless of its source (industrial/natural). &#xa0;With the quality of carbon dioxides forcing effect on climate warming (subscribed to by the AGW orthodoxy), it is neither challenged, nor made clear, that atmospheric gases, especially CO2 is calibrated using a logarithmic scale. This gas does not absorb infra-red radiation over a linear range as many climate scientists mistakenly believe. Because CO2 is strongly logarithmic in magnitude (a measurement that displays the value of a physical quantity using intervals corresponding to orders of scale), the first 1.5oC of molecular CO2 arises from the initial 20ppm. The next 1.5oC increase requires a further 400ppm, and then 1oC for a further 1000ppm. The significance of this is that with current levels put at ~0.039%, a one 100ppm increase will amount to ~0.1oC warming after 50 years and less so with each added 100ppm increment. Or put another way, assuming a rising rate of 2ppm per annum (IPCC), temperatures will rise at 0.1oC for every 50 years.&#xa0;Furthermore CO2 forcing can only be radiated over a tiny portion of the infra-red (IR) spectrum, i.e. within a 15 micron bandwidth only. Gaseous H2O (water vapour) on the other hand (~4% of all atmospheric gases) is measured similarly but over almost the entire bandwidth spectrum. Therefore it is unscientific, nay impossible that anthropogenic and natural carbon dioxide gases coalesced together (or separately) can be responsible for climate warming. Not only is this gas insufficient of itself to account for a projected high degree of additional temperature escalation (2.4 to 6.4oC) by the end of the twenty first century (AR4 2007, IPCC). But even with the inclusion of more dominant GHGs (H2O, CH4) that contribute mainly to the mass of our atmosphere, such large increases in warming are seen to be unattainable. Given the best climate scientists, they cannot predict future warming trends with any accuracy or indeed the amount of carbon dioxide that is said to contribute to it. It is well understood that atmospheric CO2 follows (is not responsible for) warming over historical time-frames, but acts in reverse – atmospheric carbon dioxide follows warming, albeit somewhat belatedly over-time. (hundreds of years). This trend points to gradual rises in temperature following the last Ice Age ~10k years ago and suggests we might be entering one of many interglacials during the current Ice Age. Interestingly researchers at Berkeley National Laboratory (Jan 2012) have found that newly discovered so-called Criegee biradicals molecules react to accelerate the formation of sulphate and nitrate in the atmosphere. It is suggested these compounds will lead to aerosol formation and ultimately to cloud formation with the potential to cool the planet rather than warm it.&#xa0;However, the hottest climate ‘science’ innovation used by climate science institutions, is defined (guessed at) using specious modelling techniques (built-in projected undefined feedbacks). The end results of which provide nourishment for political consumption in IPCC reports. It can be said that hitherto temperature ratios have not increased beyond 0.7oC from ~150 years ago. This is as one would expect given well researched observational data, although vested interests will state otherwise – mention ‘climate change’ for funding research grants and you are more than likely to get them!&#xa0;

[[[Commentary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Tendentious pseudoscience has been laid bare by the so-called ‘Hockey Stick’ diagram that first appeared in science literature and the public media in 2008 - ‘The Hockey Stick Illusion’ (2010) and additional literature opposing AGW issues. This was followed a year later by the ‘Climategate affair’ that exposed the same institutions and so-called ‘climate scientists’ transgressing their responsibilities to science ethics. The climategate revelations were a seminal moment that reinforced deep scepticism of science everywhere. It became patently clear that not only were some science institutions seen to be apostate to science principles, but that the ‘science’ conducted was corrupt to its core. Worse was to follow when a committee tribunal exonerated the protagonists with a ‘pseudo-judicial’ ruling (by a chairman with AGW leanings) without due reference to the mendacious behaviour employed by the protagonists themselves in altering and obliterating their ‘research’ and presenting it as authentic science. Moreover, our public broadcaster the BBC, contrived by all means possible’ to silence any opposition to these AGW ‘researchers’ and the shabby science that followed from it. In fact the BBC went out of its way to commend this ‘dodgy data’ based on the contrived Hockey Stick illustration and without probing comment expected from a public broadcaster. This was backed-up with a documentary series (Earth: The Climate Wars, 2010), while elsewhere their medium persisted with (an unbalanced) AGW agenda at every opportunity. Indeed it could be said; the BBC legitimised the Hockey Stick author (Prof Michael Mann) with prime-time (celebrity ‘scientists’) in radio and TV appearances that went essentially unchallenged in contravention of its editorial standards - to this effect underpinned by Royal Charter. Not only is the U.K. a democracy underpinned by fundamental rights for detracting opinions, but the BBC funded by licence fee payers has no mandate to adopt partisan strategies as to what, in their opinion, is correct and good for us.  &#xa0;

[[[Commentary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]From time-to-time there has been a good deal of correspondence with the BBC and BBC Trust, principally as a long term licence fee payer/s, to remind the power-that-be, that in almost every broadcast (regardless) via radio or television on their pervasiveness to plug the AGW agenda without balancing the topic with opposing viewpoints. Their response has been in the standard form:&#xa0;‘The BBC has held a high-level seminar with&#xa0;some of 

[[[the best scientific experts]]]&#xa0;and has come to the view that the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the AGW consensus’&#xa0;Or to be concise ‘The science is settled’ - tough! Well needless to say, as a practitioner (now retired) in geophysics, (the) science is never settled. Hence much laboured correspondence took place with the Corporation and Trust as to who these ‘best scientific experts’ might be. Disquieting to report both organisations refused to name the scientists involved despite insistence that it was their duty to do so under the terms of their broadcasting mandate and for reasons of public transparency. It transpired however, following a rejected Freedom of Information request (FOI), from another (unknown) licence fee payer, that the FOI could not be disclosed in a High Court action. The judgement related to some obscure edict; citing dismissal of the action on behalf of the defendant (the BBC) in contention that ‘for the purposes of journalism’ it could not be granted - a rather inadequate get-out clause, notwithstanding an iniquitous waste of licence fee funding it seems – again it later became known the sentencing judge was a member of a pro-AGW pressure group. However an intrepid blogger utilising the internet’s archival Wayback Machine discovered that 58 persons attended a seminar in 2006 supposedly representing a scientific gathering of minds on behalf of the BBC - forming as it happens, the Corporation’s scientific gathering. These attendees were in fact the BBC’s ‘best scientific experts’. The names and representations revealed most attendees were none other than AGW campaign groups (Greenpeace, Stop Climate Chaos, etc) plus 28 BBC employees and some representing NGOs, but most coming from industry and vested interests groups. In fact only three scientists attended the seminar, none of whom was qualified in attribution science associated with Earth sciences or climate physics. It was revealed the meeting was organised by the new BBC Director General (March 2013), Lord Hall, who was then, Mr Tony Hall, the Director of News – perhaps an opportunity here now to redress past editorial imbalances?  We shall see! &#xa0;

[[[Commentary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]When in post it was clearly apparent that Chris Huhne (Coalition, LD) was a vocal AGW environmentalist, as was David Milliband (Labour) before him, another strident AGW supporter. Both had poor/no understanding of climate science issues other than the benign consensus viewpoint, whose intent is lofty noble cause principles at the expense of adapting to climate changes, if indeed such is occurring. None of the past ministers were qualified in science training, nor indeed is the current incumbent, Ed Davey (LD) - all it seems hold PPE qualifications from the same red-brick university. Moreover none has ever been employed outside of academia or worked in the ‘real world’. The current Environment Secretary is seemingly enacting a coalition initiative clearly designed with energy policies that could be rightly called the ‘Green Mix’- a strategy clearly intent on utilising a combination of renewable energy resources, such as wind turbine, solar panel and tidal surge. Such ‘green’ policies thus far have cost/is costing millions of pounds of tax payer funding by way of Government subsidies, no doubt designed to appease the minority (yet strident) green lobby. However it is well known that manufacturing costs of wind turbines are extremely high while the U.K’s chaotic variable wind speeds make their use largely inefficient and costly to maintain or replace. The evidence/research points to a huge imbalance of operating margins that is leading to rising energy prices from an unworkable misguided environment policy. As for solar power in our changeable climate where winters are long, cold, dark and damp and when power is most needed, they are again singularly costly and inefficient because insolation is highly variable. And like most renewable energy sources the electricity generated is unable to be stored thereby delimiting downloads to the National Grid. &#xa0;On the inevitable concern of utilising nuclear power, well this is one of the most proven and reliable sources of energy, albeit associated with initial high build, maintenance and safety costs. The conundrum still exists however; ‘what is to be done with nuclear waste?’ As for safety issues generally, well the industry as a whole tends to be (extremely) safety conscious following Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011) - a natural unforeseen catastrophe. Sad to report a U.K. nuclear power programme by necessity should have been addressed (by successive Governments) many years ago with a rebuild/modification programme projected fifty to perhaps a hundred years ahead - but today is still in wanting because of restricting  AGW laws/guidelines that result in continued inaction.&#xa0;

[[[Commentary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A wealth of insight and knowledge on climate science has been ignored by politicians, the media, and especially AGW scientists following their own (CO2) agenda. Vast amounts of new research by Earth scientists, astrophysicists, cosmologists, climatologists and other disciplines is today available from easily accessed websites and institutions. Much information is still being researched but what is available has been made accessible on the internet which attempts to address all known (and unknown) variables relating to climate science. In just a few examples, a well informed paper of climate modelling/residency times and AGW CO2 on the origins and proficiency of GE global warming is available from Professor Segalstad (1997) together with impartial independent studies, such as website http://brneurosci.org/co2.html (click Global warming) which is highly informative. Such balanced studies from many Earth and climate physicists foretell of variable factors (too many to discuss here) that point to warming and cooling episodes over shorter time spans than was previously envisaged in addition to episodically longer periods of warming/cooling deduced from the geological record. &#xa0;Further studies (readily accessible) include the influence of Heinrich Events (sedimentary marine core data), D-O Cycles (ice core data), and Milankovic Cycles (Solar system planetary cycles). Solar insolation alone amounts to 99% of warming and radiative forcing at the Earth’s interface where warming phase transitions release CO2 from natural sinks to the atmosphere in relatively short-term (hundreds of years) following temperature increases. Simple experiments demonstrate that solar irradiance cycles and industrial carbon (fossil fuels) contribute miniscule amounts of life-giving CO2 to the atmosphere. Insolation is the driving mechanism of all atmospheric heating captured (to a greater extent) by a ‘Blanket Effect’ rather than (a misnomer) ‘The Greenhouse Effect’.  Furthermore the atmosphere is an open system and does not have a ceiling, where all atmospheric heat is ultimately lost (disseminated) to the vacuum of space. And having researched the impact of atmospheric CO2 gases for many years, there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that carbon dioxide is uniquely responsible for inducing global warming (climate change) – regardless that there is a correlation of nominal warming (thermal infra-red) in all GHGs (H2O, CH4, CO2) and a dilution in others (N, O, &amp; O3). A correlation with something else however cannot be regarded as science fact as many might believe.&#xa0;Indeed the CLOUD project currently under investigation at CERN relating to heavy electron bombardment (muons) due to idiosyncratic variation in solar flares (coronal mass ejections) seems to offer a better understanding of (perhaps) shorter term climate change based on solar irradiance. Current (known) climate influences fail to persuade many scientists (the sceptics) that CO2 (a minor thermally reactive gas) is the prime driver of global warming (climate change).

[[[Commentary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]India and China emphasise an overriding priority of maintaining high economic growth rates to raise living standards. Their plans identify measures that promote development objectives while also yielding co-benefits for addressing climate change effectively if possible.&#xa0; Both agree national measures would be more successful with assistance from developed countries, and pledge that per capita greenhouse gas emissions will at no point exceed that of developed countries even if pursued with development objectives. In other words their own economies must come first, with a tacit understanding that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels cannot be controlled by the developed world, and anyway the AGW science is suspect and not proven.&#xa0;In 2011 Japan and Russia stated that they would not take on further Kyoto targets.&#xa0;The Canadian government invoked Canada's legal right to formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol in December 2011.&#xa0;Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990, while warming remained static. The Environment minister&#xa0;cited Canada's liability to "enormous financial penalties" under the Kyoto treaty unless it withdrew.&#xa0;He also suggested that the recently signed&#xa0;Durban agreement&#xa0;may provide an alternative way forward. Canada's decision was strongly criticised by other ratifying countries. &#xa0;

[[[N.B.]]]On a topical but sad note following the death of our former Prime Minister, Baroness Lady Thatcher (‘The Politician’), she was greatly responsible during the 1980s for adopting an AGW agenda. This course of action was taken-up by most developed countries because of her symbolic status in the world of politics. On further investigation however during her retirement, Lady Thatcher (‘The Scientist’) renounced the AGW Theory by referring to it as ‘highly suspect’; and to activists motives as ‘doomsters’-
