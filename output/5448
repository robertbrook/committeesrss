[normal]In June 2010 the Government committed to improve the way in which tax policy is developed, communicated and legislated, and published a consultation document: 
[normal]Tax policy-making: a new approach
[normal]. In December 2010 the Government published 
[normal]“
[normal]The new approach to
[normal] tax policy making: a response to the consultation
[normal]”
[normal], which set out details of the new tax policy making process. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]During the Tax Policy Making consultation, officials met more than 40 tax practitioners to discuss the way we make tax policy: including lawy
[normal]ers, accountants, and tax managers and received over 40 written responses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following consultation, the Government announced five major changes which have a substantial impact on the way tax policy is made and communicated: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]• Where the Government is emba
[normal]rking on 
[normal]major areas of tax 
[normal]reform
[normal], it will set out its policy objectives and rationale for reform, building on the approach taken in the Corporate Tax Road Map. 
[normal]• Tax policies will be developed over a 
[normal]longer policy cycle
[normal]. The majority of tax measures will be announced at Budgets for inclusion in the Finance Bill the following year at the earliest. 
[normal]• The Government will use the period between the Budget and the following Finance Bill to consult on proposed policy changes 
[normal]and draft legislation. The Government published a 
[normal]Tax Consultation Framework
[normal] [bold]that outlines its approach to consultation on tax policy and 
[normal]legislation. In summary, the framework commits to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]• The Government will ta
[normal]ke a 
[normal]more strategic approach
[normal] [bold]to 
[normal]tax 
[normal]avoidance, and its response to significant avoidance risks will be balanced with improving predictability and stability in the tax system. The Government published a 
[normal]Protocol
[normal] [bold]setting out the circumstances in which it wil
[normal]l announce legislative changes with immediate effect outside fiscal events. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]• 
[normal]When announcing changes to tax law, the Government will ensure that it clearly sets out what the change is
[normal];
[normal] why it is being proposed and what impact it will have. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evaluation of the tax policy making process[bold]Tax Professionals Forum
[normal]The Government is continuing to engage with the Forum on areas where, on occasion due to concerns regarding avoidance, 
[normal]it has not been able to follow the full stages of the new approach.
