"&#xa0;\nPUB0011&#xa0;Written evidence from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Introduction &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. What are the risks and opportunities of opening up public services to alternative forms of ownership, provision and accountability? Factors that restrict the level of provider competition  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSpecific restrictions on competition created by commissioning and procurement practices&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFactors influencing the extent of consumer empowerment Potential breaches of competition law by public bodies when they engage in ‘economic activity’ &#xa0;\n8. How realistic is it that ‘choice’ can be exercised in public service provision or should be we looking instead at greater control by users so they can ensure that public services become more responsive to changing needs?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUsing intermediaries to help consumers make more effective choices \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Using ‘choice tools’ to help consumers make more effective choices \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9. What safeguards should be in place to deal with service providers who fail to deliver services, or who deliver services of an insufficient quality? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 1: Overview of the tools the OFT uses to achieve its goals &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n More information about the OFT’s mission and tools can be found in Annex 1 and here:\n \nhttp://www.oft.gov.uk/\n Office of Fair Trading Annual Plan 2013-2014.

Thus, a body – including a public body – may be an undertaking (and therefore subject to competition law) in respect of some of its activities, but not others.\n \n \nIt is also important to note that this 'functional' approach means that a public body may act as an undertaking – and therefore be subject to competition law – in respect of some of its activities, but not in respect of others\n OFT (2011) Empowering consumers of public services through choice tools.
