[normal]Durham Energy Institute (DEI) covers the spectrum of energy research but the areas in which we excel are those which lie at the boundaries between the traditional technical disciplines and the social sciences and humanities. We have expertise in the area of shale gas and oil and hydraulic fracturing.

[normal]The potential for shale gas exploration and commercial level extraction in Wales
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whether shale gas in Wales becomes a cottage industry, or is more widespread is difficult to predict and depends on several factors including the total organic content of the rocks, how thick they are, how they fracture, social factors and economics.  
[normal]2.2    
[normal]              
[normal]According
[normal] to Eden Energy 
[normal]webpages
[normal], the company RPS, estimated that the 
[normal]Namurian
[normal] (Carboniferous) shale has a 90% chance of representing a resource of 34 trillion cubic feet of gas, of which 12.8 TCF is classified as recoverable.  We have done no research to verify their estimation.  
[normal]2.3   
[normal]              
[normal]Wales is at a very early stage in shale gas exploitation - the exploration phase.  During this phase drilling activity is usually limited to a small number of exploration wells.  After this there will be a better understanding of whether the gas can be produced at economic rates and quantities. Resource estimates will change.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5  
[normal]              
[normal]Although we cannot know how much gas will eventually be produced one can consider scenarios, using assumptions based upon data from the USA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6   
[normal]              
[normal]If one assumes that the geology is in fact 
[normal]favorable
[normal] for shale gas production, then as a rule of thumb, a shale gas well will produce a fraction of the gas that a conventional gas well produces.  Using data from producing shale gas wells from 5 shale provinces in the USA, the ultimately recovery (EUR) from shale wells varies from 1.4 BCF (Billion Cubic Feet) to 5.9 BCF (
[normal]Baihly
[normal], J., et al., 2010). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7  
[normal]              
[normal]If we compare this to the recovery from producing gas wells in the UK’s Southern North Sea (SNS) where reservoirs are conventional, SNS wells produce on average 
[normal]8-114 BCF per well (
[normal]Gluyas
[normal] and Mathias in prep)
[normal].
[normal] Between 1.4 and 81 times more gas per well
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8   
[normal]              
[normal]If one ignores the very important factor of public consultation and social acceptance, then one can use the estimated volumes of gas that are ultimately recovery (EUR) from shale gas wells in several shale gas plays in the USA as a guide to the number of wells that would be needed in Wales. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9   
[normal]              
[normal]For
[normal] every 1 TCF of production, 169 and 714 wells would be required. So the Eden estimate 12.8 TCF of recoverable gas would require between 2138 and 9139 wells. This statistic hides the fact that much of the production comes from the first couple of years of life of the shale gas well. There is a rapid decline in production after that. Normally approximately 12 wells can be placed on a well pad. Therefore the number of well pads should is smaller than the number of wells.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10 
[normal]              
[normal]The 2138-9139 range is simply based upon the 12.8 TCF statistic issued by Eden Energy, as already stated it could be a small fraction of this because of opposition to drilling, unfavourable geology or unfavourable economics (e.g. high costs). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]              
[normal]The UK currently imports 1.8 TCF of gas per annum.  
[normal]Based upon the assumptions above, t
[normal]o totally eradicate this reliance on imports could require 
[normal]on average at least 
[normal]304 to 1285 wells to be drilled per year, year on year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is the current regulatory regime covering such shale gas and oil adequate?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1   
[normal]              
[normal]Just 2,152 hydrocarbon wells (exploration and production) that have been drilled onshore in the UK since 1902 and these targeted conventional reservoirs. This is dwarfed by The USA which has drilled several million (the exact number is unknown). A small proportion of the UK wells have been drilled in Wales (South Wales and the Cheshire Basin). We estimate that 1138 of the 2152 wells in the UK are what the American’s would term ‘orphaned’ – there is no clear ownership for the wells.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2  
[normal]              
[normal]If shale gas is widely exploited in the UK, mainly unhindered by 
[normal]economics
[normal] or social objections then the UK could drill more wells than we have in our last 111 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is very likely to be the biggest increase in drilling activity onshore since the 1940s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But the UK does not have a supply chain for widespread shale gas and oil development. The UK is at the exploration stage and if shale gas or oil drilling were to take place it would take several years before enough wells could be drilled to make any impact on our current reliance on imported gas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4  
[normal]              
[normal]In terms of environment damage such contamination of water supplies, our peer reviewed research indicates that 
[normal]fracking
[normal] itself is not a cause of contamination, but well leak can be.  Well leak can also lead to emissions of methane into the atmosphere.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our comprehensive global review of the literature on wells onshore and offshore shows that well leakage is an issue.  For example of 316,439 wells in Alberta, Canada, 1904 and 2004, 4.6% show evidence for leak (
[normal]Bachu
[normal] and Watson, 2009).  
[normal]Vignes
[normal] et al., (2008) reported a survey of 7 companies, 12 offshore facilities, 
[normal]406
[normal] wells which included producers and injectors offshore of Norway.  They did not include plugged and abandoned wells. 75 of the 406 wells had well integrity issues (18%).   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is unlikely that well leak is a significant issue in the UK, as it’s not commonly reported. But there is no easy way to find out how many, if any, of the existing onshore UK wells are leaking. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the potential well count in coming decades, we may need a better understanding of how wells that no longer have an 
[normal]owner,
[normal] would be dealt with in the future. Who will be 
[normal]responsible if a well leak occurs after the operator has moved on?  Who will carry out the routine monitoring?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our research suggests that many wells in the UK cannot be effectively monitored as they have been buried by subsequent land use, such as farming and housing developments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are examples of best practice on well monitoring in Pennsylvania where an online database on well infringements exists as well as some sort of investment which provides insurance for well repairs after the company has left or gone out of business. Before this monitoring started tens of thousands of wells were drilled and are not monitored.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To provide some context in terms of other industrial activity in the UK, there are 250,000 disused mine shafts in the 
[normal]UK,
[normal] the locations of many are unknown.  This is substantially higher than any estimate of the number of wells counts predicted for shale gas and oil production in the UK.
