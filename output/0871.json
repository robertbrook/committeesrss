"Written evidence from Accenture (LTC 90)&#xa0;Accenture welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Health Committee’s call for written\n evidence\n.\n \nWith a global H\nealth practice comprising over 15\n,00\n0 professionals, we work with 35\n Trusts in England, 23 of the 25 Health companies in the Fortune Global 500, and public, private and community health providers in \nin Brazil, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, US, Canada, Australia and Singapore. \n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;The scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectiveness&#xa0;The imperative for service transformation is clear&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Recommendations for enabling at scale delivery of integrated care&#xa0;5.1. \nPutting integration and health management at the top of the investment agenda&#xa0;\n5.2. \nIdentifying excellence in integrated care and enabling delivery at scale&#xa0;5.3. \nEnabling integration through technology&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nValencia, Spain: adapting existing care models to better manage chronic conditions and their impact on public health&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Current examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditions&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIllustrating the model: treating diabetes through integrated care&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Examples of effective service integration of different actors&#xa0;Cambridge University Hospital (CUH), UK – Right patient, right place, right time across the care continuum \n19.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe problem:\n \nCUH wanted to reduce the length of stay (LOS) of patients to improve the patient throughput and experience, and reduce cost.\n \nThis included\n prevent\ning\n unnecessary delays to the discharge of patients with on-going care needs. A key challenge to achieving this was insufficient collaboration between the Trust and adult social care providers. \n19.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe solution\n: Accenture worked with CUH on a wide range of measures but the two most relevant for the Committee are the introduction of \ncase management and the set-up of a \nsingle point of access to coordinate all discharge activities across several health and care providers.\n \n19.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe outcome\n: Implementation of this integrated care model reduced section 5 admissions by 3 days, led to LOS reduction of 1 day in surgery for patients with no on-going care needs and reduced outliers by 40%.\n \nOverall the benefit of case management led to reduction of 47,000 bed days over the course of one year, equating to around £5.5m of cost savings.\n \nThere were also significant improvements in patient experience, as well as in the satisfaction levels of healthcare staff.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLarge Cleveland-based research hospital system, US - \nCommunity-based patient navigators supporting chronically ill diabetes patients in the community 20.1\n \nThe problem:\n Research in the US found that \nunmanaged diabetes costs approximately 21% more than managed diabetes, in large part due to the higher levels of inpatient treatment. \n20.2\n \nThe solution:\n Accenture worked with the \nhospital \nto implement a Patient Navigation Program (PNP). The PNP used non-medical ‘lay’ staff in the community to help clinical staff to ensure chronically ill patients received continuous support \noutside\n the hospital setting. Patients were profiled and segmented and personalised interventions developed to target the particular needs of each group.\n20.3\n \nThe Outcome:\n Patients are more compliant with their care plans after enrolment in the program, contributing to a de\ncrease in no-show/cancellation. \nWhilst the annual cost to patients for unmanaged diabetes is $14,210, this was reduced to $11,744 after the introduction of the patient navigators. \nIntegration across different actors needs to be complemented with big data, analytics, technology and changing services&#xa0;\n22.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPredictive analytics: spotting the most at risk patients and treating them \nbefore\n episodes\n \nbecome acute;\n22.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCase management and integrated discharge: improving cross-agency collaboration, increasing patient throughput and experience, and reducing cost;\n22.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWellness management: Health coaching program\nmes\n engaging patients in positive motivation and behaviour modifications, and wellness screening and outreach campaigns; and\n22.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn-going education and monitoring: \nTelemonitoring\n and remote follow-up\n, for example\n using cutting edge TEKI technology\n,\n tailored to patients with long-term conditions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;May 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Health, \nWill we rise to the challenge of an ageing society?\n, 25\nth\n April 2013\n 3 million lives; Whole system demonstrator; Torbay (Kings Fund)\n \n NHS England, \nPutting Patients First: the NHS Business Plan for 2013/14-2015/16\n, April 2013\n Department of Health, Integrated Care Pilots, 12 March 2012 \n Reduction in unplanned, predictable visits due to exacerbation of chronic disease symptoms\n Reduced length of stay (elective and non-elective) for patients requiring post-acute lower levels of care across all specialities; Reduced length of stay for patients (elective and non-elective) with no post-acute on-going care needs\n October 2012-March 2013\n \nmeasured against October 2011-March 2012\n CUH calculates bed days at a cost of £125/day.\n \nUsing the Kings Fund figure of £250, the cost saving comes up to £12m annually.\n For further information on Patient Navigators see: http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/insight-patient-navigation-most-important-healthcare-job-summary.aspx\n For a short video detailing the innovative technology deployed in the Basque Country to connect clinicians and patients, including using patients’ televisions via TEKI technology, see \nhttp://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/success-basque-country-managing-increased-chronicity.aspx\n"
