defaultDo you think sentence length is a valid proxy for deciding which prisoners get the right to vote?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is the best proxy for offence seriousness, and is preferable to a scheme which excludes certain prisoners, i

defaulte
default.,
default those convicted of personal injury offences. Yet sentence length is still a poor tool to distinguish between prisoners in order to determine who should be disenfranchised. There is no point on the dimension of sentence length which provides a cut
default-
defaultoff which is anything but arbitrary. The few correctional regimes that use sentence length – such as Canada – did so drawing upon an important
default division of jurisdiction. Thus in Canada, federal prisoners – those serving two years or longer were disenfranchised, while provincial prisoners retained the vote. The federal provincial correctional bifurcation in jurisdiction split in Canada was important but has no 
defaultequivalent 
defaultcounterpart in England and Wales. (In addition the disenfranchisement of federal prisoners 
defaultin Canada 
defaultwas ultimately struck down on constitutional grounds
default in R. v. Sauve)
default. The closest alternative 
defaultin England 
defaultwould be the Magistrate/ Crown court division but using this as the division would 
defaultin our view 
defaultbe overbroad: federal prisoners in Canada represented only 
defaultapproximately 
default3% of the 
defaulttotal Canadian 
defaultprison population; prisoners sentenced from the Crown Court represent a 
defaultsignificantly
default higher percentage of the total prisoner population.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOur preferred approach would involve 
defaulttwo 
defaultsteps:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat, if anything, is the 
defaultsignificance of four
default years and/or six months in the sentencing of criminals? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs noted, there is no significance; both are arbitrary thresholds.
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf you were to draw a line between serious and non-serious offences using sentence length, where would it be?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would not draw the line, but one possibility would be to disenfranchise anyone sentenced to life imprisonment
default on the grounds that they have committed a crime of such seriousness that the most severe penalty was warranted
default.
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCan you think of an example where the sentence length approach could lead to an anomalous result? (For example, electoral fraud may result in a short sentence.)
defaultMany cases heard at the Crown Court involve several counts, some relating to the same incident, some relating to completely separate incidents. If a threshold relating to sentence length is applied clear rules will be needed about the way in which total sentence is calculated. Clearly it would be anomalous to sum concurrent sentences, but 
defaultmore 
defaultrational to do so for consecutive ones
default.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt has been suggested by Liberty that the disenfranchisement of prisoners disproportionately impacts on ethnic minority communities. Is this correct?
defaultAny groups that are less likely than others to secure sentencing discounts – eg for early guilty pleas or for expressing remorse will – other things being equal – be more likely to be disenfranchised. There is evidence that BME groups are 
defaultless likelydefault to enter early guilty pleas.
default&#xa0;
defaultPeople nearing the end of their criminal careers – aiming to find a route out of crime – may by virtue of their long record actually be sentenced more heavily than those who are not trying to stop. This group may be over-represented.

defaultAccording to a note from the House of Commons Library,
default 
defaultapproximately a quarter of those sentenced to less than four years have been convicted of a violent or sexual offence.
default&#xa0;
default Under what circumstances would someone convicted of these types of offences be sentenced to less than four years?
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultAs noted, we are of the view that 
defaultall 
defaultcategory-based exclusions are unwise. Why would you want to disenfranchise someone convicted of a crime of violence against a single individual 
defaultbut
default not someone who has deprived dozens of elderly victims of their life savings 
defaultyet
default who is convicted of a property crime? Crime seriousness is a better yardstick
default than offence category
default, but as we noted, there is no non-arbitrary cut
default-
defaultoff. 
defaultBut to address the question directly, many offenders convicted of a crime of violence would be sentenced to much less than 4 years. For example, the guideline range for common assault carries a ceiling of 26 weeks.
default Section 47 assaults are divided in the 
defaultdefinitive sentencing 
defaultguideline into 3 categories of seriousness, each with its own sentence range. The sentence range for the most serious category (1) is from 1-3 years.
default The guidelines for less serious sexual assault involving an adult victim has starting points that span the custody threshold.

defaultWhat proportion of convictions results in a custodial sentence?
default&#xa0;
default 
default8% (98,047) of all offenders sentenced in 2012  (n = 1,229,827) get a custodial sen
defaulttence
default. This includes motoring and summary offences.

defaultOf the, 1

default19,754 offenders out of the 1,160,776 offenders found guilty at magistrates courts are committed for sentence. (not quite 2%)

defaultFor what sort of crimes are people likely to get a sentence of more than four years?
default(Assuming a not guilty plea): the most serious of domestic burglaries; street robbery involving a weapon); rape and serious sexual offences; GBH with intent; drug trafficking; homicides. 
defaultPeople with previous convictions
default 
defaultare more likely to get longer sentences, other things being equal
default.
default 
defaultOr for under six months?
default 
defaultAs above
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCan you give examples of criminal offences which fall on the threshold – e.g. for which sentences of, say, anything from three to six years, might be given? (i.e. a situation in which two people convicted of the same offence may get different sentences such that one is disenfranchised and the other is not)
defaultThe range
default of sentences for apparently sim
defaultilar offences is wide. An early guilty plea will earn a 33% discount. 
defaultGenuine 
defaultremorse will get an additional reduction
default. Aggravating factors can make a large difference: 
defaultprevious conv
defaulti
defaultctions; 
defaultyoung or elderly victims; premeditation
default etc. In aggregate, these aggravating and mitigating factors can play as large a part in determining sentence as the charge.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWould considering disenfranchisement in terms of type of offence be more appropriate than focusing on length of sentence?
default&#xa0;
defaultNo – for the reasons noted.
default (with the exception of offences relating to election fraud and similar), 
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCan you provide a snapshot of the number of people in prison at the last general election who would have been eligible to vote if either of the re-enfranchising options in the draft Bill had been enacted?
defaultThe prison population is just under 84,000. 
defaultAround 65,000 are se
defaultntenced prisoners, and 
defaultour guess is that 
defaultaround 4
default5,000
default are sentenced prisoners who would normally be 
default entitled to vote. The paper produced by the House of Commons Library on 
default28 June
default 2013 
default“Prison Population Statistics” present
defaults
default MoJ estimates that in June 2012
default:
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default26,683 prisoners who would otherwise be entitled to vote were serving sentences to four years or less. Of these 7,059 were serving sentences for violence against the person or sexual offences.  
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default4,043 prisoners 
defaultwho would otherwise be entitled to vote were serving 
defaultsentence
defaults of 
defaultsix months or less
default. 
defaultOf these 1,035 were serving sentences for violence against the person or sexual offences. 
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDo you think it would be feasible to link the right to vote to rehabilitation?  For example, providing prisoners with an opportunity to be educated in civic responsibility and, as part of this, allowing them to apply to be enfranchised? 
default&#xa0;
defaultEnfranchisement c
defaultould 
defaultcertain
defaultly be of value in supporting offenders’ 
defaultreintegration. 
defaultBut we cannot say whether a 
defaultscheme 
defaultof this sort would be practical. Those who might feel strongly about being disenfranchised may not regard such a scheme as having any legitimacy. 
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf disenfranchised prisoners were given the option of applying to be re-enfranchised, how would this work in practice?
default 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow easily could sentencing guidelines incorporate an ancillary penalty of disenfranchisement on an individual basis? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our view relatively easily, although this is a question for the Sentencing Council to answer
default.
