defaultWritten evidence submitted by Terry James [OLS0050]default&#xa0;defaultHaving been brought up in a Christian household and taught Christian values and principals as set out in the Holy Bible from a child, it is of great concern to me that there is not more protection for young people today from the extremely harmful effects o
defaultf 
defaultonline pornography.
defaultIt is equalling distressing to hear of the 
defaultongoing abuse of children being used to create pornographic images.
defaultIt is the parentâ€™s responsibility to protect their children from any type of danger be it physical or moral but is also the
default responsibility of the government to use its powers to take steps to enforce this 
defaultprotection
default.
defaultIf a child by any means has gained access to unsuitable material then 
defaultthat is a 
defaultsad 
defaultfailure on the part of the parents, the government and the internet providers.
default 
defaultIf everybody 
defaultshoulders 
defaulttheir bit of responsibility our children can be protected and must be protected. 
defaultAs for the ongoing use of the internet for child abuse and pornography, this is an evil that cannot be tolerated. 
defaultThe government has powers 
defaultit can us
defaulte to fight this terrible activity. Action must be taken to protect these innocent children from exploitation.
