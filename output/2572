[normal]Written evidence submitted by Terry James [OLS0050][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Having been brought up in a Christian household and taught Christian values and principals as set out in the Holy Bible from a child, it is of great concern to me that there is not more protection for young people today from the extremely harmful effects o
[normal]f 
[normal]online pornography.
[normal]It is equalling distressing to hear of the 
[normal]ongoing abuse of children being used to create pornographic images.
[normal]It is the parentâ€™s responsibility to protect their children from any type of danger be it physical or moral but is also the
[normal] responsibility of the government to use its powers to take steps to enforce this 
[normal]protection
[normal].
[normal]If a child by any means has gained access to unsuitable material then 
[normal]that is a 
[normal]sad 
[normal]failure on the part of the parents, the government and the internet providers.
[normal] 
[normal]If everybody 
[normal]shoulders 
[normal]their bit of responsibility our children can be protected and must be protected. 
[normal]As for the ongoing use of the internet for child abuse and pornography, this is an evil that cannot be tolerated. 
[normal]The government has powers 
[normal]it can us
[normal]e to fight this terrible activity. Action must be taken to protect these innocent children from exploitation.
