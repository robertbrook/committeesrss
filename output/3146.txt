[[[Dan Bailey]]]&#xa0;I fully support the land reform agenda set out in briefing paper 432:50. &#xa0;In my view comprehensive and radical reform of land ownership in Scotland is long overdue, and would revitalise local economies, boost small scale enterprise and give democracy itself a badly needed shot in the arm. &#xa0;Measures really must be taken to break up the big estates that act as a wealth sink and a drag on social, environmental and economic progress. These should include: &#xa0;&#xa0;Whatever the constitutional settlement next year, we must make Scotland a hostile environment for money laundering, tax dodging, inherited wealth and entrenched privilege - and thereby a far more positive and forward-looking place for the rest of us.&#xa0;October 2013
