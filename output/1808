[normal]Written evidence submitted[bold] by the British Geological Survey[bold] [bold]Background to the British Geological Survey[bold]The British Geological Survey is a part of the 
[normal]Natural Environment Research Council (
[normal]NERC
[normal]) and is its principal supplier of national capability in geoscience.
[normal] 
[normal]It advances understanding of the structure, 
[normal]properties
[normal] and processes of the solid Earth system through interdisciplinary surveys, monitoring and research for the benefit of society. 
[normal]The BGS
[normal] is the UK's premier provider of objective and authoritative geoscientific data, information and knowledge for 
[normal]wealth creation, sustainable use of natural resources, reducing risk and living with the impacts of environmental change. 
[normal]We are a world-leading geoscience centre for:
[normal]MineralsUK
[normal] is the 
[normal]British Geological Survey (BGS)
[normal] Centre for Sustainable Mineral Development. Facilitated by the BGS Minerals and Waste science programme, the Centre is a 
[normal]global leader in the compilation, provision and analysis of mineral statistics and the major UK national provider of spatial and statistical minerals information. We also carry out research in areas directly relevant to our user community, such as metallog
[normal]enesis, land-use impacts of mineral extraction and geomaterials.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Questions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The BGS publishes an annual compilation of statistics related to UK mineral production in the form 
[normal]of the UK Minerals Yearbook. (
[normal]http://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=2876
[normal]). The following are extracts from the latest version of the 
[normal]Y
[normal]earbook
[normal] which give a good indication of the contrib
[normal]ution of the minerals sector to the UK economy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Note that the value of energy minerals (oil, gas and coal) dominates overall production. These data have been removed from the second pie chart to reveal the value of all non-energy minerals produced from the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The table above gives some
[normal] context to the earlier value data by showing the volume of minerals produced in the UK. Note the very large tonnages of construction aggregate 
[normal](igneous rock, limestone and dolomite, sand and gravel) and the very small volume of metals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BGS have no data on UK citizens employed overseas
[normal].

[normal]4.  Has the boom in London-l[bold]isted extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are not in a position to provide a comment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. What are the corporate governance concerns rais[bold]ed by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are not in a position to provide a comment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Is there sufficient [bold]engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]At the national level the UK Minerals Forum facilitates regular and structured dialogue between i
[normal]ndustry, regulators, policy makers and NGOs. UKMF is 
[normal]valuable
[normal] in debating contentious topics and identifying key issues relating to sustainable development of UK mineral resources. For example, the UKMF is currently undertaking a forty year horizon scan on
[normal] the future of UK mineral extraction. The BGS is a founder member of the UKMF.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Outside of the UKMF our experience is that the larger NGOs do have an understanding of minerals related issues. However, across the sector many 
[normal]other 
[normal]groups find the technical aspects of mineral development challenging. The BGS has an important role to play in helping NGOs and the wider community understand the economic, social and environmental issues related to mineral development. For example, see ou
[normal]r Mineral Planning 
[normal]Factsheets
[normal] (
[normal]link below
[normal]) which are designed to inform debate and decision
[normal]-
[normal]making around planning for domestic mineral supply.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the [bold]UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A large part of the UK domestic mining and quarrying industry is owned and operated by relatively few large multinational companies, the majority of which are foreign-owned. A high percentage of total outp
[normal]ut of construction aggregates in the UK 
[normal]is
[normal] from quarries operated by 
[normal]four companies
[normal]. These companies are all vertically integrated and include 
[normal]cement manufacturing 
[normal]in the UK or Europe. The indigenous silica sand and ball clay/ kaolin industries are also do
[normal]minated by just two large, foreign owned companies. Ownership of the coal industry across the UK is more diverse. 
[normal]The
[normal] consolidation of mining and quarrying companies
[normal] is partly
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] response to competition for land use. The commercial risk involved in 
[normal]setting
[normal] aside time and financial resources 
[normal]needed to obtain a licence to operate 
[normal](planning permission and environmental permits) 
[normal]in the UK is relatively high by both world and European standards. The response of the market to this risk has been for companies to r
[normal]eplenish reserves by acquisition (in order to access additional permitted sites or to deny them to rivals) and by vertical integration (for cement companies to secure supplies of vital aggregate raw materials). The result is a relatively small group of lar
[normal]ge companies who have sufficient investment capability to meet permitting costs and maintain a portfolio of different supply options. 
[normal]This situation may present
[normal] 
[normal]a barrier
[normal] to entry for smaller local operators
[normal]. It may also encourage 
[normal]consolidation of producti
[normal]on at fewer, larger quarries where 
[normal]larger
[normal] companies can take advantage of economies of scale
[normal], as well as
[normal] the ‘trading’ of sites with permitted reserves between companies
[normal] and the
[normal] giving up of dormant sites in scenic areas such as National Parks in exchange 
[normal]for a licence to operate elsewhere.
