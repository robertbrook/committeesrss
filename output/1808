defaultWritten evidence submitteddefault by the British Geological Surveydefault defaultBackground to the British Geological SurveydefaultThe British Geological Survey is a part of the 
defaultNatural Environment Research Council (
defaultNERC
default) and is its principal supplier of national capability in geoscience.
default 
defaultIt advances understanding of the structure, 
defaultproperties
default and processes of the solid Earth system through interdisciplinary surveys, monitoring and research for the benefit of society. 
defaultThe BGS
default is the UK's premier provider of objective and authoritative geoscientific data, information and knowledge for 
defaultwealth creation, sustainable use of natural resources, reducing risk and living with the impacts of environmental change. 
defaultWe are a world-leading geoscience centre for:
defaultMineralsUK
default is the 
defaultBritish Geological Survey (BGS)
default Centre for Sustainable Mineral Development. Facilitated by the BGS Minerals and Waste science programme, the Centre is a 
defaultglobal leader in the compilation, provision and analysis of mineral statistics and the major UK national provider of spatial and statistical minerals information. We also carry out research in areas directly relevant to our user community, such as metallog
defaultenesis, land-use impacts of mineral extraction and geomaterials.

defaultQuestionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe BGS publishes an annual compilation of statistics related to UK mineral production in the form 
defaultof the UK Minerals Yearbook. (
defaulthttp://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=2876
default). The following are extracts from the latest version of the 
defaultY
defaultearbook
default which give a good indication of the contrib
defaultution of the minerals sector to the UK economy
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultNote that the value of energy minerals (oil, gas and coal) dominates overall production. These data have been removed from the second pie chart to reveal the value of all non-energy minerals produced from the UK.

defaultThe table above gives some
default context to the earlier value data by showing the volume of minerals produced in the UK. Note the very large tonnages of construction aggregate 
default(igneous rock, limestone and dolomite, sand and gravel) and the very small volume of metals.

default5. What are the corporate governance concerns raisdefaulted by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6. Is there sufficient defaultengagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?default&#xa0;
defaultAt the national level the UK Minerals Forum facilitates regular and structured dialogue between i
defaultndustry, regulators, policy makers and NGOs. UKMF is 
defaultvaluable
default in debating contentious topics and identifying key issues relating to sustainable development of UK mineral resources. For example, the UKMF is currently undertaking a forty year horizon scan on
default the future of UK mineral extraction. The BGS is a founder member of the UKMF.
default&#xa0;
defaultOutside of the UKMF our experience is that the larger NGOs do have an understanding of minerals related issues. However, across the sector many 
defaultother 
defaultgroups find the technical aspects of mineral development challenging. The BGS has an important role to play in helping NGOs and the wider community understand the economic, social and environmental issues related to mineral development. For example, see ou

defaultFactsheets
default (

default) which are designed to inform debate and decision
default-
defaultmaking around planning for domestic mineral supply.

default10. What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the defaultUK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?default&#xa0;
defaultA large part of the UK domestic mining and quarrying industry is owned and operated by relatively few large multinational companies, the majority of which are foreign-owned. A high percentage of total outp
defaultut of construction aggregates in the UK 
defaultis
default from quarries operated by 
defaultfour companies
default. These companies are all vertically integrated and include 
defaultcement manufacturing 
defaultin the UK or Europe. The indigenous silica sand and ball clay/ kaolin industries are also do
defaultminated by just two large, foreign owned companies. Ownership of the coal industry across the UK is more diverse. 
defaultThe
default consolidation of mining and quarrying companies
default is partly
default 
defaultin
default response to competition for land use. The commercial risk involved in 
defaultsetting
default aside time and financial resources 
defaultneeded to obtain a licence to operate 
default(planning permission and environmental permits) 
defaultin the UK is relatively high by both world and European standards. The response of the market to this risk has been for companies to r
defaulteplenish reserves by acquisition (in order to access additional permitted sites or to deny them to rivals) and by vertical integration (for cement companies to secure supplies of vital aggregate raw materials). The result is a relatively small group of lar
defaultge companies who have sufficient investment capability to meet permitting costs and maintain a portfolio of different supply options. 
defaultThis situation may present
default 
defaulta barrier
default to entry for smaller local operators
default. It may also encourage 
defaultconsolidation of producti
defaulton at fewer, larger quarries where 
defaultlarger
default companies can take advantage of economies of scale
default, as well as
default the ‘trading’ of sites with permitted reserves between companies
default and the
default giving up of dormant sites in scenic areas such as National Parks in exchange 
defaultfor a licence to operate elsewhere.
