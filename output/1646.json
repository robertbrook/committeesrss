Our participation in the scheme is regularly advertised to staff members to assist in providing suitable lev\nels of funding for their clients. All guarantees were provided at 75% of the approved funding. The guarantees are provided subject to portfolio caps. The cap is agreed between the lending institution and EFG and is based upon the level of new business writ\nten annually. Aggregate amount of guarantees available to First Trust Bank customers is limited to 15% of the first £1,000,000 of new business and 9.25% of any further new business.   \n&#xa0;\nApplications for funding are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with \ne\nligibility determined by the EFG eligibility criteria. Parameters for EFG are borrowings between £25,001 and £1,000,000. Availability of the funding supported by EFG is accordingly restricted by these amounts and the operation of portfolio caps\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRetail Mortgages&#xa0;\na.  \nCurrent\n Government Initiatives\n:\n&#xa0;\n-  \nHelp to Buy: mortgage guarantee (1 January 2014 – 31 December 2016)\nThis Scheme is \nnot\n yet finalised.
