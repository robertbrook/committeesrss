default              
defaultLocal Government Scrutiny has an integral role in the accountability framework for many services, including health and social care. The work of the Scrutiny Committees is based on the evidence
default&#xa0;
defaultand since the introduction of local government scrutiny and health scrutiny, Scrutiny Committees have built up a body of knowledge and expertise. The information provided in this memorandum is based
default&#xa0;
defaulton the work of Local Government Scrutiny across 10 West Midlands Local Authorities and will hopefully be of interest and use to the Health Select Committee in its inquiry on Public Expenditure on Health and Social Care.
default&#xa0;
default2.0default              defaultThe West Midlands Scrutiny Networkdefault2.1
default              
defaultThe West Midlands Scrutiny Network is an informal network open to all local authorities across the West Midlands. The Network aims to:
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTo share experiences and knowledge and to work with other members to develop ideas and good practice which can support and strengthen overview and scrutiny in the region.
default
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTo provide support and networking opportunities for Councillors and officers who are members of the West Midlands Network
default
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTo represent the views of West Midlands local authorities' overview and scrutiny members at regional and national events.
default2.2
default              
defaultTo gather information on the work undertaken by Scrutiny Committees across the region relevant to this Inquiry a questionnaire was sent to all Members of the West Midlands Scrutiny Network and the West Midlands Regional Health Scrutiny Forum. A copy of the questionnaire is provided as Appendix 1. This memorandum is not a formal response from Scrutiny in all West Midlands Authorities, rather it provides evidence of work undertaken by Scrutiny in the following authorities that is relevant to the Health Select Committee Inquiry:

default4.0 default              defaultLong Term Viability of NHS and FT Trustsdefault4.1
default              
defaultThe issue that provided the second largest number of responses related to the work of Scrutiny on the long term viability of NHS and FT Trusts. Seven Authorities provided evidence in response to this question. The West Midlands is a particularly interesting area to consider as there are two acute trusts that have been recognised as unsustainable.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Mid Staffordshire FT Trust which has been reviewed by the Trust Special Administrators
default and the George Eliot NHS Trust that has announced that it will go out to tender for a partner. In both these areas Scrutiny has a key role. The evidence below provides information on the work by Scrutiny on these authorities and other areas:

default              
defaultTelford and Wrekin Borough Council Scrutiny
defaultThe Joint Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee with Shropshire had received reports regarding concerns at both hospital sites at Shrewsbury and Telford which had resulted in a Risk Summit being convened by the NHS England Area Team. While the Chairs of the Joint HOSC were informed that the immediate quality issues were being addressed, the Committee still had concerns about the long term viability of the services across the two hospital sites. The Joint HOSC Chairs recognised that the issues faced by the acute Trust were symptoms of the issues within the whole local health and social care system. Following discussions with all key stakeholders within the NHS and Local Authorities, including the Health and Wellbeing Board Chairs and the Local Area Team, the Joint HOSC held a meeting and asked the local NHS commissioners, providers and NHS England Area Team to set out what are the key issues for the local health economy and how the different organisations would work together to resolve these. The Joint HOSC was pleased with the joined up response from the local NHS and will continue to monitor the CCGs’ Commissioning Plans that will follow from the Call to Action consultation and the 
defaultdevelopment of the Excellent and Sustainable Clinical Services Strategy which will consider the future provision of acute and community hospital services.

default4.6
default              
defaultIn 2011 GEH was not considered sustainable in the long-term and
default&#xa0;
defaultwas not able to apply for Foundation Trust Status without a strategic partner.
default&#xa0;
default The GEH Board produced a strategic outline case setting the context and providing an overview of the hospital – its size, patient profile, the people it serves and wider partner agencies and reported on early work that had been undertaken to further define and assess options for the best model / approach to a strategic partnership that would provide the sustainability required to both apply for FT status and build on into the future.
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default              
defaultThis work was interrupted
default&#xa0;
defaultby the Robert Francis Inquiry into Mid Staffs and the subsequent recommendations to come from that Inquiry.
default&#xa0;
default This led to the Keogh Review and the GEH was identified as one of the 14 Keogh Review Hospitals due to the high mortality rates at the hospital.
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default              
defaultGEH has been placed in ‘special measures’ while plans to improve the quality of care were taken forward.
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default              
defaultGEH has published its Improvement Plan and the actions to address the Keogh recommendations have been agreed by the Trust Board.
default&#xa0;
default4.10
default              
defaultGEH has been partnered with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust with a view to supporting the work it is doing to deliver the Keogh Review recommendations.
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default              
default&#xa0;
defaultGEH had also received the go-ahead from government to go out to tender for a partner, and for the first time ever, it is a tender for the whole hospital rather than for a service within the hospital and it is open to public and private organisations.
default&#xa0;
default4.12
default              
defaultAll of the above issues are being monitored by the
default&#xa0;
defaultAdult Social Care and Health OSC on an on going basis, as well as more defined quality performance scrutiny
default 
defaultaround areas such as mortality, pressure ulcers etc (as identified by the Quality Accounts Task and Finish Group).
default&#xa0;
default4.13
default              
defaultThe long-term sustainability issues being faced by GEH are not unique to this hospital, and will possibly face most small general hospitals.
default&#xa0;
default5.0 default              defaultNHS Efficiencies and Cutsdefault5.1
default              
defaultEvidence provided by Local Government Scrutiny across the West Midlands regarding the efficiencies or cuts made by the NHS illustrated the depth of the work undertaken by Scrutiny Committees and the complexity of the organisations and services involved. The responses showed that the evidence received by Scrutiny related to both service and organisational reconfiguration. Some service reconfigurations were clinically driven e.g. the review of stroke services identified by scrutiny in Telford and Wrekin, while scrutiny in Solihull identified the oversight role of the Scrutiny Committee in the Heart of England FT 
defaultTransformation Programme. Scrutiny at Rugby Borough Council had received detailed evidence regarding the development of the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust’s Integrated Business Plan which included information about QIPP savings.
default5.2 
default              
defaultTelford &amp; Wrekin Council Scrutiny
defaultThe Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee carried out a detailed review of Continuing Health Care (CHC). The Committee received evidence from the Local Authority  that there has been a 73% cut in the PCT spend on CHC from £13.9 million in 2009/10 to £3.8 million in 2011/12. The total reduction in CHC over this period of £10.1million has resulted in an additional burden on the Council’s Adult Care budget of £8.5 million, with the balance falling on people who self fund.The PCT / CCG has made one off contributions to the Local Authority to offset an element of these costs. The Scrutiny Committee has made recommendations to the CCG and Health and Wellbeing Board which address the underlying issues regarding the level of CHC funding. 
default&#xa0;
default6.0default              defaultIntegration of Health and Social Caredefault6.1
default              
defaultSeveral responses provided examples of the evidence considered by Local Government Scrutiny on the integration of health and social care services. The examples provided were:
default
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultStaffordshire Adult Social Services integrated into the Stoke-on-Trent
default&#xa0;

default7.1
default              
defaultScrutiny in five local authorities responded that Committees had received evidence on the impact on the provision of adult social care following the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary savings. Examples of the issues considered by the Committees are:
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFairer charging and eligibility criteria
default
default&#xa0;

default
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe funding for Adult Social Care must be seen in the context of the overall reduction in funding for local government and that efficiency savings in the NHS can result in additional costs for the local authority

defaultTelford and Wrekin Council Scrutiny
defaultThe Budget and Finance Scrutiny Committee in Telford and Wrekin has monitored the financial pressures on the Adult Care budget following the 2010 Spending Review. In addition to this, as part of the Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee’s review of Continuing Health Care members received evidence that the average reduction in funding for Local Government was initially 27%, but following later announcements this increased to 33%.   A detailed report will be considered by the Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee and members of the Budget and Finance Scrutiny Committee on the 4
defaultth
default November 2013.This sets out the pressures on the Council’s Adult Care budget which accounts for 36% of the Council’s spend and over 80% of this is spent directly on providing care. The Adult Social Care budget has been reduced by £7million which has been achieved through efficiencies, new ways of working and staff reductions.  The Adult Care budget is expected to find a further £6.5 million to achieve the savings required by 2015/16 while there continues to be an underlying growth in the number of people needing services compared with the number of people leaving the service. The Scrutiny Committee will consider the financial improvement plan put in place to manage the Adult Care Services budget.
