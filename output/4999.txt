[[[Sir Alan Haselhurst MP, ]]]

[[[Chair of the Administration Committee]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Thank you for your letter dated 16 December regarding your Committee's inquiry into the impact of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 and how it may affect the work of select committees in the year before the general election.As you will be aware, the Administration Committee does not scrutinise legislation or Government policy. Our remit is to examine the services provided by and for Members and visitors to Parliament by the House of Commons. The Committee's programme of work is therefore less affected by the clear timetabling of the next general election than other departmental select committees who may undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.However, certainty about the date of the next general election is very welcome in terms of timetabling the Committee's business and helping the House prepare effectively for dissolution and ensure suitable new induction arrangements for new Members in 2015. The Committee examined this matter in some detail in its recent report, First Weeks at Westminster: induction arrangements for new Members in 2015, which you may be interested to consult.
