&#xa0;Written evidence from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) (HCS0015)The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) welcome the opportunity to submit our views as part of TRANSCOM’s inquiry into the Government’s maritime policy strategy.The RMT organises around 7,000 offshore workers, including drilling, engineering/maintenance, diver, and catering grades, and all of these workers require helicopter transport to and from installations on the UK Continental Shelf at the start and end of their 2 or 3 week long tours.

[[[Key Points]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1               The offshore unions, RMT, Nautilus, Unite, Balpa and GMB are calling for a public inquiry into the safety off helicopter transport in the offshore industry which would cover: &#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 1980 there have been nine fatal accidents involving helicopters operating in the offshore oil and gas industry, claiming the lives of 114 offshore workers and helicopter crew. There were 44 reportable non-fatal helicopter incidents in the offshore sector over this period.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is 25 years since the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea and 23 years since the publication of the Cullen Report which was a watershed moment for operational safety in the offshore oil and gas industry. Key amongst Cullen’s 106 recommendations (all of which were accepted by the Government of the day and industry) was to institute a safety culture of ‘continuous improvement’ in the offshore industry. We believe that this culture of continuous improvement is critical to improving the safety record of offshore helicopter operations. &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The cost of such an inquiry would not be prohibitive, given the scale of the industry’s annual contribution to national tax revenue (£10.6 billion in 2011-12). For example, the House of Commons Library recently estimated that the full cost of the Cullen Inquiry in today’s prices would be £5.7m. &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the wake of the Clutha bar tragedy in Glasgow on 29th November this year, RMT also accept that there is a serious case for a full public inquiry into all aspects of helicopter transport covering operations beyond the offshore sector, including police, air ambulance and air-sea rescue.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is notable that the model of helicopter, EC 135, involved in the Clutha Vaults incident is a Eurocopter manufactured machine. The models of helicopter that transport the vast majority of offshore workers, the EC225 Super Puma and AS332 L, L1 and L2 are all Eurocopter models.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The five incidents, two of them fatal, involving helicopters in the North Sea since February 2009 should press the Government into concerted and effective action to improve the safety record of helicopter operators and their operations in the UK Continental Shelf. Yet the current approach is purely reactive, in terms of the Air Accident Investigation Branch and Civil Aviation Authority reports, as demonstrated in response to the fatal accident involving a Eurocopter AS332 L2 on 23rd August this year which claimed the lives of four offshore workers. &#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; RMT is concerned at the variation in practice that exists amongst helicopter companies operating in the North Sea and the potential consequences of this in terms of the safety of offshore oil and gas workers. For example, Bristow Helicopters operate to a "gold standard", essentially the set of standards applied in the Norwegian sector which are widely acknowledged as more robust than those in place for the UK sector. &#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If the “gold standard” in inspection, operating procedures, training and maintenance in operation at Bristow and in the Norwegian sector had been in place in the UK sector, we believe that four out of the five incidents since February 2009 potentially could have been avoided, including the fatal incidents on 1st April 2009 and 23rd August 2013 which claimed a total of 20 lives. &#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Variations between minimum and “gold” standards amongst offshore helicopter operators are a source of concern in the specific areas of pilot training and operating procedures. Bond and CHC, for example, only train their pilots to the minimum standard and industry sources tell RMT that this is because the companies are under no statutory obligation to achieve higher standards in this and other areas, so this extra cost is avoided. In our view, Norwegian standards should be adopted across the industry and this standardisation should be set in law.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Historically, helicopter transport in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was not as safe as that provided for their offshore colleagues in the UK. Between 1966 and 1989 the fatality rate was 4.1 for the Norwegian sector and 3.7 for the UK sector per million person flight hours. This difference continued over the 1990s with a fatality rate of 1.6 in the UK compared to 2.3 in the Norwegian sector between 1990 and 1998. &#xa0;2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the decade between 1999 and 2009, however, there were no fatal accidents in the Norwegian sector (a nil rate) whilst the UK’s fatality rate shot up to 5.6 – a deeply worrying reversal of the historic, downward trend across the North Sea. Furthermore, 11 out of the 12 helicopter accidents in the North Sea between 2001 and 2009 were in the UK sector.&#xa0;2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Norwegian sector has a different inspection regime and different regulations applying to helicopters and helicopter flights in the North Sea. All of these have been introduced over the last 12 years or so and explain the marked improvement in the safety record. &#xa0;2.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; RMT welcome the Civil Aviation Authority’s announcement on 24th September of the review of helicopter operations in the North Sea. We note that this will involve work with the head of helicopter operations at the Norwegian CAA (as well as officials from the European Aviation Safety Agency), comparing the record of helicopter operations in the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. We await with interest the publication of the CAA’s recommendations in early 2014.&#xa0;2.10 RMT also support the introduction of a system of guaranteed access to seats for trade union officials on helicopters travelling to and from offshore installations. Not only would this remove a significant barrier to improving the health and safety culture offshore, it would also provide offshore workers with greater awareness of their workplace rights, as well as benefiting the performance of helicopter operations in the North Sea which is in the interests of all concerned. &#xa0;2.11 Following the fatal incident on 23rd August, the RMT met with industry representatives to discuss a number of issues, including regular trade union access to offshore workers at heliports and on installations with some positive progress being made. Some subsequent progress has been made in terms of access to the workforce at but progress on trade union access to offshore workers in their place of work (i.e. on installations in the North Sea) has slowed. RMT support amendment to the existing law, if necessary, to ensure that offshore workers have regular access to their trade union representatives when they are working on installations which can be for periods of up to three weeks at a time.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The role and effectiveness of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is at risk from two recent developments. Firstly, we believe that proposals to extend the regulatory remit of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to cover helicopter operations in the UK continental shelf will dangerously undermine the responsiveness and local knowledge of the UK offshore sector that the CAA has built up over a number of years. RMT argue that member states with extensive helicopter operations central to the transport of workers in an industry should retain the powers to regulate that sector. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Secondly, the Coalition Government’s decision to cut 120 posts at the CAA is a serious threat to effective enforcement of the regulatory framework and, therefore, increases the risk to offshore workers obliged to use helicopter transport because transport by sea takes too long. &#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is not to say, however, that there are no complaints about or concerns over the CAA’s regulatory performance. For example, the CAA’s response to the fatal incident off the coast of Shetland on 23rd August was not widely regarded as sufficiently strong to prevent a further decline in confidence of offshore workers in this mode of transport or the Super Puma models.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also worrying that the CAA have only limited powers of enforcement on helicopters operating within the UK, but registered elsewhere. Clarity needs to be established in this area and we would prefer those regulatory standards to be brought up to a high level, rather than down to a lower level which is a potential consequence of EASA’s regulatory power grab.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In our view, the Government should take its cue from the Helicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG) on which the offshore trade unions, Health and Safety Executive, CAA, oil and gas industry representatives and helicopter operators sit, before taking any decisions that affect the regulations applying to helicopter operators in the offshore sector.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Furthermore, in order to regain the confidence of the offshore workforce in helicopter transport, any decisions that the Government makes on the future regulatory framework applied to offshore helicopter operations should be consulted on with workers and their trade union representatives, at the very least.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1               We are also concerned at the reliability of the Department for Transport’s statistics on the offshore helicopter fleet, including the range of helicopter models used to transport offshore workers. Our concern has been caused by a recent written answer to a question from Grahame Morris MP requesting information on the composition of the offshore helicopter fleet. Incredibly, the Super Puma EC225 and AS332 L1 models were not included in the Government’s answer.&#xa0;4.2 Super Puma models AS332 L, L1, L2 and EC225 account for 60% of the helicopter fleet currently transporting the vast majority of the 30,000 strong workforce employed in the UK offshore oil and gas industry. That is 45 out of a fleet of 75 which has clocked up millions of flight hours and passengers over the last ten years alone. Trade unions on the Helicopter Safety Steering Group agreed with the operators’ decision to ground Super Puma models following the fatal incident on 23rd August 2013.&#xa0;4.3 The EC225 model was taken out of service following two non-fatal emergency ditchings in the North Sea in May and October 2012. It had only been returned to service in the offshore sector a matter of weeks before the fatal accident on 23rd August 2013 involving a Super Puma AS332 L2.&#xa0;4.4 Two events prior to the 23rd August incident are vital to consider in the context of offshore workers’ confidence in the safety of helicopter transport in the North Sea. Firstly, a survey of 1,600 offshore workers in May 2013 by the Step Change in Safety body, a coalition of the safety regulator HSE, the 5 trade unions and the oil and gas industry, found that nearly 9 in 10 (86%) of offshore workers did not trust the EC225 model. It was clear from this that trust in helicopter transport in general had declined significantly amongst the offshore workforce, before the fatal accident on 23rd August. As the Step Change in Safety official Les Linklater commented in industry press coverage of the May survey’s finding: “We cannot think of this as an EC225 issue...The EC225 will come back and will be safe to fly again, but there are other airframes out there and there are confidence issues.”&#xa0;4.5 Secondly, the reported comments of a helicopter company (CHC) employee in response to an offshore worker’s concern over the safety of the EC225s has served to anger offshore workers and highlight a culture of macho bullying that exists with the tacit acceptance of the employers. Again this episode occurred before the accident on 23rd August, but also serves to highlight the problems over confidence in helicopter transportation that are ingrained in the workforce in the offshore sector.&#xa0;4.6 It should also be noted that the “Boots On” campaign to reassure and support offshore workers was agreed and launched by members of the HSSG, in response to the further concern over helicopter safety raised by the fatal incident on 23rd August. RMT believe that this unified approach is the most effective way of improving the health and safety of all offshore workers, on installations and on the helicopters used to transfer them to and from the workplace.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1 The RMT supports Patricia Ferguson MSP’s Inquiries into Deaths (Scotland) Bill and would urge Transcom to consider applying pressure on the Scottish Government, via the Scotland Office, HSE and CAA to support this Bill which contains much needed reform to the fatal accident inquiry process in Scotland that attends such tragic accidents. The consultation on the Bill is open to responses until 31st January 2014. Whilst all effort must be expended in protecting the lives and well being of offshore workers in the North Sea, they must also be assured that access to justice will be swift, straightforward and effective should the worst case scenario be realised.&#xa0;5.2 To further illustrate the need for reform in this area, we point to the unacceptable experiences of the families of the 14 offshore workers and 2 air crew who died on 1st April 2009 in an incident north east of Peterhead involving a Super Puma AS332 L2, the same helicopter model involved in the 23rd August incident. The families of those who died in April 2009 are still waiting for the Procurator Fiscal to open the Fatal Accident Inquiry into this tragic episode. Whilst that inquiry will finally commence on 6th January 2014, a preliminary hearing in November was cancelled at the last minute, leaving the bereaved relatives who had travelled to Aberdeen from all over the UK severely inconvenienced and again asking why such a significant inquiry into the death of their loved ones should be subject to constant delay and its terms of reference, powers and scope, so severely restricted.&#xa0;December 20136&#xa0; Quoted at 3.2 http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/07/5746/3  Hansard 27th November 2013, Col 127WH. http://www.itfglobal.org/news-online/index.cfm/newsdetail/9430  http://www.easa.europa.eu/rulemaking/docs/npa/2013/NPA%202013-10.pdf  Hansard 2nd December 2013 col. 506W http://www.energyvoice.com/2013/06/nine-in-10-oil-workers-dont-trust-ec225s-after-ditchings-survey-finds/  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/10268574/Helicopter-crash-workers-told-to-put-big-boy-pants-on-after-expressing-safety-fears.html  http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/gettinginvolved/66152.aspx
