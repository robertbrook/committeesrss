What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
