"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Society for Applied Microbiology (WSC068)&#xa0;\nThe Society for Applied Microbiology\n (S\nf\nAM)\n is the oldest microbiology society in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nS\nf\nAM \nenvisages a future where applied microbiology research and development is strong in the UK and beyond, and the applications of microbiology contribute significantly to all global challenges facing humanity, including infectious diseases; the changing envir\nonment; sustainability of energy, food, water, and land resources; and economic growth.\n&#xa0;\nTo achieve this \nvisi\non, S\nf\nAM seeks to encourage equality and diversity in microbiology and related disciplines. This, with the express aim of \nfully utilising\n the best talents in microbiolo\ngy and \nensuring\n that the application\n of microbiology\n research\n serves the needs of all citizens.\n&#xa0;\nThis response is in addition to our endorse\nment of the Society of Biology submission\n to the same inquiry\n. \nS\nf\nAM\n is a member organ\nisation of the Society of Biology.\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\nWe find that equality and diversity issues in STEM are complex and that there is unlikely to be a single approach that \nis effective to bring parity\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe also take the view that STEM careers provide a magnif\nying glass on inequality of opportunity in wider society. Academic careers are necessarily elitist because of the requirement for extensive post-16 education and specialist knowledge and skill. \nAs a consequence of this, e\nvery inequality experienced by thos\ne from low socioeconomic status groups, girls and women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities, \nis likely to take\n an individual a step further away from STEM as they go through life. Therefore, we believe that interventions that address inequalit\ny of opportunity from day one will be magnified in their effects in STEM.\n&#xa0;\nWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhilst the under representation of women in senior positions is perhaps less pronounced in microbiology, with several notable female professors among \nS\nf\nAM\n’s membership\n and two of the past four Society presidents being female\n, there remains\n a lack of parity\n.\n&#xa0;Working environment\n,\n culture\n, and career progression\n&#xa0;\nFemale PhD\n graduates\n and postdocs tell us that they leave academia because they find the male-dominated environment oppressive \nand unsupportive. They experience an environment that is inconsistent \nwith their principles and values and they lack mentoring and guidance from senior colleagues.\n&#xa0;\nOne area of particular concern is the ability of senior scientists in managerial roles to nurture and develop women’s talents. \nAs a direct result\n of conscious or unconscious bias, women scientists are often steered towards administrative and pastoral roles, which are relatively undervalued by academic employers. As a consequence\n,\n they do not \nachieve\n career progression in line with male colleagues a\nnd so seek alternative careers where their talents and experience may be better appreciated.\n&#xa0;\nAnother factor in women STEM graduate \ncareer \nchoices is the culture of excessive working hours in academic research. Measurement of success is usually by output\n,\n \nand what can be achieved in a normal working week is not seen as competitive for funding or career progression.\n Researchers are regularly working six or seven days a week and clocking up hours far in excess of \ncontractual obligations\n.\n This particularly imp\nacts women early in their research careers when they may also be taking on additional responsibilities within the family context.\nThere is also a lack of transparency in recruitment and selection\n.\n \nW\nith researchers often operating in niche areas with a lim\nited pool of recruitment panel members, it is the perception of our members that a degree of nepotism is at play and there is a sense of an ‘old boys network’.\n&#xa0;\nWork-life balance\n&#xa0;\nThere exists a s\nocial expectation that women take \nprimary\n responsibility for\n child rearing\n. This actively excludes women from the practice of science, because of the culture of long working hours and presenteeism.\n&#xa0;\nOur members tell \nus \nthat they are aware of \nindividuals with \nnegative attitude towards maternity leave and\n their managers \nare unaware of \neffective processes to manage parental leave to the benefit of the individual and the employer.\n Managers are also facing challenges in funding the cost of maternity leave from research grants.\n \nAs a consequence, there is a per\nceived\n bias in recruiting, against women of child bearing age.\n&#xa0;\nThe path to a tenured position generally involves a number of short term, temporary, post-doctoral positions. It is also true that many scientists expect to be nationally or internationally mo\nbile during this phase of their career. \nOur members tell us that this is discouraging for scientists who also wish to establish a stable home and family. Again, there is still a social expectation that a male partner is primary earner and his career will b\ne prioritised, particularly if it is ahead of an uncertain and risky career path of the female partner.\n&#xa0;\nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in dif\nferent employment sectors?\n&#xa0;\nWomen transition into a huge range of careers, however, the proportion of women who are not in STEM related jobs or not in employment at all is greater than the proportion of men.\n This is discussed with data in the Royal Society\n of Edinburgh’s April 2012 report, “Tapping all our talents”\n&#xa0;\nWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;Affordable, or free at the \npoint of service, childcare\n is the most commonly requested support. Indeed, \nS\nf\nAM\n has recently implemented a facility to ‘top-up’ meeting attendance grants to cover childcare if it is necessary to enable a researcher to attend the meeting. Flexible working \nand job sharing schemes are also valuable.\n&#xa0;\nThere is a clear requirement for effective training in equality and diversity at all levels.\n It may also be useful to use tools to identify and address the impact of implicit social attitudes\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is also the ca\nse that many senior \nprofessionals, including scientists, \nlack the skills and training to be effective managers of people. This should be addressed as a matter of great urgency. In particular, training that encourages man\na\ngers to value differences in style \nand, indeed, make use of a diverse team in delivering organisational objectives.\n&#xa0;\nGreater openness and transparency in the recruitment and selection process is vital to address issues of nepotism and the ‘old boys network’. HR oversight and involvement in \nall scientific appointments is absolutely necessary to ensure this.\nEvery organisation should have a robust personal and professional development review process to ensure matching of individual ambition with organisational obj\nectives and training \nneeds. This should be intrinsic to an ongoing programme \naimed at realising\n the impact of research as opposed to short term fixes\n,\n often carried out\n in the run up to a REF exercise.\n&#xa0;\nInstitutions and the scientific community as a whole should institute c\nlear career paths that reward non-research contributions to academic life and consider output rates based on the time each person \nreasonably chooses to commit\n beyond \ntheir \ncontracted working hours\n. \n&#xa0;\nMentoring schemes\n are useful\n to support career planning \nand also to discourage the ‘pulling up of ladders’ by senior women scientists. \nAnd, in addition, c\nareer planning workshops that encourage the ‘Plan A’ \nacademic \nroute over\n various\n back-up plans\n (non-STEM careers, full time parenting, starting own business, \netc.)\n, which women are more likely to have in place\n or in mind\n than men.\n&#xa0;\nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?\n&#xa0;\nFunding\n&#xa0;\nFollowing on from the chief medical officer’s statement that all NIHR \nfunded departments should achieve Athena SWAN Silver within a reasonable time period, this should be extended to all research council funded departments.\n&#xa0;\nThere should be \nfinancial \nprovision in all publicly funded PhD and postdoc positions for the possibil\nity of maternity or paternity leave.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n assessment\n of research track-record by funding panels\n should\n take into account periods of part time\n working\n, career breaks, or parental leave.\n&#xa0;\nSupport and information for complainants and whistle blowers\n&#xa0;\nThe gov\nernment should provide support and information to employees for the pursuance of grievances or whistle blowing in organisations that are not operating \nin line with existing equal\n opportunities policies and legislation.\n&#xa0;\nCommission social research\n&#xa0;\nThe gove\nrnment should commission research that measures the experience of women working in science and those who have left STEM careers\n,\n in order to establish qualitative base lines for future improvements in culture and work environment. Such research should be f\nree to question the rational orthodoxy and so present solutions outside of the established political and legal structures, which have so far failed to address the problem\n for more than 40 years\n.\n&#xa0;\nResearch should seek to re-\nimagine \nthe problem of the under \nrepresentation of women in \nSTEM\n as:\n&#xa0;\nSeptember  2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/advice-papers/inquiry/women_in_stem/tapping_talents.pdf\n \nhttps://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/\n for example\n"
