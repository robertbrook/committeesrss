[[[How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment? ]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Needs to be recognised that investment needs to be directed to the whole highway networks as the majority of trips start and end on local highways;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The needs of other road users such as bus and coach does not appear to have much regard-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recognition of some form of segregation for pedestrians and cyclist on these routes needs to be made&#xa0;1.1&#xa0; The policies set out within the Command Paper addresses largely regional traffic, focusing on cars and HGVs in particular. The policy also makes reference to “future proofing” the strategic network for cycling. The policy however does not reference to or provide any identified investment in the local road network, of which responsibility lies with Local Authorities. It needs to be recognised that the vast majority of trips either start or end on these roads, and that investment needs to also be directed towards supporting maintenance of the rest of the highway network, including associated bridges and other related infrastructure.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0; The policy does not provide much information regarding other road users, in particular short-bus trips and long-distance coach routes which may also utilise the strategic road network as modes.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0; In addition, as these roads generally operate at high speed (50mph or higher) it is accepted that the roads need to be as safe as possible. This is reflected within the command paper to some extent for vehicles and future proofing for cyclists, but little reference is made regarding the potential risk for pedestrian and rights of way related casualties that can occur on the strategic network, in particular at uncontrolled level crossings over dual carriageways for rights of way. Due to both vehicular speeds and high risk of fatalities, some form of segregation may be required where possible for hazardous locations, which should be identified within the route based strategies, in particular at locations where high KSI accidents occur.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0; By making the best use of the existing highway network through use of selective junction improvements and removing bottlenecks, the policy has the potential to improve the environment by mitigating traffic congestion and minimising the need for the provision of entirely new construction.&#xa0;

[[[How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes? ]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The form proposed here is similar to that of the rail industry which has been shown to work-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The role of Park and Ride should be recognised-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Long terms planning of alternative modes such as rail lines should not be detrimentally affected by highways infrastructure proposals-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The policy need to link with the growth at sea and airports&#xa0;1.5&#xa0; The policy for roads follows a similar policy process for that of rail, with a long term strategy based on five year funding rounds, developed alongside smaller Route Based Strategies, which mirrors a similar method of Control Periods and Route Utilisation Strategies published by Network Rail. This form of planning has been shown to work within the rail industry, and should potentially work for the development of the highways network.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0; One of the most direct links to other transport modes is for that of Park and Ride schemes, both bus and rail orientated. The siting of a effective Park and ride site will help reduce congestion within towns and cities, and will most likely require being sited next to the strategic highway network to be effective.&#xa0;1.7&#xa0; An additional interaction exists relating to the crossing of other transport infrastructure, including rail and canals. Significant planning is required to ensure that any future reinstatement of a rail line for instance is not detrimental and pushed up in cost through the development of a new road for instance. In addition, the maintenance or replacement of bridges and removal of level crossings require coordination between both parties to ensure that both modes see an advantage and not cause unnecessary maintenance liability on one mode.&#xa0;1.8&#xa0; Finally, the policy needs to link into the proposed growth of both airports and ports, both for the effective and efficient handling of freight and passengers to access these facilities. &#xa0;

This information should then be used to inform the potential traffic growth expected within the area.&#xa0;1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Traffic demand on the strategic network is determined by a number of factors that can determine use, and may help inform forecasts. These include:&#xa0;&#xa0;1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposals within “Action for Roads” indicates that road funding should be determined in five-year funding rounds. Each funding round should, like the rail industry, focus on delivering specific outputs and ensuring sustainability of the network. Regarding the forecast growth, the funding rounds should collect robust data regarding demand, which can closely monitor the levels of actual demand and adjust accordingly.&#xa0;

This is already demonstrated in the use of “managed motorways” of using the hard shoulder during peak periods, and the deployment of VMS signs to inform road users of delay and disruption.&#xa0;1.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The wider deployment of this technology across the network will have benefits in terms of both capacity and flexibility at times of disruption. The deployment of technology however is much wider. The deployment for instance of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) or Bluetooth opens up possibilities of monitoring traffic flows across the network. In addition, enforcement use for uninsured vehicles and speeding could potentially utilise these technologies.&#xa0;1.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At signalised junctions, the upgrade of the signals to utilise MOVA or SCOOT systems provides a chance to provide additional capacity to the road network at pinch points.&#xa0;
