Written evidence [bold]from [bold]Together for Short Lives[bold] (LTC 05)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]About us[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Together for Short Lives
[normal] is the leading UK charity for all children with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions and all those who support, love and care for them. We support families, professionals and services, including children’s hospices. Our work helps to ensure that children can get the best possible care, wherever and whenever they need it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Children’s palliative care (CPC)
[normal] differs greatly from adult’s palliative care. Whereas the majority of adults only need palliative care at the end of their lives, children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions require palliative care over a much longer period, often from birth. It is common for their conditions to fluctuate and, as such, it is often much more difficult to identify when a child is moving into their end of life phase. Children with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions often have complex disabilities, while the range of health conditions which results in children requiring palliative care is more diverse.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To cite the committee’s definition of a long-term condition, many children who need palliative care have conditions which “cannot, at present, be cured, but can be controlled by medication and other therapies”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome this
[normal] opportunity to comment on the 
[normal]management of long-term conditions
[normal] in England. We would be happy to provide oral evidence if requested to do so.
