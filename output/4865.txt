[[[Introduction to EDF]]]&#xa0;1.1 The Emergent Disease Foundation (EDF) is a UK-based public health education and research charity. The charity is both headed and supported by highly qualified academics, psychologists, biologists, veterinarians and medical scientists with extensive backgrounds in public health, medicine, wildlife biology, species conservation, and animal welfare. EDF’s scientific base is necessarily derived from diverse disciplines because the charity’s main focus, zoonotic disease, involves a multi-factorial cause history that emerges from human habits, poor animal welfare, ecological disturbance and general pathogenesis. Disease associated with exotic pet trading and keeping represents a key interest for EDF, and the primate pet trade is highly relevant to our work.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.0 

[[[Exotic pet trading in general]]]&#xa0;2.1 Exotic pet trading and keeping historically attracted significant concern and criticism. However, in recent years there has been a particularly expansive raft of published evidence-based independent scientific reports and articles establishing that exotic pet trading and keeping presents serious problematic areas. These problematic areas and sample publications, include:&#xa0;2.2 animal welfare involving both wild-caught and captive-bred sourcing, holding, transport, sale, and domestic maintenance (for example, Akhtar, 2012; Altherr &amp; Freyer, 2001; Arena &amp; Warwick, 2004; Arena, Steedman &amp; Warwick, 2012; Auliya, 2003; ENDCAP 2012; GAO 2009; Koch et al, 2013; Laidlaw, 2005; McLennan 2012; Toland et al., 2012; Warwick, Lindley &amp; Steedman, 2011a,b) &#xa0;2.3 species and ecological conservation involving depletion of natural populations, alteration of habitat, and introduction of invasive alien species (for example, Andreone et al., 2008; Bomford 2008; Bomford et al., 2009; Faraone et al., 2008; Ficetola et al., 2007; Fischer &amp; Garner, 2007; Fouquet &amp; Measey, 2006; Henderson &amp; Bomford, 2011; Kark et al., 2009; Keller et al., 2011; Kolbe, et al., 2004; Krauss et al., 2003; Langton, Atkins &amp; Herbert, 2011; Lillo et al., 2005; Rebelo et al., 2010; Rhyne et al., 2012; Scalera, 2007; Shine et al., 2009; Shine et al., 2010; Simon et al., 2011; Skerratt et al., 2007; Strayer et al., 2006; Vilà, et al., 2010) &#xa0;2.4 public health and safety involving the transmission of disease from non-human to human animals, and injuries (for example, Abbott &amp; Janda, 2012; Aiken, Lane &amp; Adak, 2010; Arena, Steedman &amp; Warwick, 2012; Bertrand et al., 2008; Brown, 2004; Brugere-Picoux &amp; Chomel, 2009; Chomel et al., 2007; GAO, 2009; Hale et al., 2012; HPA, 2009; Jones et al., 2008; Karesh et al., 2007; Mettee Zarecki et al., 2013; Nenoff et al., 2012; Praud &amp; Moutou, 2010; Smith et al., 2012; Smith &amp; Whitfield, 2012; TRAFFIC, 2012; Warwick, Arena &amp; Steedman, 2012; Warwick et al., 2012; Warwick &amp; Corning, 2013; Warwick &amp; Steedman, 2012).&#xa0;2.5 Allied concerns have also been raised about antibiotic resistance associated with both (unsuccessful) industrial and general endeavours to control or eradicate microbial agents (for example, Aklilu et al., 2012; Rose et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2012).&#xa0;3.0 

[[[Primates]]]&#xa0;3.1 Essentially, few subjects in bioscience have been either as frequently highlighted or as well furnished with evidential support as the growing concerns surrounding all types of exotic pet trading and keeping. Primate pet trading and keeping epitomizes all problems associated with exotic pets. For EDF, control and prevention of zoonotic disease is of primary concern, and primates, because of the close evolutionary, genetic, and habitual similarities to humans, manifest a highly notable pathogenic risk to humans. Primates harbour a substantial raft of potential human pathogens, notably, but not exclusively, viruses. Viruses are the most difficult of pathogens to eradicate from an occupied reservoir and they are also the most difficult to ‘treat’ in affected carrier or sick primates and people. Captivity-stress and general husbandry conditions for primates are, in our view, also major elevators of risk in the domestic environment.&#xa0;3.2 Primates, as highly and vitally social animals, require the interactions of relevant conspecifics. For people, this sociality is frequently a driver for acquiring primates, and keepers typically regard close interaction between themselves and their ‘pets’ as essential. However, such contact creates a fundamentally negative situation in which ‘necessary’ human-primate interactions increase the inherent risks of zoonoses transmission.&#xa0;3.3 Responsible management for primates is overly challenging. We have tested a range of primate species found in the UK for their suitability or unsuitability as pets using both the Schuppli &amp; Fraser (2000) and the EMODE (Warwick et al., 2013) management assessment systems. All primates scored in the exceptionally challenging and high in the ‘Difficult’ and ‘Extreme’ scale, so as to be regarded as beyond the abilities of the general public to care for them well or safely.&#xa0;4.0 

[[[Conclusions]]]&#xa0;4.1 We are unable to determine the extent of trade in primates in the UK. However, we consider the nature of the problems associated with primate trading and keeping to be sufficiently concerning that, regardless of scale, the issues warrant very serious concern.&#xa0;4.2 We regard the existing framework of ‘controls’ on primate trading and keeping to be unacceptable and insufficiently modifiable to offer meaningful improvement.&#xa0;4.3 There can be little doubt that the scientific evidence collectively and overwhelmingly determines that primate trading and keeping is fundamentally harmful on all major fronts. It is widely accepted that primates constitute a special zoonotic risk due to their evolutionarily close relationship with humans. There also can be little doubt that, both from anecdotal and scientific assessment using formalized evaluation tools, reasonable primate maintenance is beyond the capabilities of the general public and many specialised husbanders alike. The consequences of these serious deficiencies involve highly negative, and in our view, unacceptable implications and results both for people and for primates intended as pets.&#xa0;5.0 

[[[Recommendations]]]&#xa0;5.1 Given both the historical and current concerns surrounding the primate pet trade, together with the ineffectiveness of remedial education, it is our firm view that the only pragmatic, rational and ethical recommendation we can offer in order to control and prevent potential problems is to institute a total ban on all future trade and keeping of these animals.&#xa0;5.2 With regard to how ban might be implemented, given the different problematic issues associated with primates as well as the different potential legislative options, we consider this a matter for the Committee to decide.&#xa0;We trust this summary and recommendation is helpful to the Committee.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
