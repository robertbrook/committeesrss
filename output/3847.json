"Written evidence submitted by Amnesty International UK (JRR 0015)&#xa0;On 18 July 2013\n, the Joint Committee on Human Rights launched an inquiry into the implications for access to justice of certain of the \nUK g\novernment\n’\ns proposals to reform legal aid. Amnesty International submitted written evidence to the C\nommittee on 27 September 2013 highlighting the organization\n’\ns serious concern that the proposals \nwill deny legal aid and access to justice to vulnerable individuals. \n&#xa0;\nOn 06 September 2013\n,\n the UK government published a series of new proposals in \nits Consultation Paper \nJudicial Review: Proposals for further reform.\n In \nresponse to\n a call for further written evidence by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, this submission highlights Amnesty International\n’\ns concerns with respect to the government\n’\ns pr\noposed \nchanges, focussing on their implications for human rights. These submissions should be considered together with Amnesty International\n’\ns previous written evidence \ndated\n 27 September.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn its consultation document, the government describes judicial review as \n“a critical check on the power of the state, providing an effective mechanism for challenging the decisions, acts or omissions of publ\nic bodies to ensure that they are lawful”\n.\n This is accurate. Judicial review focuses on the exercise of, and potential misuse of, executive power. As such, it crucial\nly\n support\ns\n \na\n fundamental tenet of the rule of law \n–\n that no-one is above the law\n -\n by ho\nlding the Executive accountable to the law and due process. \n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International is concerned about the effect of the proposals on the rule of law and access to justice. In particular, Amnesty International is concerned that the proposals discussed belo\nw will significantly undermine the effectiveness of the judicial review mechanism, a critical part of the system of checks on government compliance with its obligations, including human rights obligations. These concerns are further compounded by the lack \nof evidence presented by the government to support its proposals.\n&#xa0;\nSet out below is more detail on: (1) the lack of evidence supporting the proposals; (2) the\n implications of the\n proposed changes to standing\n (a) and third party interventions \n(b)\n; and (3)\n the implications of\n the proposed changes to costs (specifically Protective Costs Orders).\n&#xa0;\nThe\n are\nas highlighted in this evidence are those where\n Amnesty International is best placed to contribute to the \nCommittee’\ns inquiry. Where other proposals are no\nt dealt with in this \nevidence, this\n should not be taken as an indication that Amnesty International agrees with those proposals or considers that they do not have \nimplications for\n human rights.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFrom the outset Amnesty\n International\n would draw the Committee\n’\ns attention to the lack of evidence underpinning the proposals made in the consultation document and the fact that, where evidence is presented, it does not support the case that the government attempts to make. \n&#xa0;\nThe government \nmakes two main claims on the basis of the statistics presented: (i) that the use of judicial review has expanded massively in recent years; and (ii) that judicial review is used as a \n‘\ncampaigning tool\n’\n, where unmeritorious claims are brought by campaigning\n NGOs and others simply to attract publicity. The evidence presented does not support these contentions. \n&#xa0;\nThe government\n’\ns figures and graphs on page 8 of the proposals are presented alongside a statement that \n“[t]he number of judicial review applications\n has more than doubled in recent years”.\n However, the only significant increase shown is in immigration and asylum cases, which the government recognises are soon to be redirected to the Upper Tribunal and are therefore irrelevant to the proposed reforms.\n The remaining, \nrelevant\n cases show an almost static line, and certainly do not demonstrate the claimed proliferation of judicial review actions; which forms the main basis of these proposals.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe government points out in its proposals that between 2007 a\nnd 2011, around 50 judicial reviews per year “\nappear to have been lodged by… claimants who may not have had a direct interest in the matter at hand”\n \nand expresses its concern “\nthat the wide approach to standing… [allows] judicial review to be used to seek\n publicity or otherwise to hinder the process of decision-making\n”.\n However, in 2011, even excluding immigration, asylum and planning cases, these cases \n‘\nof concern\n’\n represented only two per cent of all judicial reviews.\n Furthermore, these types of cases \nare in reality \nrelatively\n successful\n \nwhen compared with other judicial review claims\n, as the government points out.\n \n&#xa0;\nSo the government has highlighted a type of judicial review which forms a \nsmall fraction\n of all judicial reviews, and which is \ndisproport\nionately successful\n on the merits. Clearly, this does not appear to justify the government\n’\ns claimed need to seriously restrict standing on the basis of these cases\n’\n demands on the court system. Even accepting the government\n’\ns approach of judging the value\n of judicial review on the success rate of cases (an approach with which Amnesty International would have reservations), the relatively successful track record of this type of judicial review would seem to lead to the opposite conclusion; that the broader \ntest for standing should be retained as it allows more meritorious claims to be brought, increasing the \n‘\nvalue for money\n’\n of judicial review in terms of court resources\n.\n  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nA key issue raised by the proposals concerns who ought and ought not to have “standing” to bring a claim for judicial review. The government argues that over time the test for standing in judicial review has been interpreted too widely\n,\n \n“allowing judicial \nreview to be used to \nseek publicity or otherwise to hinder the process of proper decision-making”.\n \nThe government therefore proposes restricting the test for standing so that individuals and groups \nwithout\n a “direct” or “direct and tangible” interest in t\nhe outcome of the proceedings do not have standing to bring judicial review claims. \n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International is concerned that the government\n’\ns proposals \nwould \nunnecessarily\n \nrestrict who is able to bring judicial review claims before the courts\n, undermining\n the rule of law by limiting the remedies available to hold the government to account, including for failure to comply with its human rights obligations.\n&#xa0;\nFor example, the consultation paper references the case of \nR (on the application of Maya Evans) v Sec\nretary of State for Defence \npresumably in order to highlight cases where the government thinks it is wrong that a particular person could bring a claim. However, this case is an example of precisely the kind of case which raises issues of fundamental impor\ntance to the public interest\n, the rule of law and human rights\n, namely the UK\n’\ns policy and practice in relation to the transfer of detainees to the Afghan authorities and the risk of torture and other ill-treatment those individuals would face.\n  Amnesty \nI\nnternational is concerned that the restriction on standing to those who have a direct and tangible interest will prevent these kinds of cases from being heard before the courts.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe proposals also fail to properly consider instances where there \nmay\n \nnot \nbe\n individuals with a direct interest in the outcome, for example where an unlawful policy exists but has not yet affected any individuals. It is precisely this reasoning which has led the courts to develop and relax the test for standing in judicial revie\nw in the way they have; out of a concern about restrictions on access to\n justice.\n Changing the rules on standing as proposed would undermine access to justice and the rule of law. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The government expresses concern that third parties who \nintervene in judicial review cases may over-complicate matters and unnecessarily add to costs. The government makes three main proposals in this regard: (i) to restrict the test for standing for judicial review claims to exclude these third parties; (ii) t\no require third party interveners to be responsible in principle for their own legal costs resulting from the intervention; and (iii) to require third party interveners to be responsible for any significant extra costs incurred by the existing parties to t\nhe claim. \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe government’s claimed concerns are unlikely to materialize in practice. \nIt is rare that any third party intervener is awarded its legal costs, and judges have discretion to refuse to allow third party interventions where these might over-com\nplicate matters or disproportionately add to costs. \n&#xa0;\nFurther, t\nhird party NGOs and voluntary sector organizations, such as Amnesty International, do not take lightly the decision to intervene in court proceedings (whether judici\nal review or other proceedi\nngs).\n Amnesty International would only do so where: (i) there is an important legal principle at stake; and (ii) the organization is able to bring additional expertise and useful legal arguments. Joining a case as a third party requires considerable commit\nment in terms of resources (which are often scarce at these organizations). If an intervention were made, this would only be following detailed consideration (with the input of in-house legal experts and possibly external counsel). \n&#xa0;\nB\ny intervening, these \nthird parties are likely to bring added expertise, which will allow the case to be better argued and considered.\n Even where c\nosts \nin a specific case are \nincreased by an intervention (which is doubtful, \ngiven that the \nintervention\n \ni\ns likely to \nresult in\n the\n issues be\ning\n more clearly argued and efficiently dealt with), \nfocussing on a single case \nignores the fact that \na well-run \ncase may establish a clear precedent which disposes of the need for numerous other individual cases. \n&#xa0;\nRestricting the right of these\n organizations to intervene would reverse the effect described above, and therefore be detrimental to the rule of law and to the effectiveness of the system of checks and balances on governmental action. \n&#xa0;\nIt is also troubling that these proposals will det\ner third party interventions from organizations that are unable to take any additional costs risks, whereas interventions will continue to be made by those representing well-resourced interests including companies and the government itself. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA Protective Cost\ns\n Order (PCO) limits the costs exposure of a claimant in a public interest case. In the consultation document the government raises concern that PCOs are being granted in too wide a range of circumstances; in particular that an expanding approach to PCOs\n “h\nas tipped the balance too far and now allows PCOs to be used when the claimant is bringing a judicial review for his or her own benefit”\n.\n The government also questions whether\n costs protection ought to continue to be available for\n “political” and “campaig\nning” judicial review claims\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nPCOs are an important tool available to the courts to “level the playing field” between the claimants and defendants in order that certain cases can be brought which are in the public interest. As such, they help to promote the rule of law by holding the E\nxecutive to account in instances where there might otherwise be no claimant willing and able to bring proceedings. Amnesty International is concerned that the proposals concerning PCOs will seriously deter these types of claim from being brought, because t\nhe financial risk in bringing such claims will be too high. \n&#xa0;\nThe proposals, when read as a whole, also appear fundamentally unworkable\n and will result in a greater restriction on access to justice than at first appears\n. The government proposes to: reform \nthe test for standing to require a “direct interest” or “direct or tangible interest”; and at the same time remove the availability of PCOs for claimants who have a “private interest”. In its proposals, the government does not specify \nprecisely what is mea\nnt by “direct interest” or “direct and tangible interest” (and invites views on an appropriate test), but if “direct interest” and “private interest” are in effect the same test (which appears likely)\n, then no claimant with standing to bring a judicial re\nview would be able to benefit from a PCO. The effect will not be to limit the availability of PCOs, but to \nremove them entirely\n. This will prevent many claimants from bringing claims resulting from legitimate grievances, because the financial risk would si\nmply be far too high.    \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;As we have highlighted previously, the government’s proposals to reform legal aid \nwill deny legal aid protection and access to justice to poor and vulnerable people \nand inhibit the ability of individuals to hold to ac\ncount public bodies and officials for their actions and decisions\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe \ngovernment’s more recent proposed judicial review reforms\n - if implemented - would make it \neven\n more difficult to hold the government and public bodies to account\n. The proposals would\n insulat\ne\n executive action from adequate judicial scrutiny, and significantly \nundermine checks on government compliance with its obligations, including human rights obligations\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nTaken individually, these two sets of proposals have negative implications \nfor the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law. When taken together, the combined effect of the proposals is even more severe. Amnesty International calls upon the Committee to consider this evidence and the evidence submitted by othe\nr interested parties carefully, and to use its position to persuade the government to rethink these harmful proposals.\n&#xa0;\n27 November 2013\n6\n&#xa0;\n Ministry of Justice, Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform, paragraph 1.\n Ministry of Justice, Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform, paragraph 9.\n Ministry of Justice, Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform, paragraph 78.\n Minis\ntry of Justice, Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform, paragraph 79.\n The total number of cases was around 2,300. If immigration, asylum and planning cases are included the figure is 0.4 per cent.\n See paragraph 77 of the Ministry of Justice, Jud\nicial Review: Proposals for further reform document, “\nThe identified cases tended to be relatively successful compared to other JR cases”\n.\n Ministry of Justice, Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform, paragraph 79.\n LJ Richards at paragraph 2 stat\ned that this was a case “\nbrought in the public interest\n”, which “\nraises issues of real substance concerning the risk to transferees\n”. Also of interest is the fact that the Secretary of State in this case did not pursue the objection to standing.\n See the \nPublic Law Project, \nJudicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform¸ \nOctober 2013. The Public Law Project also highlights two examples of such cases, \nR (Medical Justice) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[2011] EWCA Civ 1710 and \nR v Gloucestershir\ne County Council ex p Barry \n [1997] UKHL 58.\n See for example R v HM Inspectorate of Pollution, ex p Greenpeace Ltd (No 2) [1994] 4 All ER 329, where the court granted Greenpeace standing to bring a claim for judicial review relating to authorisations for\n discharge of radioactive waste from a nuclear fuel processing plant. The court considered Greenpeace to be “an entirely responsible and respected body with a genuine interest in the issues raised”, and was concerned that its 2,500 supporters in the area m\night not otherwise have an effective means of bringing their concerns before the court.\n Ministry of Justice, Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform, paragraph 158.\n See for example reference to “personal interest” in Ministry of Justice, Judicial\n Review: Proposals for further reform, paragraph 74.\n"
