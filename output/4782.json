"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Patrick O’Brien (CRJ 14)(The Constitution Unit, UCL)\nGeneral observationsThis submission is submitted in a personal capacity, but is informed by work I have done with colleagues for the past three years on an AHRC-funded project on \nThe Politics of Judicial Independence in Britain’s Changing Constitution\n. \nThere are two important aspects to the role of the judiciary under any\n constitution. The first is\n what I will call the ‘substantive power’ aspect\n – the role of the judge\n as a decider\n in recognisable courtroom \nscenarios\n. Under this heading we can group questions like\n: “H\now much power \nshould judges have to judicially review Government decisions?” and “Is there any circumstance in which a court should have the power to quash statutory law?”\n The second\n aspect\n I will \nrefer to as the ‘administrative’ \naspect. Here we need to consider how courts and the judiciary are to be funded, managed and appointed and what role Parliament and the Government should have\n in these \nareas\n. \nThis inquiry is concerned largely with the first \naspect\n \n–\n \nthe\n substantive power of judges – \nbut\n the two issues\n are intertwined.\n The degree to which politicians are prepared to trust the judiciary to exercise a judicial review jurisdiction responsibly, for example, will depend to some extent on whether those politicians trust the process by \nwhich those judges are appointed, and the wider\n judicial\n culture within which they operate.\n \nOne point that has emerged from our project on \nThe Politics of Judicial Independence \nis that judges now engage \nwith parliamentar\ny committees on a regular basis, \nand that this form of contact has increased over time as contributions by serving judges to parliamentary debate \nwere phased out\n.\n \nThere were 121 appearances by 61 judges before 16 different committees in the years 2003 to 2012\n; appearances prior to 2003 were very rare.\n \nThis is \na useful illustration of the fact that\n a distinctive\n constitutional culture – in \nthis case, the\n culture\n in Britain\n of engagement between Parliament and the judiciary – can persist\n despite significant constitutional change.\n Judges can no longer speak in the Lords, so they tend to engage with Select Committees.\n \nT\nhe UK is a\nn\n outlier in this respect: in many other jurisdictions direct contact between judges and Parliament is \ndeprecated\n \nor discouraged \nas \nincompatible with\n concepts of the separation of powers.\nThe example is also valuable for its own sake.\n To build and maintain trust between judges and politicians requires that there be contact between them. This \nwill be \nimportant\n \nunder a codified constitution – and perhaps acutely important during the transition to such a constitution – just as \nunder the current arrangements.\n Judicial appearances before Select Committees have, unsurprisingly, been \nmost frequent during periods of constitutional change\n (such as during the 2003-2005 \nperiod\n)\n.\n \nThis existing culture\n of engagement should be encouraged and preserved\n. I\nt would be u\nnfortunate if \na codified constitution \nwith a more formal separation of powers led to the loss of this culture of engagement.\n&#xa0;Response to the inquiry questions1. What is the constitutional role of the judiciary and in what principal respects would the role of change if the United Kingdom were to move towards a codified constitution?At its core, the constitutional role of the judiciary is to adjudicate disputes impartially and independently\n based on the law\n.\n \nInsofar as \nthey bear a constitutional duty, it is to decide\n the\n disputes that are brought before them\n.\n \nThere is nothing inherent in the \nconcept\n of a codified \nconstitution that necessitates any change in the United Kingdom’s current constitutional arrangements\n, including to the role of the judiciary\n. There is no reason why \nthe\n current\n arrangements \ncould not be expressed \nin a writt\nen and codified form\n.\n2. What forms of consultation with the judiciary would be necessary to ensure that the legal and judicial implications of codifying the constitution were taken into account?The judiciary should be consulted (and involved) as part of any process of codification. The parliamentary inquiry model has worked well for this \ntype of work in the last decade, but the way in which the judiciary are involved will depend on the process of codification itself. A process that is led by Parliament will require a different form of involvement to one that is citizen-led.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. If the UK were to have a codified constitution, what powers should the courts have if they held that a piece of legislation was unconstitutional? a) What would be the implications of these powers on existing constitutional doctrines, including parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review? b) In the context of question 3, what can we learn from the interaction between the UK courts and the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights?As above, there is no reason why a codified constitution should lead to any significant change to the powers of the courts. That said, many written constitutions do implement some form of enhanced judicial review in relation to co\nnstitutional matters. There is \nlogic to this, because it is generally intended (although not \nstrictly speaking \nrequired) that a codified constitutio\nn will have some superior status\n. \nTo protect this status\n, it will be necessary to have some way of resolving\n conflict\ns\n between the constitution and \nother laws\n. It will often fall to the judiciary to identify where these conflicts exist\n, simply because they will inevitably\n arise\n in the context of ordinary litigation.\n If a \ndefendant to\n, for example, a \ndriving offence asserts that \nshe committed no crime \nbecause the Road Traffic Act is unconstitutional\n and so not valid law\n, it will be almost impossible for the court to avoid \nengaging with the constitutional aspect of the problem.\nThis does not, however, require that the court be given the power to quash the Road Traffic Act. T\nhe consequence of a finding of unconstitutionality does not have to be that a statute is nullified (as\n it is\n in the case in jurisdictions like the USA and Ireland). The German Constitutional Court takes\n a broader \nand more pragmatic \napproach. Whilst in some cases it will declare an unconstitutional statute to be null and void, it will sometimes make a more limited declaration\n that the statute is unconstitutional but that the legislature must resolve the problem by a given deadline. On occasion it has allowed an unconstitutional statute to remain in force; in the \nSaarland \ncase it concluded that an agreement for the Government of Saarland that violated the German constitution should be upheld, on the basis that the alternative was worse.\nAnother example, closer to home, exists \nin the ‘declaration of incompatibility’ mechanism contained in the Human Rights Act\n (HRA). \nWhere a court identifies a problem of unconstitutionality it could\n, drawing on the mode\nl\n of section 4 of the HRA,\n issue a declaratory judgment and leave the matter to Parliament\n to resolve\n.\n Again borrowing from the HRA (section 10), such a declaration could trigger a fast-track amendment process for amending the statute in question.\n A process of this kind could be implemented within a codified constitution without any risk to the sovereignty of Parliament.\n4. If there were a codified constitution, should the courts be able to assess the constitutional validity of a Bill before it becomes an Act? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of such a system?No, on balance it would be best not to have abstract review of this kind. \nAbstract review of a bill may help to reduce the possibility of any glaring and unintended constitutional errors but Parliament is generally capable of avoiding these on its own. \nThe \nprimary \nbenefit abstract review appears to offer \nis that it promises \nsome measure of certainty that bills\n that have been through a constitutional \nassessment\n will not be deemed unconstitutional by the courts at some point in the future. However, a\nbstract review can only \nexamine\n the compatibility of the text of the bill with the codified constitution. \nIn reality, \nthe manner in which a statute is\n enforced \nwill\n \nbe\n a very important \ncomponent\n o\nf the constitutional assessment. \nMany \nproblems \ncan\n \nonly become apparent once a policy or statute is\n implemented. This is as true for problems of unconstitutionality as it is for anything else.\n \nIt is possible to inoculate bills that have been through an abstract review process against further constitutional \nscrutiny\n \nbut this can only be done at the cost of ignoring the point made above: that unconstitutionality will often be\ncome\n apparent only when a statute is implemented.\nParliament does, however, sometimes seek the input of the judiciary as part of the legislative process. There is no reason why this practice could not \nbe extended to \ninclude consideration of \nabstract \nc\nonstitutional issue\ns under a codified constitution\n; albeit that judges are likely to be unwilling to wish to commit themselves o\nn the\n specific\ns\n.\n Additionally or alternatively, the Attorney General could be given a formal responsibility \nto alert Parliament wherever proposed legislation is likely to be unconstitutional.\n&#xa0;\n5. Would a Constitutional Court function best as part of the Supreme Court, or should it be separate? If the latter, how should it be appointed?A\n separate constitutional court\n would not be appropriate\n. Dedicated constitutional courts are mostly found in civil law countries that tend to have an array of specialised court systems\n – in such a system a subject-specific constitutional court makes sense\n. Whilst the UK court system has moved towards greater specialisation in the last 20 years or so, \nthe court system remain\ns unified and\n the single Supreme Court model is more culturally \napt\n.\n6. When considering the constitutional role of the judiciary in the context of a codified constitution, are there any particularly instructive lessons to be drawn from other countries with common law jurisdictions and written constitutions?Sweden is not a common law country but its constitutional culture is similar to that of the UK (with, for example, a constitutional monarchy, an easily amended constitution\n that is contained in several documents\n and significant parliamentary involvement in the protection of human rights\n).\n It might be a useful example to draw on.\n17 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nSaarland\n 4 BVerfGE 157 (1955).\n As is done in relation to the abstract review procedure in the Irish Constitution: see Article 26 (which describes the procedure) and Article 34.3.3 (which provides that the validity of a statute that has passed the Article 26 procedure cannot be further challenged).\n As applies in relation to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (section 7).\n"
