"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n members of \nLlandovery\n U3A\n Transport Group (TIC 090)\n \n&#xa0;\nSummary\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nBackground.\nThis submission is based on Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, to highlight the public transport problems in this rural area. \nThe main form of transport, as in all rural areas, being the private car.\nTransport is needed for employment, further educa\ntion, hospital visits, entertainment and shopping.\nThe main problems are lack of transport combined with the lack of co-ordination between modes of transport resulting in difficulties\n for both able and disabled members of the community.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExisting provision\n.\nLlandovery is on the A40 and is served by:\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThree bus routes via various villages to  Carmarthen\n   Brecon\n   Lampeter \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHeart of Wales railway line from Swansea to Shrewsbury via several small towns, with connections\n \nto London from Swansea and the north a\nnd the midlands from Shrewsbury.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCounty Cars a volunteer run car service initiated by the WRVS for essential journeys  ie  hospital appointments.\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo private taxi services.  \n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProblems with the current infrastructure\n.\nThe low number of bus services \ncombined with the length of the journey and the limited time available for activities.\nThe poor links between train and bus for onward travel.\nThe non - existent connections between the town and neighbouring villages.  \nBuses\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarmarthen  - five per day dur\ning school term, only three per day during school holidays. Duration 1hr 20 mins. Last service departs Carmarthen at 17.45\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBrecon  - three per day (Mon to Sat). Duration 40mins. Last service departs Brecon at 17.05\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLampeter –   route A -  one service on Mo\nnday \nand Friday. \n Route B – one service Mon, Tues, Wed and Thurs. \n             Last service departs Lampeter  13.45.\n \n&#xa0;\nTrains\n Four services per day at 4 hour intervals.\n1hr 30 mins to Swanse\na, last service departs at 18.21\n2hrs 30mins to Shrewsbury, las\nt service departs 18.05\n&#xa0;\nLink between train and bus service extremely poor.\neg the bus to Brecon departs Llandovery train station at 10.40, the train arrives from Swansea at 10.37 allowing just 3mins for the connection.\nNo connection if the train is late.\n&#xa0;\nLack of services\n to/from nearby villages not on the A40 corridor.\nSurrounding villages used to connect to Llandovery by the Post Bus.\nThi\ns service has been discontinued\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nThere are many villages and communities that have no access to public transport\n at all.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nResulting problems for the local community\n:\n&#xa0;\nYoung people \nunable to access after school activities, no transport home.\n \n&#xa0;\nPeople out of work, school leavers, work placement people, those struggling with poor mental health issues and those wit\nh physical and learning disabilities  - an efficient transport system would increase access to work opportunities for them.\n&#xa0;\n18-25 year olds have to pay a high premium for car insurance which restricts those who might have a car. The young who do not live \nin towns are severely limited in their access to work, cultural activities and socialising. \n&#xa0;\nFamilies – affected by cost of keeping a car on the road, eg  a two car family having to give up one car resulting in limitations on access to out of school activ\nities.\n&#xa0;\nAble bodied adults who are non drivers have to rely on neighbours or expensive taxi services to travel into Llandovery, eg  £30 return fare from Rhandirmwyn to Llandovery\n – a distance of seven miles.\n&#xa0;\nAdults with mobility problems are dependant on \nothers being able to visit them for social and caring services.\n \n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nSuggested solutions\n \n&#xa0;\nBuses  - increase the number of services to\n include evenings \n&#xa0;\nTrains – add one extra service per day in each direction\n at appropriate times.\n \n&#xa0;\nTransport links – \nrealistic co-ordination of timetables, this should be feasible as both buses and trains are operated by Arriva.\n&#xa0;\nLinks to nearby villages – introduce a dial-up request mini-bus service.\nA service entitled Bwcabus operates in the western half of the county \nonly. \n&#xa0;\nRural areas require direct buses linking town to town centres, with feeder minibuses from surrounding villages. \nThe times of trains and buses should facilitate work in the mornings and socialising in the evenings. \n&#xa0;\nWhy in the 21st Century should people feel as though they are on house arrest simply because they do not have access to a set of wheels?September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
