[[[WIDER ECONOMIC BENEFITS]]]

[[[The KMPG claim]]]KPMG, acting for HS2 Ltd, claim that the “Y” network, connecting London to Birmingham and Manchester and Birmingham to Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds will generate £15bn per year in Wider Economic Benefits, the so called WEBs. This extraordinary value is circa 15 times higher than the annual value implied by the £13.3bn discounted value claimed in the October 2013 Economic Case.

[[[The WEBS]]]All these WEBs, or nearly all, should be assigned to the generated or new trips since the other trips, and most of their associated WEBs, would arise in the absence of the scheme.Source documentation suggests that the proposal is forecast to generate circa 98,800 new trips per day. Dividing the £15bn by the 98,800 and by the 300 effective days in the year provides £500 per trip, or £1,000 for a round trip.  Multiplying the £500 by the 1,460 million trips carried by Network Rail in 2011/12 generates circa £730 billion, a sum equal to half the nation’s GDP; clearly an impossibility, implying that the £15bn is wildly optimistic.  Alternatively the WEBs could be assigned to the generated business and commuter trips alone.  Sources suggest these are to number circa 37,000 per day.  Dividing the £15bn by 37,000 and the 300 days in the year yields £1,350, or £2,700 for a round trip.  Multiplying the £1,350 by the nation’s business plus commuting trips provides an absurd £14,300 billion, some ten times the nation’s actual GDP, illustrating again how ludicrous it is that anyone should ever believe that the proposal could generate WEBs worth £15bn per year.Note particularly that (a) these extraordinary WEBs are in excess of what would have arisen had the new passengers stayed in their offices or at home or gone elsewhere (b) that the new passengers are supposedly generated by reductions in journey times of 30 to 60 minutes (c) pre-existing trips on the West Coast Main line should have WEBs substantially above, perhaps double, those of the new and marginal trips. That leaves HS2 Ltd to either (a) explain why a High Speed Rail trip, generated merely because a journey has been shortened somewhat, should provide vastly more benefits than any other journey on the rail network ever could – a task made doubly difficult because, as above, the benefits from a generated, or marginal, trip should be lower than (perhaps half) those associated with a pre-existing trip or (b) to throw the analysis into the waste paper basket.(The Committee will see from the footnotes that the above relies on our interpretation of the trip data in the Economic Analyses of January 2012 and October 2013, the forecasts report dated April 2012 and the National Travel Survey.  We would have preferred to use the latest data available from HS2 Ltd itself.  To that end we asked HS2 Ltd for its estimate of generated trips and the proportions of those that may be for business and commuting.  We received the astonishing reply that the data is not available; a statement which, on the face of it, must be false, since without the data it would seem impossible to calculate the alleged benefits).

[[[O]]]

[[[ther benefits]]]We have from table 22 of the Economic case dated October 2013 benefits sourced as follows:.(1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; £5.5bn from improved reliability, as though the trains cannot be made to run on time without building a high speed network, (2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; £6.6bn from a combination of improved access (£1.1bn), improved interchange (£4.1bn), and reduced walking (£1.3bn) as though a high speed network is required achieve those.(3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; £7.5bn from reduced crowding, largely solvable otherwise.  E.g. (i) add carriages and expect passengers to walk towards more central ones at stations where the platforms are too short, or (ii) raise the fares so as to reduce demand and lessen the vast financial loss which the railways make. After all, a business in the private sector would do that.(4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; £31bn from time savings, much of which remains contentious.  E.g. a business man, if losing time, may well make it up out of his leisure time.Those dubious items total £45bn out of a total of £71bn. Our view is that at least half should be struck out, thereby destroying the “economic case”.

[[[ey and hidden assumptions.]]]Embedded within the analysis are two key assumptions, namely:(1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GDP drives growth in demand. This assumption is difficult to sustain when it is realised that GDP grew, in real terms, by 160% between the 1955 and 1995 but that rail use grew not at all.  The implication is that the extraordinary growth since1995 is due to the razzamatazz of privatisation, aided by vast subsidies from the public purse; nothing at all to do with GDP and not likely to be sustained..(2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Values of time etc. will increase at close to 2% pa for ever and ever.This seemingly trivial input doubles the computed benefits!

[[[A ]]]

[[[fundamental flaw.]]]The analysis depends on the so called ‘Willingness to Pay Calculus’ developed by Professor Sugden of the University of East Anglia.  That ‘calculus’ enables the incremental fares, namely the HS2 fares minus those lost to HS2 by the rest of the railway, to be subtracted from costs and for the difference to be compared with the benefits.  The problem is that the theory reduces to the absurd when it is realised that changing the economic boundary of the scheme (a matter that can be done at the stroke of a pen) would change the incremental fares.  E.g. if we assume the rest of the railway is properly privatised then the incremental fairs rise to the full HS2 fares.  Alternatively widen the boundary to capture losses suffered by the airlines and the incremental fares are reduced.The correct place to draw the boundary is round the nation as a whole, not the Government as pretended in this analysis.  When the boundary is so widened the incremental fares fall to zero since every pound spent on the railway is a pound lost elsewhere.Striking out these fares would of course destroy the economic case for this scheme and for all railway projects.

[[[P]]]

[[[enalties.]]]Our view is that penalties should be imposed upon those who have led these studies, irresponsible as they are in all their detail - putting tens of billions of Pounds at risk. At the least nobody should ever again believe data produced by ARUP, Atkins, HS2 Ltd, Greengauge or Network rail in connection with HS2, or any other railway project.  These people have, in our opinion, shamelessly misrepresented this scheme so misleading the Government on a mammoth scale, a sentiment taken from Stewart Joy’s book, ‘The Train that ran Away’.  

[[[C]]]

[[[onclusion.]]]Against that background we canvas for a more straight forward approach, namely if it makes a financial loss, particularly if the loss is in the tens of billions, do not build it.

[[[Footnotes]]]&#xa0;. The 13.3bn is the sum of the discounted values out to the year 2093.  It equates to circa £1 bn per year if the WEBs are held constant in real terms year to year.. The Economic Assessment of January 2012 provides, at paragraph 3.2.1, 270,000 trips per day in and out of London plus 110,000 inter-regional trips, a total of 380,000.  Table 12 of the October 2013 Economic case provides 26% of trips as new, or generated.  Hence we have 98,800 generated.  £15bn divided by 98,800 and by 300 days provides £506 or £1,012 per round trip.  Note the 26% is higher than the 24% cited in Table 2 of the January 2012 assessment..  The ORR stats provide 1,460 million network rail journeys in 2011-12.  1,460 million times £500 (the supposedly WEB associated with each generated trip) provides £730 billion, roughly half the nation’s GDP..  The Demand and Appraisal report for HS2 to the West Midlands, WS Atkins, April 2012, provides at, paragraph 6.4.8, that 30% of trips are business trips.  We have from note 1 above 98,800 generated trips.  Hence there are likely to be 98,800 x 0.3 = 29,640 

[[[generated]]] business trips.  Table 0407 of the National Travel Survey provides 5% of trips purposes as commuting and 19% as business for journey lengths between 100 and 150 miles, and 3% and 19% respectively for lengths between 150 and 250 miles.  That suggests that business plus commuter trips via HS2 may amount to the business trips plus 25%, providing 37,050. .  National Travel Survey, NTS, data provides 177 commuter trips and business trips per head by all modes in 2012.  Multiplying by the population of 60 million and by the £1,350 per generated business plus commuter trip estimated above provides an absurd £14,300 billion..  The classical argument is that the first trip to be generated by a reduction in journey time, or cost, enjoys the same benefit as do pre-existing trips but that the last trip so attracted is entirely marginal and hence takes no benefit from the cost reduction.  Hence the benefit assigned to each generated trips is typically half that assigned to each pre-existing trip.  This argument may apply equally to the WEBs...
