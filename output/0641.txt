[[[ (CLC021)]]]              This submission presents research on three topics relevant to the inquiry, namely; i) discussions with members of the public about novel and unfamiliar climate change mitigation technologies, ii) research into social dilemma theory suggesting that particular aspects of knowledge about climate change are key, and iii) the study of local energy developments which bring climate change discourse into peoples’ everyday lives. Our conclusions drawn from these research areas are structured according to the questions specified in the terms of the inquiry rather than by topic.Ashworth, P., N. Boughen, et al. (2009).
