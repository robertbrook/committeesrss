[normal]Further written evidence submitted by the Department for International Development[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Health Expenditure as a Proportion of DFID Burma’s Budget[bold] - [bold]Clarification[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Health now accounts for 
[normal]roughly 
[normal]one third of DFID Burma’s expenditure over the current Operational Plan period (2011/12 to 2014/15) – 
[normal]as indicated 
[normal]in the table submitted in the Memorandum to the IDC’
[normal]s inquiry (page 5
[normal]). 
[normal] A
[normal]n older chart 
[normal]reproduced on page 7
[normal] 
[normal]of the Memorandum 
[normal]indicated
[normal] that health expenditure was closer to half. 
[normal]The di
[normal]fference 
[normal]arises due to the changing pattern of DFID Burma’s expenditure since the start of the Operational Plan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In particular, w
[normal]e have a 
[normal]commitment of up to £80m for the 3MDG Fund
[normal] to 2016
[normal]. Most of this 
[normal]could potentially have 
[normal]be
[normal]en
[normal] 
[normal]spent within the O
[normal]perational 
[normal]P
[normal]lan
[normal] period
[normal],
[normal] but over £30m of this will now fall into later years. 
[normal]This is due in part to slower than expected expenditure by 
[normal]the 
[normal]3MDG 
[normal]Fund 
[normal]and partly due to DFID Burma prioritising new work in other sectors as the reform environment improved and new opportunities arose. 
[normal]We were also allocated 
[normal]additional 
[normal]budget of 
[normal]£6m 
[normal]in September
[normal] 2014
[normal], which was 
[normal]allocated to non-health sectors – this also reduced the proportion of our budget spent on health. 
[normal]H
[normal]ealt
[normal]h
[normal] 
[normal]remains our largest area of expenditure
[normal], 
[normal]but e
[normal]xpenditure in other sectors has grown
[normal] more quickly
[normal] reducing the proportion accounted for by health to about a third
[normal].
[normal]  In addition to ‘pure’ health programmes, a proportion of our humanitarian budget also goes to funding health services to internally displaced people and refugees in camps
[normal] (note this expenditure is not included in the health expenditure figures quoted above)
[normal].
