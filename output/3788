defaultI cycle for pleasure and fitness, usually alone, occasionally 
defaultwith one other person.
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default  I am increasingly concerned for my safety when cycling on the roads where I live.
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default  This is due not only to so
defaultme people
default driving without due care and attention
default but primarily because of the hostile attitude of a significant minority 
defaultof motorists.
defaultI use the word significant because that is what the consequences for me could be if an accident occurs.
default 
defaultSome shout abuse or threats, some make it clear that in their view I should not be using the
default road
default.
defaultSome overtake at speed, without a
defaultny at
defaulttempt to give me any space, even if the road is wide and otherwise empty.
defaultSome overtake and pull back in very close to the front of my bike, rubbing their wheels into the 
defaultverge
default.
default&#xa0;
default4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default  While these things do not occur every day
default,
default it is usual to experience hostile driving at some point every week.
defaultAll of these things make me feel as if I am being bullied off from the road. There is often little or no margin for error on my part.
defaultThere are some cycle paths in the area where I live b
defaultut they are unsuitable 
defaultfor adult / competent cyclists
default who wish to 
defaultcycle distances or at much above walking pace.

default  
defaultI would like to see a high publicity safety and awareness campaign, with the backing of both government and police, aimed at establishing th
defaulte right of cyclists to use the national road network and re enforcing the responsibility in law of taking due c
defaultare and attention while driving.
default 
defaultA clear and unequivocal statement from the
default 
defaultPrime
default minister would make a good start.
default6)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI realize that 
defaultthe 
defaultrecent 
defaultfatal accidents in London must take some priority for cycle safety but rural roads are not the blissful places that others may believe.
