[normal]Written evidence
[normal] f
[normal]rom Mr Stephen Bellows 
[normal](CYS0041)
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I cycle for pleasure and fitness, usually alone, occasionally 
[normal]with one other person.
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]  I am increasingly concerned for my safety when cycling on the roads where I live.
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]  This is due not only to so
[normal]me people
[normal] driving without due care and attention
[normal] but primarily because of the hostile attitude of a significant minority 
[normal]of motorists.
[normal]I use the word significant because that is what the consequences for me could be if an accident occurs.
[normal] 
[normal]Some shout abuse or threats, some make it clear that in their view I should not be using the
[normal] road
[normal].
[normal]Some overtake at speed, without a
[normal]ny at
[normal]tempt to give me any space, even if the road is wide and otherwise empty.
[normal]Some overtake and pull back in very close to the front of my bike, rubbing their wheels into the 
[normal]verge
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]  While these things do not occur every day
[normal],
[normal] it is usual to experience hostile driving at some point every week.
[normal]All of these things make me feel as if I am being bullied off from the road. There is often little or no margin for error on my part.
[normal]There are some cycle paths in the area where I live b
[normal]ut they are unsuitable 
[normal]for adult / competent cyclists
[normal] who wish to 
[normal]cycle distances or at much above walking pace.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]  
[normal]I would like to see a high publicity safety and awareness campaign, with the backing of both government and police, aimed at establishing th
[normal]e right of cyclists to use the national road network and re enforcing the responsibility in law of taking due c
[normal]are and attention while driving.
[normal] 
[normal]A clear and unequivocal statement from the
[normal] 
[normal]Prime
[normal] minister would make a good start.
[normal]6)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I realize that 
[normal]the 
[normal]recent 
[normal]fatal accidents in London must take some priority for cycle safety but rural roads are not the blissful places that others may believe.
