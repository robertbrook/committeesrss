defaultI write to you in the matter of the proposed Deregulation Bill which I understand the Government is assembling.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe that the fundamental purpose of the Bill is to illuminate ‘red-tape’ unnecessary regulation and beaurocracy. 
defaultOver a whole range of spheres.
default I do not have the privilege of the Bills details but I would ask for the following matter to be included in its remit if possible and appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultI refer to the Green Lanes Alliance of which there are several active branches operating in counties such a Hertfordshire and Yorkshire.  There purpose to protect rural byways, tracks, and all unsurfaced lanes used for recreation / leisure purposes and by farm vehicles from indiscriminate and unscrupulous use by offroad 4x4 vehicles and motorcyclists.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs both a walker and cyclist over many years I have traversed many of the green lanes, especially of my own county of Yorkshire and I have witnessed increasing damage and despoiling of these amenities.  
default&#xa0;
defaultOver the decades these diverse tracks, byways, unsealed 
defaultroads,
default ancient ‘pack horse’ ways have become accepted leisure / outdoor facilities for walkers, cyclists, horse riders and for all who seek the peace and solitude of the countryside.  Such facilities are now being increasingly destroyed by the intrusion of motor vehicles, whose users contravene existing traffic regulation orders.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe purpose of my writing to you is to ask for consideration of the points I make in the matters of offroad usage and for the work of the Green Lanes Alliances to be included in the proposed Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently the process of combating instances of illegal usage of green lanes is complicated and protracted and, as in the case recently where I report an offender to the police, two police forces were involved in a lengthy process of prosecution.  I believe that any such instances of prosecution would be better accounted for if the work of the green lanes alliances could be included in the Bill.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a member of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance, I wish to commend their work to you and express my support for their formal submission to the proposed Bill, and of any submissions by the Green Lanes environmental action groups, The Green Lanes Protection Groups and the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance.
