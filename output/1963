defaultWe would like the committee to consider some changes to legislation regarding the use of recreational motor vehicles and green lanes. This is an issue which we have experienced first-hand in terms of the damage and disruption to these ancient byways. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe support the view put forward that:-
default“All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe second point which has been made and which we support concerns the procedures for imposing Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) and the way this can conflict with local authority with no means of appeal. Therefore we support the proposal that:-
default&#xa0;
default“When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order the is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or a magistrate”
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore we fully support the formal submissions put forward by the following organisations.
defaultThe Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM)
defaultThe Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG)
defaultThe peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA)
defaultThe Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA)
