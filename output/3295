[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this evidence, I conc
[normal]entrate 
[normal]largely on issues raised by 
[normal]questions 3, 4 and 5. 
[normal]By way of introduction, I wish to state that the
[normal] move to a codified constitution would not necessarily trigger a change in the
[normal] role of the
[normal] Britis
[normal]h
[normal] judiciary
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]t would be
[normal] possible
[normal] to draft the provisions of the new constitution and
[normal] ensure that the judiciary 
[normal]has 
[normal]the same attributions and the same constit
[normal]utional position therein
[normal]. 
[normal]For the role o
[normal]f the judiciary to change following the adoption of the 
[normal]codified constitution
[normal], i
[normal]t would mean
[normal] one of two things: 
[normal]either
[normal] 
[normal]the authors
[normal] of
[normal] the 
[normal]constitution took a decision
[normal] to alter
[normal] the role of the judiciary in the new
[normal] document or
[normal] despite
[normal] the
[normal] lack of formal change
[normal], the ‘codified’
[normal] constitutional environment trigger
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]new political and/or judicial practices and an unforeseen
[normal] transformation of
[normal] the role and position of the judiciary.
[normal] If the
[normal] second
[normal] situation
[normal] 
[normal]requires a certain degree of ball gazing
[normal], it is important to no
[normal]te that this evolution is
[normal] possible
[normal]; new constitutiona
[normal]l settlements have been known to trigger dynamics of constitutional change over and beyond the strict text of the constitution
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here are plenty of 
[normal]comparative 
[normal]instances around the world of courts transforming their role and position
[normal] beyond the ones contai
[normal]ned
[normal] in the constitutional document
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While the move to a codified constituti
[normal]on would not necessarily change
[normal] the role of the judiciary
[normal] in itself
[normal], the adoption of a system of constitutional review has the
[normal] potential to do so. In fact
[normal], t
[normal]he adopti
[normal]on of such a
[normal] system raises such fundamental questions
[normal] for the British constitution
[normal] that it would likely transform
[normal] it entirely. 
[normal]Already 
[normal]in the last decade, 
[normal]s
[normal]eeds of this
[normal] transformation
[normal] have
[normal] be
[normal]en
[normal] sown
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and the
[normal] adoption of a system of constitutional
[normal] review would h
[normal]ave th
[normal]e effect of confirming
[normal] this evolution
[normal]ary trend
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Consequently, prior to addressing questions of constitutional design for such a system of review, it is important to identify the 
[normal]constitutional
[normal] conditions that need to exist for a system of constitutional
[normal] review to function satis
[normal]factorily. It is these ‘
[normal]conditions’
[normal] or this constitutional environment that have the potential to affect
[normal] the principle of 
[normal]parliamentary sovereignty and to transform
[normal] the British constitution. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As mentioned above,
[normal] a certain constitutional envir
[normal]onment needs to exist
[normal] for a system of constitutional review to function and to be effective. 
[normal]However, to establish
[normal] 
[normal]this environment, some 
[normal]fundamental deci
[normal]sio
[normal]ns
[normal] on the character
[normal] and content of the 
[normal]codified constitution need to be made first
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The p[bold]rimacy of the codified constitution[bold]The adoption of a system of constitutional review r
[normal]aises
[normal] in turn
[normal] the question of the primacy
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]the future constitution
[normal]. 
[normal]It wo
[normal]uld be somewhat
[normal] impossible for
[normal] a 
[normal]full 
[normal]system of constitutional review 
[normal]to function w
[normal]e
[normal]re the codified constitution 
[normal]not granted
[normal] primacy over Acts of Parliament
[normal].
[normal] Only this higher status
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] give the necessary authority to the new constitution and to the system of constitutional review to
[normal] ensure
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]compliance
[normal] of Acts of Parliament
[normal] with the provisions of the constitution. Consequently, 
[normal]the new
[normal] codified
[normal] constitution 
[normal]would need to be placed 
[normal]at 
[normal]the 
[normal]apex of the constitutional
[normal] order 
[normal](or in jurisprudential parlance, 
[normal]at the top of the
[normal] ‘hierarchy of norms’
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A Bill of Rights?[bold]T
[normal]he second issue that should 
[normal]to be addressed
[normal] to create an effective
[normal] environment for constitutional review is th
[normal]e
[normal] adoption of 
[normal]a Bill of Rights.
[normal] 
[normal]While
[normal] constitutional review 
[normal]could exist and function without a
[normal] Bill of Rights
[normal], it
[normal] would be severely curtailed
[normal]. 
[normal]Traditionally, 
[normal]co
[normal]nstitutional review
[normal] 
[normal]ensures
[normal] the protection of
[normal] 
[normal]fundamental rights and freedoms. Indeed, w
[normal]ithout
[normal] a
[normal] Bill of R
[normal]ights
[normal], the courts 
[normal]would only be able to ensure
[normal] compliance with the
[normal] procedural requirements of the
[normal] legislative procedures or
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]constitutional
[normal] principles
[normal] clearly enounced in the constitution (such as 
[normal]the p
[normal]rinciple of 
[normal]in
[normal]dependence of t
[normal]he judiciary). This wo
[normal]uld establish
[normal] a very
[normal] narrow 
[normal]system of constitutional review and one that would 
[normal]tend to concentrate on the political system, its various mechanisms and the relationship and balance of 
[normal]power between Government, Parliament and Judiciary
[normal].
[normal] Traditionally, these 
[normal]areas are regulated efficiently by constitutional practices and conventions and although 
[normal]they would be 
[normal]codified in the new constitution, they may not ben
[normal]efit much from becoming the
[normal] focus of the new system of constitutional review. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally,
[normal] were the const
[normal]itution given primacy in the constitutional order and were a system of constitutional review 
[normal]be adopted, these would undermine
[normal] the main tenets of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Not only would the courts be empowered
[normal] to challenge the validity o
[normal]f
[normal] Act
[normal]s
[normal] of Parliament but
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]hey would no longer be held to have a somewhat inferior constitutional position to Parliament. The institutional balance inherent to the principle of parliamentary 
[normal]sovereignty would be compromised
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whatever the choices made with regard to the issu
[normal]es adumbrated above, these will
[normal] inform the design of the system of constitutional review. 
[normal]When designing a system of constitutional 
[normal]review, two main questions
[normal] need to be addressed: the 
[normal]choice of judicial structure and th
[normal]e type of judicial remedies
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Constitutional court v. ordinary courts[bold]There are two main options when deciding on th
[normal]e judicial structure 
[normal]appropriate for a system of
[normal] constitutional review
[normal]: a spe
[normal]cialized constitutional court 
[normal](e.g. the German, Italian and Spanish systems of constitutional review)
[normal] or a 
[normal]diffuse system of constitutional review
[normal] through the control of ordinary courts
[normal] (e.g. the system of 
[normal]constitutional review in the USA or in Greece). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The organisation of a 
[normal]‘
[normal]diffuse
[normal]’
[normal] system of constitutional review would not necessitate the creation of a new court and would only require
[normal] some adjustments to
[normal] the existing judicial processes
[normal] and court structure
[normal]. 
[normal]For instance, t
[normal]he constitutionality of an Act 
[normal]of Parliament relevant to the case could be challenged
[normal] in
[normal] all
[normal] ordinary litigations.
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However
[normal], the majority of European countries resort
[normal] to constitutional courts. T
[normal]hese
[normal] specialized courts
[normal] 
[normal]concentrate 
[normal]all constitutional litigation
[normal] in one
[normal] 
[normal]court and
[normal] their
[normal] d
[normal]ecisions
[normal] 
[normal]often
[normal] have major poli
[normal]tical and societal implications. Consequently,
[normal] 
[normal]const
[normal]itutional courts can
[normal] attract deep and repe
[normal]ated criticisms. W
[normal]hen designing 
[normal]such a court
[normal], 
[normal]particular attention
[normal] need
[normal]s
[normal] to be given 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]any aspect
[normal] that
[normal] may
[normal] foster legitimacy;
[normal] in particular both 
[normal]the m
[normal]embership and
[normal] appointment system
[normal] need
[normal]s
[normal] to be chosen
[normal] car
[normal]efully
[normal]. 
[normal]For instance, in the context of the UK judicial system, it
[normal] would be useful to move awa
[normal]y from the limitations of the
[normal] judicial appointm
[normal]e
[normal]nt system and allow
[normal] some
[normal] lay membe
[normal]rs with relevant knowledge (
[normal]e.g. 
[normal]political scientist or specialist in
[normal] ethics
[normal]) or professional experience (e
[normal].
[normal]g
[normal].
[normal] human rights campaigner of high standing)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Furth
[normal]ermore, the relationship of the constitutional
[normal] cou
[normal]rt with the ordinary courts would need to be or
[normal]ganized
[normal] carefully
[normal] to ensure that 
[normal]cases requiring
[normal] a constitutional ruling are referred
[normal] easily
[normal] to the constitutional court.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On balance, the choice of a diffuse system of constitutional review may suit the Brit
[normal]ish judicial system better. Also
[normal], there
[normal] has never been muc
[normal]h enthusiasm in the past for the creation of a
[normal] specialized public law court.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The remedies[bold]If 
[normal]the codifi
[normal]ed constitution were granted a higher status, then the court(s) should have the power
[normal] to strike down an unconstitutional Act of Parl
[normal]iament. 
[normal]In addition, the court(s) may need the power to modulate the eff
[normal]ect of their
[normal] ruling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, t
[normal]o 
[normal]a
[normal]void the need for 
[normal]this type of 
[normal]modulation
[normal], 
[normal]the constitutionality of a b
[normal]ill
[normal] could be checked before coming
[normal] into
[normal] force. This 
[normal]system of 
[normal]pre-enactment
[normal] review 
[normal]would control
[normal] 
[normal]the bill 
[normal]once adopted
[normal] by Parliamen
[normal]t and be
[normal]fore receiving the
[normal] Royal Assent
[normal]. Accordingly, the court
[normal] would be able
[normal] able to ‘catch
[normal]’ unconstitutional provision
[normal]s
[normal] before they had any legal effect
[normal]. 
[normal]There would be
[normal] no need
[normal] to remedy
[normal] th
[normal]e
[normal] detrime
[normal]ntal impact
[normal] of an unconstitutional
[normal] 
[normal]Act of Parliament and no scope
[normal] for the modulation of the effect of a ruling of unconstitutionality
[normal].
[normal] However, the system of
[normal] pre-enactment review
[normal] has some 
[normal]known drawbacks. First, the control
[normal] is 
[normal]abstract and 
[normal]it is 
[normal]debatable 
[normal]whether any
[normal] court
[normal] in the circumstance
[normal]s
[normal] can really identify 
[normal]all possibl
[normal]e 
[normal]breaches of the constitution
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Also
[normal], 
[normal]this control 
[normal]occurs immediately after a bi
[normal]ll has been passed
[normal], when the political arguments for and against the text resounds around Parliament stil
[normal]l. 
[normal]In this context, it can be difficult for the
[normal] court
[normal] charged with this review not to be tainted by ‘political’ association. It would 
[normal]be 
[normal]all
[normal] the mor
[normal]e difficult if the
[normal] system of
[normal] pre-enactment review
[normal] is n
[normal]ot automatic but if it is
[normal] trigger
[normal]ed 
[normal]by 
[normal]any number of
[normal] 
[normal]elected representatives
[normal] 
[normal](e.g. the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the House of
[normal] Commons, a number of MPs) as is often the case 
[normal]for this type of revi
[normal]ew.
[normal] In fact, in many countries where it exists, pre-enactment review
[normal] is 
[normal]re
[normal]garded to be last obstacle 
[normal]the oppo
[normal]sition can put across the path of
[normal] bill
[normal]. 
[normal]In view of
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]rather
[normal] abstract nature of the litigation and the
[normal] politicized environment
[normal] in which it often operates, it 
[normal]is doubtful whether a system of pre-enactment review
[normal] would 
[normal]take root easily in the United Kingdom
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]See instance, 
[normal]the US Supreme Court with Marbury 
[normal]v. Madison, 5 US 137 and
[normal] the French Constitutional Council with
[normal] the decision on
[normal] Freedom of Association
[normal] C Cons. 71-44 DC 16 July 1971 
[normal]Liberté d’association
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]Among these seeds one can point to the decision
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] R
[normal] v. 
[normal]Sec. of State for transport, ex p. Factortame
[normal] [1991] 1 AC 603
[normal], the Human Rights Act and the debate concerning the new category of ‘constitutio
[normal]nal statutes’
[normal], see Laws LJ in 
[normal]Thoburn
[normal] v. 
[normal]Sunderland City Council
[normal] [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin)
[normal].
[normal] In fact, despite this evolution, 
[normal]the principle
[normal] of parliamentary sovereignty h
[normal]as demonstrated great resilience
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]While it would be possible for the authors of the 
[normal]codified constitution to continue using the ECHR as a replacement for an endogenous Bill of Rights, it may not be desirable. For instance, it may be politically difficult to granting to the Convention the higher constitutional status necessary to ensure co
[normal]mpliance all other Acts of Parliament.
[normal] In France, the Constitutional Council can postpone the effect of its ruling to give time to Parliament to replace the unconstitutional legislation. 
[normal] 
[normal]In France, some commentators have questioned whether all breache
[normal]s of the constitution are really identified despite a robust pre-enactment review by the Constitutional Council.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, in the French constitution, the right to have ordinary bills reviewed by the constitutional council is given to the President of
[normal] the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Presidents of each chamber of Parliament, 60 members of the National Assembly (the first chamber of Parliament) or 60 members
[normal] of the Senate (the second chamber of Parliament).
