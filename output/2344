[normal]Written e[bold]vidence submitted by Dr. Ranjan Ramasamy, former Professor of Biochemistry and Immunology (AMR0002)[bold]I would emphasise the need for global coordination. Prescribing practices are appalling in many countries where regulations and physician/pharmacist values have failed to keep up with the needed care. I have seen this in many third world countries in Asia 
[normal]and Africa. I am sure that it is also the case in under-developed parts of Europe. It is not up to the UK government to contribute financially as is the common thought but to work harder through organisations like the WHO for all countries to adopt and mor
[normal]e importantly ensure safe practices. Bilateral pressure would be helpful also. Antimicrobial resistance emerging in a problem country can spread rapidly worldwide and threaten the UK. It is almost certain that much of the resistance seen in the UK now had 
[normal]its origins abroad.
