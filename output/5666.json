I know you are doing lots of other things. It is very nice to meet you again. This session will probably last approximately 60 minutes. Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Do any of you have relevant interests? No, so y\nou will receive a transcript of the session \nto check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website.\nI am going to ask if you could begin by stating\n,\n for the benefit of the transcriber\n,\n your name and official title.\nEmer Costello: My name is Emer Costello. I am the MEP for \nDublin\n region in \nIreland\n and I am a Labour Party MEP for \nDublin\n, \nIreland\n.\nThe Chairman: Thank you. I think you probably know what the purpose of our inquiry is: we are part of the European Union Select Committee of the House of Lords. We have the remit to look at the internal market infrastructure and employment. Of course, we do reports and send them to the Commission and to the Government. Our last witness said that she had seen our reports and thought that they were quite good. We are obviously following the \nD\nirective on unemployment, and we decided to look into this because the consensus is that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Unfortunately there are all sorts of reasons\n for that\n. We have had a lot of witness sessions from youth, businesses and all sorts of people involved in employment. We are nearing the end of our inquiry now\n,\n and we will probably produce a report in mid-April before the Easter \nR\necess. We thought it was a good idea to come over here to see how we could unravel some of the problems we still have with the information we have \nbeen getting\n.\n \nWe have 12 on the Committee\n. For \nreasons of resources\n and all the rest of it\n \nonly a few have come on this trip\n—there is not a lot of point in taking too many people on trips such as this—\nbut\n I am very grateful to \nm\nembers of the Committee who have given up these two days to do this\n. \nI am particularly grateful to you \nfor\n giving us \nyour time for us.\n \nWe are going to ask you questions\n. Y\nou have had notice of the questions?\nEmer Costello: I have indeed, yes.\nQ154 &#xa0; \n \nThe Chairman: I \nsaid that\n there is a general consensus that youth unemployment across \nEurope\n is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis\n. C\nould you summarise for us your own view of the \nexact \nnature of the current problems\n,\n and the issues that you are more concerned about?\nEmer Costello: I \nwill \npreface any remarks by welcoming you to the European Parliament\n,\n and commend\ning\n you \non \ntaking the time to come here to the European Parliament to investigate and explore these issues at a European\n level here in \nBrussels\n. I think it is a fantastic initiative and I really \ndo want \nto commend you.\nSecondly, I am a member of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee in the European Parliament. \nY\nouth unemployment is a major issue in \nIreland\n. It has certainly been one of the issues that I have particularly focused on since taking my seat here in the European Parliament almost two years ago. To that end, I have been holding a series of meetings across the Dublin region, doing consultations with the various different stakeholder organisations, young people, people who work with young people in the business, education, youth work and training sectors, and those who come from unemployment organisations\n—t\nhe whole gambit of stakeholder involvement. I have been holding those meeting\ns\n,\n first\n, to\n identify the issues that are particularly relevant in the \nDublin\n region and to look at what those stakeholders feel would be the solution.\n \nThat \nis my background and experience and how I c\na\nme to this. At the end I can give you a copy of \nthe\n speech \nI gave to the last meeting \nand \na copy of the\n report\n that I\n submitted to the Irish Government\n, which\n \nis \nin relation to the consultations that I have been having\n.\n I have also given Commissioner \nLászló Andor\n a copy of my report.\nAs you are aware, youth unemployment is one of the greatest crises\n—\nif not the greatest crisis\n—\nthat is facing the EU. One in four under 25 year-olds is unemployed in the European Union. We have approximately 26 million unemployed across the European Union\n. A\nbout 5.5 million young people are unemployed.\n \nThere are a number of issues that concern me about that from a \nDublin\n perspective. One of the biggest issues that is facing us in \nIreland\n, particularly in \nDublin\n, is the huge level of emigration of young people. It is a particular issue and problem because it is causing a major brain drain. \nEven\n the 1980s\n—I come from that \ngeneration\n—\na lot of people emigrated across the water to the \nUK\n. However, now we find that with the crisis that is facing Europe, people are now looking much further afield and are going to \nCanada\n, the \nUnited States\n, \nAustralia\n and \nNew Zealand\n. They are travelling continents apart. The scale of emigration is having\n, \nand will continue to have\n, \na major impact on \nIreland\n and on the Irish economy. We are losing some of our brightest and \nour \nbest. \nThat \nis not to say that those who stay are not bright and \nnot \nsome of our best, but at the same time it is a\n very\n worrying development.\nI am \nvery much \nan advocate of enabling and facilitating people \nto travel\n,\n because I believe that for young people to travel to work outside their country of origin is hugely educational and very insightful and when they come home they bring back certain skills. That can be hugely important. So while I would advocate very much that people should travel, many people\n, \nparticularly many young families\n, \nare leaving and are not travel\nling\n with the intention of coming home. They are putting down roots in other places\n,\n and that is particularly worrying.\nAnother aspect of the whole youth unemployment issue, which is relevant to \nIreland\n \nbut applies to \nmost European countries, is that many of the young people who are unemployed are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Many of them are a year or more unemployed. That has a real scarring effect on their own lives with their families and with their communities in terms of their ultimate ability to find employment, their earning capabilities, and even right through to their pension rights. That will have a major impact\n,\n and one of the legacies that we \nsee \nvery much as a result of the austerity and \nt\nroika period that we have had in \nIreland\n is\n long-term unemployment, particularly among young people\n,\n who may never fully recover from that experience. They are not able to make the kind of personal decisions at milestones in their lives that young people are normally able to make. They are not able to decide to le\nave home and live independently\n, and i\nt is very difficult for them to make decisions about getting married and starting a family. \nAll\n those decisions are deferred, postponed or somehow altered and there is \nno\n natural progression for these young people. \nT\nhat is the real scarring impact\n of unemployment on young people\n.\n \nThe families of young people\n and \nparents are absolutely heartbroken. \nO\nver the Christmas period in particular we are struck by various different stories of families on Skype to families \nin \nAustralia\n, and \nby \ng\nrandparents \nwho \nhave never seen their grandchildren. \nIt is really sad. \nThose kinds of issues are felt quite acutely\n, and it \nis something that I \nam \nconscious of. \nY\nouth unemployment is a major issue in \nIreland\n, particularly in my own constituency of \nDublin\n. To highlight the extent of it in \nDublin\n, t\nhe rate of youth unemployment is \nabout \n28%\n and \napproximately 60,000 \nyoung people \nare \nsigning on\n. T\nhat does not tell the whole story of those who \nmay not be \nin education, employment or training either, so we know that there are more. We know that about \na \nthird of the young unemployed people in \nIreland\n live in \nDublin\n; t\nhey are concentrated in the capital city. That has a very negative impact on the city\n. \nI\nt is not good for the city and it is not good \nfor \nsocial issues or \nthe \ncommunities where these young people are living and wandering about \nmaybe \nwith a sense of aimlessness. These are the huge problems that we are facing. \nIt is important to say that if an economy wants to be dynamic\n and \ncompetitive, it is very difficult to call yourself an open, dynamic, competitive economy when one in three \nor four of your \nyoung people \nare \nunemployed. \nThat is really difficult. \nI\nt is a major challenge and \none \nthat we have to address for the long term.\nQ155 &#xa0; \n \nLord Freeman: Thank you very much for that introduction. Clearly, it is not just a European problem, it is an international problem, or could be in due course. The Committee may be concerned—I am certainly concerned—about \nthe \nco-ordination not only \nof \nthe Commission but \nof \nnational Governments, trade unions and employers. Surely, we should be treating this—and I would welcome your views on this—as a major problem. \nDo you think we are getting it all together when it comes to t\nhe exchange of best practice between different countries, proper co-ordination and leadership?\nEmer Costello: \nT\nhis time last year, certainly the European Parliament had long identified youth unemployment as the major issue that was facing the European Union. This time last year, under the Irish presidency the conclusion of the EPSCO \nc\nouncil \nwas very clear, and the conclusions\n of the \nc\nouncil at the start of the year when the Heads of Government came, was \nthat it was \nvery important that we dealt with the issue of youth unemployment. \nO\nn 6 February 2013\n t\nhe EPSCO \nc\nouncil put \nin place that this would be a \npriority\n of the Irish presidency that this be dealt with\n,\n that it should be dealt with in a co-ordinated way\n,\n that there should be some kind of European funding and that there should be a programme to tackle the problem so that it was\n not\n tackled in an ad hoc way.\nI\nt was very much the European Parliament that proposed the Youth Guarantee and the concept of a \nyouth guarantee\n. The Commission took t\nhat proposal on board \nand\n w\nas\n very positive about it. I think it was \nan \naffirmation of that when the EPSCO Council said, “Okay, we believe \nin \nthis\n,\n and if we are seriously going t\no pursue the issue of youth unemployment we have to put financial resources behind it”. So it was agreed that €6 billion in financial resources would go into the Youth Guarantee: €3 billion from the youth employment and €3 billion from the European Social \nFund. It was hugely importa\nnt that there was that proposal.\nCurrently, all \nmember states\n in the European Union \nco\n-ordinating youth employment and youth unemployment responses have been asked to put together a proposal for their youth employment programmes. The Youth Guarantee money applies to countries with regions \nwhere\n youth unemployment \nis\n over 25%. As far as I know, the Commissioner told us before that that 21 \nout \nof 28 countries would be entitled to draw down funding from that.\nTo answer your question, it took some time to acknowledge that youth unemployment was a problem that needed to be addressed in a co-ordinated way. We have not yet seen all submissions from the \nmember states\n as to how they intend to draw down the money and what programmes they are putting in. I have a request in at the moment, and I understand that the Irish\n Government under Joan Burton have\n put in a request and their programme for funding. I am waiting to see that. I believe that the quality of \nthose \nprogrammes will be assessed by the Commission\n. I\nt is important that those programmes \ndo \nnot just draw down European funding but are clear, co-ordinated responses and have all the stakeholders involved. That is why I engaged with the trade unions, employers’ organisations, education and training experts, people who were working in the field of youth work and young people themselves. I consulted them in a series of meetings \nI had \nacross \nDublin\n. \nS\nome of the findings from that were important, but they are also saying that there is no co-ordinated approach at the moment. It is hoped that perhaps the Youth Employment Initiative will pull that together.\nQ156 &#xa0; \n \nThe Chairman: Is it appropriate for the EU Commission to have a role in youth unemployment? What you have said is absolutely appropriate for \nIreland\n, and certainly sharing examples with us would be useful. But there are certain countries in the European Union where that would not necessarily be appropriate. I would have thought that this was in the area of “good to have” and “let us see if whether we can produce a framework”—we the Commission—but \nis being \nso descriptive and prescriptive \nnot \ngoing to take up a huge amount of bureaucratic time?\nEmer Costello: I feel it is really important that this is seen to be a priority of the Eur\nopean Union. Employment, \nand the aim and aspiration of full employment\n, has to be \na priority that the European Union uphold\ns\n and support\ns\n in whatever way \nit\n can. I agree with you in the sense that some countries have more acute problems than others. It is important to acknowledge that\n. \nT\nhat is why \nthe Youth Employment Initiative targeted specific countries with high levels of unemployment. It is also important to acknowledge that all countries are having increasing problems of youth unemployment, even countries that did not traditionally have it. When we are looking to achieve full employment\n and \nto put people into work it is important that we try to ensure \nthat \nwe are able to provide decent work. The decent work agenda should really \naccompany\n this. That is why it is important that mechanisms \nare \nput in place to make young people job-ready. It is not as if there are no vacancies, even in the European Union, but there is a huge skills mismatch.\nThe Chairman: \nYou are absolutely right.\nEmer Costello: That can be supported through the use of EU funds, \nsuch as\n the ERASMUS\n+\n funding, which is aimed at all levels of students.\nOne of the issues that has also come up, very much in my own seminars in \nDublin\n, is the whole issue of vocational education and training. In some countries, vocational education and training has equal status with higher education\n,\n and people who have the accreditation from vocational training are respected as much as any of the professions. However, in \nIreland\n and probably in the \nUK\n also\n, \nbecause our systems are very similar\n, \nthere is a huge respect for higher education\n,\n and vocational education is very often treated as the Cinderella or the poor relation. \nSo t\nhere is a need. The European Commission also, in its education and training programme, has a major role to fulfil in helping to change mindsets and to achieve parity of esteem for vocational education.\nThe Chairman: \nThat is e\nxactly right.\nEmer Costello: I am very concerned and working towards this in \nIreland\n and looking to see how we can actually achieve this.\nThe Chairman: In terms of good practice, the German system of apprenticeships is one area.\nEmer Costello: That is right, \nand \nthe dual system of education in \nAustria\n or \nFinland\n is another\n. The other issue for \nIreland\n is that there are five main categories \nof apprenticeship\n, \nwhich are \ndivided into trades. If you look at the experience in many other countries there are hundreds of different areas of apprenticeships.\nThe Chairman: Exactly.\nEmer Costello: In \nIreland\n, the Minister for Education, \nRuairí Quinn\n, is currently undertaking \na review of apprenticeship. \nO\nne of the areas that is \nbeing looked\n at is how can we expand apprenticeships into areas like \nthe \ngreen economy\n, \ncaring and the hospitality industry.\nThe Chairman: You made a point about ERASMUS. That is the first time that \nhas been \nmentioned today. ERASMUS is tailing off at a time when \nit \nshould be becoming more important. \nDo you know of \nany reasons for that?\nEmer Costello: I would not actually agree. The new programme, ERASMUS\n+\n, is a redesign o\nf\n the life-long learning programme. I come from a background\n—\nand have to declare my interest in this\n—\nof \n10 years working in\n \nLéargas\n, \nthe national agency in \nIreland\n. \nI wor\nked\n very closely particularly with the British Council, \nwhich \nhad the contract to manage the programme in the \nUK\n. We worked with \nall\n the national agencies. I worked in the national agency that had \nthe \nco-ordination responsibility for all the education programmes. We did not do ERASMUS itself, the Higher Education Authority did that, but we did all the school and adult education programmes and all the other programmes. We also did Leonardo da Vinci, the vocational training programme, \nand the \nyouth programmes. I see that there is enormous potential in programmes like that. I objected to the name \nof the new programme, \nERASMUS\n+,\n \nbecause\n I think it is elitist and brings up connotations just \nwith \nhigher education. I was quite attached to the name of Leonardo da Vinci.\nI do think \nthat \nt\nhose programmes have a major role to \nplay.\n \nLeonardo da Vinci, \nfor example, \nis a really innovative programme that will equip people with employment skills. I was Lord Mayor of \nDublin\n in 2009-10\n, and\n I established what was called the Lord Mayor’s Commission on Employment, because at that stage the crisis was very much beginning to take root in \nDublin\n. I was hugely concerned about the challenges that were facing \nDublin\n city. \nO\nne of the actions that came out of that was that we joined forces with one of the \ninstitutes of technology in \nTipperary\n. \nIt was \ninvolved in a Leonardo da Vinci programme with an institute in \nGermany\n retrofitting and housing insulation. It was a hugely successful programme\n. A\n lot of the people who \nparticipated\n in those types of programmes, even short vocational training programmes, were able find jobs in a self-employed capacity, having completed some of that training. Programmes like Leonardo da Vinci, which develop people’s vocational training\n,\n open up new horizons and give them the opportunity to gain work experience in another country\n,\n \nare\n hugely important. The experience of ERASMUS students travelling abroad is important. The new ERASMUS+ programme, which will become evident as it is rolled out, is geared to try to enhance young people’s skills and try to make them job\n-\nready.\nQ157 &#xa0; \n \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: I wo\nuld like to pick up on the different elements of the actions the EU is taking\n. There is \nthe \nyouth employment \nprogramme\n: \nthe Youth Guarantee\n. T\nhen there is the Youth Employment Initiative\n,\n with the extra money that has been found\n of \n€6 billion. There is als\no an emphasis \non \nsome of the European \nS\nocial \nF\nund programme \nnow being \ndevoted to creating employment opportunities for younger people. You mentioned that you had been running seminars. I know it is early to \njudge \nhow the latter part of these programmes \nis \nworking, but you mentioned that there was a feeling that there was a lack of co-ordination. Can you elaborate on that? Where do you think there is a lack of co-operation and what could be done to try to change it? Are we getting best value from these initiatives or could more be done?\nEmer Costello: In the first instance, a lot will depend on how the \nyouth employment initiatives are rolled \nout. To date, there are a number of issues. In \nIreland\n there have been a number of training agencies and vocational and education training boards. A lot of changes \nare\n \ntaking\n place in relation to that at the moment. There are community employment initiatives and vocational training programmes. Sometimes there is not as much co-operation as there might be between the various different elements that are involved. I think that was one of the issues that \nRuairí \nQuinn saw when he took on the role of Minister for Education: there are labour activation courses\n, \nthere is community employment\n,\n and then there are education programmes. The training courses were operated through what w\nere\n then the FÁS centres, and they came und\ner the Department of Enterprise, Trade \nand Employment, whereas a lot of the education programmes came out of the Department of Education\n and Skills\n. So in \nIreland\n there is an attempt to try to co-ordinate \nthat\n now to see if we can come up with a more comprehensive system.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: In a sense, you are trying to bring the business side closer to education.\nEmer Costello: Yes. \nT\nhe other thing that we are \ndoing\n is \nrolling\n out the new Intreo centres\n. That\n means when a person finds themsel\nves\n unemployed and they turn up at an employment exchange for the first time to sign on, it is not that they are going in to sign on and receive money\n; t\nhey are going to a centre that is going to facilitate their entry back into the workforce as quickly as possible\n. S\no the Intreo centres are not just places where people collect their cheques or sign on for their giros or whatever\n; they are places \nthey will go to where they will be provided with job advice and counselling. A personalised training and education programme can be put in place for that person. That is something \nthat \nI think has been missing\n,\n and the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, is very keen that we should try to activate that.\nThat is where the Youth Guarantee will be very important. The Youth Guarantee is supposed to be based on a rights-based approach that will look at the needs of the person, rather than just try\ning\n to slot people into the existing provision. As somebody who was a counsellor and worked very much underground in my local area, I could see the problem, too, \nwhere\n you do one course, you do one programme\n,\n and all of a sudden you are told it is two years before you can do anything else. Having done a programme or having done a course a person will say, “I know that I need to get the skills in this particular area”. But when they try to get the skills in that particular area they are told, “Sorry, because you have done this programme you are not entitled to do anything further for another two years. Go away and come back to us in two years’ time”. That is an absolutely crazy situation to have. So I think that rolling out the Intreo centres will be quite useful.\nThe other thing I mentioned is that we are reviewing the apprenticeship programme at the moment. A lot of the youth organisations said that it is really important that the Youth Guarantee and the youth programmes that we have should be voluntary\n:\n that young people should not be compelled to take part in them. Certainly, there is a major carrot involved for them\n,\n because since we \nbegan\n to discuss this\n, \nas you are probably aware\n \nthe budget situation in \nIreland\n has become quite serious. We had a very difficult budget. We had to take\n €2.5 billion out of our economy in the last budget in October. There was a request by the \nt\nroika to take €3.1 billion out of the economy but the Labour Party insisted that no more than €2.5 billion would be taken out of the economy. From my perspective, o\nne of the more painful and difficult budgetary decisions was the decision to reduce the level of benefits that are given to young people. So there is a substantial incentive given to young people to start training programmes. They will certainly be paid much more than they would be paid if they were unemployed and claiming unemployment benefit.\nQ158 &#xa0; \n \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: I would like to pursue the question of who does what\n best.\n You are making a strong case for the EU being involved in doing things, and that the \nYouth Guarantee\n \nis \none of those\n. What things \ndo you think \nare better done at \nthat sort of level by the European Union\n and what \nthings are better done \nby member states? \nHow would you rate that problem?\nEmer Costello: I \nthink\n that the European Union \nthrough \nthe \nprovision of funding\n, \nsuch as provided by the Youth Guarantee\n \nor the European Social Fund\n, \nshould\n provide \nmember states with \nthe \ncapacity to \ndeliver what is needed. I do not see it as, “This set of actions is youth actions and this set of funding is national\n action\ns”\n. \nT\nhat\n is i\nmportant as we try to develop \na \nEuropean framework of qualifications and \ntry to address a proper system of \nmutual recognition\n of qualifications across the EU\n.\nFrom that point of view, while \nmember states are \nvery \nwell equipped to design \nand develop \ntheir own\n national qualification systems and work within that\n, \nit is important that there is a \nco-ordination and transparency of qualifications \nacross the European Union, which will \nfacilitate \nthe \nmobility and \nthe \nfreedom of movement\n of workers across the EU\n. It is \nvery \ndifficult to have the mobility that \nthe \nEU aspires to\n, and \nwhich \nthe internal market would say we should have, \nif we do not have \na\n mutual recognition of \nqualifications. There is an i\nmportant role for the EU there\n to come up with some funding for it\n,\n but I would not say that one is exclusive of the other\n.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: \nHow do you rate \nthe way in which the various \nEU policies\n have been applied in \nIreland\n? How would you rate the effectiveness of the different policies?\nEmer Costello: \nI\n would say that \nI\nreland\n is one of the \nreal \nsuccess stories\n of EU funding\n. \nThe European Social Fund is particularly important. Last year we \ncelebrated 40 years\n since our entry into the European Union and the referendum\n. \nI think \nIreland\n and the \nUK\n entered at the same time. \nAt the time \nIreland\n \nentered the EU, \nfrom our perspective\n there have been \nhuge advances\n,\n because joining the \nEuropean Union\n, \nor the Common Market as it was called then\n, \nopened up a huge market. Quite frankly, before that \nIreland\n \nwas \nvery dependent on \nthe \nUK\n’s\n cheap food policy. We were seen as \na mechanism for \nproviding \nthe \nUK\n with food\n,\n but \nwe had \ndifficult\ny \nreach\ning\n markets \noutside of that. One of the s\nuccess\nes of \nIreland\n’s entry into the European Union \nwas \nworkers\n’\n and women’s rights. \nI am not sure what the situation was in the \nUK\n at the time, but when we joined the European Union there was a\n marriage bar for women in the Civil Service\n; women had to resign from the Civil Service once they got married\n.\nThe Chairman: That was not so in the \nUK\n.\nEmer Costello: \nThat\n was not so in the \nUK\n but we had that in \nIreland\n. There was the whole equality treatment in terms of social protection\n, b\nut one of the big areas that helped \nIreland\n \nto \nadvance, with its entry into the European Union, was the d\nevelopment of \nthe \ni\nnstitutes of \nt\nechnology\n,\n or the regional technical colleges as they were called at the \ntime\n. This \ngoes\n back to the whole idea \nof \nvocational training. Instead of developing \na whole series \nof universities\n—we had three or four universities\n:\n \nas much as we could \nsustain\n—we developed a lot of the \nregional technical c\nolleges \nin strategic locations. \nMy own hometown, Dundalk—although I represent Dublin and I have l\nived in Dublin \nlonger than I have lived anywhere else, I am \noriginally from Dundalk\n, which is just on the border between Dublin and Belfast—had a very \nblighted history\n in many ways,\n being a border town\n, and it had developed a certain reputation over the years as well.\nThe Chairman: \nB\nandit country\n.\nEmer Costello: \nSo they say. I would not necessarily agree with that, but it s\nuffered \nthe \nconsequences of being a \ntown on the \nborder\n. \nI\nt developed an \ninstitute\n—an RTC—which is now an \ninstitute of technology\n, and that \nhas \ncontributed to the overall development of the \ntown \nand \nits\n ability \nto attract \nmajor \nindustr\nies there\n.\n So I think that \nIreland\n does demonstrate success. Also, the \nstructural fund \nhas helped us \nto \nd\nevelop a \nwhole \nroad network\n,\n and \nour \ninfrastructure\n to a large extent\n. Becoming a member of the \nEuropean Union\n was hugely beneficial to \nIreland\n, no more so than \nthe whole area of \nthe Social Fund, the development of \neducation and training programmes\n through the ESF\n. \nI know that the s\ntate \nt\nraining \na\ngency developed\n, \napart from the \nregional technical colleges\n, \nmany programmes \nthat are \nfunded \nthrough\n ESF \nas well. M\nany \nof the \nparticipants \nin those programmes \nbecame highly skilled \nand were able to go on to \nmake \nIreland\n \nthe \nknowledge economy \nthat it is now, \nan economy that \nis capable of attracting \nhigh-end industry. We have had \na lot of \nvarious different member states\n come to \nIreland\n to see how \nIreland\n has drawn down the Social Fund as well.\nQ159 &#xa0; \n \nThe Chairman: It is a great example and we all know it. \nW\nhat has happened in \nIreland\n \nis r\nammed down our throats all the time\n, which is great\n. \nThe point is \nthat \nw\ne are \nwhere we are and we are \nall affected by \nthis high \nyouth unemployment\n, which has \nlong-term\n effects on whether people who are out of work for any length of time are ever going to be employable again, and all the social problems that you have mentioned.\nI am told w\ne are running out of time\n, so I will ask you the q\nuestion\n. T\no what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand-side, the availability of jobs, and how well are young people prepared for the labour market with regard to their skills or employability?\nEmer Costello: This is another big issue\n that has come up\n. \nPeople say, “\nThe \nYouth Guarantee says\n that a young person \nwill be made \na quality offer\n \nwithin four months \nof leaving full-time employment or education”. \nPerhaps we could \ntouch on \nthat \nbefore we finish: a quality offer\n of an apprenticeship, \na \ntraining \nplace \nor education place\n,\n and \nan offer of a place \nwithin four months\n. T\nhe question \ncomes up, “Well,\n what happens at the end of th\nat training\n period if the jobs are not there\n?”\n.\n \nI suppose in the first instance, while we are e\nxperiencing \nthe\n downturn\n,\n \nit is important that we have people who are job\n-\nready for when the economy does actually recover. So t\nhere \nis very much that, but I think there \nhas to be dual action in preparing people for \nthe \njob market without \nbeing able to \nprovid\ne the jobs\n. That\n can be difficult. You can do so much in trying to address the s\nkills mismatch\n, which I mentioned earlier\n.\n I think \nit is\n hugely important \nto\n address the skills mismatch\n. \nAt the same time, t\nhere will be people who \nwill \nemerge from these \ntraining \nprogrammes\n with the expectation of getting a job\n. \nThat is why, from my point of view and from \nthe perspective of \nmy p\nolitical group here \nin\n \nthe \nEuropean Parliament\n, \nEurope\n \nneed\ns\n to come up with \nan injection of stimulus\n or growth that will see growth in the economy that will help create jobs.\nQ160 &#xa0; \n \nThe Chairman: I \nwill \njust throw a s\ntatistic\n at you. I do not know whether it is true or false and perhaps you can tell me\n. \nThe \nIrish \nPrime Minister \nsaid \nthat if all \nthe \nIT job\ns that were\n vacan\nt\n in \nIreland\n \nwere filled \nthere \nwould be no youth unemployment. In other words, the jobs are there \nbut \nthe \nskills are not. \nW\ne a\nll think we are brilliant at IT, but \nwe are not, with \nall \nthe new developments in IT. \nIf the EU has to be involved in \ntrying to \ndivvy up the whole thing, would it not be better to \nbe doing something specifically \naim\ned\n at IT training\n in every member state?\nEmer Costello: \nCertainly i\nn a country like Ireland \nIT training \nis \nparticularly important. I am \nnot familiar with \nthat particular \nquote from the Taoiseach\n, Enda Kenny\n. W\nhat I would say is that I know a number of companies \nthat \ndo locate \nto\n \nIreland\n, \nparticularly some of the IT companies\n, \nm\nay locate some \nof their \nsales position\ns there\n. \nOne of t\nhe \nhuge problems is \nlanguages. The \nC\nommissioner had an interesting perspective on this\n. I had a meeting with him some months ago\n in relation to \nthe \nroll-out of \nthe Youth Guarantee\n.\n \nI said that p\neople \nfrom countries like \nIreland\n \nare going to \nAmerica\n, \nCanada\n, \nAustralia\n and \nNew Zealand\n, and he \nsaid \nthat \nit is interesting\n to see\n, when you look at the level of vacancies across the European Union, \nthat \nthey are c\nhoosing to travel \nnot across the European Union but to \ndifferent continents\n. That is very often because they travel to a continent\n where the\ny have\n a language affinity.\nThe Chairman: Yes, exactly.\nEmer Costello: \nN\not only IT training\n but the way we t\neach languages \nin schools \nis \ngoing to have \nto be revised. \nWe have to look at producing people who have high quality language skills.\nThe Chairman: Yes, that is absolutely right.\n \nLook, t\nhis has been \nfascinating \nand we could stay here for another hour \nbut \nunfortunately \nwe are being booted out. \nWell, not as inelegantly as that. I am sure \nthat \nlots of \nideas will \ncome to \nyou \nover the next few days, so can I ask if you could \njot them down to \nhelp us in our report and to \nfurther our discussions\n?\n W\ne \nare almost at the end of witness taking so we would be most grateful.\nEmer Costello: \nC\nan I leave these with you\n?\n These are c\nopies of my report. \nI had another m\neeting in Tallaght in November. \nThat is annexed there. That\n is \nthe\n full report \nof \nall\n the meetings that I \nheld with \nthe \nstakeholders. \nThe names of the stakeholders who attended the meetings are there\n, s\no even though y\nou will not be familiar\n with the organisations it will give you an idea of who they are and what we did\n.\n I will leave you with all the copies of those that I have, and I will give you a c\nopy of \nthe\n speech \nthat I gave \nat \nthe \nlast \nmeeting because that \ntried \nto encapsulate some of the issues that came up at some of the other meetings.\nThe Chairman: If you were in my position now, what questions would you be asking you?\nEmer Costello: \nWow, now there is a question. \nTo be honest, the questions \nthat you had here \nare \nvery \nimportant\n,\n but one \nof the \narea\ns that\n we need to look at \nis \nhow to give young people \nsome kind of ownership and \nhope. \nI\nf we are talking about youth employment initiatives, I think the \ninvolv\nement of\n young people in \nthe \nroll-out\n of those is hugely important\n.\nThe Chairman: \nWe have \nhad \nyoung people\n as witnesses\n.\nEmer Costello: I am very impressed, yes.\nThe Chairman: \nWe ha\nd them and it was really fiery\n. W\nhen I asked my first question\n about \nwhich \norganisation they go \nto \nfor jobs\n, they\n just said in front of us—\nwe are \nMembers of the House of Lords, do not forget—“\nJob Centres\n are crap\n”\n,\n and i\nt went on from there\n. \nBut \nit was good\n. They\n said they really\n felt engaged with us \nand I think they were delighted that we had \ngone to the trouble. \nWe d\nid the same in \nBirmingham\n. \nThey were tough and they b\nrought us down from \nwhatever \ncloud\n we were on. I give you \nthe \ntip \nthat \nif m\nore \nEuropean \ncountries \nactually \nask\ned\n their young people\n,\n they might get some staggering answers\n—\nnot \nthat they would \nnecessarily use that word\n. \nI think that w\ne have covered that\n, but if you think of any other points that we should cover because we only have a few weeks left\n.\nEmer Costello: The other issue \nthat I mentioned to you wa\ns the quality framework\n, which I believe is h\nugely important. \nIf we are developing internships and placement programmes or whatever, it is important that we develop\n that framework\n. I know \nthat \nthe \nCommission has moved towards develop\ning a quality framework \nfor \ntraineeships and \ninternships\n. \nT\nhat has to be developed and improved on\n. T\nhere is a\n possibility \nthat they \ncould be open to abuse\n,\n but a\nt the same time \nI \nbelieve that internships can p\nrovide a major stepping stone\n into employment\n. T\nhey are good for employers\n, and \nthey are good for employees. It g\nive\ns them a chance to try\n each \nother out\n,\n and \nthat \nis very important.\nQ161 &#xa0; \n \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: A\nre you working \nat trying to develop a framework for those\n?\nEmer Costello: \nYes, \nwe\n are, but I think i\nt has to come with a contract. I\nt has to come with something that says \nthat \na certain level of skills \nwill be \ndelivered. I\ndeally\n,\n \nI would like to see it come with \nan accreditation process\n at the end, which perhaps could be tied into the accreditation of p\nrior learning\n. Therefore the\n skills derived over a period \nof training \nin a job placement \nwould be accredited in \nsome\n way, so that somebody w\nould \nhave something that sits within the European \nq\nualifications \nf\nramework\n that \nthey could see.\nThe Chairman: Thank you so much.\nEmer Costello: I hope that that was useful.\nThe Chairman: In fact, \nwe are not being booted out but you are.\nEmer Costello: That is fine\n as\n I have other places to go to. It was nice to see you.\nThe Chairman: It was nice to see you too.\n \n&#xa0;\n"
