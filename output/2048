defaultAlison Sharman – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultDeregulation Billdefault – Rights of waydefault&#xa0;defaultMany green lanes in national parks – areas set aside for peaceful recreation – have for many years been threatened by serious damage caused by unregulated use of recreational 4x4 and trail bikes.  These vehicles rut up the ground and are a nuisance to other park users through noise and pollution.  Unsealed surfaces cannot withstand modern transport and I have witnessed many lanes that have been destroyed beyond repair by motorised recreational vehicles.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would like the Deregulation Bill to enable the protection of unsealed 
default(i.e. not surfaced with tarmac) 
defaultgreen lanes in national parks by including a clause: 
default&#xa0;
defaultAll unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as NOT being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.default&#xa0;defaultThis clause will effectively allow motorised vehicles that need access to premises (farm vehicles etc.)
default,  along
default with pedestrians, horses, horse-drawn carriages and cyclists to travel along green lanes, but prevent
default access to
default recreational vehicles.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, I wish to see a further clause to give local communities greater influence to determine the management of green lanes in their areas: 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. default&#xa0;
defaultI am a member of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) and support the formal submissions made by them to this enquiry, along with those of the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG) and the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA).
