default&#xa0;
defaultOur member organisations represent people who have any or all of the characteristics protected in the 2010 Equality Act and one of our key concerns is that everyone should have the same rights to access to justice regardless of their 
defaultage, disability, gender and gender identity, race, religion
default&#xa0;
defaultor belief, and sexual orientation (unless there is a good reason why this is not appropriate). 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this submission we address in particular questions 3, 7, 8 and 18-20 of the questions the Committee raised in its request for evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe understand that the draft Deregulation Bill 
defaultis intended to reduce the burden of regulation on business, civil society and individuals. It is important that regulation should serve a useful purpose and be both proportionate and effective. We therefore see the value of considering whether there are any regulations that do not meet these standards. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of the clauses in the draft Bill are concerned with areas outside our remit so we are not commenting on them. However, we are concerned that the clauses of the draft Bill that fall within our remit would not reduce burdens and could in themselves be damaging. Clause 2 (which deals with 
defaultEmployment Tribunals power to make recommendations (Equality Act 2010, section 124)) 
defaultwould remove a useful power that is not burdensome and has the potential to help employers to be more effective. 
defaultClause 58 proposes a new 
defaultduty for regulators that could in 
defaultitself
default be burdensome
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 2 – Employment Tribunal’s power to make recommendations default&#xa0;
defaultWe are strongly opposed to this clause: even the Government appears to have 
defaultacknowledged
default that there is no evidence that this tribunal power is a burden.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe power enabling Employment Tribunals to make ‘an appropriate recommendation’ to an employer as a possible remedy when the Employment Tribunal has made a finding of unlawful discrimination is a relatively new power. It applies to cases where the action complained of occurred after October 1st 2010. A consideration of the use and efficacy of this new provision ought to take into account the fact that it has been available for use for significantly less than three years. As a result there is as yet limited information about its impact.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is striking that the Government states in its May 2012 consultation document, ‘we are unaware that
default 
defaultany such recommendations have been made since the commencement of the Equality Act 2010’
default and yet proposes to remove this power. The recommendation to remove it appears to have been made even though the Government has no evidence that it is a burden to anyone. Instead, they argue that there ‘is no evidence, so far, to show that 
defaultthe extended power is necessary or that it is an appropriate or effective remedy’.
default It is certainly rather early to evaluate the impact of the power but we think what evidence there is suggests it will help to improve employment practice and reduce the incidence of discrimination.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no evidence that the power is burdensomedefault&#xa0;
defaultWe would draw your attention particularly to the following points:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe consultation impact analysis appears to suggest that this provision when operating as expected will affect 0-3% of employment tribunal cases, suggested as likely to be 17 cases a year, and that these recommendations leading to changes in employer practices and policies may help to prevent further discrimination cases being brought.
default If this estimate is correct, it is difficult to argue that the power will generate burdens. On the contrary, improving employer practices is likely to generate a net benefit by preventing further employment tribunal cases, even if there is a small outlay in training for managers etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany tribunal cases result from poor human resource management, so there is a public interest in improving practice in this area, particularly in the equality field. An employment case raising equality issues will be heard either by a panel of three (one of whom will be an employer’s representative) who will have huge experience of human resource practice or by a single very experienced judge. It is in the public interest that their insight into the shortcomings (if there be any) in the human resource management of an 
defaultorganisation
default is put to good use through a general recommendation where they judge this to be appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that the Government observed, ‘employers often make changes to their policies and practices, anyway, as a result of a tribunal finding, without the need for a recommendation’.
default We cannot see that this is a good reason for depriving Tribunals of this useful tool designed to assist employers and trade unions to remove the continuing effects of structural and systemic discrimination in the workplace. The purpose of this power is to deal with those that don’t improve their practices in response to tribunal cases and to help focus those that would benefit from expert assistance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public after all pays for the tribunal system. If a tribunal considers that systematic shortcomings in an employer’s practice have come to light it makes every sense that they should be able to make recommendations as to how they are put right. It may be said that to prohibit them from using their discretion in this way, as the government proposes to do, would be a waste of public resources!
default&#xa0;
defaultEvidence of the value of the powerdefault&#xa0;
defaultContrary to the Government’s assertion that there is no evidence that this is an effective power there are already some cases where this power has been used. For example in 2011 it was used in:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012 it was used more frequently: 
defaultan 
defaultEqual Opportunities Review
default survey records
default 19 occasions when tribunals used their power to make wider recommendations. These recommendations mainly concerned provision for training for managers, improvement of internal processes and record keeping. For example:
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen a recommendation is made, it is to be expected that it will lead to better employment practice and prevent further cases of discrimination, with their associated costs. There is no evidence that it has been abused or in any other way misused.
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment Tribunals are obliged to send copies of all discrimination cases to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The Commission will then look at the cases where recommendations have been made and decide whether it is appropriate and proportionate to contact the employer and offer further assistance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe EDF strongly urges the committee to recommend the removal of this clause. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 58 - new defaultduty for regulators to have regard to promoting economic growth when they reach decisionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultAt a time when the Government is keen to reduce burdens it is difficult to understand why a new duty on regulators is being proposed. Regulators already work within a number of well recognised frameworks. In particular the Hampton Principles, which have been in place since 2005, were introduced as a result of a report on ‘
defaultReducing
default administrative burdens: effective inspection and enforcement’.
default  Regulators’ compliance with these principles has been evaluated by the Better Regulation Executive.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Hampton principles were developed to reduce unnecessary administration for businesses, without compromising the UK's regulatory regime and they are recognised as the standard with which regulators should comply. They provide that ‘Regulators should recognize that a key element of their activity will be to allow, or even encourage, economic progress and only to intervene when there is a clear case for protection’. We would therefore question why any further provisions are needed. Any case for additional regulation in this area should be based on evidence either that the Hampton Principles are not being applied or that they do not work. We are not aware of any such evidence having been produced to support the new duty being proposed in this draft Bill. We are also not aware of any consultation about this proposal with civil society organisations that have an interest in the work of non-economic regulators. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf Ministers have evidence that regulators are acting in ways that would impede economic growth without adequate justification, this evidence should be made public so that there can be a considered debate about what a proportionate response to any problems might be. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are very concerned that the promoting economic growth duty will compromise the independence of regulators. In the case of the EHRC, it would jeopardise the Commission’s UN accreditation as an A rated national human rights institution. We are also concerned about the position of other non-economic regulators whose remit encompasses equality or human rights, such as the Children’s Commissioners and the Information Commissioner.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are a number of factors behind this concern about the compromising of regulators’ independence:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTaken as a whole, clauses 58-61 would give Ministers considerable powers to intervene in how regulators created by Parliament do their jobs, with very limited parliamentary scrutiny of how Ministers would use these new powers. Some of the regulators likely to be affected by these clauses have functions of constitutional significance, such as protecting vulnerable individuals against abuse or intrusive uses of state power. It would be wrong for Ministers to have the power to be able potentially to undermine the role of independent regulators in this way. We therefore think clauses 58-61 should be removed from the draft Bill. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that other Parliaments have addressed this in a more balanced way. The Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill, section 4 is significantly different:
default&#xa0;
defaultRegulators’ duty in respect of sustainable economic growth 
default(1) In exercising its regulatory functions, each regulator must contribute to achieving sustainable economic growth, 
defaultexcept to the extent that it would be inconsistent with the exercise of those functions to do so 
default(our italics).
default&#xa0;
defaultIf clause 58 is retained in the draft Bill, a similar qualification would be necessary.
