[[[Corpus Christi College, University of Cambridge]]]&#xa0;Military Casualties: Alternatives to Tort Compensation&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;The Ministry of Defence should undertake to pay full tort damages for all deaths and injuries sustained during active operations on a no-fault basis, as the quid pro quo for removing the right to sue in tort (e.g. for negligence).  (Crown immunity can be revived by the Secretary of State’s making a suitable Order under the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987; it has previously been suggested that this should be done to reverse Smith v. Ministry of Defence to avert that decision’s likely pernicious influence on military effectiveness.)&#xa0;About the Author&#xa0;Dr. Jonathan Morgan is Fellow, Tutor and Director of Studies in Law at Corpus Christi College and University Lecturer in Tort Law, University of Cambridge.  He is active as a teacher and researcher in the fields of tort and public law.  He is one of the editors of Hepple and Matthews’ Cases and Materials on Tort.  Publications in the specific field of public authority liability include “Policy reasoning in tort law: The courts, the Law Commission and the critics” (2009) 125 Law Quarterly Review 215, and a case-note on the Court of Appeal’s decision in Smith v. Ministry of Defence, “Negligence: Into Battle” [2013] Cambridge Law Journal 14.  Articles on human rights law include “Amateur Operatics: The Realization of Parliamentary Protection of Civil Liberties” in Campbell, Ewing and Tomkins (eds), The Legal Protection of Human Rights: Sceptical Essays (Oxford 2011).&#xa0;Military Casualties: Alternatives to Tort Compensation&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the Scheme should continue without change to treat injuries, illness or death due to service in the same way, irrespective of the precise cause, because it is the act of joining up and signalling willingness to make a sacrifice that distinguishes those who serve.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0; Ministry of Defence, Review of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, Cm 7798 (2010) 2.88. The Boyce Review noted that there would also be practical difficulties in drawing the boundary of active operations—e.g. “travel to and from operational duty, training to deploy, plus those in posts where individuals are predominantly not on operations but travel to operations occasionally”, ibid 2.85.
