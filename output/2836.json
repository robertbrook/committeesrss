"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Albert Kennedy Trust&#xa0;\nThe Albert Kennedy Trust (AKT) is a \ncharity that has been working with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) young people \naged \n25 and under\n,\n \nwho\n are homeless or in crisis at home\n,\n since 1989. \nW\nith offices in London, Manchester and, from this year, Newcastle, w\ne provide a \nrange\n of services, including advice and assessment, advocacy, me\nntoring, residential services, peer support and training. \n&#xa0;\nA ye\nar away from our 25th anniversary\n as a charity\n, and with many of the larger legislative issues for LGBT people now addressed by this and previous governments, we are nevertheless still seeing the same issues arise for young LGBT people as they struggle to \nsustain\n their lives in their family homes. We maintain that withdrawing the support that currently enables young people to live away from \nunsafe or unsuitable\n family homes will disproportionately affect young LGBT people in a negative way. \n&#xa0;\nThis submissio\nn has been drafted at short notice, but AKT staff and trustees are very willing to enter into more detailed discussion with the Select Committee on this and other relevant points.\n Please contact Tim \nSigsworth\n, Chief Executive: \ntim@akt.org.uk\n.\n&#xa0;Over the past two years, the homelessness sector has seen a \nsignificant \nrise in demand for services. \nThe Rough Sleeper Statistics repor\nts for 2011 and 2012 \nshowed an aggregate 30\n% rise in street homelessness\n, and statutory acceptances have risen by 24% over the same period (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/homelessness-statistics)\n. \n&#xa0;\nBy compari\nson\n, over the last 3 years\n, AKT has seen a \n97% rise in new contacts in Londo\nn, and a 78% rise in Manchester.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMeanwhile, the capacity of the \nhomelessness \nsector is shrinking. \n Homeless Link reported that 2012 saw reductions in funding for 58% of projects, with frontline staff reductions in 28%. \n24 night cover services, 22 floating support services, 18 outreach services, 15 \naccommodation services, and 3 day centres closed last y\near. Services reported reduced outcomes for clients in terms of employment (44%) and accommodation (38%). The same period saw LGBT-specific services shrink from 11% to \njust \n3% of the sector (\nhttp://homeless.org.uk/sites/default/files/SNAP2012%20fullreport.pdf\n).\n&#xa0;\n4.1&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrevalenceAnecdotal evidence from homelessness services has long maintained that there is a large LGBT youth homeless \npopulation; t\nhere \nis \nalso some\n \nsocial research suggesting \na sizeable disproportion\n of LGBT people in the youth homelessness population\n, particularly in urban areas with LGBT cultural hubs. \nDunne et al (2002) found an estimate of 26% LG\nBT people among the y\nouth \nhomelessness population from homeless agencies in London\n (this compares to an estimated 9% prevalence of LGBT people among the general population).\n Browne and Davis (2008) found a \n22% \nprevalence of \nhomelessness among a sizeable sample of LGBT people l\niving and working in Brighton (this compares to around 8% prevalence of homelessness within the general population).\n By contrast, in the US, where state support for homeless people is far lower, the estimated prevalence of LGBT people in t\nhe young homeless population is between 25% and \n40% (\nKruks, 1991; Noel and Ochs, 2001; Cochran et al, 2002).\n&#xa0;\n4.2&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPresenting issues4.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHomelessnessIn 2012-13, 63% of young people in London and 30% of those in Manchester gave homelessness as their primary reason \nfor contacting us. The majority of those who contact AKT, particularly in London, are already homeless or living in an unsustainable situation which will result in imminent homelessness.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFamily rejectionThe great majority of young people who contact AKT have faced rejection from their families. Many have been asked to leave their homes on coming out (or being outed, an increasing phenomenon in the age of social media). Some have faced violence and abuse, \nsome face psychological or religious reparative 'therapies' or rituals, forced marriage or corrective rape (see s4.2.3\n and s4.2.4\n, below). Though AKT seeks to reconnect young people with their families wherever it is safe and appropriate to do so, this rem\nains a minority of cases. Many young people, once settled and independent after a period of homelessness, do reconnect with their families at some level, but those who are forced to move back home for lack of options elsewhere\n often face the same issues an\nd \nagain become homeless because of them.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDomestic violenceWhile only 6% of young people gave domestic violence as their primary reason for contacting AKT last year, \nmany \nof those who were already or imminently homeless had experienced\n domestic violence. The majority were experiencing violence from family members \nrather than\n from partners, which makes accessing services particularly difficult: though definitions\n of domestic violence\n in homelessness law include familial violence on young\n people, in practice the vast majority of domestic violence services are aimed at women experiencing partner violence; they are not designed for young people of all genders fleeing violence from their \nfamilies\n.\n Domestic violence includes physical, emotiona\nl, sexual, psychological, financial and verbal abuse. It is AKT's position that frequently and stridently expressed homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language and attitudes are forms of emotional abuse when experienced by LGBT young people in their fami\nly context. Many of \nthose who contact us have experienced several kinds of abuse from their families over a sustained period of time. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForced marriage, religious abuse and 'honour'-based violenceAKT sees a small but steadily growing number of cases where\n young LGBT people have faced increased risks to their safety and wellbeing because of religious and cultural belief. We see a variety of backgrounds in this work, which \nin mainstream provision\n tends to be aimed at British Muslim women. We have seen cases \nof young people from Pentecostal, Jehovah's Witness, Salvation Army and Irish Traveller backgrounds as well as those from Muslim backgrounds. Of these young people the largest \nproportion have \nPentecostal Christian backgrounds. AKT works with these young pe\nople to help them find safe and \npositive\n homes, \nsupportive\n new networks, and legal protection. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSexual exploitationAround 65% of young gay and bisexual men and around 35% of young trans women working with AKT have exchanged sex for a place to stay. Sexua\nl exploitation of LGBT young homeless people is common: the lack of relevant sex education, the power imbalance between older and younger people, and the club culture prevalent in LGBT commercial hubs all contribute to a situation in which too often, LGBT \nyoung homeless people are not offered an opportunity to meaningfully consent to safe sex. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMental healthOf the 22% of \nour clients\n who count themselves as disabled, the most commonly reported form of disability is mental \nillness\n. Many of those who do not see themselves as disabled are also in varying levels of mental health distress. \nA considerable amount of research has shown that LGBT people, and particularly LGBT youth, are more vulnerable to mental health difficulties than he\nterosexual comparison groups. In particular studies have shown that there are higher rates of attempted suicide and depressive illness in the LGB population (Bagley and Tremblay, 1997, Garofalo et al., 1998, Bagley and D'Augelli, 2000, Webb and Wright, 200\n1, King et al., 2003a). One study of LGB youth report that 39% have attempted suicide compared to 6-10% of the general youth population (Rotherum-Borus et al., 1994); another recent study in Northern Ireland found that 27.1% of young gay or bisexual men ha\nd attempted suicide (McNamee, 2006). One study of LGBT youth (some of whom had been homeless) found that 64% of transgender youth had attempted suicide (Carolan and Redmond, 2003)\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDebt, sanctions and rent arrearsThe majority of young people accessing AK\nT's services are claiming benefits for at least some of the time they work with us and over the last year, as the value of benefits has fallen below inflation, we have seen young people resort increasingly to expensive forms of credit.Â  Many have debts fro\nm mobile phone contracts; some have payday loans. Without the means to address these issues robustly they will often fall into rent arrears and risk losing their accommodation and making future tenancies far harder to find. At the same time we have begun t\no notice a pattern of benefit sanctions being applied to young homeless people who may be unable to meet the demands of their jobseeking agreements, or attend courses or placements while homeless. Young homeless people on sanctions also soon fall into rent\n arrears, as they are unable to pay the rent contributions which homeless hostels require; we have even seen some cases of young people being evicted from homeless hostels for this reason.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLGBT migrantsOver the last year, the number of LGBT migrants app\nroaching AKT for support has increased significantly, particularly in London. Though relatively few have made asy\nlum claims, and most are in the UK on student or working visas, they tend to be strongly motivated to stay by experiences of violence, oppressi\non and discrimination in their home countries. \nA \nthorough\n analysis of the \nhousing and homelessness \nissues facing LGBT asylum seekers\n can be found here: http://www.metropolitan.org.uk/images/Over-Not-Out.pdf\n \n&#xa0;\nAKT would suggest that given the likely disproportion of LGBT people in the young homeless population, the recent rise in homelessness is leading to a disproportionately large number of young homeless LGBT people who face serious barriers both in services \nand in their ability to reconnect with their families and/ or enter employment or education. Simultaneously, there has been a reduction in LGBT-specific services that might help to address those issues. \nBoth these factors are resulting in a vastly increase\nd demand for services like AKT. Young LGBT people face a variety of complex issues and barriers folded in to their experience of family rejection and homelessness; i\nt is AKT's \ncontention\n that \nthey\n should not be forced by lack of services or support to retu\nrn to homes where they face violence and abuse, including the emotional abuse caused by homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.Â  \n&#xa0;\n10 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
