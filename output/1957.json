"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Alex Henney (CLC061)&#xa0;\nI studied engineering at the universities of Bristol and Virginia and some economics at the LSE.  I was on the board of London Electricity.  In  February 1987 I was the first person in Britain to propose a competitive restructuring of the electric industry.  Following the election of June 1987 I was involved with Secretary of State Cecil Parkinson and civil servants in the early days of restructuring.  Subsequently I have worked on electric markets from Norway to New Zealand via North America.  I wrote “The British Electric Industry 1990-2010: the rise and demise of competition”.  My interest in climate science was stimulated by the effect it has had on the British government’s belief in anthropogenic climate warming, which has led to very expensive policies for renewables and nuclear power.\n&#xa0;“\nNullius in verba\n” (Take nobody’s word for it)\n – \nThe motto of the Royal Society\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nSummary\n&#xa0;\nTwo of the questions the Committee asks are “Which voices are trusted in the public discourse on climate science and policy.  What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government, and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?” There is unfortunately a fundamental problem in Britain because the official “voices” are all avowedly “warmist” and believe that anthropogenic effects are driving climate warming (ACW), and do not provide a balanced picture of climate science.  \n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe distortions of science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC is wedded to the view that \n“Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperature since the mid-twentieth century is 90% probable due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations”\n.  It is, unfortunately, \na politicized body which \nhas endorsed some very dubious and manipulated science in support of this line including:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGiven the influence of the Met Office and that the British government has to sign off the Summaries for Policy Makers in Stockholm on 23-26 September, we can expect that the forthcoming IPCC Assessment Reports will be more of the same, regardless of the genuine science.\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC’s Scientific Working Group Reports should be treated with extreme caution.  While some are scientifically sound, there is some sloppy work and some is politically slanted to meet the IPCC view of ACW and its undesirable consequences. The models claiming to project or predict future climate change are not worth the code they are written in. The Summaries for Policymakers should be treated as politically correct group think and ignored.&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe Met Office bias\n&#xa0;Starting with John Houghton, its former Chief Executive (1983-91), the Met Office has had, and continues to have, considerable influence on the IPCC reports.  Like the IPCC the Met Office is an ardent “warmist”.  A climate scientist commented of the Met Office’s chief \nscientist “\nJulia [Slingo] is an advocate and won't let anything come in or out of her office that doesn't meet the gatekeeping requirements of global warming disaster.”  \nAnother scientist commented \n“The Met Office is a major employer of scientists and has long had a policy of only appointing and working with those who subscribe to their views on manmade global warming”\n.  \n&#xa0;\nA set of case examples which I was sent in support of the Met Office’s claim that extreme weather events were due to ACW did not substantiate the claim – they were insubstantial.  Likewise the current attempt by the Met Office to explain away the “Recent pause in global warming” of 15 years by alleging that the heat resulting from the increase in CO2 has gone into the deep ocean is thin.  The “analysis” is based on string and sealing wax logic along with some dubious scientific claims for knowledge of the behaviour of the oceans; unjustified claims for measurement accuracy; and reliance on inaccurate models rather than empirical data.  With no evidence the papers conclude further “\nThe recent pause in global surface temperature rise does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century. Nor does it invalidate the fundamental physics of global warming, the scientific basis of climate models and their estimates of climate sensitivity”.  But before accepting this completely unfounded proposition we should recall that in 2007 t\nhe Met Office Hadley Centre stated “We are now using the system to predict changes out to 2014.  By the end of this period the global average temperature is expected to have risen by around \n0.3\n0\nC\n compared to 2004, and half the years after 2009 are predicted to be hotter than the current record hot year, \n1998.”\n In fact temperature remained more or less constant and none of the years have exceeded 1998.  As an Arab saying goes “He who professes to foretell the future lies, even if correct” – does the Met Office just merely lie?\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThe “scientific activism” of the Royal Society and of Government Scientific Advisers\n&#xa0;\nThe last three Presidents of the Royal Society \nand three recent Chief Scientific Advisers to the government have put their names to ACW, although climate science was not their field.  I doubt that they would take much notice if atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, and geologists were to advise the public on cosmology, zoology, chemistry, cell biology, and population biology.  \nThe Royal Society produced a report “Climate Change: A Summary of the Science” which is a thin and flawed document, overly reliant on IPCC work and computer modelling.  The Royal Society and Government Scientific Advisers have ill-advisably indulged in “scientific activism”, which is better left to “green” NGOs.  They are not living up to the Royal Society’s motto.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nThe ignorance of the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change/DECC\n&#xa0;\nIn a TV interview Ed Davey, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, made a number of claims that are incorrect, which reflected the pro-ACW scaremongering views of officials in DECC.  He could not even get the additional costs of the climate based measures he is enforcing on electric customers correct.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nThe eloquent ignorance of the Chairman of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC)\n&#xa0;\nThe chairman of the CCC recently demonstrated the limits of his knowledge of climate change economics both in a speech in the House of Lords and in an address to the Parliamentary Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group.  He in part justified spending money on reducing CO2 emissions by claiming it was like an insurance policy, and compared it to the rationale for buying fire insurance for one’s house.  Unfortunately he not only got his numbers wrong, the analogy is false.  For all his talk of “science” it is not obvious that John Gummer (who studied history) knows much about climate science beyond some basic temperature information.  Although he claims to be open, that seems doubtful given his eloquent ignorance.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n              \nWhat can be done to improve public understanding of climate science\n&#xa0;\nA fundamental point to appreciate is that while there is a vigorous (and often highly politicized) debate in the US between politicians and climate scientists who are both warmists and skeptics, there is no such debate in Britain. Most of the “political class” are supporters of ACW and some who have had an influence on renewables policies have direct financial interests in renewables projects.  There are no senior climate scientists who are skeptics in Britain and put his or her head above the parapet, perhaps because they are all on the public payroll and most seek grants which are only awarded to the politically correct.  \nThe consequence of what is effectively the suppression of free debate by “state science” is that we live in parochial little British bubble of supposed scientific consensus.&#xa0;There is currently no easy answer to the Committee’s questions from such a politicized – and too often factually ill-informed – scene.  Perhaps the only hope for an objective review would be to set up a Royal Commission consisting of an independent and balanced group which should not be stuffed with irrelevant scientific great and good.  Rather it should be headed by a judge who is noted for rigour and who preferably has a science degree.  It should include at most one person from the Met Office; two or three leading North American/ANZAC/Continental European scientists of a skeptical persuasion, and a similar number of British scientists who are preferably not behoven to government grant finding (any such grants should be declared) – none should have been involved in climategate or heavily involved in the IPCC; and either the Rt. Hon. Nigel Lawson or the Rt. Hon. Peter Lilley.  It should aim to produce a report of not more than 150 pages of main text written for intelligent lay people. It should focus on solid science, and avoid the politics, spin, and vested interests in which climate science is mired\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\nTwo of the questions the Committee asks are “Which voices are trusted in the public discourse on climate science and policy.  What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government, and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?”\n&#xa0;\nI argue that there is a fundamental problem in Britain because the official “voices” are all avowedly “warmist”, and do not provide a balanced picture of climate science, namely:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nThe distortions of science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC was set up in 1988 under the auspices of the UN Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organisation.  Membership is open to 195 governments (not to scientists per se) which are members of these two organizations. According to the Royal Society “\nThe IPCC is the world’s leading authority on climate change and its impacts\n”\n.  It has thus far published four Assessment Reports (AR) in 1990 (AR1), 1995 (AR2), 2001 (AR3), and 2007 (AR4) and the firth is due very shortly\n another is due in September 2013.  In AR4 the IPCC stated\n \n“Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperature since the mid-twentieth century is 90% probable due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations”,\n and claimed that \n“For the next two decades a warming of 0.2\n0\n&#x2011;\nC per decade is projected.”\n  The IPCC also presented in graphic detail the adverse consequences of this warming including an increase in the level of the oceans with extensive flooding; major changes in regional climates with reduction in crops and loss of bio diversity; and various threats to human health.\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC work is shared among three main Working Groups; one assesses the physical scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change; a second assesses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change; and the third assesses options for mitigating climate change.  Ostensibly these are scientific reports, which the IPCC has claimed are based on peer reviewed papers by leading scientists. The papers form the basis for the Summaries for Policy Makers which are authorised by governments.\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe scientific reports\n&#xa0;\nSome of the scientific observations are measured and cautious such as \nChapter 1 of the IPCC 2001 Scientific report (IPCC, 2001a, p.97), which reads:-\n&#xa0;\n“The fact that the global mean temperature has increased since the late 19th Century and that other trends have been observed does not necessarily mean that an anthropogenic effect on the climate system has been identified. Climate has always varied on all time-scales, so the observed change may be natural.”\n&#xa0;\nBut the IPCC has also endorsed some very dubious and manipulated science as the following examples show.\n&#xa0;\nThe cause célebre of the editing of Chapter 8, Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes, in the IPCC’s Second AR of 1995.  The lead author, American Ben Santer, excised denials of any scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate warming (ACW) which were in the draft, and replaced them with statements to make the Scientific report consistent with the Policymakers’ Summary.  This claimed that “\nThe body of statistical evidence in Chapter 8, when examined in the context of our physical understanding of the climate system, now points to a discernible human influence on the global climate\n.”\n Perhaps this editing was for the benefit of the position of the Clinton/Gore Administration at the 1997 Kyoto Conference.  \nThe hockey stick was the star of the 2001 report.  It was devised by Michael Mann and colleagues and, with the backing of John Houghton (see below), featured prominently in the 2001 Assessment.\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC “Hockey Stick”\n&#xa0;\nThe graph, which was largely based on using tree rings as a proxy temperature measure, showed a slightly decreasing temperature from 1000 to the beginning of the twentieth century, with temperatures then rising rapidly to a peak in 1998 supposedly due to industrialization producing CO2.  It eliminated the Medieval Warming Period, which possibly had higher temperatures than now but significantly less CO2 and thus spoils the claim that there is a close relationship between temperature and CO2. And it became the core of the IPCC’s claim that \n“the 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium”\n \n.\n&#xa0;\nCanadians Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick took the hockey stick analysis apart\n, showing there were many errors in the temperature data and that the algorithm used to analyse the data was biased to produce a hockey stick shape from the type of data that was used.  Their criticism was supported from a number of sources and the hockey stick was generally discredited:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProfessor Paul Reiter is a world leading specialist in the natural history and biology of mosquitoes and the epidemiology of the diseases they transmit.   He explained in a submission to the House of Lords Committee on Economic Affairs\n his experiences with the Human Population Health Chapter of AR2, AR3 and AR4.  He commented on the lack of knowledge of many of the contributors, and that the conclusions were derived from distorted scientific knowledge and taken to imply that ACW was spreading malaria and was thus deleterious to health.  His experience highlighted a significant lack of scientific competence on the part of the IPCC; a lack of integrity; and show the manner in which science is spun, including the extreme exaggeration that there was a supposed cast of 1500 (if not more) scientists who signed up to the false conclusions.\n&#xa0;\n“Himalayagate”: on 20 January 2010 the IPPC had to withdraw its claim (based on a WWF report) that the glaciers in the Himalayas were likely to melt by 2035.  \n&#xa0;\nExtreme weather events: i\nn 1996 the IPCC stated (p173) that “Overall, there is no evidence that extreme weather events, or climate variability, has increased in a global sense, through the twentieth century”, but subsequently it changed its tune. Based on modeling studies the 2007 Assessment claimed “\nthat human activities\n \nmore likely than not have contributed to an increase in tropical cyclone intensity”\n. Several knowledgeable scientists dispute this:-\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“From the broad perspective, where we consider all the extremes above, we should see a warning – that the climate system has always had within itself the capability of causing devastating events and these will certainly continue with or without human influence on the climate.”\n \n&#xa0;\nThe claim that we are causing “extreme weather events” will be in the forthcoming Assessment because Professor Julia Slingo, the Chief Scientist at the Met Office, posted a note on the Met Office’s website on 3 June 2003 to that effect.  When I challenged her for evidence I was sent a set of papers “Exploring Extreme Events of 2011 from a Climate Perspective”. It included six case studies of which three did not attribute the phenomenon to ACW, and three did.   But they assumed general ACW as a given and two used models as a basis for their analysis of the probability of the event; and the papers that assumed ACW included an author from the Met Office.   But as we show below models are not accurate; there was more surmise and “modelitis” than science in the papers; the examples were unconvincing, see \nAppendix\n 1.\n&#xa0;\nFor warmists the advantage of the proposition that extreme events maybe (or are) a consequence of ACW is that they can proclaim a steady stream of random events as demonstrating ACW, thus maintaining a flow of scare news which the media laps up.The inaccuracy of climate models: the IPCC publishes what are taken by the media as forecasts\n of climate warming, notably the figure of 0.2\no\nC warming per decade, and higher figures of 4-6\no\nC over the twenty first century.  But in fact the models are basically flawed; the proof of their pudding is in the eating. Professor Christy has recently compared the temperature predictions of 39 climate models that will be used in the forthcoming AR5 over the period 1975 to 2012 with actual measured data, see exhibit\n.  The black line is the average of the model results; the blue and red circles are the results of two satellite-based actuals; and the green squares are the Met Office surface temperature series. The models over back-cast temperature significantly.  \n&#xa0;\nExhibit               Global CMIP5 39models, 7-yr running average&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlso recently:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA consequence of the underestimation by models has been an underestimate of the natural variability of the climate and an overestimate of anthropogenic climate change:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Science at MIT, commented in a presentation to MPs last year “Climate science is immature.  It cannot forecast the past, let alone the future.”\n,\n&#xa0;\nCasual methodology: Canadian journalist Donna Laframboise spent a couple of years examining how the material in AR7 was prepared\n. She found:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The character of climate science: while it is patently obvious that climate science is highly politicised and big money hangs on it, it is also important \nto appreciate that it is not like conventional experimental laboratory science. Much of it is based on observing the chaos and complexity of a range of phenomenon and trying to make sense of it.  Often correlation is confused with causality; surmise and speculation are mistaken for science; and standards of rigour are low as illustrated by the cases cited above.  The case of the Met Office’s insubstantial story about extreme weather events, and its “explanation” of the pause in global warming.  Both consisted of a mix of surmise, speculation and spin, along with some flawed scientific claims; a reliance on models as though they were real, rather than on empirical data; and reasoning that slithers and slides and includes non-sequiturs.  If they are supposed to represent climate “science”, then they are no credit to the trade and dismissed; if they are better interpreted as political documents aimed at bolstering the positions of the IPCC and Met Office then they should also be dismissed.\n&#xa0;\nErrors in climate science can persist because the scope for experimentation is limited.  An unusual feature is the strong emphasis placed on “peer review”, which appears to replace the replication of results that is the hallmark of experimental science.  Yet peer review should not be taken too seriously:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nModelling has been thrown into the pot, and has developed a life of its own with models comparing models with each other, but often divorced from empirical reality. Instead of being used as a means to an end of trying to understand processes, they have become a predictive end in their own right. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe Summaries for Policy Makers\n&#xa0;\nGiven that the totality of the assessments are voluminous (e.g. the 2007 Scientific Report was 996 A4 pages and weighed 2.4kg) the critical documents for politicians, their officials, and media are the Summaries for Policy Makers.  These are not scientific but political documents as implied by the “intergovernmental” part of the Panel’s title\n.  The draft Summaries are largely prepared by the scientific supporters of ACW then crawled over, revised and agreed by representatives of member governments.  \n&#xa0;\nThe House of Lords Committee on Economic Affairs, which examined “The Economics of Climate Change”\n in 2005, \ncommented\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“\ngovernments … do have a say in the Summary for Policy Makers [which is] taken extremely seriously by governments, and it is a line-by-line acceptance…We can see no justification for this procedure. Indeed, it strikes us as opening the way for climate science and economics to be determined, at least in part, by political requirements rather than by the evidence.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC’s Scientific Working Group Reports should be treated with extreme caution.  While some are scientifically sound, there is some sloppy work that does not merit the description of the word “science” and some is politically slanted to meet the IPCC view of ACW and its undesirable consequences. The models claiming to project or predict future climate change are not worth the code they are written in. The Summaries for Policymakers should be treated as politically correct group think and ignored. &#xa0;In short the claims of a body which has promoted some of the specious propositions to which the IPCC has signed up to should be treated with considerable suspicion. To a degree the IPC promotes “disaster porn”, which is consistent with Houghton’s view (see below) “unless we announce disasters, no-one will listen.”&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nThe Met Office bias\n \n&#xa0;The Met Office bills itself as “\nproviding weather and climate change forecasts for the UK and worldwide\n”, its Chief Scientist, Professor Julia Slingo, assured this Committee in 2010 that “We are world leading.”\n Its influence within the IPCC began with John Houghton, its former Chief Executive (1983-91).  He was chairman or co-chairman of the Scientific Assessment Working Group of the IPCC 1988-2002 and lead editor of three IPCC reports including that which endorsed the hockey stick.  A recent chairman of the Met Office was concurrently Chief Executive of WWF-UK\n.  The influence of the Met Office/Hadley Centre on the IPCC reports continues – Britain is second only to the US in providing authors and review editors to the IPCC and a quarter of them work for the Met Office.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Met Office produced UK Climate Projections 2009 which purports to project “how the UK climate may change over the 30 year period from 2010-2099 at a resolution of 25km.” With a possibly Freudian slip it referred to the projections as “predictions”.  Climatologist R.A. Pielke Sr.\n commented:-\n“This study…is clearly a subversion of the scientific method. To state that climate science is being stretched is quite an understatement. There is absolutely no multi-decadal prediction skill on the spatial scales presented in this study…\nThe scientists who present the viewpoint of skillful multi-decadal regional predictions to policymakers are deliberately and dishonestly misinforming the public and policymakers. (emphasis original).\nThe proof of the pudding lies in the eating.  The Met Office Hadley Centre in 2007 stated “We are now using the system to predict changes out to 2014.  By the end of this period the global average temperature is expected to have risen by around \n0.3\n0\nC\n compared to 2004, and half the years after 2009 are predicted to be hotter than the current record hot year, \n1998.”\n In fact temperature remained more or less constant and none of the years have exceeded 1998\n,\n.  (A wag blogged that the Met Office should rename itself the Climastrology Office).\n&#xa0;\nA current issue the warmists are trying to deal with is the pause in global warming.  The Met Office’s contribution is a series of three reports on “The recent pause in global warming”.  The paper starts by claiming that there are two possible reasons for the pause, namely there has either been lower energy \nfrom the sun, or the heat has been stored in the deep ocean.  This choice \nspecifically excludes the third possibility that the climate is much less sensitive to CO2 than the IPCC and Met Office have claimed, and the models are useless. \n&#xa0;\nNotwithstanding the inadequacy of the ocean temperature measurements; the inadequacy of models; the lack of understanding of significant characteristics of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the papers conclude with string and sealing wax logic “that t\nhe earth system has continued to absorb a substantial amount of heat during the last 15 years, despite the pause in surface wearing” (p15).”  “Heat is most likely taken up by the ocean below 800m (p17).”  With no evidence the papers conclude further “\nThe recent pause in global surface temperature rise does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century. Nor does it invalidate the fundamental physics of global warming, the scientific basis of climate models and their estimates of climate sensitivity” (p3).  (In view of its lamentable record of seasonal and climate forecasts perhaps the Met Office should reflect on the Arab saying “He who professes to foretell the future lies, even when correct” – does the Met Office just merely lie?) \nAppendix\n 2 shows the papers and includes not only unjustifiable leaps of logic and non-sequiturs and claims for the validity of models that just do not stack up, but also some of what Professor Judith Curry\n regards as dubious science.\n&#xa0;A recent article in the Spectator\n claims that:-\n&#xa0;\n              \n“Last November, the Labour peer Lord Donoughue tabled a written question asking whether the government considered the \n0.8C\n rise in the average global temperature since 1880 to be ‘statistically significant’.  Yes, came the reply.  Douglas J. Keenan, a mathematician and former trader for Morgan Stanley, knew the answer was false.  With Keenan’s help, Donoughue tabled a follow-up question. The Met Office refused to answer it, not once, but five times.  Its refusal to clarify its stance left the energy minister, Baroness Verma, in an awkward position.  Only then did it confirm that it had no basis for the claim.”\n&#xa0;\nA foreign scientist, who has significant knowledge of the Met Office, observed of the set of papers that I was sent about extreme events (see above) “This is a non-response.\n&#xa0;\n Julia is an advocate and won't let anything come in or out of her office that doesn't meet the gatekeeping requirements of global warming disaster.”  Rupert Darwall\n quotes an anonymous scientist commented \n“The Met Office is a major employer of scientists and has long had a policy of only appointing and working with those who subscribe to their views on manmade global warming”\n, which is clearly an effective way to get a “consensus”!\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nThe “scientific activism” of The Royal Society and of Government Scientific Advisers\n&#xa0;\nThe last three Presidents of the Royal Society \n- Robert May, a theoretical physicist and zoologist; Martin Rees, a cosmologist and astro-physicist; Paul Nurse, a geneticist and cell biologist – and three recent Chief Scientific Advisers to the government - the same Robert May; chemist David King (who absurdly suggested that by the end of the twenty-first century “\nAntarctica was likely to be the only habitable continent left on earth\n”); and John Beddington, an expert in population biology - have put their names to ACW, although climate science was not their field.  (One imagines they would not have taken too much notice if oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, or geologists had advised the public on their specialisms).  \n&#xa0;\nThe Royal Society’s report “Climate Change: A Summary of the Science” is a thin and flawed document signed off by a raft of scientists, few of whom are climate scientists.  It relies heavily on climate models, among other things claiming “Current understanding of the physics (and increasingly the chemistry and biology) of the climate system is represented in a mathematical form in climate models, which are used to simulate past climate and provide projections of possible future climate change.” It also claims that “Climate models indicate that the overall climate sensitivity (for a hypothetical doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere) is likely to lie in the range \n2C\n to 4.5C.” Both of these claims are baseless.  The document refers to:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Royal Society and Government Scientific Advisers have ill-advisedly indulged in “scientific activism” which is better left to “green” NGOs.  They are not living up to the Royal Society’s motto “\nNullius in verba”.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nThe ignorance of the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change/DECC\n&#xa0;\nOn 14 July Andrew Neil interviewed Ed Davey, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, on Sunday Politics on the BBC.  Davey made a number of claims that are incorrect, namely:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDavey could not even get the additional costs of the measures he is enforcing on electric customers correct, claiming “the vast majority [of the cost] is making people’s homes warmer – only a small amount is spent subsidizing renewable and low carbon energy”. Let us help him - according to DECC figures the policies he is espousing have already increased average electricity bills by £80 p.a. (out of a total bill of £563) of which £22 is spent on energy companies’ energy efficiency obligations and £50 on subsidies.  The £80 figure is forecast to increase by an additional £200 by \n2020, a\n tax to be paid out of post-tax incomes\n.  By the early 2020s the annual costs of Davey’s ambitions will total £10-11bn for subsidies, capacity payments, and additional transmission on an industry with a turnover of about £30bn\n – surely something is going to give some time?\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nThe eloquent ignorance of the Chairman of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC)\n&#xa0;\nThe main role of the CCC is to prepare carbon budgets and report on progress in meeting them.  Although the Committee takes ACW as a given and does not major on the issue, it has a few misleading quotations from the IPCC on its website.  More significant is the speech in the House of Lords on 18 June 2013 by its chairman, former Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment \nJohn Gummer, and his address to the Annual Conference of the Parliamentary Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group on 10 July 2013.\n&#xa0;\nIn the Lords he commented\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“There is no doubt that there is sufficient scientific belief and evidence that climate change is happening, is caused by human beings and could be disastrous. It is therefore a threat with which we have to deal. There are two ways that you can deal with a threat: the first is to insure yourself against it, and the other is to hope for the best.”\n&#xa0;\n“The chance of disastrous climate change occurring is enormously greater than the chance of your house burning down, yet we are now seeking to say that we should not spend certain sums. At the moment, for an average family the cost is about £60 a year and by the end of 2020 it will be £100 a year.”\n&#xa0;\nIn his conference speech he compared this cost with the average cost of home insurance against fire of £140 p.a. when the probability of a fire is 0.2%.  “I am asking for less than half for an event which is not 0.2% probable but 98% certain.” There are three problems with the insurance storyline:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn order to seem scientifically reasonable Gummer claimed “We are the skeptics in the sense that we look at the science clearly and skeptically, and we come to a conclusion based on the science and we revisit it every time some new science comes our way…but it would be foolish to ignore the very large consensus.”  However for all his talk of “science” it is not obvious that Gummer (who studied history) knows much about climate science beyond some basic temperature information.  Although he claims to be open, that seems doubtful given his eloquent ignorance.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nWhat can be done to improve public understanding of climate science\n&#xa0;\nA fundamental point to appreciate is that while there is a vigorous (and often highly politicized) debate in the US between politicians and climate scientists illustrated by the recent report by a Senate Committee “Critical Thinking on Climate Change”\n, there is no such debate in Britain. Apart from Nigel Lawson and Peter Lilley most of the “political class” are on side.  Gummer is chairman of the Committee on Climate Change and former chairman of the London Array; former Minister Charles Hendry is chairman of a wind company; and the former chairman of the Energy &amp; Climate Change Committee Tim Yeo collects a substantial sum from renewables companies and is the President of The Renewable Energy Association.  There are no senior climate scientists who are skeptics in Britain and put his or her head above the parapet perhaps because they are all on the public payroll\n, seek grants and many have mortgages to pay and families to keep, and so they are politically correct. Also many have invested their careers and “face” in the position they espouse.   \nThe consequence of what is effectively the suppression of free debate by “state science” is that we live in a parochial little British bubble of supposed scientific consensus. In view of the influence of the Met Office on the IPCC scientific reports and that the British government has to sign off the Summaries for Policy Makers, we can be confident that the forthcoming Assessment will continue the same storylines, but will now include an explanation of the reason why the temperature has not increased over the last 15 years which the Met Office has just trailed\n.\n&#xa0;There is currently no easy answer to the Committee’s question from such a politicized – and too often – factually ill-informed environment. Given the long history I have observed from both within and without the civil service of the British government talking superficial nonsense and spinning on a range of matters, I do not believe any statement from the government and its agencies that I cannot independently check.  If the aim of the Committee is to improve the knowledge of the public about climate science, then:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\nAppendix 1              \nThe claim by the Met Office that extreme weather events are increasing&#xa0;\nProfessor Julia Slingo put a claim on the Met Office’s website on 3 June to the effect that extreme weather events were increasing due to ACW.  In reply to a request for substantiation I was sent “Explaining extreme events of 2011 from a Climate Perspective”, which consisted of a series of papers\n.  The introduction quoted a 2012 paper by the IPCC\n:-\n&#xa0;\n              \n“It is likely that anthropogenic influences have led to warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale” and that “there is medium confidence that anthropogenic influences have been contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation at the global scale.”\n&#xa0;\nReference to that document found:-\n&#xa0;\n              \n“Many extreme weather and climate events continue to be the result of natural climate variability…Observed changes in climate extremes reflect the influence of anthropogenic climate change in addition to natural climate variability, with changes in exposure and vulnerability influenced by both climatic and on-climatic factors.”\n&#xa0;\nRegrettably there was no hard edged evidence to support the latter part of the proposition.\n&#xa0;\nThe introduction also included a reference to a paper which claimed of the very hot European summer of 2003 “The demonstration that human factors had influenced the climate of southern Europe in a quantifiable way over the latter part of the twentieth century was an important element in establishing that human influence has probably substantially increased the likelihood of an extreme warm summer like that experienced in the region in \n2003”\n.  But this claim was based on an analysis of a model simulating the low probability of the event occurring.  Then followed six papers describing various extreme events. The first discussed “The absence of a role for climate change in the 2011 Thailand Floods”, while the second described how warming in the Indian Ocean had contributed to more frequent droughts in Eastern Africa, but it did not attribute the ocean warming to ACW, and cautiously commented “It is impossible to unambiguously attribute a single event to anthropogenic climate change”.  Another paper by French climate scientists discussed the “Contribution of atmospheric circulation to remarkable European temperatures of \n2011”\n.  It pointed out that the temperature pattern was very unusual, but again it did not mention ACW.  This left three papers:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \n“Have the odds of warm November temperatures and of cold December temperatures in central England changed?” by British academics and two from the Met Office.  The paper started by claiming:-\n&#xa0;\n“The emergent science of probabilistic event attribution is becoming an increasingly important method of evaluating the extent of how this human-influenced climate change is affecting localized weather events.”\n&#xa0;\n“We use large ensembles of the two climate scenarios to evaluate whether the frequency of warm Novembers and cold Decembers occurring has altered between the 1960s and 2000s, this being the period during which there has been a significant anthropogenic influence on climate.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“The winter of 2010/11 was a rare weather event, even in the context of the 352 years of the central England temperature record.  Yet while the odds of such an event have lengthened as a result of human influence on climate, such unlikely events can still happen.”\n&#xa0;\nIt is interesting to note that the advocates of warming were trying to have it both ways.  One of the last three papers and the reference to the European heatwave were claiming ACW was increasing summer temperatures, while two were claiming ACW was decreasing winter temperature – they do not like to lose!\n&#xa0;\nThe paper on the European heatwave of 2003 and papers 4, 5 and 6 all included Met Office staff.  They derive the probability of occurrence of an extreme event by comparing it with modelled climate behaviour.  But we saw from the main script that climate models (including the Met Office model which is in the centre of the pack in the exhibit) do not project or forecast climate accurately.  The papers’ reliant on them can be dismissed; models are models, not science which is about facts.  \nIn reality this was a very thin collection of papers with more surmise and speculation and “modelitis” than science; they did not substantiate Professor Slingo’s contention.  Appendix 2              The Met Office attempts to rationalize the pause in temperature rise&#xa0;\nThe papers\n&#xa0;\nIn July 2013 the Met Office published a sequence of three reports on “The recent pause in global warming” which purport to answer the questions (1) what do observations of the climate system tell us?; (2) what are the potential causes?; and (3) what are the implications for projections of future warming?\n   The attempt at explanation starts with a selective proposition, namely “\nThere are potentially two distinct mechanisms to explain the recent pause; the first involves changes to the total energy received by the planet (radiative forcing), and the second involves the low frequency variability of the oceans and the way in which the oceans take up heat and store it below the surface, potentially into the deeper ocean.”  This specifically excludes the third possibility that the climate is much less sensitive to CO2 than the IPCC and Met Office have claimed, and the models are useless. \n&#xa0;\nThe storyline of the papers starts with the claim that we can conclude little from the temperature pause because “it is only with averaging periods of 30 years or longer that climate change can be detected robustly” (p6). \nBut if this is the case why has so much been made of the twenty years of warming from 1980 or so to 2000 or so?  \n&#xa0;\nThe explanation of the “pause” has been “through redistribution of energy within the climate system, particularly through exchange between the upper and deep ocean, which can temporarily hide the warming beneath the surface” (p7). (But the Pacific Decadal Oscillation “may have played a substantial role in the recent pause in the global surface temperature rise” (p12)).\n&#xa0;\nAt one point the report claims that “The Argo measurements indicate a rapid increase in heat content down to 700m between 1999 and \n2004”\n (p14).  But in reality Argo floats\n only began to be installed in 2000 and all 3000 were not in place until 2007, and then time should be allowed to collect and analyse data. While the Argo floats were being installed, there was a mix of historically collected and Argo data which was not consistent.  The Met Office admitted (p15) “\nAlthough Argo floats are increasingly providing robust global measurements of the upper ocean, drawing conclusions from periods during which there are large changes in an observing system must be treated with caution\n.” This reservation did not, however, temper its enthusiasm for conc\nl\nu\nd\ning “\nthat the earth system has continued to absorb a substantial amount of heat during the last 15 years, despite the pause in surface wearing” (p15).”  “Heat is most likely taken up by the ocean below 800m (p17).” \n&#xa0;\nWith no evidence the papers conclude further “\nThe recent pause in global surface temperature rise does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century. Nor does it invalidate the fundamental physics of global warming, the scientific basis of climate models and their estimates of climate sensitivity” (p3).\n&#xa0;\nBlogs\n&#xa0;\nTwo scientists have written significant blogs on the Met Office papers “The recent Pause in Global Warming”.  Professor Judith Curry of Georgia Tech on her blog judithcurry.com on 23 July, and Bob Tisdale who describes himself as an independent climate scientist on his blog bobtisdale.wordpress.com on 25 July when he commented on Part 1 and on 30 July when he commented on Part 2.  His blogs include extensive graphical evidence.  An anonymous blog comment on Curry’s blog by HR summarises well the fabrications of the Met Office’s story.\n&#xa0;\nCurry\n&#xa0;\nIn Paper \n1 a\n \n15+ yr pause seems to be reflected in the surface temperature, lower tropospheri \ntemperature, lower stratospheric temperature, NH hemisphere snow extent, and total column water vapor.  Nonetheless the concluding remarks claim “\nIt has shown that a wide range of observed climate indicators continue to show changes that are consistent with a globally warming world, and our understanding of how the climate system works.” \nAH comments: hardly consistent.\n&#xa0;\nPaper 2 asks “\nIs the current pause in global warming unusual?” \nand comments:-\n&#xa0;\n“It is clear that there have been other periods with little or no surface warming in the relatively recent past, a good example being the period between the 1940s and the 1970s (Figure 1). The trend in warming over that period is well understood, and linked to a substantial increase in the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere.”\n&#xa0;JC comment: \n&#xa0;\nThe 1940s to 1970s pause is not well understood…The aerosol explanation doesn’t hold up\n. \n&#xa0;\nI suspect it has mostly the same cause as the current pause, associated with changes in the ocean circulation patterns, notably the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO).\n&#xa0;\n“\nHowever, prior to 1965 and from 2000 to the present day, there are substantial differences between the net radiative flux and the upper ocean heat uptake (black dashed curve in Figure 9), implying heat taken up by other components of the climate system, most likely the ocean below 800m…”  (\nAH comment: this is pure surmise).\n&#xa0;\n“If, however, the observations are robust, then the maximum in upper ocean heat uptake in the early part of this decade and the subsequent minimum in upper ocean heat uptake cannot be explained by changes in net radiative fluxes, as shown by large residuals in Figure 10. This suggests that the pause in global surface warming is unlikely to have been caused solely by systematic changes in the top of the atmosphere radiation associated with solar variability and minor volcanic eruptions, anthropogenic aerosol emissions, or changes in stratospheric water vapour as suggested in other studies.”\n&#xa0;\nJC comment: \n&#xa0;\nthis acknowledgment that not all climate change is forced is important; unfortunately they only seem to apply it to the recent pause and not the warming in the 1980′s and 1990′s.\n&#xa0;\n“In addition, direct measurements of the exchange of heat between the upper and deep\n&#xa0;\nocean do not exist because\n the present ocean observing network does not sample the ocean\n&#xa0;\nbelow 2000m adequately.\n” &#xa0;\nJC comment: \n&#xa0;\nThis acknowledges the deficiencies and uncertainties in magnitude anyways of the recent deep ocean heat uptake.\n&#xa0;\n“What can we conclude from all this? First, periods of slowing down and pauses in surface warming are not unusual in the instrumental temperature record.\n \nSecond, climate model simulations suggest that we can expect such a period of a decade or more to occur at least twice per century, due to internal variability alone. Third, recent research suggests that ocean heat re-arrangements, with a contribution from changes in top of the atmosphere radiation, could be important for explaining the recent pause in global surface warming.”\n&#xa0;\nJC comment: \n&#xa0;\nThey seem to think that this pause is not unusual or even unexpected. \n&#xa0;\n16 years of ‘pause’ and counting brings us very close to falling completely outside of the large envelope of climate model simulations. \n&#xa0;\nYou can see why they want to redefine the pause to begin in 2000.\n&#xa0;\n“The scientific questions posed by the current pause in global surface warming require us to understand in much greater detail the flows of energy into, out of, and around the Earth system. Current observations are not detailed enough or of long enough duration to provide definitive answers on the causes of the recent pause…”\n&#xa0;\nAH comments: this does not stop the Met Office strongly insinuating that it definitely knows the answers!\n&#xa0;\nPaper 3 concludes “the recent pause in global surface temperature rise does not invalidate climate models or their estimates of climate sensitivity. It does however raise some important questions about how well we understand and observe the energy budget of the climate system, particularly the important role of the oceans in taking up and redistributing heat, as highlighted in the second report…”\n&#xa0;\nJC comment: \n&#xa0;\nThey dismiss all of the recent empirical estimates of low climate sensitivity, and continue to think climate models are adequate.\n&#xa0;\nTisdale\n&#xa0;\nHe notes in his response to Part 2\n “What they (i.e. the Met Office (MO)) fail to acknowledge is that sea level is a terrible proxy for global temperatures. In looking at the global temperature plots in the top panel of their Figure 1, global surface temperatures cooled from 1880 to about 1917 and then warmed from 1917 to 1944. As if repeating a cycle, global surface temperatures then cooled from about 1944 to 1976 and warmed once again from 1976 to 1998/2000. But the rise in sea level did not slow during the two cooling period…In short, based on the 30-year trends, there is no agreement between the rates as which global surface temperatures warm or cool and the rates at which global sea level rises. So there is no reason based on past cooling periods since 1880 to believe that the rise in sea levels would slow during the recent hiatus in global warming…Global sea level has risen since the end of the last ice age, and based on data presented by the MO, the rate at which it has risen during the instrument record has no relationship with the rate at which global temperatures have warmed or cooled.\n&#xa0;\nHe cites a recent paper that discusses the many faults with climate model simulations of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, \nThe Atlantic\n \nMultidecadal Oscillation in twentieth century climate simulations: uneven progress from CMIP3 to CMIP5\n, Ruiz-Barradas et al, 2013.\n The beginning of the “Concluding remarks” observes (all subsequent emboldening is Tisdale’s):-\n&#xa0;\nDecadal variability in the climate system from the AMO is one of the major sources of variability at this temporal scale that climate models must aim to properly incorporate because its surface climate impact on the neighboring continents…\nIf climate models do not incorporate the mechanisms associated to the generation of the AMO (or any other source of decadal variability like the PDO) and in turn incorporate or enhance variability at other frequencies, then the models ability to simulate and predict at decadal time scales will be compromised and so the way they transmit this variability to the surface climate affecting human societies.&#xa0;\nThe authors then describe the many problems with climate model simulations of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and end observing:-\n&#xa0;\nThe current analysis does not provide evidence on why the models perform in the way they do but suggests that that the spurious increase in high 10–20 year variability from CMIP3 to CMIP5 models may be behind \nthe unsatisfying progress in depicting the spatiotemporal features of the AMO. This problem, coupled with the inability of the models to perturb the regional low-level circulation, the driver of moisture fluxes, \nseem to be at the center of the poor representation of the hydroclimate impact of the AMO.&#xa0;\nIf climate modelers cannot simulate the AMO properly, then it’s very obvious that the pause in global surface temperatures from the 1940s to the 1970s is not “well understood”…as the MO claims.  Then the MO makes the admission that \n“The characteristics and mechanisms for the PDO are less well understood than for the AMO.”&#xa0;\nBased on the MO’s own statements, they and the climate science community in general do not understand the causes of the multidecadal variations in the sea surface temperatures of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This indicates that they also do not understand what caused the global warming from the mid-1970s to about 2000.\n&#xa0;\n If they can’t explain the pause, then they surely can’t explain the warming.\n&#xa0;\nThe MO states with unbelievable certainty:-\n&#xa0;\nIn summary, observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that the Earth system has continued to absorb heat energy over the past 15 years, and that this additional heat has been absorbed in the ocean.\n&#xa0;\nBut they’ve presented nothing to support their certainty.\n&#xa0;A blog comment by  \nHR \n| July 25, 2013 at \n8\n:43 pm\n \n&#xa0;\nThis all really exposes the just so nature of some of climate science. We have internal variability which is poorly understood mechanistically and poorly quantified. Aerosols that again aren’t fully understood mechanistically and badly observed. As well as other forcings and feedback. Each one is wheeled out at different times to explain unexpected observations and at other times are completely forgotten when the aim is to tell a clear story about GHGs. So we seem to have:-\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n1910-1940 that warmed more rapidly than expected from forcing.

We seemingly have poorly observed, poorly understood and poorly quantified processes that can at least be as large as the GHG forcing (given they seem to be fully masking the ongoing GHG forcing in present Pause). Yet we can have what seems to be highly level of certainty about attributing warming at the end of the 20th century. \n&#xa0;\nIt just horrifies me. Either I’m seriously missing something in climate science or this is all just badly observed, badly controlled and badly understood best guessing.\n&#xa0;\n P295 et seq, op. cit., \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeconaf/12/12we24.htm\n. \n \nOfficials are meeting in \nStockholm\n 23-26 September 2013 to sign off the Summaries for Policymakers.\n \nClimate Change 2007: Synthesis report p5 and p7.\n \nIn “The Real Global Warming Disaster” (pp62-68) Christopher Booker points out that:-\n              \n“Santer and colleagues admitted “The changes made after the Madrid meeting were in response to written review comments received in October and November 1995 from governments,” as well as from individual scientists and NGOs.  The changes were politically necessary to match the IPCC’s headline claim to have detected a discernible human influence on global climate, which would have been hard to square with the statement that “no study had shown greenhouse gases.”  A deputy assistant secretary at the US State Department, Day Mount, wrote to Sir John Houghton, chairman of the IPCC Working Group I, on 15 November: “It is essential…that chapter authors be prevailed upon to modify their text in an appropriate manner following discussion in \nMadrid\n.”  \nBooker and North in “Scared to Death” point out “The senior official who gave this instruction worked with Timothy Wirth, the Under-Secretary of State for Global Affairs.  He was an ardent advocate of global warming, and a close political ally of Gore.”  \nA \n1997 article co-authored by the late S\ntephen Schneider commented \nthat \nt\nhe Second Assessment Report was “fraught with political significance” because it was published shortly before COP2 in \nGeneva\n at which the \nClinton\n administration announced its support for binding emissions targets.”\n \nSignificantly \nnowadays \nthe claim (e.g. by Secretary of State Davey and \nthe Met Office)\n is that temperatures \nhave \nnever been warmer than sin\nc\ne measured temperatures began about 160 years ago, which is true\n but of no significance in climate timescales.\n \nHockey Sticks, principle components, and spurious significance, Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, Geographical Research Letters (32), 3, 2005.\n National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, National Research Council\n, \nhttp://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11676\n. \n \nhttp://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/WegmanReport.pdf\n. \n \nA statistical analysis of multiple temperature proxies: Are reconstructions of surface temperatures over the last 1000 years reliable?,\nhttp://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.aoas/1300715170\n. \n \nV\nolume I: Report, HL12-I, \n6 July 2005\n, \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeconaf/12/12i.pdf\n \nhttp://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/gw_hurricanes/\n. \n \nHe checked my script.\n \nChapter 7 of \n“The Climate Fix: What Scientists and Politicians Won’t Tell You About Global Warming”.\n \nHe checked my script.\n \nWritten Statement of John R.

The parameterizations are generally ad hoc devices designed to behave in a manner that is thought to be appropriate where ‘appropriate’ sometimes simply means that the parameterization is designed to compensate for obvious model problems.
