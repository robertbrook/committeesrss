"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Department for Transport (TIC 098)SummaryThe Government:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecognises that the car is the dominant means of travel in rural areas and isolated communities, but a significant minority of households do not have a car, and many people do not have use of a car for a particular journey.  Considers that local authorities are best placed to identify the specific demand at a local level.  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTakes account of the needs of all people in considering transport provision in isolated communities through its policies published in Making Transport More Accessible to All and an Accessibility Action Plan in 2012.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlays its part in addressing the challenges faced by such communities.  Recognised that subsidies provided via Bus Service Operator Grants (BSOG) took a share of cuts announced in 2010, but confirmed in the 2013 Spending Review that spending on BSOG will be protected for 2015/16.  Announced in July reforms to the bus subsidy system planned to improve services by making the subsidy more locally targeted and accountable.  Allowed time for the work requested by the sector to minimise potential instability to services from the changes planned.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecognises Community Transport as useful in addressing the needs of passengers in such communities.  Provided £20 million in 2011 to rural local transport authorities in England to support the development of such services.  Sponsored the Community Transport Association’s (CTA) 2012 State of the Sector Report focussing on rural areas.  Works closely with the CTA alongside Defra, for instance on a group set up to address gaps in rural transport highlighted by the Youth Select Committee in 2012.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecognises that many services offered by the Community Transport sector are demand-responsive.  Notes taxis are a commercial demand-responsive service, albeit in most geographical areas some taxi journeys are already publically funded for certain journeys for social and education services.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsiders that the best way of making services in such areas more affordable given the current financial situation is by closer working between the three main organisations in the sector responsible for the services, allied with innovative changes in the way passenger transport in such areas is provided and funded.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHas provided £600m for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) covering schemes worth £1bn with local contributions in 77 Authorities comprising 96 Projects.  There is provision for National Park Authorities to bid.  LSTF will support the delivery of sustainable transport in a number of isolated areas including four National Parks.  DfT are also supporting the Wheels to Work Association to make existing LSTF schemes more sustainable and to promote new ones as well as sponsorship of a national coordinator.Introduction1.

How can these challenges be overcome?Q4 How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?Q5 To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?Q6 What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?.\n Annex A&#xa0;STATISTICAL DIGEST: PASSENGER TRANSPORT IN ISOLATED COMMUNITIES&#xa0;\nMost isolated communities are in rural areas and the evidence\n in this Statistical Annex concentrates on rural areas, and differences between rural and urban areas. The annex mainly draws on data from \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The National Travel Survey \nover\n 2011\n and 20\n12 shows that around 9 per cent of households in rural areas\n in Great Britain\n do not own a car\n (or van)\n, compared to 45 per \ncent in London Boroughs, 33 per cent in metropolitan bu\nilt up areas and 27 per cent in large urban areas. In rural areas, 52 per cent of households owned more than two cars.\n \n&#xa0;\nChart 1: Proportion of households without a car (or van), by area type: Great Britain, 2011 and 2012 combinedSource: National Travel Survey\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSo while a small minority of households in rural areas do not have access to a car, more than 90% of households do. As a result the\n car \nis a more dominant mode\n of transport\n for residents of rural \ncommunities\n than for residents of urban settlements of any size.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWith car ownership being higher in rural areas, travel by car is also the predominant means of transport in rural areas. I\nn fact, t\nravel by car as a driver is the predominant\n means of transport in all area types (with the exception of \nLondon\n), but it is at its highest in \nrural areas.\n \n&#xa0;\nRural residents \nmade 526 trips on average by car or van as a driver in 2011 and 2012 combin\ned (and another 239 as a passenger) compared to 357 as a driver in metropolitan built-up areas.\n \n&#xa0;Chart 2: Average number of car/van trips (as driver or passenger) by area type: Great Britain, 2011 and 2012 combinedSource: National Travel Survey\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;People in rural areas also take the least number of walking and bus trips per person. In 2011 and 2012, people walked an average of 147 trips, and took a \nlocal bus for an average of 28 trips. This compares to \na \nGreat Britain\n average of 217 trips and 62 trips walking and by bus respectively.\n &#xa0;&#xa0;P\nroportionally fewer households in rural \nor isolated areas \nhave access to a regular bus service th\nan \nhouseholds in \nurban areas.\n This can be measured by the National Travel Survey’s ‘bus availability’ measure. This \nis expressed as the percentage of households whose nearest bus stop is within 13 minutes walk and has a service at least once an hour.\n&#xa0;\nOver\n 2011 and 2012, 59 per cent\n of households in rural ar\neas in \nGreat Britain\n were within reach of bus under this measure, compared to 98 per cent of\n households in \nmetropolitan built-up areas and 91 per cent in \nGreat Britain\n as a whole. Indeed, all other (non-\nrural) area types\n \nscored 90 per cent or more on this measure over\n 201\n1 and 201\n2\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, this figure has increased in recent years in rural areas. \nBetween 2002 and \n2011 and \n2012\n combined\n, the proportion of households in rural areas that were within 13 minutes walk of an hourly or better bus service increased \nfrom 48% to 59%.\n&#xa0;\nThe introduction of statutory free concessionary travel for older people on local buses has had the biggest propo\nrtionate impact in rural areas. The take-up of concessionary travel passes among eligible residents of rural areas increased from 34% in 2005 (the year before the scheme’s introduction) to 66% in 2012, an increase of 32 percentage points. The equivalent in\ncreases were \n12 percentage points in metropolitan built-up areas, and 3 percentage points in \nLondon\n boroughs.\n&#xa0;Department for Transport bus statistics also unsurprisingly show fewer local bus journeys in rural areas than in urban areas. The total number of bus journeys in \nEngland\n in “significant rural” and “predominantly rural” local authority areas has been broadl\ny level since 2007/08. In the latest year available, 2011/12, there were 451 million journeys in significantly rural areas, and 322 million journeys in predominantly rural areas. This was about 17 per cent of the total number of bus journeys in that year.\n However, these areas contained 37.4% of the resident population of \nEngland\n in 2011\n.\n1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWhile the usage of certain modes of travel can differ markedly between rural and urban areas as described above, \nthe \noverall \nnumber of trips \nmade in a year varies much less. However, those in\n more rural settlements travel much \nlonger\n distances on averag\ne than those in urban areas\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nOverall, \nthe \naverage distance travelled per person per year \nfor residents of rural \nareas\n was 9,764 miles over 2011 and 2012 (which included 5,731 miles by car). This \nwas around double the average of \nLondon\n residents (4,687\n miles\n) and residents of Metropolitan built-u\np areas (5,276 miles).\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;R\nural areas\n, and in particular very isolated rural\n areas, are \nmuch \nless densely populat\ned\n than urban areas. This means that rural service locations (schools, food stores, GPs, etc.) are \nlikely to \nbe more sparse, and to \nserve larger geographical \ncatchment \narea\ns.\n&#xa0;The DfT’s accessibility indicators measure access to eight key services (employmen\nt centres, primary schools, secondary schools, further education institutions, GPs, hospitals, food stores and town centres) by public transport/walking, cycle and car. \nResults for 2011\n \nshow that users in urban areas \nin \nEngland\n \ncould access key services by\n public transport/walking, on average, in 12 minutes compared to 22 minutes in rural areas\n. However, there was much less difference in the average access times for car users, which only varied between 6 minutes and 7 minutes across urban and rural areas re\nspectively\n.\n \n&#xa0;Chart 3: Average minimum travel time to reach the nearest key services by mode of travel, rural and urban areas, England, 2011Source: DfT Accessibility Statistics\n&#xa0;As shown above, household access to cars is highest in rural areas. These\n figures therefore suggest that accessibility difficulties will particularly affect the minority of rural households that do not have a car, and therefore need to use other modes of transport to access key services.\n&#xa0;\nChart 4 (below) shows the percentage of\n user populations in \nEngland\n with “reasonable” access to key services.\n (This is a \nmeasure of accessibility which takes into account the sensitivity of users to the travel time for each service)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe variation between rural and urban a\nreas \nwas greatest fo\nr further education institutions (17 \npercentage point\n difference between rural and urban areas), and least for primary schools (5 \npercentage point\n difference).\n&#xa0;Chart 4: Percentage of users with 'reasonable' access to key services by public transport/walking: rural and urban areas, England, 2011Source: DfT Accessibility Statistics\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n              \n www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227006/Statistical_Digest_of_Rural_England_Aug_2013.pdf\n The NTS area definitions differ from the classification in Defra’s Statistical Digest of Rural England, 2012, which showed NTS resu\nlts based on Defra’s own classification of urban/rural (Urban, \nRural\n \nTown\n and Fringe, Village and Dispersed).\n \nwww.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/200252/nts9902.xls\n www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_d\nata/file/200253/nts9903.xls\n \nwww.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/att\nachment_data/file/200254/nts9904\n.xls\n \nwww.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/att\nachment_data/file/200254/nts9916\n.xls\n www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/14595/bus0111.xls\n www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/200254/nts9904.xls\n www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/9483/acs0102.xls\n              \n www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/9484/acs0103.xls\n"
