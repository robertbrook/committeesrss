Written evidence from Police and Crime Commissioner, Thames Valley [CST0038][bold]Response to Public Administration Select Committee request for evidence on Crime Statistics[bold] [bold]In response to questions raised by the Chairman of [bold]PASC[bold] in his letter of [bold]6[bold]th[bold] December 2013[bold], Thames Valley PCC’s response is as follows:[bold]What, if any[bold],[bold] targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording practices?[bold]For 2013-14, 
[normal]I have 
[normal]set five
[normal] ‘headline’ targets. Two of these (
[normal]Burglary Dwelling and Violence against the Person) are Crime Reduction Targets. The other three are detection targets (Burglary Dwelling, Rape Offences, and Violence against the Person with Injury). 
[normal]I have also set 
[normal]a number of o
[normal]ther 
[normal]key 
[normal]crime reduction 
[normal]targets
[normal], 
[normal]such as 
[normal]Rural Crime, 
[normal]M
[normal]etal 
[normal]T
[normal]heft and 
[normal]D
[normal]isrupting Organised Crime Groups
[normal]. 
[normal]We are still in quarter 3 of the current performance year and it 
[normal]is difficult to say with 
[normal]any 
[normal]precision 
[normal]what the true impact of PCC target setting has ha
[normal]d on police recording practices
[normal]. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e 
[normal]current 
[normal]set of ‘headline’ targets for T
[normal]hames 
[normal]V
[normal]alley 
[normal]P
[normal]olice
[normal] has
[normal], on the whole
[normal], been
[normal] challenging for the Force
[normal]. T
[normal]he backdrop to deliver
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]these is
[normal] set against continuing
[normal] reduction
[normal]s in budget and resource
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] However, the Force has for many 
[normal]years
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]responded 
[normal]positively 
[normal]to ch
[normal]allenging targets set by the previous Police Authority.
[normal] 
[normal]Thames Valley received a positive
[normal] 
[normal]assessment 
[normal]from HMIC 
[normal]of its data integrity back in 2011. The cornerstones for this 
[normal]were based upon strong 
[normal]leadership 
[normal]that focused on ethical recording, along with good practices for recording crime consistently and accurately.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]I have no reason to believe that the Force h
[normal]as departed from these policies and practices.
[normal]W
[normal]hilst we are conscious that some PCC’s have followed the government’s line of 
[normal]introducing 
[normal]a single 
[normal]target for ‘reducing all crime’,
[normal] this 
[normal]in itself
[normal] can create a 
[normal]number 
[normal]of 
[normal]perverse
[normal] outcomes. 
[normal]We have 
[normal]discussed 
[normal]future target setting
[normal] with our local HMIC and i
[normal]t has been 
[normal]suggested that a limit
[normal]ed basket of 
[normal]key 
[normal]targets 
[normal]can be
[normal] appropriate in addressing 
[normal]areas 
[normal]which 
[normal]require focused 
[normal]performance imp
[normal]rovement
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?[bold]I h
[normal]ave 
[normal]attempted to answer
[normal] 
[normal]th
[normal]is 
[normal]question through our initial 
[normal]evidence submitted
[normal] to th
[normal]e
[normal] Committee 
[normal](
[normal]via 
[normal]the APCC)
[normal] in November
[normal] 2013

[normal]Within 
[normal]Thames Valley, 
[normal]I hold
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]Chief Constable to 
[normal]a
[normal]ccount for 
[normal]d
[normal]elive
[normal]ring the Police and Crime Plan 
[normal]and
[normal]/or 
[normal]for ensuring 
[normal]accountability for
[normal] the efficient
[normal] and 
[normal]effective
[normal] 
[normal]direction and 
[normal]control of the Force
[normal]. These
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]boundaries
[normal]’ help reduce 
[normal]my 
[normal]exposure to, and involvement in, 
[normal]the 
[normal]operational 
[normal]‘
[normal]micro-detail
[normal]’
[normal] of crime 
[normal]statistics
[normal]. 
[normal]By 
[normal]focusing 
[normal]on crime 
[normal]statistics at a 
[normal]‘
[normal]macro-level
[normal]’
[normal], 
[normal]I have 
[normal]a 
[normal]richer-picture that 
[normal]enables more objective understanding
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]key 
[normal]performance r
[normal]isks and issues wit
[normal]hin the 
[normal]Force.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My Office regularly monitors timely performance data to identify trends (through 
[normal]the Home Office ‘
[normal]iQuanta
[normal]’ Performance Management System
[normal]) and comparisons are carried out with other forces.  
[normal]I
[normal]nternal performance reviews
[normal] from the Force
[normal], 
[normal]coupled 
[normal]with 
[normal]external
[normal] q
[normal]ualitative/quantitative performance information
[normal] 
[normal]sources
[normal],
[normal] are triangulated 
[normal]to provide 
[normal]an 
[normal]independent
[normal] perspective.
[normal]I would like to underline
[normal] HMIC’s previous assessment of the Force
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] data integrity in
[normal] which 
[normal]good 
[normal]ethical recording and high 
[normal]crime 
[normal]recording standards were 
[normal]acknowledged. I am confident that the Force continues to maintain these standards.
[normal] 
[normal]However, 
[normal]I do have a concern that fraud, and cyber enabled crime is increasing, and we do not have an accurate measurement of this as it is reported direct to Action Fraud. We have little feedback on the extent of it within Thames Valley, but I believe that, in monetary terms, it is by far the largest crime both within the Thames Valley Police area. I believe this to be the case nationally.
