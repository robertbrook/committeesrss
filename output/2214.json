I would like you please to pass on to the Parliamentary Committee advising on the Bill my views that some further clauses on rights of way should be added to the Bill, in order to deal with the problem of offroading. I believe that in all cases these would have a deregulatory effect or at a minimum have a nil effect on regulation and red tape.\n&#xa0;\nI\n \nsuggest\n \nthat\n \nadditional\n \nrights\n \nof\n \nway\n \nclauses\n \nshould\n \nbe\n \nadded\n \nin\n \norder\n \nto:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn\n \nterms\n \nof\n \nregulation,\n \nfor\n \nexample,\n \nreclassifying\n \ngreen\n \nlanes\n \nto\n \nbecome\n \nrestricted\n \nbyways \nwould\n \nget\n \nrid\n \nof\n \nthe\n \ncosts\n \nand\n \nbureaucracy \n \ninvolved\n \nin\n \nthe\n \nprocessing\n \nof\n \nrights\n \nof\n \nway\n \nclaims \non\n \nthem.\n \nThe\n \nsuggested\n \nadditions\n \nwould\n \nalso\n \nboth\n \nprotect\n \nthe\n \nenvironment,\n \nresidents\n \nand \nnon\n \nvehicle\n \nusers\n \nand\n \navoid\n \nthe\n \nneed\n \nto\n \nspend\n \npublic\n \nmoney\n \non\n \nrepairing\n \n(often\n \nagain\n \nand \nagain)\n \nunsealed\n \nlanes\n \ndamaged\n \nby\n \nmotor\n \nvehicles.\n&#xa0;\nIn\n \nmy\n \nview\n \nthe\n \ndamage\n \ncaused\n \nby\n \noffroading\n \nis\n \na\n \ngrowing\n \nproblem,\n \nwhich\n \nl see\n \nin\n \nmy\n \nown \nlocal\n \nNational\n \nPark,\n \nthe\n \nPeak\n \nDistrict,\n \non\n \na\n \nregular\n \nbasis.\n \nClearly\n \ncurrent\n \nlegislation\n \nis\n \nnot \nsufficient\n \nto\n \ndeal\n \nwith\n \nthis\n \nissue\n \nand\n \nto\n \nprotect\n \nour\n \nareas\n \nof\n \noutstanding\n \nnatural\n \nbeauty\n \nand \nnational\n \nparks\n \nfor\n \nfuture\n \ngenerations.\n \nI\n \nurge\n \nmembers\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nParliamentary\n \nCommittee\n \nto \ninclude\n \nthese\n \nadditional\n \nclauses\n \nin\n \nthe\n \ndraft\n \nDeregulation\n \nBill.\nI would be grateful for an acknowledgement of this letter, and to be kept informed. \nThank\n \nyou.\nYours\n \nsincerely\nSally\n \nGreen\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
