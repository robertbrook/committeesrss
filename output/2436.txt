[[[call for evidence]]]&#xa0;1.1              Affinity Sutton Group is one of the largest Housing Associations in England. We work in over 120 local authorities in which we own or manage over 57,000 properties.  These include General Needs, Supported Housing, Keyworker, Leasehold and Part Buy/Part Rent homes. We welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to your inquiry into the provision of support to meet housing costs in the reformed welfare system. In particular we wish to comment on the social sector size criteria and will focus on the implications of this reform on landlords.&#xa0;1.2              Our business planning assumption is that the welfare reforms will lead to our rent arrears to more than double to 9.5% and our bad debts to more than quadruple to 3.5% after 2016/17. We estimate that 230 Affinity Sutton households will be subject to the benefit cap losing an average of £64 per week which will have an annual additional rent arrears impact on us of £0.7m. We have estimated that the size criteria will affect 4,000 of our residents (66% under-occupying by one bedroom and 34% by two bedrooms) and that this will have an annual impact of £4.2m. Therefore our total exposure from these two changes is estimated to cause us to lose income of nearly £5m pa assuming that none of the shortfall from reduced benefits is made up in other ways.

[[[Impact of social sector size criteria ]]]

[[[– unintended consequences]]]&#xa0;2.1              We invest heavily in our communities through our Community Foundation which we have endowed with £53m. The current economic climate and cuts to welfare have led us to support our residents by helping them into work and helping them manage their money better.&#xa0;Last year we helped 585 long term unemployed people into work, provided 77 apprenticeships and helped over 1700 take up affordable financial products and over 1200 access free debt advice. The level of our investment in this work – approaching £4.5m pa – will be exceeded by the loss of income we expect to suffer as a result of the welfare reforms.&#xa0;Many of our residents are vulnerable and we believe that the work we do to encourage people to get involved in their neighbourhood is key to the sustainability of our communities. We provide financial management training and advice and in response to welfare reforms have employed three additional Welfare Benefits Advisors to help residents maximise and manage their income. &#xa0;2.2              The shortage of housing in this country is well-documented and in addition to supporting communities Affinity Sutton is committed to delivering affordable homes.  Under our current housebuilding programme (2011-15) we are building over 3,000 much needed new homes.&#xa0;2.3              Rent is the main source of Affinity Sutton’s income and is essential for maintaining our existing homes, supporting our communities and building new affordable homes.  If we are to meet our housebuilding commitments and continue to add value to our neighbourhoods it is important that we do everything possible to maximise rent collection in a way that gives our residents the chance to pay.  For example, every pound of the public funding we receive to support our affordable housing programme is matched by £6 of private borrowing and other finance that we provide and this debt has to be repaid over time. The timely payment of rent is clearly extremely important if we are to do so.&#xa0;2.4              The figures below show the increase in Affinity Sutton rent arrears since April this year for the whole group and for those deemed to be under-occupying:&#xa0;

[[[Arrears ]]]

[[[Greatest monthly ]]]

[[[change]]]&#xa0;All residents                                                        0.18%                                           0.15%&#xa0;Under-occupying residents                             1.41%&#xa0;                             0.59%&#xa0;2.5              Rent arrears for those who are under-occupying have risen over seven times more quickly than average and in a single month increased by more than three times the all resident figure for the total five month period.  By transferring the burden from Housing Benefit to Housing Association balance sheets an unintended consequence of this policy could ultimately put the supply of new affordable homes at risk; a situation that would see more families reliant on the more expensive private rented sector and an increase in the cost to Housing Benefit.&#xa0;2.6              It is likely that the increase in our arrears would have been significantly worse had it not been for the work of our welfare benefit advisors and support workers who have made 107 successful Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) claims for residents since April.  Local Authorities have been able to award a greater number of DHP payments during this period than would usually be the case because they built up reserves over the past few years. We fear this increased reliance of households on DHP is not sustainable in the long term.&#xa0;2.7              We are helping a number of people to move to smaller accommodation via the mutual exchange route which allows households to move into a home with one bedroom more than they are deemed eligible for. Since April 2013 we’ve completed 449 mutual exchanges; largely as a consequence of the shortage of smaller homes, 85 of these households (19%) moved to accommodation which was still too large by one bedroom. Around&#xa0;half of our residents who have downsized in this way will still be impacted by a 14% reduction in housing benefit as they move from under-occupying their home by two or more bedrooms down to one. Although residents may be reducing the impact of the bedroom tax by moving in this way, the risk presented to us as a landlord remains. Should the household find that their financial circumstances deteriorate for any reason&#xa0;(e.g. loss of job, relationship breakdown) or even the new lower rent is unaffordable, any housing benefit to which they are entitled will not meet their housing costs resulting in potential hardship, rent arrears or both. &#xa0;2.8     In some areas, particularly in the north of England, we have historically allowed under-occupation of three and four bedroom houses. This is both because this is the predominant property type and also because we cannot meet the large demand for two bedroom homes. Additionally, we try to actively manage levels of child density, thereby allowing families to grow into a property and help with community stability and cohesion. Most local authority allocation schemes allowed for under occupation by one bedroom for the same reasons. Generally local authorities have now changed their approach to allocating properties to fall in line with the housing benefit changes which came into effect April 2013 and do not nominate households who would under occupy and be affected by the benefit changes.&#xa0;Consequently, demand is falling for larger homes in some northern towns and cities (examples are Hull, Bradford, Leeds, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne). In these locations the local authority is either struggling to nominate suitable housing applicants or have simply said they cannot nominate applicants for larger homes for the foreseeable future.

[[[Savings to Treasury of the social sector size criteria]]]&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are currently undertaking a piece of research assessing the likely level of savings to Government generated by the under-occupation penalty. We are working with three other social landlords -&#xa0;Riverside, Gentoo and Wigan and Leigh Housing - with support from the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York). Using the DWP’s own savings impact model, and re-running it with data drawn from real experience across the four organisations since April, our initial findings indicate that the level of savings projected by DWP are likely to have been overstated to a significant extent, possibly by as much as a third. Despite the generation of savings being one of the Government’s key objectives for the policy, and central to Parliamentary debates during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, our study confirms the DWP’s own assessment that there is “uncertainty about likely claimant and landlord responses to the introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” (DWP 2012 p13). Our work also highlights significant deficiencies in the design of the model which are likely to have further overstated the level of savings generated through the implementation of the under-occupation penalty. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This research complements work being undertaken by the National Housing Federation, considering indirect costs which should be taken into account in an overall assessment of the financial impact of the policy. These include potential extra net costs to tenants, landlords, local authorities and the voluntary sector such including:&#xa0;&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst it is difficult to quantify these additional costs with accuracy, taken together with the reduced savings discussed above, we believe there is now a powerful case for urgent scrutiny of the £930m two year savings estimate, which has been presented as one of the central objectives of this policy.&#xa0;26 September 2013&#xa0;
