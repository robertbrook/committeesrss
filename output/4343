defaultSurfers Against Sewage response to The Environmental Audit Committee Inquiry On The Sustainability Of Measures To Reduce The Use Of Plastic Shopping Bags.default&#xa0;
defaultSurfers Against Sewage (SAS) is an environmental charity protecting the UK’s oceans, waves and beaches for all to enjoy safely and sustainably, via community action, campaigning, volunteering, conservation, education and scientific research.  SAS is also a founding member of the Break The Bag Habit coalition and has campaigned strongly for a charge on single use bags to reduce their impacts on the environment.

defaultThe Likely Change In The Number Of Bags Discarded And Any Benefits For Biodiversity And The Environment:default&#xa0;
defaultSAS annually organise between 100 – 200 beach cleans around the UK.  Plastic bags are consistently found on these beach cleans and whilst they might not be the most 
defaultcommonly
default found

default, they are often the most visible. All bags can impact on marine species (over 100,000 marine mammals and 1 million sea birds die from entanglement and ingestion of marine litter.)

defaultand bags labelled as ‘biodegradable’ might not persist in the environment as long as plastic bags (although current biodegradable bags can take many years to break down in the marine environment

default).  However, they are still littered and unsightly and can still cause death to marine life from ingestion and entanglement.  SAS believes these bags should not be exempt from the proposed charge.  The exemption would undermine the effectiveness of the charge at reducing litter, protecting the environment and changing behaviour.  The proposed exemption might also encourage retail

defaultrs to provide free single use paper bags.  There are numerous environmental impacts associated with paper bags and many of these are considered worst for the environment than the plastic bags included in the charge.  For example, paper bags require greater energy to transport.   
default&#xa0;
defaultN.B. SAS do not accept the current biodegradable bags are at a standard that the public recognise as biodegradable due to the specific conditions needed for these bags to biodegrade.       
default&#xa0;
defaultSAS also believe that exempting businesses with less than 250 employees would also reduce the effectiveness of the charge at protecting the environment and changing behaviour amongst consumers.  These exemptions will also create confusion for consumers and retailers, creating differing systems within the UK.  The bag charge in Wales and Northern Ireland is proving successful with all types of businesses and encompasses all single use bags.  Wales has seen a 
default76% reduction in single use bag distribution since the charge has been implemented and has strong support (more than 70%) for the charge from the public (

default). The Break The Bag Habit coalition commissioned a poll that showed 75% of the English public would try and cut the number of bags used if a charge was implemented (

default).  The Association of Convenience Store (ACS) would support the English bag charge mirroring the established and successful charge in Wales (

default).  As the scheme is a charge and not a tax it will be free of onerous reporting and will allow shops to distribute the funds raised 
defaultin their community 
defaultas they feel appropriate.    
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst SAS would support a ban on all single use bags, we accept there is legislation in place to implement a charge and strongly believes a charge would better serve the environment than the status quo.

defaultThe Likely Changes In The Volume Of Plastic Film Produced, And The Impact Of A Reduced Demand For The Oil Production By-Product Used To Make Bags:default&#xa0;
defaultThere is strong evidence to show any increase in sales of alternative plastic bags (for example bin liners

default, is small in comparison with the reduction of single use bags distributed.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt’s important to reiterate that the single use paper bags and bags labelled as biodegradable have a significant environmental impact and the Government should include all single use bags in the charge.
