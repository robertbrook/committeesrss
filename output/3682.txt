[[[How should we do this?]]]&#xa0;

[[[Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) is an extraordinary over-reaction to what the evidence tells us is the situation.]]]  It involves the destruction of the whole current national system for assessing and supervising offenders and its replacement with an approach that does not seem to be evidence based.   The priority aim – to improve reoffending rates by those released from prison – can be achieved better through targeted action than by an undifferentiated attack on the entire system for supervising offenders: most offenders under statutory supervision are on community orders not post-release licences.

[[[The new system will erode and complicate the essential close working links between probation and other local services, bodies and organisations]]].

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The quality of work with offenders depends on staff with the right skills and attitudes but there are no plans for how staff delivering probation services will be trained in future.]]]  The new National Probation Service (NPS) will not be able to provide practice-based training because it will not have the capacity and it would not be appropriate for new trainees to work with the most serious offenders.  It is unclear who will provide the academic element of training.  The Government proposes a professional body or institute.  While this may be an excellent way to promote standards it is difficult to see how it could resolve the problem of how training is provided or of who has the authority to mandate the content of training. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The breaking up of probation will lead to the erosion of organisational knowledge about best practice in managing and rehabilitating offenders]]].  While the proposed new institute will have a part to play it will not be able to replace the everyday workplace-based sharing of intelligence about good professional practice and the career development experience of today’s probation staff.  Over time employees of contracted services will lose experience in, for example, report-writing; residential work; victim issues; assessment and management of risk, breach and recall; MAPPA; and how courts and the Parole Board work while staff in the NPS will lose touch with unpaid work and the breadth of experience of supervising offenders with high needs but low risk such as petty recidivists.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Sharing the assessment of risk across two organisations builds]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[in weakness to public protection work.]]]  The most effective risk assessment is an unbroken process involving periodic “actuarial” and continuous “clinical” monitoring, review and action by a single responsible person.  The new arrangements make it impossible for this to happen in the contracted services.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Financial uncertainty]]].  Contracts will be with lead providers who can bear the financial risks but it is not unknown for private sector companies providing public services to fail, financially or in terms of quality of service.  With a much reduced public probation sector the national centre will have to deal with any contract failure.     &#xa0;&#xa0;
