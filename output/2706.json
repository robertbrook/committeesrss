"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health&#xa0;&#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExecutive\n Summary\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe CIEH welcomes the Select Committee’s Inquiry into the Government’s review of housing standards and its proposals on the Code for Sustainable Homes.  The principal role for Environmental Health Practitioners is in the maintenance of housing standards and conditions in the private rented sector, but there is strong interest in the standards \net\n for new build housing\n, not least\n as these are of course the private rented dwellings of the future. The consultation also raises important issues about accessibility and space standards\n, which are of \nparticular\n interest\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe key points of our submission are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2              Overall approach &#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe consultation is concerned with the standards that are applied to new housing construction and seeks to both to simplify standards and remove unnecessary ones, concentrating on those that should be \nmandatory\n,\n \nwhile other issues are left to be the subject of \nvoluntary \ncodes adopted by the industry. \n&#xa0;\nCIEH position\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe distinction between mandatory and voluntary is sensible, but the \nbalance between the two has \nto be set carefully. \nT\nhe housing market \ncurrently favours the \n“seller” and voluntary codes cannot be relied on \nalone \nto achieve the housing stock required in the longer term. \n \nFurthermore, government policies, especially its carbon-reduction targets, depend heavily on the performance of the current and future housing stock. The government should also be planning to ensure that the housing stock is better suited to the demographic shifts that are taking place. \n&#xa0;3              Implementation &#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe \nconsultation \npaper considers different methods for implementing the standards, e.g. embodying them in the Building Regulations. \n&#xa0;\nCIEH Position\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe\n CIEH ha\ns \nsome concerns about placing sole reliance on the Building Regulations, firstly in terms of the consistency w\nhen \napplied on energy issues and secondly, while the\ny\n are a well-established and relatively stable mechanism, \nthey have proven less successful in driving up \nstandards. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nIt\n i\ns not only in energy efficiency that Building Reg\nulations\n are inconsistently applied\n; t\nhey\n are\n also not noted for\n bringing about\n step changes in standards\n,\n while the\nre is resistance by\n house builders \nto\n improvement\ns.  But we do not view the solution as being in\n voluntary codes\n.\n&#xa0;\n4              Keeping the standards under review &#xa0;\nCIEH Position \n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nWhilst this is n\not an issue of great significance for \nthe CIEH\n, \nwe support the establishment of a \nreview group\n, which\n should \nhave a\n broad\n base \nto reflect consumer and wider interests (e.g.\n on\n environmental\n and \naccessibility\n issues\n) and should not be solely an industry forum\n.  It \nis not clear \nto us \nhow this is different from the current B\nuilding \nR\negulations \nA\ndvisory \nC\nommittee\n which \nthe CIEH \nha\ns\n had occasional input into.\n&#xa0;5              Standards for affordable housing &#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nThe \nGovernment proposes to remove separate standards for affordable housing but that its higher needs are ‘taken into account’ in implementation. \n&#xa0;\nCIEH Position \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nWe agree with the Chartered Institute of Housing that s\neparate standards for social housing have served the sector well. Of course, if the private sector w\nas\n willing/able to operate to the same standards then differences may no longer be justified, but recent experience suggests that it is not. \n&#xa0;6              Accessibility &#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nCurrent standards\n on accessibility\n are in part M of the Building Regulations but there are also discretionary standards about wheelchair access and (particularly) the Lifetime Homes (LTH) standard\n, while v\narious other standards are set by local authorities. The government proposes both a minimum, compulsory standard set in Building Regulations and two further optional levels – intermediate (similar to LTH) and high (fully wheelchair accessible) which could be applied to a proportion of units in a development. \n&#xa0;\nCIEH Position \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nFor too long there ha\ns\n been ambiguity, not only in the standards to follow when designing accessible property but to the interpretation of the guidance given. The result of interpretation of the guidance alongside the often conflicting policies (also determining the building design) \nhave sometimes led\n \nto “\nhybrid\n” properties\n that \nare\n not always fit for purpose or which may have been over manufactured for ‘disability’, rather than being accessible.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nOften when considering adaptations to a property the person requiring them has quite differing and individual needs. \nCouncil Disabled Facilities Grant and adaptation \nservice\ns\n need to consider the individual anthropometrics; one size of adaptation does not always fit all.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nBy making the policy clear and functional, it is hoped that ‘accessible and adaptable’ \nhomes will be provided \nallow\ning\n for the easy tailoring to a person’s needs.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nIt is very important to make the standards the same for private and affordable housing, which would hopefully open up the housing options for people perhaps affected by the welfare reform changes, or that are inadvertently discriminated against through lack of accessible stock across tenure. Encouraging private landlords to consider accessible stock might impact on the pressures on the council housing stock.\n&#xa0;\n6.6\n              \n‘The wheelchair standard’ should be researched and be more of a culmination of other recognised guidance. \nW\nheelchair users\n should be consulted in this research, which \nshould cover not only the internals of the building, but the approach, access and the provision of parking. \n&#xa0;\n6.7\n              \nSome local authorities \nhave seen \nincreased demand \nfor one bed wheelchair accessible stock\n, following\n the introduction of the welfare reform changes, however, location of this also needs to be near community facilities or is not easily rented. \nThere is some evidence also of\n a rise in families requiring accessible, level access property, so that they are able to easily and independently tend to their children and stay together as a family in their chosen community. These are mostly 3-4 bed needs. Developers have reported that costs of building such stock are high due to the land required and there is no incentive to build this type of stock, resulting in costly extensions to\n&#xa0;\nexisting properties, if the building structure lends itself to this in the first place.\n&#xa0;\n6.8\n              \nThe part M requirements essentially make a home ‘\nvisitable\n’ rather than fully useable overall by a disabled person.\n&#xa0;\n The debate is therefore essentially about whether LTH (or similar) should be required nationally across sectors.\n&#xa0;\n It already applies in London and several LAs outside London and the previous government planned to extend it to the private sector. The obvious arguments in favour are the ageing population and the much lower cost of incorporating higher standards from the outset. \n&#xa0;\n6.9\n              \nPart M was a significant advance nevertheless it is somewhat tokenistic and can be applied that way. By contrast, LTHs are not only about the immobility of age and, for example, ought to facilitate caring for chronically sick people in the community.\n&#xa0;7              Space &#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nNational space standards apply only in affordable housing through the HCA and GLA, although they may be enforced by LAs through planning policies. Given the variety of approaches there is obviously a case for harmonisation. \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nThe government has backed away from directly tackling poor space standards and prefers a voluntary approach based on labelling.\n&#xa0;\n However, if the aim is to avoid conflicting approaches\n, the Government \nwould \nprobably need to\n rescind current planning guidance that encourages local standards, or else \nencourage\n a consistent voluntary standard which LAs would have to adopt if they wanted to \nexceed\n the minimum. \n&#xa0;\nCIEH Position \n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nThe \nlargely voluntary approach of the past clearly has\n \nn\no\nt delivered.\n&#xa0;\n Setting (adequate) mandatory standards would not only have significant practical benefits but be of symbolic importance in the government/construction industry relationship too.\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n              \nBritain currently \nhas\n the lowest floor space in new build in Europe and is the only country without minimum standards.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe CIEH \nfavour\ns\n a minimum standard that applies to all housing, not just affordable housing, that could then be consistently applied across England. \n We do not consider that an official labelling system is required above that.\n&#xa0;\n8              Water efficiency &#xa0;\n8.1\n              \nB\nasic water efficiency is currently covered by the Building Regulations and \nlocal authorities\n are able to put forward local standards, which are normally part of sustainability requirements linked to the Code. \n&#xa0;\nThe government favours continued standards and proposes a dual approach – one based on the whole house and the other on efficiency of individual fittings.\n&#xa0;\n The standards would be aimed at a similar level as currently. \n&#xa0;\nCIEH Position \n&#xa0;8.2\n              \nThe CIEH is \nsceptical of 'whole house' standards since these seem harder to enforce, lead to less market transformation and in some cases have encouraged the installation of inappropriate fittings (to 'balance' other inappropriate fittings) which are then replaced. \n&#xa0;\nWe are also not convinced on the case for\n more stringent local standards; it\n i\ns plain that household consumption cannot be squeezed inexorably to accommodate more and more incomers and where there\n i\ns no further scope for resource development or leakage reduction, the planning system has to say 'no'.\n&#xa0;9              Energy &#xa0;\n9.1\n              \nThere are two main issues \nof\n concern \nto the \nC\nhartered Institute\n: the proposed \nwi\nnding\n up\n of the Code for Sustainable Homes and the scrapping of the provisions in the Planning and Energy Act 2008 which permit local standards for energy efficiency to be set. The importance of the domestic sector in energy use and the double advantage of tackling energy-inefficiency in homes (i.e. both reducing energy us\ne and cutting consumers’ costs)\n \nmeans \nit is vital that standards are as ambitious as possible if the government’s 2020 and 2050 carbon reduction targets are to be met. \n&#xa0;10              Code for Sustainable Homes&#xa0;\nCIEH Position\n&#xa0;\n10.1\n              \nWe \nare\n concerned at the loss of the Code for several reasons: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11              Local standards &#xa0;11.1\n              \nLocal planning authority standards have required developers to work to local sustainability goals, for example generating a proportion of energy on-site, from renewable sources.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nCIEH Position\n&#xa0;\n11.2\n              \nInitiatives like the \"Merton Rule\" \nhave worked well and\n should be encouraged.\n&#xa0;\nAn important consideration is that planners and planning authorities have often been in the driving seat for local sustainability ideas which have then been taken up more widely. \n&#xa0;\nAs a \nprofessional body, we set standards and accredit courses and qualifications for the education of our professional members and other environmental health practitioners.\n&#xa0;\nAs a \nknowledge centre, we provide information, evidence and policy advice to local and national government, environmental and public health practitioners, industry and other stakeholders.  We publish books and magazines; run educational events and commission research.  \n&#xa0;\nAs an \nawarding body, we provide qualifications, events, and trainer and candidate support materials on topics relevant to health, wellbeing and safety to develop workplace skills and best practice in volunteers, employees, business managers and business owners.\n&#xa0;\nAs a \ncampaigning organisation,\n we work to push environmental health further up the public agenda and to promote improvements in environmental and public health policy.  \n&#xa0;\nWe are a \nregistered charity with over 10,500 members across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n&#xa0;\n3\n October 2013\n5\n"
