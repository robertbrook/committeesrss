[normal]British Air Transport Association – Written evidence[bold]              [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The British Air Transport Association (BATA) welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the ‘Call for Written Evidence’ conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.
[normal]              
[normal]BATA is the trade body for UK registered airlines. Our eleven members cover all sectors of the airline industry – including freight, charter, low fare, regional operations and full service. In 2012, BATA members employed 73,000 people, operated four-fifths of the UK commercial aircraft fleet and were responsible for some 96% of UK airline output, carrying 131 million passengers and 1.1 million tonnes of cargo. The eleven BATA member airlines are: British Airways, DHL, easyJet, Flybe, Jet2.com, Monarch, RVL Group, Thomas Cook, Thomson Airways, Titan Airways and Virgin Atlantic.

[normal]              
[normal]Recent decades have seen increasing deregulation of the aviation industry, in the UK, Europe and globally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Despite this welcome trend, the industry remains one of the most highly regulated sectors in the world, and from one perspective at least, quite rightly so. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Maintaining the UK’s excellent safety record and controlling the excesses of monopoly suppliers, notably airports and air traffic control providers, remain key objectives of the industry’s regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] BATA would not support any attempt to reduce the effectiveness of the CAA in maintaining close supervision, in co-operation with airlines and other stakeholders, of these two areas of its work, although of course there is always room for efficiency improvements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]With this caveat, BATA would welcome the proposed application to the CAA of a duty to have regard to “promoting economic growth” in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] UK airlines operate in highly competitive international markets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The application of any burdensome and unnecessary regulation makes that task all the more difficult.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The promotion of UK economic growth, on the other hand, provided it is carried out sensibly and with due regards to the broader interests of the aviation industry, can only help airlines to grow, creating additional wealth and employment in the economy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is also a fact to be taken into account that many of the CAA’s equivalent organisations in other countries already have a role in promoting economic growth in their own economies, either directly or implicitly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In the United States, for example, the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, the economic and safety regulators of the US airline industry and provider of air traffic control services, have a specific legal duty to promote US aviation interests internationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]The CAA is a monopoly regulator and it is important that every effort is made to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] BATA was disappointed that the Department for Transport rejected our proposal to include a specific efficiency duty for the CAA in the new Civil Aviation Act, despite support from stakeholders and indeed the CAA itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We do recognise the efficiency improvements launched by the current CAA management team and their willingness to consult extensively and constructively with us and our members.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Nevertheless, vigilance must be maintained.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] A current consultation on the collection of industry data is an example of additional regulation which potentially will damage the ability of UK airlines to compete in the international marketplace while providing only limited, if any, consumer benefits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]In summary, BATA supports the CAA being given a duty to promote economic growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The Authority should be required to report annually on what it is doing to meet such an objective and how it is supporting UK industry by minimising its regulatory burden while maintaining high standards in those areas where regulation is necessary.
