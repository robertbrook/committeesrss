"&#xa0;\nWe\n, the Liverpool \nHigh Speed\n Too Group,\n believe that the government preferred \nroute \nfor Phase 2 of HS2 is \nentirely \ninadequate in term of its provision for \nthe City of \nLiverpool and the Liverpool City Region. The current proposals, far from ensuring the future prosperity of the city and region, \nwill be of dubious benefit and possibly damaging to its economic prospects.\nThe proposals fail Liverpool in the following ways:\nWe believe\n, and can demonstrate, \nthat the City of Liverpool and the Liverpool City Region are of suffic\nient size and economic\n importance to justify significant\n infrastructure investment and, therefore, st\nrongly disagree with the \ncurrent proposal\ns\n.\nWe recommend that the government demands that HS2 provides a service to Liverpool that helps achieve the stated aim of rebalancing the national economy. Specifically, we recommend that:\nThe Liverpool H\nigh \nS\npeed\n Too Group was formed in response to the publication of the Government Preferred Route for Phase 2 of HS2 in January of this year. We are an independent group of Liverpudlian professionals, broadly supportive of the HS2 scheme but dedicated to the aim of e\nxposing the deficiencies of the current proposals with respect to the proposed Liverpool service.\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLiverpool and \nits City Region\n represent one of the most important metropolitan regions of the country. \nFollowing\n a long period of economic decline\n, t\nhe last decade has \nwitnessed\n a revival in Liverpool’s fortunes with the successful bid for European Capital of Culture in 2008 and economic developments such as the Liverpool One retail centre, the Arena and Convention \nCentre an\nd the Cruise Liner Terminal\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis revival does not show any sign of abating. \nP\nopulation \nis increasing\n and n\next year (2014), Liverpool will host the International Festival of Business showcasing the cit\ny to the world and will \nsee work commence\n on \nthe Liverpool Exhibition Centre at Kings Dock. Infrastructure developments are also taking place – most notably the Liverpool \n2\n Post-Panamax container port in Sefton and the Mersey Gateway Bridge in Halton. Plans have now been approved for the massive \nLive\nrpool and Wirral Waters office, commercial and residential developmen\nts.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nC\nity \nR\negion is host to internationally important \nindustrie\ns including the Jaguar Land Rover factory in Knowsley, the Vauxhall factory and petro-chemical industry in Halton and th\ne pharmaceutical and biotech industries in Liverpool.\n The \nC\nity of Liverpool has a large and well-established financial services industry.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nC\nity has three universities, Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores and Liverpool Hope\n and is an internationally renown\ned centre for education.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nC\nity and \nR\negion has developed a major tourist industry and possesses some world class tourist attractions including the Albert Dock, Cavern Quarter, Mersey Ferries, Museum \nQuarter, the Grand National and the two Premier League\n football teams. The \nC\nity is an international brand, frequently cited as the most well-known English city outside of London.\n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLiverpool John Lennon Airport has, in the past fifteen years\n,\n developed into a major international airport listed amongst the top \nten in the UK and is pursuing further expansion. \n&#xa0;\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLiverpool has \na \ngrowing c\nruise liner terminal, which, \nis \nde\nveloping as an\n important alternative to the\n e\nstablished south coast ports.\n&#xa0;\n1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTable 1 (below) shows that Liverpool is the third busiest flow, into \nand out of London, on the West Coast Main Line. Although Liverpool currently has almost half the annual passenger numbers to London of\n \nManchester, it only has a third of the service.\n&#xa0;\n1.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe above demonstrates that Liverpool has a diverse and modern economy f\nor which good connectivity to the national transport network is vital. The current HS2 proposals do not recognise this fact and appear rooted in an outdated image of the city and its economy.\nLocationBranchLondon 2012-13 paxCurrent Trains per hour to LondonBirmingham\nWest\n3822\n8\nManchester\nWest\n3148\n3\nLeeds\nEast\n1846\n2\nLiverpoolWest17091York\nEast\n1374\n3\nNewcastle\nEast\n1231\n2\nNottingham\nEast\n1164\n2\nEdinburgh\nEast\n1051\n2\nSheffield\nEast\n869\n2\nStockport\nWest\n820\n3\nDerby\nEast\n645\n2\nGlasgow\nWest\n619\n1\nPreston\nWest\n534\n1\nCrew\ne\nWest\n520\n2\nTable 1:  Main HS2 served locations, annual passenger totals to/from London, (Source: LENNON 2012-2013)2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe HS2 proposals ignore the recommendation of the \nHeseltine / Leahy report (Ref 1) – ‘Government should commit to ensuring Liverpool’s historic parity with Manchester for travel time to London and thereby avoid harmful competitive disadvantage to Liverpool in attracting inward investors.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nreport\n \naccom\npanying the HS2 Phase 2 \nsubmission \n(Ref 2\n) gives\n minimal attention to the pro\nvision of a Liverpool service.\n Reference is made to a ‘high level’ gauge clearance study and to unspecified routes via Warrington. The conclusion is drawn that the provision of se\nrvices to \nintermediate destinations\n is more important than an improved Liverpool service.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe attention given to Liverpool falls far \nshort of\n that given to other cities such as Sheffield and Derby, where captive station sites \nand routes \nhave been\n identified\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n T\nhe effect of the Merseyrail network – the most intensive suburban railway network outside of London – in concentrating the Liverpool market is not recognised. The MVA consultancy report\n (Ref.3\n)\n, on which the HS2 proposals is based, \nclaims t\nhat the Liverpool market is\n ‘polycentric’ \nbased on the odd inclusion of\n \nStafford, a station remote from the Liverpool City Region as well as Crewe\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe faster of the two hourly Liverpool services will run for \n40\n miles on existing tracks.\n The train units o\nn this route section will be restricted to 110mph (175kph), which is slower than the present\n Virgin Pendolinos\n. The journey time over this section is further restricted by two stops\n:\n Runcorn \nand\n Crewe.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe slower service will run for 75 miles on existing \ntracks due to a stop at Stafford. It will join HS2 at Lichfield, \nuniquely \nmaking no use \nof \nPhase 2 infrastructure.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNine miles of the classic Liverpool route (Chorlton, south of Crewe to Minshull Vernon near Winsford) will run parallel to the HS2 route. Tr\nains on this section will run at half the speed of the adjacent HS2 captive services (175kph vs 360kph).\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect of the current proposals on the economy of Liverpool has been evaluated on behalf of HS2 by KPMG, a world leading firm of \nauditors and acco\nuntants\n (Ref.\n 4 and 5\n) \n. They have calculated two possible outcomes based on assumptions business sensitivity to transport connectivity. The \nlow \nassumption results in a net gain to the city of \n£114.95million per annum whereas the high\n assumption results in a net loss of £50.19million. \n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe corresponding figures for Preston, which though further from London and smaller than Liverpool\n,\n are gains of £178.77million and £141.46million respectively\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need for the proposed classic compat\nible units to share tracks used by relatively slow commuter passenger trains and freight services reduces capacity. This is particularly acute on the double track section of the West Coast Main Line from Crewe to Weaver Junction\n used by services from and t\no the Port of Liverpool\n.\n The freeing up of \nfreight capacity on existing lines is highlighted as a major benefit of HS2, however, in the case of Liverpool, this \nis \nclearly not the case\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLiverpool does not have a Birmingham service provided by HS2 despite h\naving significantly more passengers to that city than either Leeds or Sheffield\n, which\n both enjoy a good connection under current proposals.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRevising the proposed service pattern \ncan significantly improve Liverpool’s current HS2 proposal with minimal investment in infrastructure. Reducing the number of station stops and maximising the use of HS2 high speed infrastructure will allow\n more competitive journey times\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe present propo\nsed route layout has led to Crewe and Stafford being included in the Liverpool service.\n \nThe provision of a\n north junction at Crewe would allow \nfor services from \nGlasgow and/or Edinburgh \nto stop at the town, thereby retaining top flight Scottish services an\nd removing an unnecessary Liverpool connection.\n (Crewe to Liverpool w\nould\n continue t\no be served by local services).\n&#xa0;\n3.1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe removal of the Stafford stop would result in a considerable reduction in journey time for the slower Liverpool service due to the \nelimi\nnation of both the\n station stop and the 35miles of additional reduced speed running.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStafford’s rail connection to London could be maintained by a similar solution to that proposed for \nthe \nnearby and larger city of Stoke on Trent.\n3.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following proposals \nlist ways of enhancing the present classic compatible service without developing a full captive service.\n They are not fully developed but illustrate options that do not appear to have been considered by HS2.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMinshu\nll Vernon Junction: A new junction north of Crewe at the point where the HS2 and West Coast Main Line (WCML) routes diverge allowing Liverpool services to use the HS2 route to by-pass the town. This would remove the parallel running situation outlined in 2\n.6 (above).\n&#xa0;\n3.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCheshire Link Line\n: A new line, some 15km long, linking the HS2 spine route at a point north east of Northwich to Weaver Junction where the Liverpool line branches from the WCML. This would not only allow for a greater length of running at ful\nl linespeed (360kph) and maximum branch linespeed (230kph) but would address the freight capacity issue outlined in \n2.10 (above). The new line would also improve services to Warrington and could form part of a future captive branch.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy serving Warrington \nfrom the Liverpool route, the opportunity would arise for freeing up a valuable hourly train path on the HS2 spine route. Possible routes are listed below.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDitton Freight Route\n – Opening to passenger services of an existing freight line from Ditton\n Junction near Widnes to HS2 south east of Warrington. This would involve reopening the disused Warrington Bank Quay low level station and so providing Warrington with a much improved service. Some realignment of existing tracks and reopening of a section \nof disused route would be necessary.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWarrington Central Route\n. The connection of HS2 to the existing passenger route from Liverpool to Manchester via Warrington Central via a new curve at Birchwood would be relatively inexpensive and make use of freed up \ncapacity following the completion of the more northerly Chat Moss route. This would reduce the length of classic track running into Liverpool Lime Street to 40km (25 miles).\n3.3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo gain the maximum benefit from HS2 investment, a ca\nptive route taking trains into the city centre is a high priority. Such a line would allow much reduced journey times and far greater capacity. It is the obvious solution for a major city region. The following paragraphs contain suggestions \nfor constructin\ng such a route using a mixture of new and existing infrastructure.\nFigure 1: Liverpool Captive Route Option3.3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFigure 1 illustrates some options for constructing a captive train service into central Liverpool. The numbers in the fol\nlowing paragraphs relate to this figure.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItem 1. Liverpool Exchange Station Site – This, largely undeveloped site would have obvious advantages as a Liverpool HS2 terminal due to its proximity to the existing underground Moorfields Station with its Wirral\n and Northern Line services plus its location in the business district of the city and its closeness to the waterfront and cruise liner terminal. It also has very good road access \nand is\n walking distance of the proposed Liverpool Waters development.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItem \n2: New approach tunnels from Exchange. Two single track tunnels are likely to be required, although initially, a single \ntrack tunnel might suffice\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItem 3: Liverpool Lime Street Station. As Liverpool’s current main line terminus, the development of an HS2\n station here is an alternative to Item 1. The length of station required would \nmean\n some demolition and / or projection west the current site \nbut could prove a catalyst for the regeneration of the Lime Street area\n.\n \nA Northern Line connection to Liverpool \nCentral is possible\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItem 4: The Victoria Tunnel. An existing disused tunnel formerly used for traffic to Liverpool docks. This has sufficient size and straightness to accommodate one line of HS2 track. A new parallel tunnel would take the second track, \nif required. The tunnel emerges at Edge Hill Station.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItem 5: Edge Hill to Wavertree. A section of disused land north of the current railway would allow two tracks of HS2 to be constructed as far as Wavertree Technology Park Station.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItem 6: The Olive Mo\nunt Cutting. The historic cutting was originally built for four tracks but is now used by two. The unused south side of the cutting could accommodate one track of HS2. The second track would run in tunnel to the north. The route would continue in tunnel to\n Bowring Park where it reaches open land.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItem 7: The Liverpool Loop Railway. The disused but intact Liverpool Loop Line could form an alternative route for HS2 southwards. I\nt was built for four tracks and so would easily accommodate the two track of HS2. A route to open country is available at Gateacre.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn total, the \nlength of tunnelling required, in the worst case, would be 7km.\n (This compares favourably with the 1\n2\nkm of \ndo\nuble track tunnel required for the branch into Manchester).\n&#xa0;\n3.3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom the outskirts of Liverpool to HS2, the route would be across country. The nearest point for a connection to HS2 is at Culcheth, north east of Warrington\n, some 30km from Liverpool\n (see Figure\n 2 below)\n. \nThe route would be entirely across open country and would follow the M62 motorway to reduce environmental intrusion.\n A parkway station could be provided both to serve Warrington and road traffic from the M62 and M6, so providing a major HS2 faci\nlity for the southern part of the north west region.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Culcheth route would allow a journey time of around 71 minutes, so competitive with the fastest Manchester journey time of 68 minutes.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 2: The Culcheth Route3.3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs an \nalternative, a route from the HS2 spine via Daresbury south west of Warrington would allow for a new parkway station with road and rail access to Runcorn and Warrington. This would require a greater length of track and a Mersey crossing . The route has the\n advantage that it could be developed from the Cheshire Link Route described in paragraph 3.2.3 above.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe that HS2 Limited has ignored the potential benefits for the entire network of improving the service for the Liverpool City Regio\nn. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNetwork Rail in their High Speed Rail proposals of 2009 \n(Ref \n6\n)\n \nestimated that a Liverpool and Warrington Spur would contribute around 5 million London passengers per year.\n A Liverpool Spur would provide journey time savings for around 32mins per journey\n for each of those passengers.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditionally, it would allow \nthe \ncheap\ner Captive trains to be used\n and\n,\n due to improved journey times\n,\n only two thirds of the train sets would\n be needed to provide the same service, ringing substantial savings.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA spur would also make additional services viable, adding more benefits and using existing infrastructure more efficiently.  A twice hourly service Liverpool – Warrington – Birmingham wo\nuld \nincrease\n revenues, release capacity for reuse and provide agglomeration benefits for all cities involved.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA spur joining the HS2 spine near Culcheth would create the opportunity of a Liverpool – Warrington – Manchester Airport – Manchester Piccadilly \nregional “javelin” service\n to improve the current congested and slow service\n.  The potential for agglomeration and capacity release are substantial for \nboth cities\n and feed into plans for Manchester’s “Airport City” and \nthe \nLiverpool Wate\nrs development.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nnitial research by Liverpool High Speed Too have show that Liverpool HS2 Spur could have a Benefit Cost Ratio in the “Very High” range (greater than 4.0), excluding any wider eco\nnomic benefits.\n&#xa0;\nMartin Sloman                                                                                    Andrew MorrisGareth Parr                                                                                    Neil CardwellThe Liverpool High Speed Too Group – November 2013November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
