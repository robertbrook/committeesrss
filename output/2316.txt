[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Written evidence from Sherborne Transport Action Group (TIC 107)&#xa0;The Sherborne Transport Action Group (STAG) aims to improve transport provision for the people of Sherborne and the surrounding villages, particularly to help those without access to a car and to encourage car owners to use other modes.&#xa0;STAG welcomes all who have an interest in its objects.  Members may include representatives of town and parish councils, transport-related organisations, transport-providers and other interested members of the community.&#xa0;

[[[This submission was agreed by STAG at its meeting on 19 September 2013.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The great majority of enquiries into local transport have concentrated almost wholly on the context of cities and large towns.  We welcome the emphasis of the current enquiry .  We hope, however, that it will include not only areas which are truly isolated, but also the rural areas which cannot be regarded as isolated, but where the dispersal of population raises issues entirely different from those of the large urban areas.  Sherborne, with a population of 10,000 and surrounding villages of a few hundred, comes firmly in this category. &#xa0;

[[[Relation of Public Transport to Development Planning]]]Provision of public transport ought to be assessed in the overall context of planning.  This is made more difficult by the fact that transport is a County responsibility, while planning lies with the Districts.  Active integration is needed.The current criteria for the creation of Local Plans call for assessment, in deciding how rural areas should develop, of the overall effect on the cost of services to a community. The absence of accessible public transport will increase those costs. It has the effect of excluding many of the very elderly, who are present in increasing numbers, from any community or business centre which is less than a very few miles from their home (anecdotal evidence from the property market suggests 7 miles). This alienation, once it has occurred, is irreversible. There is a compelling case for providing housing in the villages for younger people so that schools and other facilities remain viable.  However, it would be perverse to decree an increase in the need for distributed social/affordable housing in isolated rural communities without costing in a long-term subsidy for transport. Those with a real need may be expected to have a greater requirement for public transport to access not only retail but increasingly necessary social and health services. Without a transport subsidy, the effect would otherwise be to create rural communities which are increasingly made up of the relatively wealthy middle aged, whose contribution to local costs is currently limited by the absurdly low top band of Council Tax. The relative cost to local government of servicing those of the population who are in fact frail, immobile or poor would therefore be reduced by not encouraging these people to live in isolated communities.  But it must be questioned whether this would be socially acceptable.

[[[Impact of the over-60 Concessionary Fare Scheme]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There are very few people who fully understand the Concessionary Fare Scheme.  We have encountered firm statements from local authority representatives which are in flat contradiction with the actual situation.  However, several factors stand out:&#xa0;1.  The scheme was introduced on the basis that it would be fully funded by central government.  While one recognises the right of a government to vary the undertakings of its predecessor, it is deeply regretable that 'government' (of whatever party) has reneged on this and thereby destroyed the foundations of the scheme.  Given the constraints on local authority funding, the reduction in central provision means that the operators are squeezed.  The original maxim that operators should neither gain nor lose by the scheme is no longer being honoured.&#xa0;2.  The basis of calculating reimbursement is extremely coarse, with a single reimbursement rate whatever the length of journey.  Some authorities work on an 'average fare' across all of an operator's routes.  The reimbursement rate is thus dominated by short urban routes (the large majority) and is wholly inadequate for the long rural routes.  This results in a perverse transfer of funds from long rural routes to short urban routes, contrary to the economic stresses.&#xa0;3.  Since the reimbursement rate is based on the average of cash fares (often a tiny minority of passengers) there is an incentive to keep those cash fares high and to avoid offering any discounted fares such as off-peak or promotional periods.  This militates against attracting new fare-paying passengers.&#xa0;4. There is widespread evidence that many passengers would be prepared to pay a modest fare rather than having entirely free travel, if this would secure the future of a route.  However, such flexibility is not permitted under the rules of the national scheme.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
