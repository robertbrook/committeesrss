"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC)&#xa0;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xa0;\nAbout WDC, Whale and Dolphin ConservationWDC is the leading global charity dedicated to the conservation and protection of whales and dolphins. We defend these remarkable creatures against the many threats they face through campaigns, lobbying, advising governments, conservation projects, field research and rescue. \nOur vision: A world where every whale and dolphin is safe and free.\nStarted in the UK in 1987, WDC now also has offices in England, Scotland, Germany, Australia, Argentina and \nthe United States\n. \n&#xa0;\nRationale for evidence submissionThe Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 includes powers to desi\ngnate Marine Conservation Zones\n. In England, 31 sites have been proposed in the first of a tranched approach to designations of MCZs in 2013. No time frame for completion of the network currently exists and furthermore, MCZs do not include any whale, dolphin or porpoise species. \n&#xa0;\nDefra have stated that sectoral measures (such as fisheries management, by-catch mitigation measures and protected species licensing) are likely to be the most effective tools in conserving very widely dispersed and mobile species. However, MCZs for such species would be considered if there is clear evidence that the conservation of a highly mobile species would benefit from site-based protection measures in English waters (Defra, 2013). The following sites had harbour porpoise as a feature originally, but have since been dropped: Bideford to Foreland MCZ, Mounts Bay MCZ, Cape Bank MCZ and Torbay MCZ, as well as Farnes East and Celtic deeps for white-beaked and common dolphins respectively.\n&#xa0;\nExisting scientific and legal evidenceAs stated in the foreword to the review of England’s Wildlife Sites and Ecological Network, a step change is need in our approach to wildlife conservation (Lawton \net al\n., 2010). A coherent network of MPAs hinges on good connectivity (Olsen \net al\n., 2013). A coherent whale and dolphin MPA network includes a range of protected areas such that key known feeding and calving grounds are protected, with enough connectivity to allow movement between sites without serious threat (Figure 1; Hoyt, 2011). Potential UK MPA and spatial protection measures network with all existing UK, EU and international designations included (levels of protection not reflected) are provided (Figure 2).\n&#xa0;\nAs a component of wider marine planning measures, MPAs (both individually and collectively) can help to ensure protection of harbour porpoises and other cetaceans, through the appropriate and transparent management of activities within coherent networks.\n&#xa0;\nWDC ha\ns\n gathered and provided scientific and legal advice whilst highlighting \nthe \nkey evidence to demonstrate that the UK government are required to designate a network of harbour porpoise Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) as required under the EU Habitats and Species Directive. \n&#xa0;\nHarbour porpoises are an Annex II listed species under the EU Habitats Directive. The UK has some of the highest numbers of porpoises in Europe (Booth \net al., \n2012). A genuinely representative network of Natura 2000 sites across Europe cannot therefore be completed without a suite of sites in UK waters. The UK approach to site designation under the EU Habitats Directive is at odds with much of the rest of Europe. The importance of the UK’s role in supporting a pan-European network of sites for harbour porpoise cannot be underestimated. The assessment of a coherent network of whale and dolphin MPAs requires an EU-wide ecosystem based view, both for biological reasons, where mobile species cross national boundaries and for political reasons, including meeting international and regional requirements, such as the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. \n&#xa0;\nAcknowledging the challenges of selecting sites for wide ranging species, it will be advisable to select sites that encompass the wide distribution and seasonal movements (if known) corresponding to different life-cycle stages of the species, where particular areas essential to their life and reproduction can be identified (European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity, 2009). An obligation to designate sites for harbour porpoise remains (European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity, 2009) and a number of EU countries have already done so.\n&#xa0;\n“…\nthe designation of SACs is central to achieving the objectives of the Habitats Directive and to maintaining or restoring, at Favourable Conservation Status, the species and habitats of Community interest since it requires Member States to apply \nthe necessary conservation measures in accordance with Article 6.1\n” (European Commission, 2012).\n&#xa0;\nFollowing an experts' meeting in December 2000, DG Environment determined that it is possible to identify areas representing crucial factors for the life cycle of harbour porpoise. \n&#xa0;\nWe demonstrate that by using best available evidence combined with expert judgement it is possible to identify areas of critic\nal habitat for harbour porpoise\n that persist over time. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition, WDC ha\nve\n broadened our focus to \nconsider \nthe wider marine protected area network. Harbour porpoise SACs are required within the framework of marine protected areas (MPAs) and wider marine protection that is a requirement for all whales, dolphins and porpoises (collectively known as cetaceans). This wider network must be ecologically coherent to ensure the long term protection of cetaceans and other species. \n&#xa0;\nCombining MPA and wider planning measures are also beneficial for humans.\n&#xa0;\nThis two-pronged approach to conservation, including both MPAs and wider measures, is required under the key European Directives to ensure favourable conservation status of harbour porpoise and other cetacean species.\n&#xa0;\nA full WDC report on this issue titled ‘\nMaking space for porpoises, dolphins and whales in UK seas\n’ (Dolman \net al., \n2013) \nis available: \nhttp://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/making-space-for-uk-porpoises-dolphins-and-whales.pdf\n This report builds upon a previous WDC report ‘\nTowards marine protected areas for whales, dolphins and porpoises in England, Scotland and Wales\n’ (Clark, Dolman and Hoyt, 2010) and also work undertaken by WWF in ‘Protecting harbour porpoise in UK seas’ (Evans and Prior, 2012).
