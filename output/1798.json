"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Association of Transport Co-ordinating Officers (TIC 096)&#xa0;1. Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?&#xa0;\n2\n.1. \nAs context, a complete network redesign and recast of \nservices\n w\nould carry a high risk of \nlosing many more current passengers than \nthose it may\n gain. Given that p\neople often make decisions on where they \nlive and where they work based on current provision, there is a need to produce a degree of stability in the provision of the public transport network\n if we wish to avoid taking away the \nmeans\n of getting to work for these people. \n&#xa0;\n2\n.2. \nI\ndentify\ning\n unmet d\nemand\n in a way that can result in significant passenger flows is not easy\n, and \na service designed for this \nwill often take a long period of \noperation\n to translate into significant passenger flows. \n&#xa0;\n2\n.3. \nIn addition to \nidentifying how current services meet\n demand\n, \nunlike for \nn\new \nhousing or business development areas, new demands in \nrural \nor isolated \nareas tend to be more limited and of relatively small flows. The common means of identifying demand are through:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;\n3\n.1. \nFor p\neople with disabilities\n, the \nincreasing\n \nproportion\n of \nservices\n operated by low floor \naccessi\nble\n buses is \nimproving\n \naccessibility\n for many. \nDial a Ride/ Ring &amp; Ride  services for the “frail elderly and disabled” \ncan \nprovide\n for those \nwho cannot physically access conventional bus services either due to boarding difficulties or due to distance from the bus stop. \nOther \nservices\n can also be \nprovided\n, e.g. to provide \nbespoke\n \ntransport\n to \nhealth\n \nservices\n/\nhospitals\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.2. \nThe degree to which \nDemand Responsive Transport (\nDRT\n)\n services are actually able to cater for access to work, as opposed to access to town centre and other essential services, needs to be questioned.\n T\nhey are not always well-suited to catering for regular journeys to/ from wo\nrk by workers, \ngiven \nconstraints\n \nthat\n \nlong term \npre-booking ahead cannot be \nguaranteed\n where \nrouteing \nhas to \ncompromise\n to \ntake account of all users across an area. \n&#xa0;\n3\n.3. \nEngagement\n with young people \nsuggest\ns\n that they \ntend\n not to favour \npre-booked DRT services \nas \nthey\n feel \nbetter served by regular timetabled services \ngiven the \n“turn-up-and-go”\n nature of much of\n their travel patterns.\n Fare levels can also be a barrier for young people’s travel.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;\n4\n.1. \nIt is difficult to generalise on specific solutions g\niven geographical differences across the country in \nboth urban and \nrural areas\n where isolation is an issue\n:\n terrain, road pattern\n/ density\n, the various ways different towns can act as a draw for people to visit and work, etc.\n Barriers to travel can occur in urban as well as rural areas.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.2. \nA one size-fits all approach \nin relation to service type is unlikely to be beneficially applied to all rural \nor urban \nareas. \nDifferent \nservice\n types, and \ndifferent\n mixes at times of DRT and \ntimetable\nd\n \nservices\n, will suit different areas.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.3. \nRural \npassenger \nflows are \nfrequently \ndiverse and often cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.\n \nWhere there are different needs - in different directions, at different times, or at interchanges onto or from a train service – \nit is has \nto \nbe a pre-requisite of public tr\nansport planning that priority \ntends to focus on\n “the greatest benefit for the greatest number” \nor o\nn\n needs that can be met cost-\neffectiv\ne\nly\n. \nInevitably\n therefore \nother needs \nmay\n not be met\n - \nand r\nural transport cannot \nalways \nbe all things to all people\n \nin an \narea\n;\n many people \nmay\n feel that it serves their needs badly if at all, even if the predominant needs are catered for.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n4\n. \nR\nural employment is \noften \ncharacterised by \nmany \ns\nmall &amp; \nm\nedium \ne\nnterprises (\nSMEs) in \nwidely scattered \nlocations. \nSignificant and established flows \nto work \nare therefore often difficult to \nprovide for\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;\n5\n.1. \nCommunity transport \n(CT) \noften primarily\n focus\nses\n on the needs of the frail elderly and disabled\n, and less well on the needs of \npeople who need transport to get to work, or the travel needs of young people\n. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.2. \nThe sector is very diverse, from some larg\ner community transport groups that act virtually as commercial operators in tendering for large contracts, through to many small groups, often with just one or two vehicles, for whom the Community Interest Company model \nmay be\n seen to be\n both less beneficial and less relevant. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.3. \nThe difficulties \nin serving \nisolated areas are the same for community transport as for commercial operators and councils: serv\nices \nwill always \ntend to \nrequire significant subsidy to meet the shortfall between\n operating costs and fares revenue from relatively small numbers of passengers travelling. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.4. \nCommunity\n \ntransport\n best serves i\nt\ns own community: m\nany rural council funded bus routes \nare \nunsuitable\n for CT operation as they serve \na number of \ncommunities\n across rel\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\nly \nlong di\ns\nta\nn\nces\n. \nOther b\narriers to CT operation of these services\n \nmay include\n:\n&#xa0;\n5\n.5. \nThe view\n,\n that community tra\nn\nsport will simply back-fill \nbus \nservi\nc\nes cut by councils\n,\n \nis unlikely to become a reality. \nMost services for isolated rural areas that are council funded are likely to continue to require revenue support; that is why they are supported and not commercial in the first place. \nT\nhe \ninjection\n of kickstart \nfunding\n is unlikely to provide lasting long-t\nerm \nimproved \nviability\n and is \nfelt to be \ngenerally \nof limited value, \nin \ncertain circumstances only, such as \nfor \nservices that are relatively close to financial sustainab\ni\nl\nity\n and just need a push to achieve viability.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.6. \nT\nhere are clearly exceptions \nwhere \ngeography etc. may help\n enable a more viable operation\n, but on the whole there is little scope for making services \nserving \nisolated\n \ncommunities\n, or even many rural\n \nareas \ngenerally\n, \nsustainable. \nWe need therefore to \nunderstand\n that it is \nunrealistic\n t\no suppose that:\n&#xa0;\n(i) if only \ncouncil\n \nsupported\n \nservices\n were managed or operated in a different way they \nwould\n not need support;\n&#xa0;\n(ii) council funded bus services will be routinely operated by the \ncommunity\n \ntransport\n \nsector\n if the council \nfunding\n ends. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6. To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?&#xa0;\n6\n.1. \nTaxis are \nseen as \nuniversally available, but the cost is clearly prohibitive for regular use for many people\n, and\n w\nheelchair accessible taxis are not universally available in rural areas. \nT\nhe \nJoseph Rowntree Foundation (2010) identified that Transport Poverty is a greater factor in rural areas than Fuel Poverty\n, but we still hear more about the latter\n. \n&#xa0;\n6\n.2. \nD\nRT s\ner\nvices are often unsuitable for regular commuting to work. Often schemes only allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs.\n \nDRT can be seen to \nprovide\n better\n for off-peak accessibility needs \nto shopping/ town centre facilities and services.\n&#xa0;\n6\n.3. \nDRT often has higher costs per passenger than conventional bus services. A number of DRT services promoted as a cost-effective way to provide access in rural areas have in recent years been \nterminated\n due to high costs.\n \nIt cannot therefore be \nassumed\n that there is a continuum of reducing service levels in line with \nreducing\n cost \n(\nper \npassenger\n),\n \nfrom \nhigh frequency buses to low frequency buses to DRT: when replacing low frequency buses with DRT costs\n p\ner passenger\n are \nfrequently\n found to rise. \n&#xa0;\n6\n.4. \nThe cost of o\nff\n-\npeak rural services i\ns often lower by using\n resources more fully, i.e. using buses\n -\n on the margin\n - \nthat are fully used in the peak for commuting etc., \nas opposed to \nless efficient use of resources such as \nth\ne\nse buses being parked \nup \nin the off-peak and using other smaller vehicles for off-peak DRT services.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7. What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?&#xa0;\n7\n.1. \nMany public transport services serving isolated communities can never become sustainable, given the low revenue compared to costs\n;\n the aspiration to make these services affordable \nin terms of financial viability \nmay be largely unobtainable. The degree to which the level of financial support needed can be seen to be acceptable is determined by a number of factors. \n&#xa0;\n7\n.2. \nENCTS\nThe continued high cost of the ENCTS public transport spe\nnd acts as a barrier to continuing spend on supporting rural public transport services\n. \nGiven the pressure on budgets\n,\n many councils \nmay \nunderstandably feel they are already spending too much on public transport\n. \n&#xa0;\n7\n.3. \nCross-sector \nBenefits\n and Challenges\nFor most councils their funding of bus services is probably the greatest single positive impact (compared to any other initiative) on each of\n the following key policy aims\n:\n&#xa0;\n7\n.4. \nWhilst t\nhis is felt to be often generally unrecognised across councils and central government\n, If the\nse\n cross sector benefits could be levered into funding services, these services are likely in many cases to become affordable.  \n&#xa0;\n7.5. \nThe cross-sector benefits of bus services are significant. This has been \nrecently evidenced\n in many national reports from a\n wide range of bodies (Appendix 1) and yet continues to be largely unrecognised\n in government policies\n.  \n&#xa0;\n7\n.\n6\n. \nA significant element of th\nis \nvalue of bus services lies in other organisations\n, \ne.g.:\n&#xa0;\n7.\n7\n. \nHowever with services under pressure and the need for short term cost reductions, there \nappears to be\n little incentive to consider longer term benefits from working \nacross organisations. It also requires \nthese other \nagencies to decide to spend money other than within their areas of professional expertise\n,\n by diverting funding to transport. \nIn\n \nth\ne\n absence of central polic\ni\nes\n on these lines\n, c\nouncils have a pivotal, but culturally \nvery \ndifficult, role to play in facilitating this if the best long-term decisions are to be made.\n&#xa0;\n7\n.\n8\n. \nIt is \nfelt to be \nnot c\nonstructive \nfor government to leave these decisions to local government when \ncouncil\n financ\nes are being \nreduced\n to such an extent that non-statutory services, no matter how worthy or recognised those services may be within a council, \nprovide the main scope for \ncut\ns\n to meet the budget reductions\n s\net by central government\n under the Spending Review\n. \n&#xa0;\n7\n.\n9\n. \nCompeting with other Services for Shrinking Budgets\nThe high\n \ncost\n per\n passenger \nof \nservices\n \nin \nisolated\n or rural \ncommunities\n \ncompared\n to \nlower cost/ passenger urban and inter-urban services\n is bound to disadvantage \nthese\n \nservices\n when competing for \nfunding\n in \nreducing\n budgets. \nCost\n per\n passenger is a prime assessment tool, as \na \nmeans of minimising the number of people affected by service reductions. \nThe fact that rural services in the main are unlikely to ever become financially s\nustainable can lead to these services\n being seen\n as both inefficient and as a funding “bottomless pit”.\n&#xa0;\n7\n.1\n0\n. \nRural public transport is \nfurther at risk\n, given\n shrinking budgets\n,\n through what is often seen as a lack of understanding of passenger needs\n \nor \nassum\nptions that \n“they will \nfind other ways to get to work”\n:\n \nd\necision-makers tend to be car drivers\n. More \nresearch\n is needed on the reliance of those who need the bus to get to work\n,\n and \nwhether they could get to work \nif the bus service stopped.\n&#xa0;\n7\n.1\n1\n. \nAffordability \nhas to \nreflect \nB\nenefit as well as \nC\nost\nOnly by central\nly\n reassessing how \npublic \ntransport should be funded, and aligning the funding stream \nwith\n \npolicy \nareas and agencies where transport provides benefits, will the real financial and societal\n net overall benefits\n,\n that transport networks provide\n,\n be safeguard into the future. \nUnless \ngovernment departments are sufficiently joined-up\n,\n on funding transport through the benefits it provides those department\ns\n, it is unlikely that the locally based p\nublic sector, who take their cue and targets from central government, will generally work together with councils on this. \n&#xa0;\n7\n.1\n2\n. \nATCO believes that t\nhe\nre is a\n \ncurrent \nsta\nt\ne of \nnational \nparalysis \non this that \nneeds to be \nurgently \naddressed\n. \nThe \nimbalances \nneed to be resolved\n between (a) the risk to council public transport funded services, and (b) the growing evidence of the undoubted benefits of public transport to the economy and national policy aims\n. Without government action on this \nas a matter of urgen\ncy\n –\n \nwith t\nhe Spending Review taking funding out of the system year by year for a further three years\n -\n the count\nr\ny’s rural \nand isolated \nareas face the likely prospect of large scale withdrawal of any or all public transport except those that do not requir\nes financial support.  \n&#xa0;\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n------\n---\n&#xa0;\nAppendix 1: Recent Reports  Identifying the Value of Bus Services&#xa0;\nGreener Journeys/ Leeds University: Buses and Economic Growth: (July 2012)\nhttp://www.greenerjourneys.com/2012/07/buses-economic-growth-making-the-link-new-report/\n(Quantifying the contribution of buses to economic growth)\n&#xa0;\nNational Travel Survey 2010\nhttp://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/national-travel-survey-2010/\n(The reliance on buses across society;
