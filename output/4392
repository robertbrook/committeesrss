[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from [bold]Cambridgeshire[bold] County Council[bold] (LTD0011)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1[bold] 
[normal]The basis for devolving funds and powers to local areas is to pass greater control 
[normal]over setting the vision 
[normal]and delivering growth 
[normal]and ensuring
[normal] that businesses are involved in driving the economic prosperity o
[normal]f their areas. 
[normal]This 
[normal]i
[normal]s based on 
[normal]Lord 
[normal]Heseltine's recommendations in his report ' 
[normal]No Stone unturned'
[normal] which called for the creation of a single cash pot, which could be worth up to £49bn, bringing together dispara
[normal]te funding streams from across G
[normal]overnment wit
[normal]hout ring fences. However the reality is that funding levels are expected to be closer to £2bn per annum. Most of this is 
[normal]understood to be 
[normal]recycled funding for 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]A
[normal]uthorities from transport, housing and skills budgets, including some 55% funding from Df
[normal]t. However this funding is to be 
[normal]unringfenced
[normal] for LEP’s to bid 
[normal]for 
[normal]on a competitive basis for a Growth Deal to help secure a share towards driving economic growth in their areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2[bold] 
[normal]The rational is fully appreciated in that there needs to be greater 
[normal]involvement of businesses in setting the vision and helping achi
[normal]eve economic prosperity for local
[normal] areas. However there needs to be a balanced approach 
[normal]including democratically elected Members as key decision makers 
[normal]to 
[normal]tackling
[normal] the 
[normal]key challenges and ensuri
[normal]ng that the 
[normal]right conditions for growth 
[normal]ar
[normal]e achieved and sustained into the future. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3[bold] 
[normal]The main advantage
[normal]s
[normal] of devolving funding 
[normal]are
[normal] that 
[normal]it is 
[normal]unringfenced
[normal] and provides 
[normal]greater certainty over levels of funding anticipated over a longer period from 2015 -202
[normal]1 (if the allocations announced in the summer of 2014 cover that period rather than simply 2015/16 levels only). 
[normal]Thi
[normal]s offers greater potential than cyclical funding bid rounds which are generally 
[normal]for specific Departmental deliverables over a very short per
[normal]iod and require a detailed business case 
[normal]up front – such as Pinch points/
[normal] Growing Places. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4[bold] 
[normal]This should help areas with developing a more holistic 
[normal]programme
[normal] and pipeline of projects focused on delivering economic benefits. The advantage being that there is 
[normal]bett
[normal]er potential to deal with the myriad of complex issues and challenges that need to be a
[normal]ddressed to create and maintain the right conditions for growth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5[bold] 
[normal]On disadvantages, much of the funding has 
[normal]been top sliced from 
[normal]Authorities 
[normal]budgets
[normal], and not all is 
[normal]unringfenced
[normal]. 
[normal]Also LEP’s will be
[normal] 
[normal]the key decision makers regarding the priorities for fund
[normal]ing for their areas
[normal], and 
[normal]Authorities will 
[normal]now 
[normal]need to be able to convince LEP’s regarding priorities. 
[normal]Therefore i
[normal]n many ways the decision maki
[normal]ng powers appear to be 
[normal]removed f
[normal]r
[normal]o
[normal]m the democratically elected local 
[normal]M
[normal]embers. There is a greater 
[normal]focus on ‘busines
[normal]s’ leading on 
[normal]the priorities for their areas.
[normal] While
[normal] 
[normal]b
[normal]usiness involvement is critical in helping to inspire and innovate and 
[normal]inform
[normal] the ambitions for local areas
[normal], this should be
[normal] as part 
[normal]of an overall balanced approach led by 
[normal]democratically elected Members 
[normal]with ultimate responsibility for achieving the agreed outcomes for their communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6[bold] 
[normal]There is also a risk 
[normal]that money will be spent on 
[normal]bidding processes and 
[normal]sp
[normal]ecific support 
[normal]iniatives
[normal] for a short period without 
[normal]necessarily addressing the 
[normal]underlying challe
[normal]nges and improving the conditions for businesses to grow and thrive
[normal] into the future
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7[bold] 
[normal]The 
[normal]model could be improved 
[normal]if Governmen
[normal]t made the funding available to ‘
[normal]LEP area
[normal]’s’
[normal], 
[normal]rather than a specific body 
[normal]with local areas 
[normal]deciding 
[normal]which 
[normal]organsiation
[normal] was best 
[normal]placed to 
[normal]lead and 
[normal]manage the funds
[normal] as ‘Accountable Authority
[normal]’
[normal], much as the LTB arrangement works
[normal]. There are options 
[normal]for different arrangements 
[normal]which 
[normal]could include County/ Upper Tier Boards, 
[normal]LEP, 
[normal]Economic Prosperity Boards, Joint Strategic Committees or 
[normal]alternatives. The key issue is th
[normal]at local areas should ideally decide and deals should be based on 
[normal]outcomes 
[normal]to be delivered 
[normal]and funding devolved on that basis. 
[normal]Government would still set clear criteria and conditions for allocation of funds in LEP areas su
[normal]ch as requiring a strong evidence base, or operating across the LEP area or having private sector involvement
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8[bold] 
[normal]It will be important to enhance t
[normal]he role of 
[normal]local Leaders/
[normal] democratically elected members 
[normal]who 
[normal]are 
[normal]the 
[normal]key decision makers mandated to deliver 
[normal]for
[normal] their communities.
[normal] 
[normal]Most of the duty lies with the local authorities given their statutory functions around 
[normal]transport and 
[normal]planning for growth and prosperity, and 
[normal]they 
[normal]are re
[normal]sponsible for delivering on these 
[normal]ambitions
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9[bold] 
[normal]D
[normal]evolving funding over at least a 10 year period 
[normal]through an agreed model 
[normal]to deliver agreed outcomes that best fit
[normal] local 
[normal]circumstances
[normal] 
[normal]would enable loca
[normal]l areas to take 
[normal]greater control and 
[normal]iniative
[normal]. 
[normal]This would 
[normal]en
[normal]sure
[normal] a more holistic 
[normal]approach
[normal] 
[normal]to address some o
[normal]f the complexities necessary to achieve step change 
[normal]or structural
[normal] change needed in some areas
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to drive forward economic growth and achieve longer term aims rather than a focus on immediate deliverables or targets. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The City Deal model is a good example 
[normal]where in 
[normal]Cambridge
[normal]shire
[normal] we are 
[normal]   
[normal]seeking to agree a Gain S
[normal]hare mechanism to help deliver c
[normal]£
[normal]500m of transport infrastructure investment to support growth and development. Through this mechanism local 
[normal]partner
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]will
[normal] work together through a combined authority
[normal] and invest up front in infrastructure to encourage 
[normal]business growth
[normal]. The are
[normal]a
[normal] is to 
[normal]retain a share of the uplift in taxes over base to cover costs of additional investment. This type of model will enable the Leaders working with the LEP and key partners to
[normal] invest up front in infrastructure and greatly improve conditions for businesses. Such ambitious plans a
[normal]nd clarity of investment focus is
[normal] vital for businesses to see when they
[normal] are deciding where in the worl
[normal]d to l
[normal]ocate or grow. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1[bold] 
[normal]There is a real lack of resources to assess, 
[normal]prioritise
[normal] and deliver local transport sche
[normal]mes across all levels currently.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold] 
[normal]LEP’s have been set up with minimal resources and are intended to be lean bodies with a focus on achieving through thei
[normal]r partners. However this means that the Authorities 
[normal]deliver many of the aims and 
[normal]provide revenue support for basic operation of the LEP. The 
[normal]lack of capacity and resources 
[normal]means in some case LEP’s are spread t
[normal]hin and don’t have the resource
[normal] or expertise to support on transport schemes. Indeed this is the role for the Local Transport Authorities to assess, 
[normal]prioritise
[normal] and deliver local transport schemes. However the difficulty is that Authorities budgets have been reduced significantly from 20
[normal]08 levels, where both integrated transport and maintenance budgets were reduced by almost 45%. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold] 
[normal]Reduced budgets, particularly on the revenue side coupled with a lack of available resource funding from Government, (apart from specific 
[normal]programmes
[normal] like LSTF 
[normal]aimed at behavioral changes which has been useful) there have not been resources to undertake early options appraisal 
[normal]or 
[normal]scheme development work. Therefore in most cases, Local Authorities 
[normal]don’t have a pipeline of projects and focus only on key projects th
[normal]ey can commit to in terms of resources 
[normal]to progress critical schemes to support growth. M
[normal]ost m
[normal]ajor projects and schemes require significant 
[normal]up front
[normal] investment and ofte
[normal]n over a lengthy period of time
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Examples for this area include Cambridge Science Park St
[normal]ation, which has been in the LTP for 
[normal]years
[normal], and while there was understood to be a good business case, there was never sufficient major schemes funding to progress 
[normal]the case 
[normal]to delivery. Through strong local leadership and a willingness to take the risk, 
[normal]Ca
[normal]mbridgeshire
[normal] County Council 
[normal]is progressing the case to 
[normal]approval for 
[normal]de
[normal]livery. However developing the c
[normal]ase and designing to a detailed stage has taken some 3 years and cost 
[normal]millions
[normal] to take it to planning 
[normal]approval 
[normal]stage for Network Rail to take forward to d
[normal]elivery stage. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4[bold] 
[normal]Most of the current 
[normal]Government funding tends only to be available when schemes are at an advanced stage and for the most part have all their approvals in place. This means that schemes are unlikely to come forward unless the Local Authorit
[normal]ies’ have committed to progressing them. There is little funding available to test options or look for more innovative solutions, 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]Local Authorities 
[normal]have to invest significant 
[normal]in terms of 
[normal]option appraisal /
[normal]scheme development with little resources,
[normal] partic
[normal]ularly at the early stages. The LGF offers potential in terms of 
[normal]now building up a 
[normal]programme
[normal] 
[normal]and pipeline 
[normal]for delivery 
[normal]over time to hopefully address priorities
[normal].
[normal] That is provided there is agreement locally with LEP’s on priorities and funding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1[bold] 
[normal]While a focus on the functional economic area is important, 
[normal]it
[normal] would be helpful to have a more comprehensive vision and appro
[normal]ach across a wider area
[normal]. This would 
[normal]help ensure join up on approach and priorities around improving access to markets, and fostering relationships between related industries and spreading the benefits of growth
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] 
[normal]Ideally there needs to be a wider overview 
[normal]to ensure clarity and consistency across LEP’s and LTB areas regarding the challenges and priorities. There is a risk that at the moment, particularly for the key corridors that there could be a lack of join up and investment to support addressing key aims
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold] 
[normal]Some good work was done in the past on Regional Transport Plan, and this type of overview would be particularly helpful if linked to an investment plan and join up on priorities for investment 
[normal]including 
[normal]key 
[normal]partners 
[normal]like 
[normal]Dft
[normal], Highways Agency and Network
[normal] Rail. This could also then ensure join up on cross boundary priorities for LTB’s and LEP’s. This would be particularly helpful for transport issues which are not related to specific geographies and with a greater focus on corridors and improving links and
[normal] accessibility to and between key destinations to support more efficient movement of people and goods’ 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1[bold] 
[normal]There is a good working relationship at the local level between the Authorities across 
[normal]Cambridgeshire
[normal] and 
[normal]Peterborough
[normal] where the authorities are working closely under the Duty to cooperate particularly on planning and transport matters.
[normal]  As part of this wo
[normal]rk the authorities have agr
[normal]eed their objectively assessed
[normal] housing needs across the whole area and Members have worked together to develop a 
[normal]Draft 
[normal]Long Term Transport Strategy to identify the key measures and interventions needed to support growth and conti
[normal]nued economic prosperity looking forward. 
[normal]4.2[bold] 
[normal]The Greater Cambridge Greater Peterborough 
[normal]Shadow 
[normal]Local Transport Body has proven to be an effective and efficient body where the LEP and the Upper tier authorities have worked successfully to develop a robust and
[normal] deliverable major schemes programme within a challenging timescale. The Body was set up to secure devolved major schemes funding in response to 
[normal]Dft’s
[normal] request and systems were put in place to comply with requirements. Despite being awarded 33% less funding
[normal] than anticipated, the LTB agreed 6 priority schemes within a challenging timescale.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3[bold] 
[normal]Further to this, t
[normal]he LEP has 
[normal]now 
[normal]tasked the LTB with developing a 
[normal]programme
[normal] of transport schemes to recommend to the LEP for inclusion in 
[normal]their Strategic Economic Plan 
[normal]to drive economic growth. This process is working well despite the challenging timescales. However there is some concern that while the LTB is developing a robust and deliverable 
[normal]programme
[normal] aimed at supporting and facilitating growth, it is up to the LEP to
[normal] decide on priorities and funding, and the duty will still fall to the Authorities to deliver on most of the 
[normal]ambitions
[normal] although they may not have the resources to do so.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4[bold] 
[normal]Looking forward
[normal], it is proposed to review 
[normal]the terms of reference 
[normal]and remit 
[normal]for the LTB to align with the LEP and 
[normal]wider role and geography.
[normal]4.5[bold] 
[normal]O
[normal]ur LEP has been greatly supportive of transport as a key priority for this area and recognizes the key role this plays in everyday lives and as a key enabler of growth. Indeed our LEP is alre
[normal]ady providing some £50m towards supporting the delivery of the A14 improvement scheme and has agreed the 
[normal]Df
[normal]T
[normal] funding previously committed to major schemes which is welcome. However there is a risk that the LEP will decide that 
[normal]they
[normal] need to 
[normal]prioritise
[normal] other
[normal] area
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]now
[normal], without necessarily understanding that authorities won’t have resources without the LGF to progress key schemes that support and unlock growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6[bold] 
[normal]There is a good local working relationship between the LEP, LTB and HA, and Dft. However there is a
[normal] lack of clarity regarding future expectations in relation to LGF, in terms of the 
[normal]future 
[normal]role and remit of the LTB, working cross boundaries and assessment criteria for LGF. More join up in terms of clarity on expectations for key Departments would be hel
[normal]pful 
[normal]to ensure consistency and c
[normal]ertaint
[normal]y regarding the
[normal] arrangements.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1[bold] 
[normal]The funding environment is challenging particularly 
[normal]given 
[normal]that l
[normal]evels of Integrated Block and Maintenance Block funding have been reduced by some 45% already from 2008 levels. There is uncertainty over what the 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]top slice of funding for the 
[normal]Integra
[normal]ted B
[normal]lock into the Single Local Growth
[normal] Fund pot will mean for future t
[normal]ransport funding from 2015 onwards. In addition, 
[normal]Dft
[normal] has made it clear that there is unlikely to be any additional funding for 
[normal]local 
[normal]transport beyond the formula grant and LGF funding. 
[normal]5.2[bold] 
[normal]LEP 
[normal]representatives have
[normal] 
[normal]worked closely with the LTB to agree
[normal] 
[normal]the current priority 
[normal]major schemes 
[normal]and 
[normal]funding 
[normal]allocations and this commitment has been agreed. However the reality is that 
[normal]current funding levels for major schemes are not sufficient to help de
[normal]liver on the priority schemes and although we are hopeful, there is a lack of clarity that 
[normal]the levels of funding necessary 
[normal]will be secured through the Growth Deal
[normal].
[normal]5.3[bold] 
[normal]LTB’s were set up to secure devolved major schemes funding
[normal] from 
[normal]DfT
[normal].
[normal] A
[normal]lthough 
[normal]Dft
[normal] confirmed there 
[normal]is a significant increase in major schemes funding, 
[normal]some 
[normal]33% less 
[normal]major schemes 
[normal]funding 
[normal]was committed 
[normal]to the 
[normal]current priority schemes than the indicative amounts set out 
[normal]earlier.
[normal]  This was 
[normal]most
[normal] disappointing and for our area, as the Aut
[normal]horities are keen to make progress on the priority schemes
[normal] to support continued growth
[normal], the authorities agreed to deliver 6 
[normal]priority 
[normal]schemes. 
[normal]However in order to 
[normal]deliver theses, some 80% of the funding is being sourced
[normal] f
[normal]r
[normal]o
[normal]m the local authorities, 
[normal]mostly
[normal] th
[normal]rough prudential borrowing. In addition there was little or no money available for scheme development or business case development so local partners have had to take on thos
[normal]e costs. In ou
[normal]r case, the LEP has been most supportive and stepped in to cover the 
[normal]costs of independent scrutiny of schemes
[normal] which was an additional 
[normal]Dft
[normal] requirement.
[normal] 
[normal]5.4[bold] 
[normal]While a major uplift in major schemes funding 
[normal]is most welcome 
[normal]from 
[normal]Dft
[normal], it isn’t clear that this funding will be available to support the delivery of major schemes as all of
[normal] this funding is now going into the LGF. The difficulty is that the LGF is 
[normal]unringfenced
[normal] and can be spent on LEP priorities towards delivering economic benefits which can vary enormously in terms of outputs. There is also no guarantee that the LEP will see 
[normal]transport as their top priority and therefore no certainty that the funding will support priority transport projects. 
[normal]5.5[bold] 
[normal]In addition, LEP’s will be making decision
[normal]s
[normal] on priorities for the funding without necessarily understanding the local government funding 
[normal]context. There may be an assumption that 
[normal]Authorities
[normal] will carry on with 
[normal]‘
[normal]business as usual
[normal]’ and fund
[normal] schemes. However the reality 
[normal]is
[normal] that basic
[normal] budgets have been reduced and unless 
[normal]Authoritie
[normal]s
[normal] can access this LGF funding to help deliver priorities, the pro
[normal]grammes 
[normal]could well
[normal] need to be reduced
[normal] to match the reality of reduced funding
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1[bold] 
[normal]Devolving funding to local areas from 
[normal]2015 to 2021 is welcome
[normal]. H
[normal]owever 
[normal]as the
[normal] funding is going 
[normal]though
[normal] the LEP, 
[normal]t
[normal]h
[normal]is
[normal] means that Authorities and other partners need to go 
[normal]though
[normal] another 
[normal]beurocratic
[normal] process to secure funding towards priorities
[normal], and there may not be agreement on priorities
[normal]. This e
[normal]ssentially means that more time will be spent on this new process and making the case 
[normal]with less 
[normal]resources 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]for delivering the outcomes and outputs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2[bold] 
[normal]The 
[normal]devolution of funds
[normal] is welcome and over a longer period
[normal], but ideally 
[normal]it should be for local
[normal] LEP area
[normal]s
[normal] to decide the best 
[normal]organsiation
[normal]/ model for delivery
[normal]. We see the benefit in developing a 
[normal]programme
[normal] to address the range of challenges to help ensure the right conditions for growth and 
[normal]delivering
[normal] economic benefits. However, 
[normal]there are concerns that 
[normal]there is no guarantee that the LEP or indeed Government will agree the priorities for 
[normal]funding for 
[normal]this area. 
[normal]There needs to be greater recognition of the role of 
[normal]democratically elected Members 
[normal]in agreeing priorities. Members 
[normal]have a 
[normal]duty to serve their local areas 
[normal]and deliver key outcomes on behalf of their communities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1[bold] 
[normal]Having an agreed long term vision for growth and economic prosperity is an important starting point. This should be linked to an investment plan with clarity on priorities and 
[normal]key outcomes anticipated over time 
[normal]to 
[normal]provide greater certainty to investors regarding ambitions and expectations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2[bold] 
[normal]Good collaboration and 
[normal]a joined up approach on resources to support priorities
[normal] is also helpful in terms of supporting unlocking growth potential
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] key area which is pertinent is 
[normal]Community Infrastructure Levy where resources could be pooled towards delivering infrastructure
[normal] priorities. 
[normal]The funding generated by CIL doesn’t adequately cover the costs of infrastructure needed to support growth. However 
[normal]b
[normal]y pooling 
[normal]some 
[normal]CIL
[normal] receipts 
[normal]across a wider area, 
[normal]there is greater potential to support 
[normal]the delivery of strategic infrastructure priorities early
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3[bold] 
[normal]Providing local areas with greater freedoms and flexibilities, particularly in terms 
[normal]of
[normal] funding will enable areas to ta
[normal]ke 
[normal]more of the initiative to support the growth and prosperity of their local areas. One example that 
[normal]is providing 
[normal]successful in 
[normal]Cambridgeshire
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]s the creation of a Rolling Infrastructure Fund
[normal] whereby an 
[normal]initial £8 million o
[normal]f Government funding was used to establish a rolling 
[normal]fund.
[normal] This
[normal] funding was originally used to fund the Guided 
[normal]Busway
[normal] (£5.75 million) and to act as pump-priming funding for 
[normal]Addenbrookes
[normal] Access Road (£2.25 million) during the 2007-08 financial year. During 2008-09 the money was recovered from the Guided 
[normal]Busway
[normal] scheme a
[normal]nd then 
[normal]reused
[normal] to provide front-funding for the 
[normal]Addenbrookes
[normal] Access Road, therefore resulting in all £8 million being used to support spending on this project. 
[normal]The provision of this access road
[normal] help
[normal]ed
[normal] unlock up to 4,000 new homes on the Cambridge southern 
[normal]fringe 
[normal]development which otherwise would have been delayed due to 
[normal]cashflow
[normal]/ recessionary impacts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4[bold] 
[normal]In addition to this, an equity investment of £8 million 
[normal]was made to help bring forward the 
[normal]development as part of the Rolling Fund. 
[normal]T
[normal]hese investments will 
[normal]no
[normal]w 
[normal]repay with interest, or an equity return, and the funds will then be available for investments to support housing growth across Cambridgeshire in the future. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.1[bold] 
[normal]Currently the lines of accountability are clear for local decision making on transport expenditure. Most funding for transport is allocated to the Local Transport Authorities through either the Integrated Transport Block or Maintenance Block by formula, 
[normal]with some 
[normal]periodic 
[normal]competitive bids for areas like 
[normal]Pinchpioints
[normal], Growing Places, LSTF and BBAF.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2[bold] 
[normal]In 
[normal]Cambridgeshire
[normal] funding is then allocated towards the range of requirements identified in the Area Transport Strategies. These have been developed working wi
[normal]th County and Local District Members and clarify the policy objectives and identify the key measures and interventions needed to address issues and support growth. This process works successfully and well, and S106 funding is also collected towards mitigat
[normal]ing the impacts of growth and supports the aims
[normal] of the strategies
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3[bold] 
[normal]Looking forward, from 2015, while the formula grant element will remain with the Local Transport Authorities
[normal], the amount of funding is being top sliced and
[normal] there is less certainty regard
[normal]ing arrangements for local decision making on transport expenditure
[normal] for this and the major schemes funding
[normal]. 
[normal] While LTB’s have been set up to receive the devolved funding, this will now be administered by the LEP’s through the single pot. However the assess
[normal]ment criteria and decision making processes are unclear. The other issue is that democratically elected Members are not necessarily the decision makers as the LEP’s are primarily business led
[normal], and the funding will support the LEP’s priorities
[normal]. This is a co
[normal]ncern 
[normal]as 
[normal]there may not be agreement on funding for priorities which could impact 
[normal]on the potential for areas to address the key challenges in terms of transport and create the right conditions for growth.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.4[bold] 
[normal]More consideration needs to be given the 
[normal]important role of the LTB in terms of decision making on transport funding. The LTB’s have been set up with clear lines of accountability, and assurance framework
