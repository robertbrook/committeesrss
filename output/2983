defaultWritten evidence from Mr D. Holladay (SLC 034)
default&#xa0;
defaultI am an engineer with over 35 years of working on transport issues, including periods with Britiish Rail and Sustrans.  As a cyclist I have also taken a great interest detail of surface conditions and their effect on the control of cycles. This includes the points where cyclists cross railway and tramway tracks.  These are recognised as having the potential to present a serious hazard, mainly from falling off, when the surface conditions are poor.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith Sustrans I also had the aim of planning routes which fulfilled the function of connecting places but were also direct, safe and attractive., and used a variety of road base and surfacing materials. Working with CTC I have been involved in a number of inquiries and negotiations concerning level crossing closures, and the diversion routes being proposed. It is often noted in CTC responses that the alternative route places pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders at a greater risk than crossing the railway line. I have also reviewed incidents and potential for cyclists’ falling off on crossing and tramway surfaces.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere remains a great concern that the removal of a crossing from the railway delivers a less safe route for pedestrian, horse and cycle traffic, though use of a busy major road.  Some schemes such as the removal of the public road crossing at Wareham (Dorset) delivered a new bridge which offered a road with no footways and a major diversion out from the housing and shops  on either side of the railway to gain access to that road, which as a result had Dorset CC having to sign a long term licence for a pedestrian &amp; cycle crossing (with the British Railways Board) until a second bridge or underpass could be provided.  The demand for a direct route between the 2 parts of the community near to the station is now conflicting with the increased level of rail services, and because of the crossing arrangements – relying on a chicane with miniature coloured lights to deter pedestrians and cyclists from crossing the line.  As a result the crossing has been a hot spot for what is considered to be abuse, of crossing users ignoring the red light and crossing the tracks, often with a train clearly approaching and leaving no margin for any stumbling or hesitation
default&#xa0;
defaultThe example of Pooley Green especially highlighted the need for a greater co-ordination between the various planning processes, when a bus was hit by a train. The circumstances through which this arose, would have been avoided if the minor road route crossing the railway at this location had been provided with access to the new bridge span built almost adjacent to this level crossing to carry the M25 over the same rail line. the bus became trapped on the crossing due to the driver misjudging the traffic queue behaviour, with that queuing traffic being generated by the opening of the M25 and changing the operating conditions of that crossing. As with Wareham the need to plan such detail comprehensively, and often incur costs above those which meet the basic requirements is not addressed because the additional features are outside those set by the project and its budget.        
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have also been instances where cycle users have been threatened with prosecution by Network Rail and TOC staff, or obstructed from using safely, existing crossings with cycles, as they were permitted to do, when the railway staff have been ignorant of the status of the crossing (Wareham as an example), or the rail operators have acted apparently without awareness of the extent of traffic and related access issues to make the use of a crossing, or the route imposed as an alternative potentially less safe (Wivenhoe, Walnut Grove).
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is further an apparent preference by Network Rail to provide overbridges which present a visually intrusive structure, with a requirement for extensive land-take, and often extending the route previously available by 200-300% through the 120 metres of ramp required on each side of bridge, and this we note can increase the likelihood of illicit restoration of the original crossing because of the obvious and severe degradation of the level of service offered by the route using the original crossing.  By contrast the provision of an underpass requires around 60 metres of ramp, and this may well be reduced by the fact that the rail lines are often slightly above the surrounding ground. Widths are often restricted and bridges and approach ramps are below that appropriate for shared use between the groups with access to the route – cyclists, walkers and horse riders. Additionally the  increasing extent of lines electrified at 25KV means that the bridges are provided with solid and totally opaque parapets extending to almost head height, creating a closed in space which cannot be overlooked for passive surveillance, and in many ways this creates all the problems which apply to a narrow underpass which are equally difficult to get a clear sighting through.  
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of this may be due to cost of providing a wider bridge or underpass, but for a given span the costs of marginal variations in width are generally small compared to the cost of placing the supports or abutments and putting the span in place.  Often the local group is faced with challenging specialists brought in to design a specified solution and there is a need to have transparency in making the case for a contentious proposal, or technical support to consider any alternatives put forward by local users.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe AXIAT modelling for assessing road crossings focusses solely on those travelling in private cars, and misses out the time and significant safety issues for traffic on foot when the alternative route may place the pedestrian traffic on roads with motor traffic at high speed and limited footway provision.  This gap in provision of a modelling and assessment tool is clearly felt when it comes to key foot crossings such as that at Wivenhoe highlights a gap in the modelling process.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a need for a better recording and reporting of surface defects, as these clearly present a greater hazard to the 2-wheeled road user than a 4 wheeled one, and equally to those on foot when surfaces are of less formal construction.  It would appear that when a crossing surface has been improved to deliver better alignment between rails and road surface elements the number of incidents can reduce. A notable example would appear to be Walton Street (Springfield) LC in Hull, where at one stage CTC solicitors (Russell Jones &amp; Walker) had 18 valid claims to be considered for this location.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have tracked a number of crossings that have been reported to CTC’s  Fillthathole website  and observed their condition over several years. As an example Staveley LC is a crossing which is regularly being repaired but not as far as we are aware, given any priority for renewal. From  a recent picture it is apparent that the threshold kerb units on one side have been replaced with an poured concrete beam, and the variation in heights of the panels on the footway strip is substantial and a trip hazard. Panels rock visibly and this in turn conceals wear and cracking in the underside where the panel moves on the supporting sleepers.
default&#xa0;
defaultRegrettably several level crossings are reported on more than one occasion as repairs made may only be temporary, or lack the substance of a full rebuilding of a damaged supporting structure. It would be a welcome facility to have regular general engagement with Network Rail to build a rolling strategy to manage a defined budget and programme to deliver a consistent standard for surfaces and interfaces with the road and path networks beyond the railway boundery, especially for footway crossings..
default&#xa0;
defaultCyclists appear, from the reports coming in to CTC, to be falling more often that reported though official channels. The ORR guidance on reporting rightly places a great importance on reporting when motor vehicles become trapped on a level crossing but appears to consider a cyclist of pedestrian fall less important, although the risk of loss of a road-users life remains.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also concern that a fallen cyclist or pedestrian may be missed by some currently developed obstruction detection systems, as the low level scanning is reported to be triggering frequently through non-hazardous events, and consideration is being given to de-sensitising or switching off this equipment.
default&#xa0;
defaultReports suggest that there have been some fortunate coincidences that have prevented a cyclist from being stranded across train tracks.  When this has happened the reporting of incidents is piecemeal and enquiring about incidents on Network Rail crossings can often reveal that no record has been made on the signallers or incident logs for the route.
default&#xa0;
defaultBramley LC – near Reading
default – 2 incidents within a short period where cyclists front wheels dropped into the gaps which had opened up in a particular, older, design of steel framed concrete panels, the bikes stopped abruptly sending the riders over the handlebars and causing serious injury. The non recording CCTV was not being viewed by a signaller at this time, and so not recorded in the log, and the cyclists speeds were low, in one case setting off after the barriers had just lifted
default&#xa0;
defaultSimilar crossings at 
defaultEmsworth, Sawbridgeworth and Three Horseshoes (No 3
default) have been noted over the years. At Sawbridgeworth the fact that the fallen rider dragged themselves clear of the railway before requiring an emergency tracheotomy to deal with swollen airways meant that this incident did not apparently get recorded by ORR system, as a serious incident, despite it being almost a fatality, avoided largely by the presence of a nurse in a nearby house.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt 
defaultThree Horseshoes No 3
default we have an example of a string of 4 public road level crossings on the same minor road and a railway staff access foot crossing all within a 2-mile stretch of the same 2-track railway line.  3 of the public road crossings could be eliminated along with the railway staff crossing by re-routing the road on the South side of the railway and making alternative access arrangements for the few houses and farms on the North side. No 3 was possibly the most dangerous as it has a severe skew angle and was for a while using some old, and worn-out concrete panel units. A motor cyclist died there in 2003, after sunset with the detail unclear on whether he had fallen and been hit or rode into the path of the train.
default&#xa0;
defaultPhotographs were taken by the fallen cyclists, who were assisted off the 90mph railway by another cyclist who had fallen before, and whose son (a local police officer) had also fallen on the same crossing, and taken an interest in recording similar incidents. The photographs worryingly showed a statutory warning sign which had fallen off the post and was lying face-up on the ground and two telephones (one presumably redundant) to be used to contact the signaller.  Repairs and relaying of the original crossing panels (now renewed) had left a patchwork of disjointed white lining and road studs at the time of the cyclists’ crash.  This detail was reported back to Network Rail  This line is now gaining a substantial increase in traffic due to the doubling of some services from Felixstowe, Network Rail’s National track recycling centre and increased passenger services, but the minor road here is a a valuable quiet roads link between March and Peterborough on the National Cycleroute Network.  Subsequent to this incident an attempt was made to check whether every fall which CTC and local Police had heard about was reflected in records kept by the signaller or Network Rail’s area office, but no clear conclusion was secured.
default&#xa0;defaultAre current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved?default&#xa0;
defaultThe flatness of level crossings, 
defaultand gaps between panels are, through the Railway Group standards very closely specified, and when new, modern panel type crossings are free from trip hazards, and stable when driven over.  However many earlier crossings have panel construction systems which do not offer features such as tie rods clamping individual panels securely within a larger unit which itself is robustly anchored to the track.  The threshold between a level crossing and the abutting road surfaces is also an area where substantial misalignment can occur due to various factors, and it is apparent that in some locations the need to keep a crossing open may lead to temporary or improvised repair arrangements being made, or the quality of the threshold being badly compromised, with tarmac breaking away from concrete or metal edges, which is especially hazardous on skew or angled crossings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe limit of typical ’steps’ in a road surface is generally 5-6 mm as this is consider to be a limit for smooth travel when moving with a wheelchair up a dropped kerb or tripping up when paving slabs are misaligned. The Network Rail Standard calls for a height difference of no more the 5mm between the road surface and railhead, and from the many other standards for road surface detailing it becomes clear that a maximum height for a ridge that will not deflect a cycle tyre is 6mm but an ideal limit for any ridge or railhead is 3mm.  Following from a costly case 
default(Roe vs Sheffield Supertram) 
defaultwhere a car driver lost control due to all 4 wheels being lifted clear of the road surface on the railheads Sheffield trams set their limit at 3mm.  From observation many railway level crossings miss these limits by a long way often through age and wear &amp; tear.  In some cases the stretched tolerances have low impact because the road is low speed and the approach surfaces are equally rough    
default&#xa0;
defaultThreshold collapse and misalignment 
defaultI note that Network Rail has been developing improved designs for the threshold construction that are both faster and more economical to install and more robust against the loadings from road traffic. It would therefore be good to have resources made available to deal with a specific detail of threshold areas where settlement is creating a hazard and causing panel damage/movement. (Pictures appendices) of Kirton Lane Thorne and Starbeck show sunken road surfaces on the approach to the crossing and Staveley (prior to repairs) with kerbs broken away etc)
default&#xa0;
defaultEarly crossing types – panel movement
default  In earlier types of panel crossings the ability of panels to separate by movement, steel framing (of concrete) to rust or wear thin and rubber to shrink or age and deform by wearing awy in hidden areas which bear on the supporting sleepers etc means that the limit of 10mm for the gap between panels can often be exceeded, presenting a classic wheel trap hazard, and the surface levels can be badly affected by hogging as the poorly supported panel rocks and then wears away
default&#xa0;
defaultEnhanced standards for crossings which are not public roads 
defaultThere are several types of level crossing which are not public roads but used by cyclists, and a few hundred licensed railway operators in addition to Network Rail with the responsibility for the maintenance of these crossings.. Indications are that there is a lot to be learned and applied in the delivery of appropriate presentation of the railway to the user of the crossing both in the way that the observation of approaching rail traffic is delivered by the way in which the crossing is approached and use controlled, and the importance of maintaining standards for the crossing surface appropriate to the conditions on the approaches to the crossing.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe low importance placed on attending to poor surface conditions at Moor Lane Staines and subsequent fatal outcome has I hope been a significant alert to the importance of this detail to non motorised users although there have still been events such as the wheelchair users near fatal incident at Victory LC, and a string of cyclists falls and fatal/near fatal incidents which could have been avoided if the crossing surfaces had been better maintained
default&#xa0;
defaultEngagement with users for defect reporting and hazard removal 
defaultThe resources available to Network Rail are we recognise, finite and thus a we work constantly to try for clear engagement, on how to maintain the levels of service provided by existing crossings, whilst delivering an inherently safe sequence for the approach and preparation to cross, and exit on the opposite side. The sheer scale of this does make it an onerous task for local members of CTC and other groups volunteering their time and a limited central resource, but modern systems can use crowd sourcing, and there is potential to offer open data on crossing locations to applications such as open street map to link with feedback from users of this system on the routes mapped, where these include level crossings. .
default&#xa0;
defaultExample of user feedback - at Scremerston
default on ECML near Berwick on Tweed, a downgraded public road crossing, now a foot crossing over which cycles can be wheeled.  Two CTC members went to cross the railway and found that the gate on the opposite side of the railway was narrower that that they had come on to the railway through.  As a result they were unable to pass smoothly through the second gate and were ’stalled’ for a short period on the live side of the gate and later realised that they had not been fully clear of the running line in a place of safety as they tried to get their cycles through the second gate.        
default&#xa0;
defaultForcing the users to look – and use their ears.
default  Of the fatal cycle crashes investigated by RAIB, every case, had evidence to suggest or confirm that the crossing could be used with the cyclist able to proceed across the line without making a positive action of checking the line in both directions, and no provision to prevent them from getting on to the line when a train is approaching.  The ability to hear an approaching train or a siren may have been shut-out by some of the victims, but this position applies equally to those who are deaf.  
default&#xa0;defaultAt Morden Hall Park (Croydon)
default the tram fatality report highlighted the detail that the crossing point had been relocated and it had been possible to cross the line, in such a way that a sequence of looking in both directions required a special effort to turn round and look.  These have generally been at crossings where there is no gate or the user operates a gate or otherwise gains access to the line without having to take an action to release the gate or check the approach of a train.       
default&#xa0;defaultGetting road and footpath signage installed to a common standard, and enhance it with appropriate ’New’ signs.
default From the observations at Three Horseshoes No 3 and Kirton Lane Thorne the condition of the signage and the introduction of non standard signage suggests that two details need to be addressed for delivery of a robust installation of signage, and a clear application of standards, especially for crossings which are not public roads used by motor traffic.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIn addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?default&#xa0;
defaultEnsure there are good pedestrian margins on public road crossings  
defaultThe incident at Victory LC near Plymouth highlighted the need to deliver the pedestrian side-strips of sufficient width and quality.  The cost of extending the heavy duty road crossing panels can be substantial, and in a number of locations crossings may need widening to deliver sufficiently wide pedestrian routes.  The need to get a consistent delivery in this respect might be judged from the photograph of the crossing at Three Horseshoes No 3 prior to its renewal where the pedestrian route is a piecemeal patchwork of timber (sleepers), concrete crossing panel and the tarmac infill, not helped by the random segments of white lining and road studs where panels had been moved or replaced as a repair.   
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAn illustration of a seriously hazardous crossing surface – now renewed where several cyclists have been brought down – note random white lining due to panel replacement gaps and vertical ’steps’ and pedestrian route under 1.0m wide with a mxture of surfaces
default&#xa0;
defaultThe deterioration of panel surfaces presents a significant hazard to cyclists and pedestrians especially where the panels may have moved due to loss of support from the track, wear on the steel framing, and settlement of the road-crossing threshold.  Rubber panels can split, hog, and sag, concrete crack and crumble at the edges, and all can visibly rock even under even light vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOn older types of crossing the settlement of tarmac or stone infilling between check-rails or simply the open slot for the full height of the rail at the edge of the timber present hazardsous surfaces that can be dealt with by use of more modern crossing construction, and there needs to be aan evaluation of traffic types and volume in considering the need to upgrade the surface.  Additionally the use of crossing types which can be removed for mechanised high output track maintenance may offer cost savings in other areas of railway operations
default&#xa0;defaultInstall cycle friendly skew crossings. 
default Currently being evaluated by Network Rail is a German design of crossing where the flangeway has a renewable insert, that compresses under the rail wheel flange and remains flush with the rail surface indications are that this removes a significant element of the hazard from skew crossings for trapping or deflecting the tyres of  cycles, wheelchairs and prams. For the crossings using panels supplied by this manufacturer the conversion simply requires the central (4-foot) panel to be replaced with the new design. The old centre panels can often be salvaged for re-use or upgrading work elsewhere
default&#xa0;defaultAddress the major reluctance from the rail operators to install underpasses.  T
defaulthis can result in ridiculous extensions in the distance travelled or the sheer number of steps required to maintain a sensible route across the barrier presented by the rail line. By creating such lengthy diversions the temptation can be for some users to continue to use the at grade crossing.
default&#xa0;
defaultA CTC objection tried strongly to get underpasses at 2 crossing points for the new Bicester chord. on one, an existing crossing it was noted that there was a massive increase in the distance being delivered by the proposal for a bridge, but the lack of resources to check and prove a robust case for an underpass which would not have increased the distance travelled to cross the line, and linked with this the lack of resources to compare the costs for the underpass, and detail – challenging the conventions used in the UK but common in NL and elsewhere*, resulted in this bid being defeated.
default&#xa0;
default*In the Scottish Highlands culverts are often vastly over-sized for the streams that pass through them as this accommodates the surge flows of melt-water which occur for a relatively short period in the spring.  In an early example the access to the Speyside Railway at Aviemore was generating unwelcome trespass from the public crossing the Highland Main Line.  A concrete ledge was cast in the invert of the culvert passing under the railway close to the car park and Speyside Railway station, and signposted as the route to be used.  A direct crossing was thus provided, which is available for at least 50 weeks per year, and generally unusable when demand to use it is low.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn NL and also in Germany there are also path crossings under the rail line which share the span with  a water course with the water level above that of the path.  Civil Engineers in these coutries clearly have sorted out how to deliver crossings where the wtare table is above the level to which the path surface has to drop to pass under the railway
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the second crossing point, in Bicester a route clearly used by cyclists, but not recorded as such by the local council was deemed not to be one which would have any provision of a ramp or even a wheeling ramp on the stepped footbridge proposed. That footbridge is to be constructed from the existing ground level over the top of a railway line on top of an embankment nearly 3 metres high, resulting in a climb of around 90 steps up and a similar number down, a near guaranteed deterrent to using the path, or bridge.  Our call to put an underpass beneath the rail line before building the embankment (itself a way to maintain the path in use whilst the construction work takes place was turned down).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultRemote Locking with low power systems – requiring no wired connections
default The control of gates on footpath, bridleway and private UWC’s is an area where there may be some transfer of technology from cycling.  Many public bike-sharing schemes have stand alone locking systems that have a minimal power drain, often covered by a small solar panel, and use a ’dumb’ mobile phone to send and receive requests for hire and lock release through GSM phone networks.  The option for a locking control that can be inhibited when a train is approaching, and with a possible message display.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith appropriate design and operation a UWC for vehicles can be operated and closed with the elimination of 2 crossings of the live railway by the person operating the gates, and the remote locking can also act to provide an ’assured closure’ activation by the signaller.   default&#xa0;defaultVehicle crossing sequencedefaultUser arrives and logs in to unlock both gates with GSM signal if line is clear to crossdefaultOpens first gate to latching postdefaultOpens far-side gate to latching postdefaultReturns to vehicle and drives acrossdefaultLogs in to unlock gates  from latching posts - gates have closing spring or similar device  defaultGates swing to closed position and latches engage both sides.#default(crossing to re-lock gates eliminated, if second 'unlock' command is not activated by crossing user it can be remotely triggereddefault&#xa0;defaultNon motor vehicle sequencedefaultAs registered user or with request from unit release both locksdefaultOpen near gate and allow to close/close and let latch engage automaticallydefaultCross and open (unlatched) far gate to exit railwaydefault&#xa0;defaultOperation of the system with give a count  for the number of crossings made and general pattern of use (times) More than one person could be crossing with each event.default&#xa0;defaultEdge lighting with low power LED’s 
defaultIn France some pedestrian level crossings have been fitted with LED edge lighting. Modern solar powered led lighting may have sufficient capacity to be fitted as a stand alone edge marking system to ensure crossing users do not miss their footing when crossing at night at remote locations with no light spill or direct street lighting.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?default&#xa0;
defaultGiven that much of the damage to level crossing surfaces comes from the speeds and weights of road traffic it may useful to consider whether a contribution from the highways budget is appropriate, especially where the type and volume of traffic has changed, due to a short or long term issues.  An example is that of 2 crossings on the Wensleydale Railway where it is crossed twice by the A 684 between Leeming and Bedale.  At both locations (Bedale Station and Aiskew) the crossings carry HGV traffic using this key route from the Yorkshire Dales, and especially during the period of work upgrading the A1 at Leeming Bar. The condition of the road surface caused a series  of cyclists’ falls some with serious injuries, and one later dying. following falls on damaged and uneven crossing surfaces.
default&#xa0;
defaultChanging use of the road has placed a greater higher demand for attention to the crossing on the  Wensleydale Railway Company, and patching up repairs are often the option at many locations where the ideal solution is a more radical renewal or rebuilding of the interface between road surface and the crossing.surfaces.  Although Network Rails resources are substantially greater, the constraints of access to dismantle and rebuild a crossing may see the option to repair selected, with the need to keep revisiting rather than a full stripping out and renewal which would eliminate the problems more effectively along with the need for continual attention.
default&#xa0;
defaultA clearer, budgetted rolling renewal programme for main public road crossings based on the loadings and levels of traffic would be good to have as a visible marker on work being done.  . From observation, a major road crossing will require renewal of significant maintenance to restore the alignment between the tarmac surface and crossing possibly as frequently as every 10 years.  A programme based on the historic data and a review of the current state of crossings is needed to establish the scale of this issue, and may be able to draw on the public reporting of road defects now using online reporting systems to .
default&#xa0;defaultThe budgetting may also need to recognise that the removal and reinstallation  of a crossing after track maintenance, or the settlement of the threshold between the road surface and crossing, can introduce wear and potentially alter the way the panels transfer the road loadings to the track. THer may be additional demand on resources to deliver . Heavy duty units require precise spacing of the sleepers, and correct levelling between the track and the threshold with the road surfaces either side  , and the high sped derailment at Croxton in Norfolk had as a causal factor the detail that the removal and replacement of panels after track maintenance had left some panels insufficiently supported, and in the detail of attending to reported defects the track workers wee also not aware of the detailed requirements and the evidence of hidden problems that was presented to them by the external appearance at the crossing surface.  The requirements for this should have been addressed since this incident by putting resources to ensure staff are better trained, although from what is seen around the country thee are still some sites where the condition of crossing surfaces is that they should have been     
default&#xa0;
defaultThe position at 
default3 Horseshoes
default highlights a further detail that a long-term measure of removing 3 of the 4 crossings can be provided for by securing the land and even material for earthworks by acting now to purchase land, and agree with local development sites to accept inert material to build up the formation for a new road alignment – including possible s.106 from developers of new housing on this road, and a planning inhibition to keep such development South of the railway
default&#xa0;
defaultIs Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?default&#xa0;
defaultThe balance of spending and direction of of how that resource is best delivered poses a major challenge, but as highlighted in the preceding answer, there is perhaps a need to resource this better but with a greater understanding of issues which affect the cyclist, horserider, and pedestrian, from the crossing surfaces and approach conditions underfoot.
default&#xa0;
defaultTRL did some work with DfT but there is a need to get clear definition of the critical, height and profiles for tramline tactile paving and the rumble effect thermoplastic white lines from the edge marking of a carriageway. Enquiries to date have failed to find the reports and detail of the testing and calculations that lead to the figures used for these features and other road detailing – all generally in the range of 3mm to 6mm for the vertical step at a joint, or similar edge presented to deflect tyres or trip-up feet.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe specification set down by Network Rail’s design guidance is clear but can be difficult to find in the documentation, and the specification of new crossings generally has features which ensure a close registration between individual panels and the railheads.  The system can fail at the point of delivery, where wear and damage to the crossing panels system leaves panels able to move under the passage of even a pedestrian when they should be firmly seated, or sit with edges raised or separated beyond the tolerances set down in the manual. Part of this may be that assessments viewed from the perspective of a motor vehicle users can be very different to those seen as a pedestrian or cyclists or horse rider using the same surfaces. This is particularly noticable in the trip hazards seen on some crossings in the strips nominally for pedestrian use at the crossing edges.
default&#xa0;
defaultA better understanding and assessment of hazards for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders needs to be developed in the inspection regimes, based on observed conditions, and the inspection reports these appear to generate
defaultIs Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?default&#xa0;
defaultNo, the current reporting system does not place a high enough level of importance on incidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, which unlike a large object, such as a motor vehicle present a minimal danger of derailing a train or causing any significant damage to it.
default&#xa0;
defaultReporting and management of hazards on crossings which are not public roads does not get the same levels of scrutiny and application as the focus of public roads and UWC’s  where the presence of a large vehicle delivers a greater risk to the train, but lives are still lost by the crossing users on foot or cycle
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a need for a form of the AXIAT modelling tool to assess the provision of alternatives to a level crossing for traffic on foot and on cycles. Currently the proposals for closure and re-routing provide a fertile ground for major challenges on the decreased safety of some proposals, sending crossing users via routes where motorised traffic especially poses a greater hazard than crossing a rail line, or the extended route, crossing at an alternative point, or via a bridge or underpass with compromises in the design which deliver a massive increase in journey times especially for the typical pedestrian journey, or create a perception of danger through high sided and narrow corridors  with poor sightlines and the passive security this provides.  Maintaining the level of service and safety for the pedestrian, cycle, and horse traffic where the railway has severed this in the past and where new development will create the potential for demand for crossing the railway.  In the latter case a stronger means to get those creating that demand to accommodate the impact on the railway  
defaultthat an unsatisfied demand for crossing may create.
defaultHow should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?default&#xa0;
defaultI note the review of level crossings legislation undertaken by the Law Commission and the Law Commission for Scotland.  The ability to obtain land and resources for appropriate works to eliminate or resite a level crossing, including works away from the railway itself  is an area which may need to be addressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe assessment tool AXIAT is used for the external risks when a public road is involved but not for a footpath of bridleway crossing. The need to maintain convenience and directness  makes it desirable to set a process for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders which measures risk for a diversiion as well as the substantially greater time impact of a long diversion
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also important to note that the ability to apply the modelling tools of ALCRM may make it possible to create a new level crossing particularly in remote areas, and where existing demand makes a formal crossing point preferable to informal routes being created by trespass, this may be a more cost-effective option than policing the railway and fence lines.  The key may be in the delivery of effective management measures which make it difficult to be on the crossing when trains are approaching (remote release gate latches, miniature colour lights) and effective delivery of penalties for abuse.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe signage, covered by the toad signs manual also lacks detail appropriate for cyclists and pedestrians, and the re-introduction of signs highlighting the uneven surface as a trip or tyre deflection hazard, and where slots in a crossing surface may open up may need to be developed with concise and appropriate wording for supplementary plates and authorised used of signs currently not officially available, but in some places, unofficially provided.
default&#xa0;
defaultA better reference to the signage for level crossings which are not public roads for motor trafficin future editions of TSRGD (Road Signs Manual) would be a ppossible way to make matters clear on the current mis-use or mis application of signs selected from the current TSRGD – notably 966 (Cyclists Dismount) and 951 (No cycling).
default&#xa0;defaultHow should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?default&#xa0;
defaultThe use of @networkrail twitter account to report issues can be promoted but given the significance of level crossing safety it may warrant a dedicated account, with hashtag identification of the crossing location. Online reporting of general road defects through CTC www.fillthathole.org.uk and MySociety ww.fixmystreet. are both I believe now able to direct reported road defects  system reporting directly to Network Rail regional centres) the reporting of defects, and incidents (such as trips and falls) through the available channels mostly through the number 08457 11 41 41, but where a potentially serious hazard arises thorough detachment of parts of the crossing equipment, to use the direct telephone to the signaller.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere the railway is not operated by Network Rail, the difference should be made clear at the crossing.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe option to warn the train drivers and signallers at the earliest opportunity needs to be appropriately highlighted in the highway code and ideally should be an action taken simultaneously with any attempt to remove people from the railway lines.  The use of telephones at the crossing as a means to rapidly contact the signaller is perhaps not emphasised enough, both as an emergency when the line is obstructed, and after a fall or loss of control to ensure that the incident is logged, and where CCTV is in use the events can be downloaded promptly before they are overwritten.

defaultCyclists have been often been helped from the line by local people living close to the crossing. The value of local observers kept aware of the issues with their local level crossing can, through the communication networks now available provide day-to-day monitoring, beyond the limitations of the official inspection regime

defaultRecent picture– North threshold repaired with cast concrete – still has trip hazard on footway strip but work has been done to mitigate the worst problems with road surface. This is perhaps doing the best with limited resources available  (August 2013)  Road markings repainted
