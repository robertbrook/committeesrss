"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from \nCentro On Behalf Of West Midlands Strategic Transport Officers Group\n (LTD0025)\n&#xa0;\nThis\n \nresponse represents the collective view of the West Midlands Metropolitan Area and was developed through the \nWest Midlands \nStrategic Transport Officers G\nroup (STOG) which comprises Centro \nand the seven West Midlands Metropolitan Authorities of Birmingham, \nCoventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe key messages from the West Midlands Metropolitan Area in relation to this line of inquiry are the need for:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The West Midlands response to the \ninquiry questions are outlined below.\n&#xa0;\nQ1. What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nThe Governments proposals were based on the r\nationale \nof \nproviding local areas with \nthe \nflexibility to \ndetermine transport \npriorities \nthat \nmeet local needs and lever in economic development\n. \nF\newer funding pots mean\nt a\n less silo based approach to transport funding and a more integrated approach to solutions.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nFor the period beyond 2015, Major Scheme funding and prioritisation was de\nvolved to Local Transport Bodies\n \n(LTB)\n \nconstit\nut\ned of \nLocal Enterprise Partnerships (\nLEP\n)\n,\n Integrated Transport Authorities (\nITA\n)\n and other key stakeholders.\n \nI\nn 2013, the requirement \nto determine transport as part of each \nLEP \nStrategic\n Economic Plans \nis the right \ncourse;\n however it is of concern that the only \nsignificant \nfunding sources go\ning into \nSingle Local Growth Fund (\nSLGF\n)\n come\ns\n from the Department for Transport \n(DfT) \nthough Major Schemes and Integrated Transport Block funding. \nThis could mean transport funding non-transport infrastructure\n and more Government departments should contri\nbute\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAdvantages\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nThe West Midlands believes the approach offered the following advantages:\n&#xa0;\nDisadvantages\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n              \nThe West Midlands b\nelieves the approach offered the following disadvantages:\nQ2. Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?5.\n              \nYes. Local areas do have t\nhe ca\npacity to assess, prioriti\ns\ne\n and deliver local transport schemes. \nGovernments original rationale of devolution was to empower local areas and allow flexible, dynamic transport government and delivery structures reflective of local \neconomic \ngeographies\n.\n6.\n              \nHowever, Government \ndoes appear to have \ncontradicted this approach by imposing new structures and bodies rather than allowing local determination\n towards transport\n. \nWhilst, the \nprioritisation of Major Schemes by the \nthree LTBs covering the West Midlands me\ntropolitan area \nis considered to have been \nlargely have been successful\n in terms of type of schemes and strategic policy alignment\n, their role \nhas now been absorbed into the LEP through SLGF A\ns strategic transport planning and scheme \npriorities will be det\nermined by LEPs, they need to be resources to undertake this work. \n7.\n              \nAny part of the Metropolitan Area effectively has 5 different organisation\ns\n undertaking similar \ntransport \nfunctions\n.\n \nIn practice, the differing remits, funding and covering geographies \nis likely to lead to inefficiencies between strategic planning, development and delivery of \ntransport \nschemes and initiatives.\n8.\n              \nWith LEPs covering differing geographical areas, there is a need for strategic transport governance structures\n \nto ensure \ncoordination activity\n. To that end, t\nhe West Midlands \nMetropolitan Area \nhas \nself \ndetermined that transport governance\n \nshould be undertaken by the seven leaders of the District Authorities as the \nITA\n. \nThis will ensure a closer alignment between the economic\n development responsibilities of LEPs and the integrated transport responsibilities of the West Midlands ITA. \nThe arrangements presently operate in shadow form and are presently being considered by the \nDfT\n.\n9.\n              \nIn relation to funding, the West Midlands welc\nomed devolution of major scheme funding. However, the pro-rata nature of the allocations reflects population not need of area. This means funding of large strategic schemes, such as rail/ \nlight rail and/ or bus rapid transit \nschemes is less feasible\n and th\nis is discussed further in question 7\n. \nQ3. What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?10.\n              \nIn the Metropolitan Area, strategic cross boundary transport planning is vital and reflects the \nrealities\n of transport patterns and requirements of an urban area both for internal cross boundary movements and wider within the economic catchment of the metr\nopolitan area.\n11.\n              \nIn the West Midlands, \nthe ITA \npresently is tasked by the Local Transport Act (200\n8\n) to \nundertake strategic cross boundary\n transport\n \nplanning \nwhilst \ndecision\n making\n on Major Schemes\n is \nnow \nundertaken by 3 separate LEP\ns\n who have a specific focus on promoting economic development\n.\n \nAs the District Leaders sit on both the LEP and ITA \nthey will be coordinating transport across the West Midlands\n.\n \nQ4. How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?&#xa0;\n12.\n              \nThe West Midlands believes that local bodies \nlargely do work well together, reflecting historical working processes and relationships. However, there \nmust \nbe \na\n stronger responsibility for national transport agencies, such as the Highways \nAgency and Network Rail, to work closely with local bodies such as ITAs and LEPs to ensure alignment between local needs and \nnational investment programmes. \n&#xa0;\n13.\n              \nNational trans\nport investment programmes should be fully aligned to supporting local areas. \nHowever, \nwe believe \nthere is a\n \ndisconnect\nion\n between local needs and \nhow \nnational \ninvestment programmes\n are developed\n. \n&#xa0;\n14.\n              \nFor example, in Control Period 5 the West Midlands wi\nll benefit from only one named scheme (Walsall – Rugeley Electrification) \nin Network Rails investment programme \nwhilst local rail priorities such as Water Orton rail corridor and the \nCamp Hill Chords \nremain unfunded impacting on the ability to support econ\nomic development, address congestion and connect people to jobs.\n \n&#xa0;\n15.\n              \nIn relation to the Highways Agency, local priorities such as \nSmart\n Motorways on the M5 (between the M6 Interchange and J4a) through the core of the Black Country \n(as identified by the W\nest Midlands Metropolitan Freight Strategy) \nalso remains unfunded, leading to impacts to journey reliability, connectivity to markets, congestion and the environment.\n&#xa0;\nQ5. Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?&#xa0;\n16.\n              \nAs previously stated, the West Midlands has seen a significant reduction in capital funding blocks. \nBetween\n 2009/10 \nand\n 2011/12 capital allowances was \ncut by \n47%\n.\n. \nThe West Midlands welcomes devolution and removal of funding allocation ring fencing, however the ability to support economic growth, tackle congestion, connect people to jobs and support environmental objectives will be directly linked the size of funding\n available. Each of these latter objectives supports the government objective of supporting economic growth. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n              \nHowever there is considerable inequity between London and the rest of the UK\n. F\nor 2014/15 all transport authorities across England outside of\n London will be allocated £2.084Bn (£1.664bn Capital; £420M revenue) compared to the £2.4bn London is to be allocated by the DfT. This significant inequity in transport funding distribution means that for 2011/12 the West Midlands had £198 per head for tra\nnsport compared to £644 per head in London. Efforts to rebalance the UK \neconomy \nwill be undermined not supported if the spend on transport \nper head \noutside of London is not \nbrought closer to the levels enjoyed by London.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n              \nInvestment in any transport sc\nheme is a highly efficient approach to supporting the economy as materials are purchased, jobs are created in building the scheme and it improves productivity of the wider economy. Whilst the Government has recognised this and has increased funding for nat\nional agencies to historical high levels for the period 2015-19, local transport funding (covering Major Schemes, Integrated Transport and Maintenance Blocks) for 2015-19 is £2.244bn per annum compared to £1.968Bn in 2009/10 an increase of 14% or the equiv\nalent of 1.9% per annum.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n              \nFinally, the West Midlands has developed the Local Connectivity Package \n(LCP) \nwhich outlines an integrated approach to maximising the economic benefits of High Speed Two. The £2bn programme of schemes and interventions would \ndouble the econom\nic benefits of HS2. The West Midlands wants the national transport investment programmes and priorities to be reflective of the \nLCP\n. If Network Rail was to therefore fund the rail schemes required in the LCP then half of the \nLCP\n would be f\nunded by Network Rail. \n&#xa0;\n20.\n              \nThe other half could be provided by Government as it is committed to maximising the economic benefits of HS2. Government could allocate additional resource to the West Midlands. For example, if the West Midlands received an ext\nra £50 per person on transport spending this would total an extra £135m per year. This additional money; allocated per year - over a ten year period; would help fund the other half of the \nLCP\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nQ6. What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?&#xa0;\n21.\n              \nThe SLGF \nin principal should be a strong start to \naddress\n the underinvestment in local transport as discussed in previous answers. \nThe £2bn per annum pot is a welcomed \nstart, however given the competitive nature of the fund, the government still retains control over funding allocations – against the premise of \nlocal \ndevolution. \n&#xa0;\n22.\n              \nWe note that Lord Heseltine’s “No Stone Unturned” report identified the potential to \ndevolve £49bn to local areas, a transformational level of resources which could regenerate and transform local areas and allow for locally driven long term planning and development.\n&#xa0;\n23.\n              \nHowever, the SLGF must be the start of a wider process of transport f\nunding devolution not the end of the process. \nCrucially, only the DfT is contributing significant Government spend, other department should provide equivalent resources to maximise the benefits and opportunities of the SLGF.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n              \nA more equitable solution \nwould be for the complete devolution of th\ne SLGF\n with \nparticular focus of resource on metropolitan areas \nurban areas which are often the focal point of journeys\n, hubs of economic activity, population growth\n and therefore \nthe location where investment in \ntr\nansport issues\n will generate the largest benefits\n. \n&#xa0;\n25.\n              \nThe West Midlands notes with caution that if SEP/ SLGF awarded monies are not allocated over a fixed medium term process (5-10 years) then the ability to plan or bring schemes forward to meet develop\nment opportunities will be severely restricted, especially if allocations are \nconfirmed \non an annual basis.\n&#xa0;Q7. How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?&#xa0;\n26.\n              \nWhilst the Government’s \nfunding for transport \nwill \nsupport \ninvestment in sma\nller scale schemes \n(&lt;£2\n0\nM\n approx\n local transport schemes\n) and larger schemes (&gt;£500\nM\n approx\n national transport scheme)\n, the\nre is a gap in\n \nthe \nability to fund ‘mid-range’ schemes i.e. £\n2\n0\nM\n - £500\nM\n locally\n, vital for transformational changes to local area economies. \nSuch m\nid-range schemes \nmostly \ncover rapid transit (light rail and bus), rail schem\nes or stations.\n In the West Midlands, the following schemes would fall into this category:\n&#xa0;              Camp Hill Chords: A £200\nM\n (approx)\n scheme which would facilitate the introduction of rail services to residential areas of Birmingham which are home to 250,000 people providing \nthem with \naccess to jobs, education and other key services whilst reducing road congestion.\n The scheme would gene\nrate £150M approx GVA \nfor the regional economy \nand support \nthe creation of\n 3220 jobs in the West Midlands.\n&#xa0;              Wednesbury to Brierley Hill Metro: \na £\n270\nM \n(approx) \nMidland Metro light rail extension from existing Metro Line One through the heart of the Black \nCountry acting as a catalyst for regeneration, land use changes and economic development. T\nhe area has poor transport accessibility and connectivity to the wider conurbation and particularly Birmingham city centre.\n The scheme would generate £165M GVA for t\nhe regional economy and support the creation of 3,600 jobs\n&#xa0;\n27.\n              \nFunding of these specific schemes and general ‘mid-range’ transport schemes \ncannot\n be done within the funding allocations of Major Schemes, whilst the multi- infrastructure nature of the SLGF means that funding \nfrom that competitive pot \nis unlikely. \n&#xa0;\n28.\n              \nThis means funding opportunities for these types of schemes will focus on \nsovereign/ private investment funds, council tax levy increases (noting the Governments statutory requirements for a local referendum), borrowing\n, \nTax\n Incremental Financing or \npr\nivate sector contributions through mechanisms such as the Community Infrastruc\nture Levy. \n&#xa0;\n29.\n              \nThe West Midlands notes that generally \ns\nmall schemes \n(&lt;£20M) \nand \nlarger \nschemes\n (£500M&gt;)\n \nare \nnot exposed to such risks, \nas \nGovernment \nprovides the capital for delivery through local transport funding or national transport agency which remo\nves risk or funding uncertainly. However, this is \nnot\n the case for such mid-range £20M-£500M schemes\n which require the promoting local authority \nor private sector \nto take on \ncost or price \nrisk\n. \nR\nisk is therefore priced into schemes, inflating costs or \ndefl\nating \nreturns\n/benefits\n.\n&#xa0;\n30.\n              \nTherefore, Government should look to \naddress how to deliver such mid-range schemes.\n \nIdeally there should be a consistent approach to funding whereby greater levels of capital is available to fund such schemes, providing equalit\ny with the low-risk funding certainty of the national transport agencies/ organisations\n. \n&#xa0;\n31.\n              \nThe \nSLGF\n offers the opportunity to pool resources but the levels of funding \npresently allocated \nare not receptive to the delivery of these types of schemes \nalone and would need to be completed by further capital funding, including locally generated funding. \n&#xa0;\n32.\n              \nThe West Midlands notes the successful use of Council Tax funding for transport schemes \nin metropolitan areas such as \nGreater \nManchester, however presently such an approach would be included in calculations to increase council tax by more than 2% and the subsequent requirement by Government for a local referendum. The specific requirement sho\nuld be amended by Government if local areas self determine this funding approach as an aspiration\n.\n&#xa0;\n33.\n              \nWithout the levels of capital resources required to deliver such transformational schemes available in the SLGF nor can they be practically raised local\nly, metropolitan areas are missing out on the economic, congestion, environmental and health benefits of these schemes, meaning our capability to cater for a growing population and economy is impacted upon.\n&#xa0;\n34.\n              \nHowever, w\nith such \na funding model \nin place,\n the \nlower \ncost of risk built into financial models and decision making by local areas and the private sector would be reduced by creating an environment of greater funding certainty to unlock investment to create jobs and growth.\n \n&#xa0;\n35.\n              \nThe W\nest Midlands \na\ngain highlights that \nan extra £50 per p\nerson on transport spending\n would total an extra £135m per year\n and would \nfund the other half of the \nLCP required to double the economic benefits of HS2 across the West Midlands.\n \nThis would be more akin to the powers \nand approaches used by Transport for London to the benefit of the London economy and population.\n&#xa0;\n36.\n              \nHowever, such an approach should not discount the opportunity of private sector investment.\n \nHowever, how\n such\n investment is secured needs to\n be\n altered. A\n single large capital pot for funding of mid-range transport \nschemes\n means the \npublic \nsector could\n \nfund and deliver \na \nmid-range transport \nscheme \nwhich could \nthen \nbe sold to the private sector \nor public sector pension funds \nas \na long term concession after a\n pre-determined number of years. \n&#xa0;\n37.\n              \nOnce the public sector underwriting period was complete and revenues known, growth and operating costs could be modelled and valued with certainty. The capital raised from the concession could then be recycled \nback \nto \nthe strategic transport \nfund \nfor \nother mid-range transport schemes. \n&#xa0;\n38.\n              \nAfter the concession period was over, a reselling of the asset could occur. However, this approach requires a dedicated capital pot to pump prime the process and Government should\n empower and resource local areas above the present levels of the SLGF to achieve this and generate economic benefits both \nlocally\n and nationally.\n&#xa0;\nQ8. How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?&#xa0;\n39.\n              \nPresently, the West Midlands feels there a strong lines of accountability\n, however in the spirit of devolution, local areas should be allowed to develop appropriate structures to undertaken government requirements rather than\n Government\n imposing structures\n.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\nPage \n6\n&#xa0;\n"
