"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGeneral comments&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe study showed that pathways without CCS would require exceptional levels of power from nuclear and \nrenewables\n – to support increased electrification of th\ne heating and transport sectors. The development of low-carbon heat networks with CHP would soon become limited due to emissions constraints and \nthe absence of \nCCS would have a significant impact on the potential for wide-scale roll-out of hydrogen \nas a fu\nel source for\n low-carbon heat.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCHP with CCS – Providing Low Carbon Power and District Heat &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecarbonising Heat in Industry&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCCS – The Potential&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe view expressed in \nthis paper cannot be taken to represent the views of all members of the CCSA.
