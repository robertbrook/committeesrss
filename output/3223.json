"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Novartis (AMR0003)Focus on Antibiotics1. How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens represent one of the greatest \nchallenges\n to human health\n. Antibiotic resistance is\n now\n a linked global problem, with the dissemination of successful clones of MDR bacteria \noften\n associated with the movement of people\n1\n. The excessive and/or inappropriate use of antibiotics \nis\n \na \nmajor ca\nusative factor for the local evolution of MDR bacteria that can be further exacerbated by horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants between different bacterial species\n1\n. \nThe last decade has seen the emergence of antimicrobial resistance \naffecting entire classes of antibiotics including quinolones, t\netracyclines, glycopeptides, \nmacrolides\n and \nβ\n‐\nlactams including carbapenems\n2\n \n.\nIn the same time period \nonly \nthree new antibiotics were \nsuccessfully \nintroduced\n to\n market\n (linezolid, daptomycin a \nceftaroline)\n2\n.\n \nOf great concern is that for some MDR bacteria, no active antibiotic is available, with the fear that this problem will increase over time\n1\n, 3\n. In the USA it is estimated that &gt; 15% of hea\nl\nthcare-ass\no\nciated infections are caused by MDR bacteria, while in Europe in 2007, it was estimated that ca. 25,000 patients died with an infection caused by and infection due to MDR \nbacteria\n3\n. \n2. What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?H\nos\npit\nal based reporting of resistant\n infections has\n improved \nmarkedly\n over the last decade\n. \nHowever, such reporting is frequently limited to a small number of pathogens (e.g. \nStaphylococcus aureus, E.coli \nand\n glycopeptide-\nresistant enterococci) and \nindications (e.g. bacteraemia) as is exemplified by the mandatory surveillance program in England\n4\n. Information \nrelating to complex\n infections associated with a significant risk of antibiotic resistance, \n(e.g. \nimplant-associated infections\n)\n \nis\n not generall\ny collected.\nIn the wider community \nthe \npicture of in\ncidence, prevalence, mortality \nand cost of resistance\n remains incomplete\n. \nE\nnhanced surveillance \noutside the\n healthcare setting \nwill\n also \nbe \nessential if we are to \nmeasure and \nunderstand \nthe impact\n of widespread antibiotic use in domestic, agricultural and industrial settings (e.g. sewage treatment). \n3. Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?F\nor pharmaceutical companies\n, \nthe development of antibiotics does not represent a\nn\n attractive commercial\n proposition\n when compared to new chemical entities in other areas of medicine (e.g. cardiology, respiratory medici\nne, rheumatology\n,\n cancer,\n chronic diseases\n). \nNew approaches \nand incentives \nare required \nto \nensure continued \nindustry commitment to the \ndevelopment \nof\n new antibiotics. These could include:\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges to the \nr\negulatory environment \n- \nreduc\ning\n the time interval from discovery to licensi\nng:\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges to a\nntibiotic\n pricing\n, \nto reflect their value compared with other treatments (e.g. cancer drugs)\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges \nto\n the practice of automatically restricting new antibiotics \nfor\n salvage therapy. \nThe use of \nnew\n \nantibiotics\n as\n first-line therapy \n(\nor earl\ny\n in the treatment path\n) for serious infections \nsuch as those caused by MRSA \nmay\n reduce the risk of resistance and reduce healthcare associated costs\n5\n,\n6\n, \n \n4. \nWhat measures (including behavioral change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens? Infection control \nhas played a critical role in\n managing \nantibiotic resistance\n in clinical settings\n. \nG\novernment\n targets \nhave\n increas\ned\n accountability and awareness and redu\nc\ned\n cases of MRSA and \nC\n.\n \ndifficile\n across\n NHS Trusts.\n \n \nHowever, \nwhile highly successful, \nthe scope of the\nse\n targets has been limited to a small number of pathogens and indications. Therefore, it is essential that\n \nN\national performance measures \nshould be reassessed to ensure that they are appropriately targeted\n and take into account the changing environment in te\nrms of causative pathogens and infections where there is a high risk of antibiotic resistance.   \nWhile s\ntewardship \nplays a central role\n in \nreducing the risk of antibiotic resistance\n and\n superinfections, there are areas where stewardship can be improved to achieve the desired outcomes. \nWhile t\nhe current \nslogan\n “the right drug, the right dose, at \nthe right time and the right duration”\n \nprovides a helpful illustration of what stewardship pro\ngrams \nshould look like, it does not include the measurement of outcomes. There is a clear need for all CCGs and hospital to have:\nThe measurement of outcomes needs to be undertaken by the clinical teams and \nthrough \nengagement with national clinical groups \nin specialties such as acute medicine, emergency medicine, orthopaedics, trauma and GPs.\nFurthermore, t\nhe current stewardship initiatives \ndo not\n address many fundamental issues associated with antibiotic resistance. To effectively address antibiotic resistance\n at a patient \nlevel requires\n:\nAntibiotics are not “wonder drugs” \nin the management of complex infections \nbut can achieve\n a remarkably high level of success\n, \nif the\n most effective antibi\notics\n are\n combined with the correct surgery and\n/or\n source control of the infected site\n7\n, \n8\n. \nThere have been significant advances in diagnostic \ntechniques that should be employed to identify the causative pathogens and direct antibiotic treatment more \neffectively\n9\n, 1\n0\n. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach is increasingly being seen as best practice in the treatment of complex infections such as \nendocarditis, \nprosthetic joint and vascular graft infection\n7\n. \nThe education and training of healthcare professionals is critical to success in addressing antibiotic resistance to ensure they have \na good understanding of pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance \nand best practices in the use of antibacterial drugs.    \nTher\ne are potential deleterious consequences of a simplistic view of antibiotic stewardship, namely\n,\n restricting the newer and more expensive antibiotics in favour of \n“cheaper” and generic antibiotics\n for “salvage” use. These consequences \ncan include \nincreasing the overall treatment course\n and associated risks for\n, morbidity\n and mortality\n to the patient,\n \nselecting resistant mutants\n and increasing the overall healthcare associated costs.\nInternational programs such as the Surv\niv\ning Sepsis Campaign\n1\n1\n adv\nocate giving the most potent and broad spectrum agent(s) as initial therapy in patients with suspected sepsis and then \nd\ne-escalating to \nantimicrobials\n with a narrower spectrum\n (if appropriate), once \nthe underlying pathogen, resistance patterns, and the pat\nient’s res\nponse to treatment become clear.\n This approach has been shown to deliver better outcomes in these circumstances.\n \n5. What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?Through the \nactivities of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and its initiative Antibiotic Action\n1\n2\n \nthe UK is at the vanguard of initiatives to address antibiotic resistance.\n This forum allows multiple stakeholders to identify, discuss and address key issues in the research, regulatory and \nmarket\n environments, and \nis\n regenerat\ning \ninterest in the discovery and development of new antibiotic agents.  \nU\nnder the leadership and dir\nection of Professor Laura Piddock, \nAntibiotic Action \nhas been highly proactive in reaching out to important\n individuals and organisations\n in the UK and internationally\n,\n to address the serious problem of antibiotic resistance\n. \nAs a global pharmaceutical company, Novartis recognises the international dimension of the challenge of antibiotic resistance \nand is greatly encourage by \nthe publication of the\n Government’s AMR \nStrategy \nand the impetus provided by the C\nMO\n’s interest in the\n subject. The UK \nis \nidea\nl\nl\ny\n position\ned\n to assume a leading role in tackling the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. \nHowever, a\nny changes implemented in the UK will need to be adopted internationally to maximize their impact and for progress to be ma\nde. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?The Government’s five ye\nar\n AMR\n Strategy \nprovides\n a useful platform to start\n addressing some key issues in the area of antimicrobial resistance\n and \nis generally balanced in its assessment of\n the challenge\n. \n \nIf delivered, t\nhe three strategic aims would go a significant way to address\ning\n the considerable c\nhallenges presented by antibiotic resistance\n. Novartis were pleased to note that antibiotic stewardship (subject to the caveats presented in the document above), the urgent need for the discovery and developments of new antibiotics, diagnostics and novel t\nherapies and approaches are core themes within the strategy. \nThe Strategy recognises the importance of improving knowledge amongst healthcare professionals and the \ngeneral public to try and ensure that current treatment are preserved and used appropriately\n. These statements and objectives need to go further to include the recognition that education and training of healthcare professionals \nto gain a far greater understanding of pathogenesis. Moreover, the importance of changes in current practice to enhance \nand \ndevelop the\n role of multidisciplinary teams in managing complex infections needs to be included. \nT\nhe Strategy\n \nplaces\n s\nignificant obligations on industry to produce new treatments\n but w\nithout offering re\nciprocal commitments\n to improving the \nrestrictive\n \ncommercial environment\n.\n  \nT\nhe Government must make concrete commitments to how they plan to \nanalyse\n the challenges \nassociated with AMR further and translate these, in collaboration with stakeholders, into initiatives that will drive real change.  In addre\nssing the commercial environment, \nthe High Level Steering Group must outline how it plans to address some of the key challenges which it started to identify in the Strategy.\n \nThe Strategy recommends a substantial and extended research program to \nbetter und\nerstand resistance, discover new therapies and improve surveillance of antibiotic resistance. This will clearly need new and substantial funding. With reference to the concerns about the significant obligation on \nindustry inferred\n in the Strategy, will new central (Government) funding be made available?\n&#xa0;\nFocus on Vaccines &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Relevant FeatureAntibioticsVaccinesTherapeutic/prophylactic\nMostly therapeutic\nMostly prophylactic\nCoverage and specificity\nBroad, indiscriminate\nNarrow, specific\nEmergence of resistance\nCommon\nUncommon\nSelective \npressure\nHigh\nLow\nTime to develop resistance\nShort\nLong\nDurability\nRestricted to the time of treatment\nDuration of protection persists from several months up to life-long\nDuration/frequency of exposure\nSome patients spend weeks/months on antibiotics, \nwith the potential for prolonged sub-therapeutic exposure\nSub-optimal schedules or responses can lead to breakthrough infections\nCross-class impact\nPotential for a single antibiotic to drive plasmid-mediated resistance to multiple antibiotics across diffe\nrent classes\nImpact of the vaccine is generally restricted to a particular type of organism, although removal of nasopharyngeal carriage can allow other types of organisms to occupy the niche\nBeneficial herd effect\nNo\nYes\nPrevention of perinatal infectio\nns\nYes\nYes (maternal immunisation)\nPrevention of cancer\nNo\nYes (HBV, HPV)\nControl of distribution\nLess tightly controlled and monitored distribution (prescribed across the breadth of the health system with variable scrutiny, control and guideline \nadherence\nGenerally distributed through the immunisation programme, and the impact closely monitored\nCost\nFew ₤s to ₤1000s\nFew ₤s to ₤100s\nAdapted from\n Mishra \net al\n \n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis represents a 93% reduction in the incidence of invasive serogroup C disease over the first 4 years after the introduction of the vaccine\n17\n \n&#xa0;19921996/19971998/ 19992004/ 200520102011/ 20122012Hib meningitis\n18\n871\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n30\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPneumococcal meningitis\n18,19\n&#xa0;\n398*\n&#xa0;\n252*\n&#xa0;\n&lt;100**\n&#xa0;\nMeningococcal \ndisease\n \n20\n \n(meningitis and septicaemia) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2773\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n766\n&#xa0;\nIn the USA, a \ndecrease in 87% in antibiotic resistant disease caused by vaccine serotypes\n was reported \nafter the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\n. \n21 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;ReferencesOctober 2013\nDeclaration of authors’ interestsE.
