"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Resus Technology Ltd (HOTCCS09)&#xa0;\nExecutive summary.&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIntroduction.&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nFirst\n it has about a 20% higher efficiency (about 80% achievable double that of thermal coal) and second carbon (or carbon fuels) are much easier to store than hydrogen. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe waste product fro a DCFC is a stream pure CO2 so no additional capt\nure technology is required, although \ncompression and storage are still required. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide a mechanism for massive energy storage combined with on demand power generation which can support renewable power generation.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide a more effic\nient power train for large scale transport (e.g. shipping) that could include carbon capture to reduce, possibly eliminate, carbon emissions.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide a much cleaner and much more efficient waste to energy conversion from non-recyclable waste plastic compar\ned to incineration.\n&#xa0;\nIn short the DCFC is a disruptive technology for clean power generation form carbon, or carbon based, fuels.&#xa0;About DCFC Technology&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRecommendationsSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
