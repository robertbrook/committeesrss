"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nChicycle\n (CYS 055)\n&#xa0; ChiCycle\n is a campaign group in \nChichester\n.\n&#xa0;\nChichester\n is a small city with lots of \ngyratories\n and large roundabouts put in the last century and with the increase of traffic, these junctions are ver\ny scary and off-putting to\n even\n seasoned cyclists.  You \nliterally \ntake your life in your hands when you cycle around our city.\n&#xa0;\nChichester\n’s cycling infrastructure has not been improved\n/maintained\n since we started our campaign in 2010.\n&#xa0;\nThere are plans to improve 2 of the junctions\n with LSTF monies but progress is very slow\n and the proposals adopted have not been approved by the Cycling Embassy of GB or the Dutch Cycling Embassy\n, or discussed and approved by the local Cycle Forum in their current form\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere are no plans to improve\n any of our other junctions, only two of our main roads have any provision for cyclists\n and one of these puts cyclists onto a very narrow pavement which creates conflict between pedestrians and cyclists\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe would propose that proper, segregated cycle rout\nes/paths are urgently requ\nired on our major arterials\n to improve cycling safety\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe need proper enforcement of our new 20mph limits by the police to make sure our residential streets are safe for cyclists and the new limits are being kept to.\n The police a\nre very reluctant to enforce our new limits due to limited resources.\n&#xa0;\nWe would also like to draw attention to Network Rail who were remarkably unconcerned when it was pointed out that a bridge, replacing a level crossing, would likely result in cyclists t\naking a fast moving main road which is more dangerous than the crossing they were hoping to close (the bridge is also believed to be \nnon compliant with government Local Transport Notes in several respects: notably not catering for mounted cyclists, expecte\nd number of users, and over tight bends which fail to properly accommodate tandems and cargo bikes). Therefore when the crossing closes, cyclists will likely be diverted away from NCR 2 onto a fast flowing dual carriageway.  \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
