default1.1 
defaultThe European Space Agency is an intergovernmental organisation
default. With its predecessors, in which the United Kingdom was a founding Member State, it has
default 
defaultalmost 
default5
default0 years of experience
default. 
defaultThe Agency has grown from 10 
defaultMember States in 1975 
defaultto
default currently 
default20 Member States
default,
default 
defaultof which 18 
default(the exceptions being Switzerland and Norway) 
defaultare also Member States of the  European Union. 
defaultB
defaultetween them, those 18 account for 98 per cent of the EU’s GNP. 
defaultThe Agency operates under the Convention which 
defaultwas opened for signature
default in 1975.
default1.2 
defaultESA 
defaulthas cooperation agreements with all current EU Member States not members of ESA, except for Bulgaria, with whom negotiations are 
defaultin progress
default. 
defaultCanada 
defaulthas a long-standing Cooperation Agreement and 
defaulttakes part in 
defaultseveral ESA programmes
default.
defaultResources and instruments
default1.
default3
default 
defaultThe budget for ESA programmes in 2013 is €3.4 billion; programmes managed for other European institutional partners will amount to
default an additional
default €0.8
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion. Total expenditure will therefore be €4.2 billion. 
defaultSlide 1 in 
defaultAppendix
default 1 shows a breakdown of programme income and institutional partner income  according to the source.
default

default4
default 
defaultThe Agency’s programmes are funded in two main ways
default.
default 
defaultMandatory activities (15%) are funded by all Member States at GNP level
default 
default 
defaultThe budgets for Mandatory activities are determined by a decision taken very 3-5 years on the Level of Resources. This provides a degree of medium term planning and allows decisions to be taken on missions within the Science Programme
default to allow for a suitable mix of cornerstone missions and those of a more moderate size
default. I also 
defaultprovid
defaultes
default reassurance to all sub-sectors in the scientific community that their needs will be catered for in the programme.
default1.
default5
default 
defaultOptional programmes (85%) are funded on a voluntary basis, programme per programme (currently around 60 different programmes), according to the interest of the Member States (the number of participating States in a programme ranges from 1 to 20). This system provides substantial flexibility, both in devising programmes and in allowing each Member State to set its own priorities. For example, the UK has
default historically
default 
defaultchosen
default to focus its investment in 
defaultprimarily in 
defaultcommercial and scientific 
defaultsatellite development
default. 
defaultProgramme decisions are taken only by the Participating States and Council 
defaultdecided recently to introduce weighted voting according to the level of contribution, for certain types of decision. 
default1.
default6
default 
defaultFor Optional activities, a 
defaultfinancial 
defaultenvelope is agreed at the time of subscription. 
defaultThis commits Participating States to complete the programme, subject to costs remaining within the envelope plus a contingency margin. With some satellite developments taking a decade, followed by an exploitation period of similar duration, such commitments are essential. The Optional programmes also ensure 
defaultthat
default, from the Member State point of view, the Agency focuses carefully on devising attractive programmes that 
defaultfully 
defaultmeet Member State needs.
default1.
default7
default 
defaultIn the area of telecommunications, almost all programmes now entail partnerships with industry and/or satellite operators
default, under which Participating States fund and bear the risks of technology development and the operator takes the risk to use these new technologies to open new markets.
default The complexity which this adds to the programme is more than offset by both the additional resources brought by the third party and the strong commercial focus. In addition, the involvement of an operator in a successful R&amp;D mission 
defaultprovides a strong opportunity for the manufacturing to build a lasting supplier-customer relationship.
default UK companies such as 
defaultAstrium
default, Avanti and 
defaultInmarsat
default have already participated in such public-private partnerships
default – 
defaultHylas
default launched in 2011 and 
defaultAlphasat
default which will be launched in July this year
default. 
default1.
default8
default A unique aspect of ESA, and the bedrock of the achievements described 
defaultlater
default 
defaultin this evidence
default, is that Article VII of its Convention requires that it should elaborate and apply an industrial policy designed in particular to: 
default“a. meet the requirements of the European space programme and the coordinated national space programmes in a 
defaultcost-effective defaultmanner; 
defaultb. improve the 
defaultworld-wide competitiveness defaultof European industry by maintaining and developing space technology and by encouraging the rationalisation and development of an industrial structure appropriate to market requirements, making use in the first place of the existing industrial potential of all Member States; 
defaultc. ensure that all 
defaultMember States participate in an equitable mannerdefault, having regard to their financial contribution, in implementing the European space programme and in the associated development of space technology; in particular the Agency shall, for the execution of its programmes, grant preference to the fullest extent possible to industry in all Member States (…); 
defaultd. exploit the advantages of 
defaultfree competitive bidding defaultin all cases, except where this would be incompatible with other defined objectives of industrial policy.”
defaultOrganisation and centres 
default1.
default9
default ESA’s technical centres contain expertise which aims to be world leading in their field and is recognised as such. This expertise provides the management capability to support industry in delivering scientific satellites of unparalleled complexity and commercial satellites capable of competing in world markets. ESA is an R&amp;D programme management organisation first and foremost, where most international organisations are administrative by nature.

default17 sci
defaultentific satellites in operation. Slides 2 and 3

default 
defaultThrough ESA, the Member States have created and maintained a highly competitive industrial sector. 
defaultThe share of commercial sales and exports in the European total space
default manufacturing 
default turnover has grown from 28% in 1991 to 45% in 2
default010. 
defaultESA has been responsible for the development of the Ariane 1, Ariane 2/3, Ariane 4, Ariane 5 and Vega launchers. The Ariane family celebrated their 
default200th launch in February 2011
default and 
defaultare the world reference, 
defaulttaking
default some
default 50 per cent of the available global market for commercial satellite launches.
default 
default1.
default12
default 
defaultEurope’s share in the worldwide commercial telecom market has grown in the past decade from 19% to 33%. In
default the
default 
defaultgeostationary 
defaultsatellite 
defaultmarket
default, Europe has improved its worldwide 
defaultmarket share: in 
defaultsatellite platforms from 20% in the 1992-2001 period to 28% in the 2002-2011 period;
default in
default payloads from 22% to 32% for the same periods.
default 
defaultAll non-geostationary communication satellite constellations (Iridium NEXT, O3b Networks and 
defaultGlobalstar
default 2nd Generation) have been captured by European industry which 
defaultwill
default deliver most of the associated equipment value (2/3 on 
defaultGlobalstar
default 2, more than 50% on Iridium NEXT).
default 
defaultThe global satellite industry itself posted average annual growth of 9 % for the period 2006 through 2011
default, and despite the financial crisis a growth of 5% in both 2010 and 2011.
default1.
default13
default 
defaultEvery billion US $ spent in by the US government gives rise to about 1.5 tonnes of institutional satellites in space and 1.25 tonnes of commercial satellites manufactured in the US. For Europe (i.e. ESA, EU and national programme expenditure) the corresponding figures are 3.5 tonnes and 4 tonnes respectively.
defaultRelative weaknesses
default1.14 
defaultThe ESA Council at Ministerial Level meets only when required, normally every 3-4 years. Their discussions focus on major policy changes within the Agency and major new programmes. Member States are in most cases represented by the minister responsible for research. In the past, this restricted the Agency’s ability to embed space systems into the development and delivery of European and national policies which would benefit from utilising space and to influence the development of policies which affect the sector, such as international trade policy and frequency allocation.
default1.15 
defaultIn contrast, the EU addresses a wide range of issues through its Councils, which generally meet several times per year, allowing political momentum to be built. From the mid-1990s onwards, the Agency has therefore sought to cooperate with the EU at all levels. This cooperation has borne fruit in many areas, the most prominent of which are the joint developments in the areas of Global Navigation Satellite Systems – Galileo and EGNOS – and Earth monitoring – GMES/Copernicus, and the decisions of the EU to fund these as operational systems. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultAs noted above, the relationship between the EU and ESA has grown substantially 
defaultduring the past decades, 
default 
defaultbased on a symbiotic relationship between ESA’s technical and managerial capacities and the EU’s political strengths and requirements for space infrastructure to meet its needs for space services. 
defaultAt a political level, 
defaulta turning point
default can be traced back to the “common resolution
default,
default”
default similarly worded resolutions
default passed in both Councils in 1998, initiated by the UK EU Presidency.
default This was followed up in 2000 by a further common resolution on a European Space Strategy, when the EU Research Council and the ESA Council at Ministerial
default Level
default met 
defaulttogether in Brussels
default, 
defaultunder the chairmanship of 
defaultthe UK
default,
default chairing the ESA
default,
default 
defaultand France, chairing the EU
default. 
default 
default2.2 
defaultThe first significant cooperation at a programmatic level was in 
defaultthe area of navigation, with EGNOS followed by 
defaultthe Galileo In-Orbit Validation Programme
default. The latter was approved 
defaultin the EU Transport Council, signalling the success in convincing ministers of the value of space beyond ESA’s 
defaultresearch 
defaultconstituency.
default2.3 
defaultA broader context was given to the cooperation through the
default Framework Agreement between the EU and ESA, which came into force in May 2004 and has twice been extended, most recently to 201
default6
default.
default Among other things, that Agreement has given rise to the European Space Policy and to political orientations and resolutions in the 8 meetings of the Space Council to date. 
default2.
default4
default However, there has been a marked change in the partnership since the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union came into force in December 2009.  The EU’s space-related activities over the next 7 year Multiannual Financial Framework period will substantially be determined by the regulations proposed by the European Commission on the Global Navigation Satellite System, Horizon 2020 and (one anticipates) Copernicus. These regulations will also determine ESA’s role in these EU programmes, working with a delegation on navigation and in a cooperation for Copernicus. Both Galileo and Copernicus now move into the exploitation phase and the funds available for space science and technology under Horizon 2020, as compared to those available in the Seventh Framework Programme, are substantially increased, emphasising the need for effective coordination.
default2.
default5
default 
defaultAccordingly, the ESA DG proposed to the ESA Council at Ministerial Level to institute a process to determine the evolution of ESA, reflecting the overall evolution of European governance and aiming at making ESA the space agency that best serves Europe. This process would be aimed at increasing the value of ESA for its Member States and Europe. 
defaultHe saw t
defaulthe core elements of this evolution, based on partnerships, as: an appropriate relationship with the EU and its institutions; a growing number of Member States in ESA; a need to take into account the interests of larger and smaller contributors; and a revised relationship with the increasingly mature industrial space sector. 
default2.
default6
default 
defaultThe ministers accepted this proposal and at their meeting in Naples, Italy on 21 November 2012 approved the political declaration ‘Towards the European Space Agency that Best Serves Europe’.
default In this they
default“[
defaultREQUEST
defaultED]
default this further evolution of ESA to take full benefit of and encompass: 
default(i)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA’s capabilities and achievements based on an intergovernmental framework offering to its Member States an efficient framework of cooperation for implementing their competence in space in pooling their objectives and resources;
default(ii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe EU competence in space, in accommodating the consequences in ESA’s operation and thus providing efficient programme management of EU funded programmes under EU rules; 
defaultwith the objective of providing the most appropriate framework in which to develop the space capabilities and resources at European level for Research and Development.”
defaultThe Council also
default“[MANDATED] in view of preparing the decisions to be taken by ESA Member States on the further evolution of ESA: 
default2.
default7
default 
defaultIn parallel to the preparation of the ESA Ministerial Council, the European Commission prepared a communication on ‘Establishing appropriate relations between the EU and the European Space Agency’ in which it set out its proposals for analysing possible scenarios for this relationship and doing this in close cooperation with ESA. More recently, the European Commission released a communication on EU Space Industrial Policy. An effective industrial policy is clearly important to the space sector
default; it is closely linked to both the funding sources and to
default the evolution of the relationship between ESA and the EU.

default8
default 
defaultThis process 
defaultof evaluating scenarios
default 
defaultis ongoing with the objective of enabling the ESA DG to bring forward proposals to the next meeting of the ESA Council at Ministerial Level, expected to take place in 2014.
default Such proposals would be discussed with the Member States Delegations during the 6-8 months of preparations for that Council meeting.
default The optimum scenario 
defaultwould 
defaultbe one which 
defaultmost effectively 
defaultmaintains the strengths of the ESA system while significantly improving the efficiency of its relationship with the EU. The options being studied will be measured against this goal.
default 
default3.1 
defaultThe EU Multi
defaultannual F
defaultinancial Framework and the proposed EU Horizon 2020 programme have not yet completed the approval processes in the Council and the Parliament of the EU
default and thus
default have not yet been brought into force. Nevertheless,
default the Select Committee is addressing one of the most difficult issues faced by ESA and the EU: how to achieve complementarity between the 
defaultcontent of the 
defaulttwo European level technology programmes, while respecting the decision making 
defaultprocesses in each organisation
default and capitalising on the strengths of each
default. T
defaulthe ESA DG and his directors are engaged in detailed discussions with the European Commission on 
defaultthis and the ESA DG will start by assessing the lessons learned from past cooperation under the Seventh Framework Programme
default.
default4.1 
defaultAs
default a matter 
defaultof principle,
default the ESA DG 
defaultdoes not 
defaultcomment
default on the actions or performance of one of ESA’s Member States
default.
default5.1 
defaultSpace is an investment designed to achieve many different benefits, over many timescales. 
defaultReturn on investment can take the form of immediate contracts, the development of an industrial capability able to secure commercial sales, the growth of a services sector in satellite applications and value-added services and the strengthening of a nation’s scientific base. Measuring all of these benefits and relating them back to the original investment in an intellectually coherent way is a challenge faced by all nations which invest in space. 
default5.2 
defaultESA and its Member States take 
defaultmany 
defaultactions 
defaultspecifically designed 
defaultto maximise the potential for economic return
default, most notably the PPPs described above
default. 
defaultA
default recent 
defaultaddition to these 
defaulthas to been to introduce a 
defaultnumber 
defaultof Business Incubation Centres designed to bridge the gap between an idea and getting 
defaulta
default technology transfer project off the ground, and assisting its development into a viable business. 
defaultOne s
defaultuch  centre is being established in Harwell, managed by 
defaultSTFC Innovations Limited.
default5.3 
defaultThe Agency
default pursues an
default industrial policy 
defaultwhose goals are
default set out in the response to question 1 above. One facet of this
default is that the contracts secured by the industries 
defaultin 
defaulteach Member State should be proportionate to that Member State’s contributions, after taking account of the internal costs of the Agency and taking into account weighting factors relating to the technological content of the work concerned. This is expressed as a return coefficient where the 
defaultideal
default is a return of 1.
default5.
default4
default 
defaultHowever, the majority of ESA’s programme contracts are awarded in competition, or as follow-on contracts to earlier work assigned after competition. 
defaultC
defaultompetition is designed to ensure value for money, world class scientific missions, efficient satellite-based services and, through the engagement of PPPs, effective global competitors in Europe.
default5.5 
defaultWhere, as result of competition
default alone
default, the performance of the industries of a Member State fall
defaults
default below 
defaulta certain minimum, that Member State is entitled to special measures designed both to improve the short term statistical return and the long term ability of 
defaultits
default industries to compete. The statistics on which the return coefficients are based are also discontinued periodically. The statistics 
defaultare planned to be discontinued at the end of 2014, when the UK’s return is forecast to be within the acceptable range
default, as it was when the statistics were last discontinued in 1999
default. 
default6.1 
defaultIn 2008, ESA Member States began the Space Situational Awareness Programme
default, in which the UK is one of the Participating States
default.  
defaultUnder “Space Situational Awareness” are gathered the activities aimed at protecting ground and space infrastructure from the 
defaultpotential threats from space
default:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCosmic radiations
default that can influence the functioning and the reliability of space and ground systems and services and en
defaultdanger property or human health, collectively known as Space Weather;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNear Earth Objects
default defaultwhich can potentially impact the Earth and, depending on their size and hitting point, produce considerable damage

defaultSpace Debris
default defaultthat pose the threat of collision

default with active spacecraft, including potentially catastrophic collisions
default, and which can be monitored through

default6.2 
defaultSpace debris is considered to consist of a wide range of
default man-made objects (decommissioned satellites, spent upper stages, launch adaptors, lens covers , fragment generated from explosions or collisions in orbit dust from solid rocket motors firings, droplets of coolant liquids…
default). For example, o
defaultn

defaultd
defaultebris pose a serious threat to 
defaultthe 
defaultISS - in particular those between 1-10 cm which cannot be detected and which are too strong for the protection shield.
default6.3 
defaultESA has been active in 
defaultR&amp;D and operations related to space debris 
defaultsince the 
defaultmid-1980s
default and has built up 
defaultoperational knowledge
default defaultthrough its Space Debris Office at ESOC with an expertise that is unique in Europe. The Office provides operational support to ESA missions on collision avoidance, contingencies, post-mission disposal, and re-entry forecasts with world-class accuracy based on US-provided data.
default It also provides information to the authorities in ESA Member States and the EU authorities. 
default6.4 
defaultMore recently, in order to strengthen and focus debris mitigation measures, the ESA DG has established in 2011 a set of activities, named the clean space initiative, which prepare technical solutions for environmental issues. Among these investigations are also the analysis for active debris 
defaultremoval concepts. The clean space initiative is thus working closely together with agencies as well as industry to safeguard the space environment and at the same time foster European competitiveness in the field of related new and innovative technologies.

defaultA2.1 ESA has 8 operational sites: Headquarters (FR), European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) (NL), European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) (DE), European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) (IT),  European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) (ES), European Astronaut Centre (EAC) (DE), 
defaultRedu
default (BE), and the latest, Harwell (UK). In addition ESA owns the launch and production facilities and has teams deployed in Europe’s Spaceport at 
defaultKourou
default (FR Guiana) and in the CNES site in Toulouse. It also has offices in Brussels, Washington, Houston and Moscow and a network of ground stations distributed over 4 continents. The first five named sites are categorised as establishments. ESA employs about 2200 staff and a similar number of contractors in support capacities.
