[[[Written Evidence from the Local Government Association [PUB0015]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government. We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.&#xa0;1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government. We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The LGA is advocating a radical new approach which provides solutions to how we can deliver public services within an ever-tightening fiscal environment. The LGA’s Rewiring Public Services is an ambitious programme which would allow local authorities, through greater local autonomy, to help communities to meet people’s future needs and aspirations and help generate economic growth. 2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Democratically elected councillors must be at the heart of any programme of public service reform. Councillors are crucial in reinvigorating local governance, ensuring strong democratic accountability, and leading local government to make a difference, deliver and be trusted.&#xa0;2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Central government can learn much from how councils have delivered efficiencies and come together to share services, not just with other councils but with organisations in all areas of public services. However, councils could achieve much more if they were freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and the direction of artificial Whitehall silos. &#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.People increasingly feel that English democracy is facing a crisis. Disillusionment with politics, frustration over unequal distribution of power in the United Kingdom, and low levels of trust in central government have led us to a place where the current model of public services is unsustainable. However well-intentioned Government reforms might be, it is ultimately local leadership that can best deliver economic growth, transformed public services and a rejuvenated democracy. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.2.In Rewiring Public Services, the LGA has set out an approach to public service transformation that will give local people a clear say in the important matters that face them and their communities, and a local vote that matters once more. The challenges England faces require a different approach that reflects the needs of local communities, based on joined-up services, economic growth and a new democratic deal. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;4.1.Community budgets look at the whole system rather than individual services; they are rooted in evidence; and they demand new models of investment to set up and sustain the most effective interventions. Independent analysis for the LGA of the work of the four community budget pilot areas showed that, if their proposals on health and social care, troubled families and work and skills were implemented across the country, up to £20 billion could be saved over five years. The four areas expect to see a range of wider benefits. For example Essex is redesigning its vocational skills such that it will create 8,000 additional apprenticeships by 2020, with training better aligned to current and future vacancies in the area. &#xa0;4.2.What is clear is the community budget led public service reform agenda offers a much greater potential for ensuring better value for money and improved services. It is therefore essential that all Whitehall Departments buy into this approach and make positive moves to devolve budgets and responsibility to the local level to enable local public service providers to bring resources together to deliver more efficient public services with improved outcomes.&#xa0;4.3.These findings are supported by an extensive body of evidence from councils, for example through the customer-led transformation programme and innovative procurement by councils following the introduction of the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012.

[[[from Whitehall and into the hands of citizens?]]]&#xa0;5.1.Public services in England face challenges which require a fundamental response at both national and local level. Services must be transformed through local leadership by rebuilding democratic participation, rewiring public services, and revitalising the economy. The risks of staying the same far outweigh those of leading a transformation that ensures public services are effective, efficient and locally responsive.&#xa0;5.2.The role of elected councillors is crucial in ensuring communities can access responsive, effective, and accountable services. Local government could do much more to rewire public services and rebuild democratic participation. A fundamental redesign of the national framework of local democracy would ensure decisions about local arrangements are made by people who are accountable to local voters. Reinvigorating this democratic relationship will give communities a meaningful say in the delivery of their services, no matter what form those services take.

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.Local authorities are crucial in delivering the services people value. The Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 has added impetus to how councils and other commissioners consider their procurement processes to support a wide range of providers depending on the outcomes required by that particular service: 65 per cent of councils have already adapted their processes to take account of the Act. &#xa0;6.2.Councils are however frustrated by some national schemes. For instance, the Work Programme should help councils and their partners better support those who are hardest to reach. Despite good intentions, the model was designed, commissioned, implemented and delivered in isolation and at speed, preventing councils and local partners from offering expertise on client groups. In most cases, it has had the effect of providers operating in isolation from one another and local partners. Critically, the model has not led to successful outcomes for those it is meant to help. March 2013 figures suggest all Work Programme providers have failed to support Employment Support Allowance (ESA) claimants, averaging 5.3% against contracted levels of 16.5%. June 2013 figures have not improved. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.3.If given the freedoms and responsibilities, local government can make public services effective, efficient and locally responsive, through place-based public service budgets. Many councils have lead the way in opening up service delivery in relation to personal budgets, for example through ‘catalogues’, guides and targeted websites. Councils also work with the users and other stakeholders themselves before setting up contracts. For example Central Bedfordshire’s work on procuring domiciliary care, or the innovative approaches undertaken by the Co-operative Councils Network. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.4.Councils have a successful record of working with their communities. Community Rights are one part of a whole host of relationships, activities, and strategies at play across local government. Data from government indicates levels of interest in the Right to Bid appear high. Many councils are working positively with local community groups and parish councils to implement the Right effectively, for example through Swale Borough Council’s ‘Localism Prospectus’.

[[[ ]]]Anecdotal evidence of the Rights to Build and Challenge suggests that the uptake of these Rights is much lower. &#xa0;6.5.However the LGA has argued a formal Community Right to Challenge process being used is a sign that local relationships with community groups are not working as well as they might be. A better way to go about the provision of services by parishes or community groups is as part of a strong set of local relationships and a good commissioning strategy. The use of legal rights is a last resort to be avoided if at all possible. This is because many councils are taking proactive approaches to engage positively with their local communities, such ‘Speak Out Sutton’ and Kirklees’ ‘It’s Time to Talk’.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1.Councils recognise the impetus of reducing funding and increasing demand as being an imperative for working together. Ninety-five per cent of councils now share services, resulting in at least £278 million of efficiency savings. Sharing services is business as usual for councils; they are now building on that expertise to deliver more effective outcomes for local communities by working across the public, private, and voluntary and community sector. The LGA and the National Association for Local Councils (NALC) have also produced a publication illustrating how principal and town and parish councils are working together to best meet the needs of their communities. &#xa0;7.2.There is nevertheless room for improvement in the way central and local government work together. The current model of local government in the context of a highly centralised national state will not serve for much longer. While there are some instances of more joined-up working, for example the Commissioning Academy programme or the Whitehall secondees to the community budgets areas, they are still too few. The LGA is calling for a new framework for public services which is able to be both strategic and locally responsive and which is supported by a more grown-up relationship between local and central government.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.3.Whitehall’s siloed structures and at times conflicting policy objectives can mean councils find it unnecessarily difficult to improve outcomes for local people. This has been seen, for example, in working to reduce re-offending, where councils are regularly frustrated at a lack of engagement from some Government departments, such as the Department of Health, which are failing to recognise their key role in reducing crime, for example through its funding of treatment for people with alcohol or drug addictions. The LGA is calling for a Crime Reduction Board that would allow central government to replicate nationally the success achieved by councils and their partners, including the police and health services, through the innovative multi-agency community budget areas.&#xa0;7.4.It is local government, through its democratically elected councillors, that is best placed to lead rewired public services. This is because they are closest to those affected by the decisions they make. A transformed and independent local government can make public services effective, efficient, and locally responsive. &#xa0;7.5.The LGA proposes that alongside a wide-ranging localisation of public services, remaining national functions be brought together into a single England Office. This would not only reduce bureaucracy and red tape but also remove the artificial silos that promote duplication, waste, and conflicting policy drivers. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1.The LGA supports councils in their ambitions to find innovative ways to deliver public services. Our Future Councils and Creative Councils programmes show how councils are taking the lead in innovative public service delivery in everything from looked after children and adult social care to energy supply and work readiness. &#xa0;

[[[How do we make sure that all citizens are able to influence public services?]]]&#xa0;9.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Councils play a crucial role in ensuring that services are delivered in a joined up way that is accountable, maximises efficiencies and provides capacity to support individuals in exercising choice. &#xa0;9.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The LGA’s Rewiring Public Services campaign puts choice at the heart of our vision for health and social care by proposing “personal wellbeing budgets” to provide choice and control to individuals for the services and support they require to improve their health, wellbeing and independence, enabling people to make choices that sustain their independence&#xa0;9.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent announcement of £3.8 billion worth of funding to ensure closer integration between health and social is an opportunity to give some of the most vulnerable people in our society control, placing them at the centre of their own care and support and, in doing so, providing them with a better service and better quality of life. The LGA is committed to helping councils work with Clinical Commissioning Groups to seize this opportunity to do something radically different. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;10.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Councillors have the democratic legitimacy to ensure that service providers who fail to deliver services are properly held to account. This is because they have a key leadership role in localised decision-making and service delivery. &#xa0;&#xa0;10.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Safeguards are also created by improving contract and supply chain management. The New EU procurement rules will allow councils to take into account relevant skills and experience of consultants and will enable councils to exclude suppliers with a poor track record. Taken together these are significant steps towards robust safeguarding mechanisms against poor performance. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]11.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commissioners learn best when they are working together on shared challenges. Building in learning support to programmes such as community budgets and Our Place! is important in making sure that best practice is shared within and between sectors. The LGA is a champion of sharing learning from areas taking a community budgeting approach. We support the Commissioning Academy which brings together senior commissioners from across different parts of the public sector to build a shared understanding of good practice in commissioning. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]11.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, it is not simply a matter of taking good practice from one area and replicating it in another. Each area has its own geographical, demographic and political context, which will be reflected in its commissioning and market support approaches. Councils, through their elected councillors, are best placed to understand and respond to that context, and to take the lead in public service provision.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]12.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; No one service delivery model will fit all circumstances. Decisions about how local services are commissioned should be a matter for individual local authorities to decide. Councils also face challenges in committing resources required to develop new models of service delivery in a time of severe cuts to local government funding. The LGA is supporting councils to explore innovative ways of funding service delivery, for example though social investment. We are working with Social Finance to support those councils interested in developing social impact bonds and other Payment by Results based social investments as part of the Big Lottery Fund’s Commissioning Better Outcomes fund. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;13.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  Mutuals are a good service model when deployed in the right way and the right place by councils that choose to do so. Many councils are looking to deliver services through mutuals, case studies of which are available on the LGA’s website. The LGA supports councils to explore a range of new models of service delivery in a number of ways, including:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0; According to the British Social Attitudes survey 2013, the proportion of people in England who think Scotland gets more than its fair share of public spending has doubled since 2000 to 44%. Data available at http://www.bsa-30.natcen.ac.uk/read-the-report/devolution/introduction.aspx Independent national polling for the LGA shows that 79 per cent of people trust councils to make decisions about the future of local services. Just 11 per cent trust central government to do so.
