[[[Written evidence submitted]]]

[[[ by Jonathan Stanley for the Independent Children’s Homes Association (ICHA). ]]]The ICHA is the largest independent children’s homes membership organisation.  It provides evidence-based and informed policy and practice leadership for the sector.  We wish to ensure the Committee has the evidence and experience that supports the consistent views of providers. Much of what is being taken in the debate as conventional wisdom has not been given rigorous scrutiny.  Sensationalist media interpretation and reporting needs to be set aside in favour of robust analysis of the evidence and to uphold the cardinal principle held by all stakeholders: ‘the right placement at the right time for the right child at the right cost.’I would be happy to give evidence in person to the Committee.

[[[The person making this submission]]]Jonathan Stanley, the Chief Executive Officer of the ICHA, has 40 years of working in residential child care across local authority, voluntary and independent sectors, managing residential and associated integrated provision (education, care, health) for national resources that address the learning, emotional, and social needs of young people. He is Principal Partner of the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care.  He was a member of the work groups for the DfE regarding the reform of residential child care.

[[[Section three - Addressing specific issues and the DfE data pack]]]

[[[Quality of homes – 72% Good or Better – and more to be done]]]http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/official-statistics-childrens-social-care-inspections-and-outcomes  These show 72% of all homes are Good or Better - 16% Outstanding; 56% Good; 24% Adequate; 5% Inadequate

[[[The DfE data pack dispels several myths that have gained credence]]]The Ofsted report, Outstanding Providers, shows larger providers had a higher proportion of ‘Outstanding’ ratings arising from their ability to invest in Quality Assurance.  The same could be offered to others, if commissioning was for more than placements but for support too. 

[[[Age of arrival and length of stay – raising concerns ]]]All data from DfE data pack September 2013Is this the best age to make optimum use of a placement?  Where have they been before?Is a children’s home only for adolescents?  Why is there a wider spread of ages and especially younger ages, in other countries? Yet we know:30. Felt security is found to predict outcomes above stability.  The lived experience of stability, felt security and development of meaningful relationships matter to young people.

[[[Distance as a factor in placement]]]http://www.icha.org.uk/uploads/files/icha_research_review___placement_at_distance__from_home__jan__2012__1.pdf

[[[N.B. The DfE research ‘A long way from home’ of 2012 has not been made public. ]]]31. Some children may need local placements and others more distant ones.  There may well be a ‘correct proportion’ but no one knows what it is and the proportion of local placements needed is certainly not 100%.  The evidence is clear that local placement, as a universal rule, is the wrong conclusion.32. We need to approach placement choice with the sophistication that includes instrumental and expressive (psychological, dynamic) dimensions.  In the main and where there is purpose, children are more able to accept additional, concerned and loving parental figures in their lives, with all the confusion inherent in such situations, than accept the loss of meaningful figures.33. The decision on whether a child should be locally placed has to be a clinical one that takes account of the relationship between child and family, the effect on the child of the local environment, and the purposes and quality of the placement.34. 

[[[ ]]]Simple instrumental factors such as distance between the placement and the child’s home are less important than the relationships among and the aspirations of care-givers in the placements’ (Lost in Care 1985).

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Out Of Authority placements]]]35. Forthcoming research suggests that placements away from home are often made to secure specialist provision for children with complex disabilities or severe mental health issues, or to establish some geographical distance to break patterns of risky behaviour (child sexual exploitation, offending behaviour, gangs and guns). There is nothing to say that being local increases knowledge and intelligence about the quality of homes or the suitability of their location.  Do we know if social work oversight is increased? Family work can be a task given successfully to the very skilled practitioners in this work in children’s homes.  It is not only social workers who can do this task. 36. We need a clear definition of Out Of Authority.  Currently it can mean round the corner or over the road.&#xa0;

[[[Question – are we not at a point where we can say that children’s homes are offering a national service?]]]

[[[Location]]]37. Government figures show that areas with a current density of homes (North West, West Midlands, Kent) have always had more homes.  This arises out of their historical development. 38. The picture is changing.  It will change more quickly if the Government had a national strategy for residential child care.  There are no current DfE proposals for this. 39. The change is complicated by new demands by some local authorities for planning permission for children’s homes.  A recent debate in Parliament recorded that such hurdles are not supported by legislation. 40. Further requirements, such as any bureaucracy surrounding safe area checks, will slow the changes desired by Government.41. There is no direct correlation between location of children's homes and level of deprivation. (page 38)42. The title of page 39, ‘There is a slight skew towards deprived areas in the location of the 1,718 homes by local levels of crime and disorder’ requires more context, as extracted from the source used by DfE The English Indices of Deprivation 2010:https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6320/1870718.pdf43. There is no data presented in the DfE data pack regarding the level of deprivation of local authorities and their use of homes.  Opportunity to do so was possible here and in pages 22 – 41.  This could be an informative study. 

[[[Costs]]]44. The costs reported in the DfE data pack are extrapolations from a limited sample.45. The most accurate costs were collated by the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care and Revolution Consulting, through an FOI to all local authorities.  These figures from 110 local authorities are the best information ever on this sector.Private and voluntary average cost per week is £2,841Local authority average cost per week is £2,49046. Comparative costings of local authority and other homes, is not advisable.  The two cohorts are not comparable, sizes and needs often diverge.  There is also a likely under-costing of local authority homes.  There is a need for a level playing field that can determine one method of calculating costs.September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Kaniuk J, Steele M and Hodges J (2004) Report on a longitudinal research project exploring the development of attachments between older hard-to-place children and their adopters over the first two years of placement.
