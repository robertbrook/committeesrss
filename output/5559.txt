[[[Background]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There is a renewed focus on the risks posed to public health by antimicrobial resistance. The Chief Medical Officer’s 2013 report warned that antimicrobial resistance is a more serious issue than global warming and called for it to be included on the Government’s National Security Risk Assessment. Recently we have also seen the publication of the Government’s Five Year AMR Strategy. This aims to improve knowledge and understanding of AMR, conserve the effectiveness of existing treatments and stimulate the development of new antibiotics.  Although the strategy is welcome, there is still a great deal of work to be done to ensure these ambitious aims are achieved. &#xa0;Since 2007, the NHS has focused on measures to reduce two healthcare associated infections (HCAIs), MRSA blood stream infections (BSIs) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infections, and has implemented strict targets and objectives to help drive down rates. A multi-faceted approach that has included both infection control and antimicrobial prescribing measures has been associated with declining rates of these infections, though the effect of specific interventions remains subject to debate. However, there have been some unintended consequences to these control measures, which require a modified approach to maintain improvements and to address emerging infection and antimicrobial resistance threats. &#xa0;During the period of successful control of MRSA BSIs and C. difficile infections, Gram-negative infections, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) BSIs, have become a greater challenge. Recent Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) figures show that E. coli BSI rates increased by 35% in the last five years, and there were  32,307 mandatory reported cases in England between July 2012 and June 2013.  Consequently, the CMO called for an expansion of the focus on HCAIs to include other significant infections, which could help reduce resistance to critically important antibiotics, including carbapenems.&#xa0;In order to address the need for further improvements, a group of experts in antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infection, supported by Astra Zeneca UK, have come together to consider improvements that can be made. This group of experts

[[[Need for change]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We

[[[ ]]]believe that there is a real need to improve the utility of data available to the NHS and clinicians, so that there is greater understanding of current antibiotic prescribing practice with clearer links to patient outcomes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]We are concerned about perverse antibiotic prescribing behaviours that are being driven by existing MRSA BSI and C. difficile infection objectives/targets.  Whilst avoiding the use of certain antibiotics is sensible in patients at high risk of MRSA or C. difficile infection, antibiotic prescribing has become too concentrated on a limited number of drugs.  There is evidence that such intensive use of few antibiotics, rather than using a wide range of agents, can lead to the emergence of resistance, particularly in problematic Gram-negative pathogens (particularly piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems.)&#xa0;We believe that changing the focus of the current HCAI targets can improve patient care.  The following measures would refine current implicit and explicit restrictions on antimicrobial prescribing.  If supported by high quality data, this would empower specialists to recommend the most appropriate antibiotic for patients at the most appropriate time, while still taking into account HCAI and antimicrobial resistance challenges. &#xa0;We therefore call for three measures to drive high quality antibiotic prescribing, which aim to improve patient outcomes and to protect the efficacy of existing antibiotics:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest public health threats.  A group of experts in antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infection is

[[[ ]]]calling for changes to establish an environment whereby infection specialists can make the best prescribing decisions for patients.  Diverse (but appropriate) antibiotic prescribing can reduce the selection pressure for resistance and can improve outcomes for current and future patients.&#xa0;For further information, please contact Professor Mark Wilcox on mark.wilcox@leedsth.nhs.uk &#xa0; House of Commons Science and Technology Committee,  Uncorrected Transcript Of Oral Evidence from the Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health, HC 921-I, Published 11th February 2013http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmsctech/uc921-i/uc92101.htm  UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013 to 2018, Department of Health, September 2013  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238872/20130902_UK_5_year_AMR_strategy_FINAL.pdf  Health Protection Agency, Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance: 2010-2011, August 2012 http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317136146912  Health Protection Agency, Escherichia coli bacteraemia in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 2007-2011, June 2011 http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317134482059  Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer Volume 2, 2011, Infections and the rise of antimicrobial infections, March 2013https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013
