"&#xa0;\nSubmission from the City Growth Commission (CD02)&#xa0;\nI \nnote with interest \nthe Communities and Local Government Committee’s\n \ninquiry into\n \nf\niscal devolution to cities and city regions.  \nThe City Growth Commission, launched in October 2013, explore\ns\n similar questions. \nThe Commission \nis an independent and \nauthorit\native inquiry into how best to enable our cities to respond to the fiscal and economic challenges of the future\n, in the context of a global trend towards growth driven by mid-tier cities\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Commission will build on the growing consensus in favour of re\nbalancing the economy and dev\nolving more power to our cities\n and\n ask how we can make our cities financially and economically sustainable. It will also ask how growth in other cities can complement London’s economic success and \nlook at \nthe relationship between devolution, reform and growth strategies in London and in our other cities. In particular, the Commission will focus on \nlocal \nlabour market\ns, skills and investment\n, issue\ns\n of critical importance to the future of our economy. \nThe ul\ntimate objective of the Commission is to lay the foundations for a significant shift away from the centre and towards cities, and to show the next Government, of whichever party, why this is needed and how it can be achieved. \n&#xa0;\nThe Commission’s membership \nconsists of:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJim O’Neill, Retiring Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset (Chair)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGreg Clark, Chairman, OECD Forum on Local Development Agencies and Investment Strategies and Global Fellow, Metropolitan Programme at The Brookings Institution   \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiane Coyle OBE, \nChief Executive of Enlightenment Economics and Vice-Chair of the BBC Trust;  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBridget Rosewell OBE, Chair Volterra Economics, former Chief Economist to GLA\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProfessor Tony Travers, Director of British Government at LSE London, professor in the LSE’s Governm\nent Department and Chair of the London Finance Commission  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBruce Katz, Vice President at the Brookings Institution and founding director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeter Vernon MRICS,\n Chief Executive of Grosvenor Britain &amp; Ireland and pr\neviously Partner at IBM Business Consulting Services and PricewaterhouseCoopers\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRohan Silva, Entrepreneur in Residence at Index Ventures and previously Senior Policy Adviser to the Prime Minister \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Van Reenen, Professor of Economics at the London Schoo\nl of Economics and Director of the Centre of Economic Performance  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRachel Lomax, Independent non-executive Director at HSBC and former Deputy Governor, Monetary Stability, at the Bank of England and a member of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBen Lucas, Principal Partner, RSA 2020 Public Services\n&#xa0;\nMike Emmerich, Chief Executive of New Economy Manchester, and Alexandra Jones, Chief Executive of Centre for Cities, are also advising the Commission.\n&#xa0;\nThe Commission’s work programme will run until \nOcto\nber\n 2014 through three main strands: \na call for \nevidence; commissioned research; and high level seminars and roundtables\n.
