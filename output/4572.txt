[[[r for the Local Schools Network]]]The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes?1 Evidence suggests sponsored academies are no better than similar non-academies in raising results (Academies Commission 2013 http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1008038/Unleashing-greatness.pdf ).  Converter academies are mainly schools which were good or outstanding before conversion.  Not all converter academies have maintained this standard post-conversion.  Claims confirming Michael Gove’s assertion that converter academies raise results do not exist (Freedom of Information response https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/statement_by_mr_gove_re_academy ).   The Academies Commission found the claimed advantages of academy conversion were present in non-academies (op cit).2   National Audit Office (2010) found the gap in attainment between disadvantaged pupils and others has grown wider in academies than in comparable maintained schools (http://www.nao.org.uk/report/department-for-education-the-academies-programme/ ).  More recent research comparing academies with non-academies in bands according to level of disadvantage (as measured by % of students on free school meals), finds non-academies out-perform academies in every band.  3 The Academies Commission (op cit) found some academies were using admission criteria to deter pupils who could have a negative impact on league table position.  It found not all academies were committed to social inclusion and warned academisation could have a negative effect on hard-to-place pupils.4 Changing the structure of schools does not transform student outcomes as evidenced above.  However, academies exist and they need regular monitoring.  An Ofsted visit every few years is insufficient to spot any decline in education provision. Local oversight is essential.  The eight Regional Commissioners who are supposed to do this monitoring will not be as effective as day-to-day oversight by local authorities.  The advertisement (TES 6 /12/2013) for these commissioners even suggested they could be part-time positions.  This shows a woeful under-appreciation of the work involved.The process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors5  Recent evidence (eg BAU Foundation/Mentora Academies Trust http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/2013/12/how-did-a-private-turkish-university-and-the-carlyle-group-a-global-asset-management-company-end-up-in-the-mix-to-run-three-rural-schools-in-oxfordshire/ ) suggests approved academy sponsor status is conferred without due diligence.   The rush to find sponsors, encouraged by financial inducements (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors ), appears to take priority over suitability.  There is also growing evidence that some academy trusts are “vehicles” by which shareholders can receive a return on investments in linked for-profit companies (eg Wey Education Schools Trust was set up as a “vehicle” by Zail Enterprises Ltd, a subsidiary of Wey Education PLC.  This is made clear in Wey Education PLC Preliminary Announcement for year ending 31/12/12:  http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=201305310700089451F ).  Again, it appears insufficient attention is paid to discover any potential links with for-profit companies which could pose a conflict of interest.6 The process of academy conversion does not encourage formal consultation with stakeholders until too late in the process.  According to Department for Education rules (http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/academies/b00229234/becoming-an-academy/consultation ), Governing Bodies are supposed to consult informally with stakeholders before making a Resolution to become an academy.   Whether these informal consultations actually happen before Resolutions are passed is unclear.  Formal consultations do not take place until after the Secretary of State has given permission for conversion to go ahead, academy trusts have been established and companies registered with Companies House.   This gives the impression conversion is a done deal.  The Governing Body decides who to consult, how the consultation is done and the timescale.  This suggests Governing Bodies can get away with minimal consultation.7 There should be a statutory requirement for consultations to take place before Resolutions to convert take place.  This requirement should also lay down who is to be consulted, how it is to be done and for how long.8 There is evidence schools are being pressurized into becoming academies. In the debate on forced academy conversion (Hansard 12/3/13 Column 40WH http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm )Rosie Cooper MP described the Schools Commissioner, Dr Liz Sidwell, as “peddling the Education Secretary’s ideological wares as if she was some kind of snake oil saleswoman.”  Downhills School is an infamous example.   An Ofsted monitoring visit to the school, which was in special measures, judged it to be improving.  But the Secretary of State intervened and pronounced it was failing.  Ofsted returned within less than a term with the same lead inspector and overturned its previous judgement.  The school was handed over to Harris against the wishes of the majority of parents.  The career of the head teacher was ruined.  This debacle also brought Ofsted into disrepute.  Such tactics are unacceptable.   9  The duties described in the advertisement  for Regional Commissioners made it clear promoting academy conversion was an important part of the job, if not the primary duty.  Yet, as stated above, there is no evidence changing school structure raises educational standards.  It is not acceptable for taxpayers’ money to be used to promote policies which have no proven benefits and many disadvantages including the possibility of taxpayers’ money being diverted from education into shareholders’ pockets.10 Some local authorities appear to be using the academies programme to drop responsibility for schools apart from statutory requirements.  Lincolnshire acts as a case study. 11 In 2011, Lincolnshire recommended it should “encourage all schools to join a single Trust through CfBT” (Minutes of Extraordinary Meeting of Lincolnshire Children and Young People Scrutiny Committee, 26 July 2011 http://lincolnshire.moderngov.co.uk/Data/Children%20and%20Young%20People%20Scrutiny%20Committee/20110726/Agenda/Document%201.pdf ).  CfBT ran Lincolnshire’s School Improvement Service and its Director, Andy Breckon, was also Assistant Director of Children's Services.  This gave rise to accusations of conflict of interest which the Council denied (https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/84863/response/214163/attach/9/SKMBT%20C55211092209341.pdf ).12 Lincolnshire’s decision to encourage academy conversion was motivated by the estimated negative impact of academisation on its budget for Children’s Services which would present Lincolnshire with “challenges in terms of retaining its existing school support service provision and supporting its most vulnerable schools” (Minutes op cit).   The answer to the problem, then, seemed to lie in passing this responsibility to schools themselves.13 Lincolnshire County Council may have come to regret its decision.   It belatedly realised it was becoming difficult, if not impossible, to regulate school place supply when West Grantham Academies Trust decided without consultation to close Charles Read Academy against the wishes of parents, pupils and the Council (http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/education/education-news/school-closure-decision-under-fire-from-council-1-4747377 ).  The academy was only saved by the Department for Education handing it over to another academy trust (http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/education/education-news/charles-read-academy-saved-from-closure-by-trust-1-5181862 ).14 This case study shows the academy conversion programme can encourage local authorities to avoid all but statutory duties to schools, can encourage schools to join academy chains which may not be in the best interests of pupils nor value-for-money and makes it difficult for local authorities to manage the supply of school places.  Local authorities can no longer commission their own schools – there is a presumption that new schools will be academies or free schools.  Yet the National Audit Office 2013 (http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10314-001-Free-Schools-Book-Copy.pdf ) found half of areas where the need for extra school places was high or severe received no applications from free school proposers.   Local authorities have to tout around for chains or sponsors to set up schools when new provision is required.The role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands15 In the event of an Academy failing, the Department for Education allocates a new sponsor to take over the particular institution.  The same is true if an academy chain wants to close an academy.    The choice of sponsor/academy chain would not be a Local Authority decision but would be imposed by the Department for Education.  It appears, then, academies are in the gift of the Secretary of State.  This can pave the way for future take-over by for-profit education providers to run English academies.16 The Regional Commissioners being recruited are supposed to authorise new sponsors.  It’s unclear by what criteria the Commissioner will judge prospective sponsors.   Neither is it clear how the Commissioners, especially those working part-time, will be able to adequately support and intervene failing academies over a much wider area than any local authority.  Local authorities are much better placed to support and challenge local schools than remote bodies.The functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level17 Local authorities should be the “middle tier” between the Secretary of State and individual schools.  They have local knowledge.  Their responsibilities should be towards all the area’s schools whatever their structure: to promote co-operation between schools; to ensure individual schools do not act in their own interests to the detriment of other schools and particular children; to monitor schools admission criteria to ensure they adhere to the Schools Admission  Code; to intervene and support struggling schools; to ensure academy chains are not using their monopoly to impose particular methods or resources on their academies and denying heads the freedom they had when they were local authority schools, and to have access to the financial records of academies to ensure there is no misuse of public funds (eg Priory Federation  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/media-statement-in-relation-to-the-priory-federation-of-academies-trust ) or nepotism (eg Kings Science Academy http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/i/kings%20science%20academy%20investigation%20report.pdf ).18

[[[authorities]]]

[[[ have three roles: organizing partnerships; commissioning services, and championing pupils, parents and communities.]]]What role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements19 Early academy chains (Harris, ARK) were sponsors which offered support, expertise and financial help to their academies.  The need to provide financial backing has gone – the National Audit Office 2010 (op cit) found a “significant proportion” of pledges had not been honoured in any case.  The National Audit Office also expressed concern about conflicts of interest between academies and sponsors when the latter exerted pressure on academies to purchase services from them.20 This conflict of interest has become more of an issue as academy chains increasingly supply back-office services once provided by local authorities.  Academies are tied into contracts with their chains which may not be the best value-for-money or of appropriate standard.  This is exacerbated when chains impose resources, curricula and methods of working on to their academies.  This reduces the autonomy of heads – the Academies Commission (op cit) heard evidence from some heads of academies in chains that they had less freedom than when they were local authority maintained.  21 Worse, the provision of centralised curricula by a chain risks poor quality materials or methods:  two of the four academies sponsored by Learning Schools Trust, the charitable arm of Kunskapsskolan, the Swedish for-profit education provider, were judged Requires Improvement in Autumn 2013, and a third was judged Inadequate.   Kunskapsskolan schools all follow the “KED education programme” developed by Kunskapsskolan for individual learning.  Ofsted criticised the teaching materials for being pitched incorrectly.22 Peje Emilsson, chair of Kunskapsskolan, has global ambitions. Another of his firms, Magnora (http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6305024 ), has set up a school in Delhi which it hopes will be the start of a school chain on the sub-continent.  Indian teachers will be trained in “KED pedagogies”.  Emilson spoke to the US-based, libertarian think-tank, the Cato Institute, in 2011 (http://www.cato.org/multimedia/cato-video/peje-emilsson-discusses-how-scale-good-schools ), where he said his firm could increase test results at a 20% cheaper cost.  In the UK, he said, he had told his “Conservative friends” he could do it even more cheaply. 23 But cheaply doesn’t always mean adequate.  And education is not just about test results: the OECD warned two years ago there was already an excessive emphasis on test results in England which risked negative consequences (Economic Survey UK 2011).24 Kunskapsskolan is not the only firm supplying materials.  The Aspirations Academies Trust operates in association with the Quaglia Institute for Student Aspirations (QISA) and Aspirations Unlimited International (AUI) (http://www.spacestudiobanbury.org/266/who-is-the-aspirations-academies-trust  ).  The US-based QISA and AUI organisations “offer significant support by providing aspirations research, materials, surveys, and consultation support.”  AUI is a for-profit provider of “dynamic assessment tools to assist schools and universities with collecting and analyzing student perspective”.   AUI entered into partnership with global education company, Pearson, in 2008 (http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Pearson+Announces+Partnership+With+Aspirations+Unlimited.-a0180734924 ).  Qisa’s products and surveys are distributed by Pearson including the My Voice survey (http://myvoice.pearsonfoundation.org/ ) which Ofsted found was being used in Aspirations sponsored Rivers Academy.  Such links between Trusts and publishers of educational materials provide a steady, profitable outlet for the publishers’ products but would prevent heads purchasing other materials which they felt more appropriate.24 Similarly, the Aurora Academies Trust paid £100,000 a year to its American parent, Mosaica Education Inc (http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/18/academy-pays-for-us-curriculum ), for its schools to use its patented curriculum.  Ofsted criticised the curriculum which is mandatory in schools sponsored by Aurora.  Again, this reduces the power of heads to decide curricula and locks schools into contracts to purchase unsuitable materials.25 Local authorities do not impose uniformity on schools.  But many academy chains have corporate images which promote the chain’s “brand”:  Harris schools all bear the name of the Harris chain; most Greenwood Dale secondary academies have the same website format which makes them almost indistinguishable (http://www.greenwoodacademies.org/our-academies/ ).  Future Academies, set up by schools minister Lord Nash, has links with the Curriculum Centre which publishes the US “Core Knowledge” curriculum developed in the 1990s by E D Hirsch. It was adapted for the UK by the short-lived head of Future Academies Pimlico Primary Free School, Annaliese Briggs (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24466928 ), and published by Civitas.  It is promoted by schools minister Liz Truss (https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-on-the-national-curriculum-to-the-fellowship-commission )and admired by the Secretary of State.  Three of the four primary schools in Pimlico are Future Academies schools (http://www.westendextra.com/news/2013/oct/facing-facts-teaching-fears-pimlico-primary-school-parents-%E2%80%98left-very-little-choice%E2%80%99 ).  There is little choice for Pimlico parents who would prefer a different curriculum or for heads who wish to devise their own.26 Future Academies raises several questions: whether there is a conflict of interest when a minister is so closely connected to an academy chain and whether it is appropriate for other schools ministers to promote materials associated with that chain.27 Recent events at Al-Madinah free school, the Kings Science Academy and Discovery New School raise questions about governance and whether such groups are given too much freedom to decide how to spend taxpayers’ money.  It is unlikely the eight Regional Commissioners will be able to adequately scrutinize the governance and financial affairs of academies and free schools.  This role could be delegated to local authorities.The appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply; and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole28 Primary schools have been reluctant to convert for good reasons.  They are too small to go-it-alone as they lack the resources of larger secondary schools to hire business managers and the like.  That means they are likely to be forced to join chains which could result in loss of freedom as described above.  Primary schools value the support that local authorities offer.  Small rural schools are threatened by academy conversion for two reasons: they are too small to operate as stand-alone operations and they could be seen as too expensive or unprofitable for take-over by an academy chain.29 There is increasing evidence that primary schools which are their own admission authorities, which includes academies, are changing their admission criteria to give priority to pupils already attending attached nurseries.  The School’s Adjudicator has ruled this does not adhere to the Schools Admission Code and has upheld all complaints about primary schools behaving in this way.  However, a school could get away with such procedures unless someone complains.  There is a role for local authorities in ensuring the admission criteria for all schools in its area adhere to the Code.30 Academy status does not bring value for money.  £1b has already been overspent on the programme but academy status alone does not raise results.  Where schools have improved it is because of initiatives such as London Challenge or because schools demonstrate the qualities Ofsted identified as being present in good or outstanding schools.  These qualities did not include academy status.  When schools “compete”, as they are expected to do, money is likely to be diverted from education to marketing.  CHAT, for example, employs a marketing manager (http://www.chat-edu.org.uk/press-enquiries ).  32 There is also the problem outlined above: schools will be required to purchase services, resources or materials from their academy chain which might not represent value-for-money and, in the worst cases, are substandard.What alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools?33 It is not clear that all primary schools identified as “failing” are failing.   Results at Downhills were improving and had exceeded the benchmark.34 That said, if primary schools are struggling then they should be given the option of remaining with their local authority especially where the authority has been supporting the school.  Ofsted, before it changed its mind, said Downhills’ improvement was down to the head and local authority support.  35 This suggests that the imperative to get as many primary schools converted to academies is taking precedence over other factors including parental wishes and council support.  December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
