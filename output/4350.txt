&#xa0;Written evidence from John Davison (CYS0096)

[[[Improving cycle safety]]]I am a life member of the Cyclists’ Touring Club.  I have been cycle commuting in Greater Manchester for about 20 years, averaging 60 – 70 miles per week. &#xa0;I would like to see more segregated cycle lanes, of a generous size such as found in Trafford Park. Not a bit of the road coloured different – that cars park in, forcing cyclists back into the stream of traffic. Pinch points on the road, where the road suddenly narrows, puts me at greater risk from motorists – cars and cyclists are forced closer together, and car drivers don’t like slowing down.  &#xa0;The key issue for me is for cyclists to have more rights, for example greater legal protection – in exchange for more responsibility required of cyclists. I wonder about a tax disc for cyclists. This would counter the (misleading) claim that motorists have more of a right to the road because of their disc. I wonder about compulsory cycle insurance – like car insurance.Finally, I wonder about a cycle registration plate – like a car. I hope the above is helpful. December 2013&#xa0;
