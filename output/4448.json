"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Forum of Insurance Lawyers (FOIL) (MI0016)\n&#xa0;FOIL (The Forum of Insurance Lawyers) exists to provide a forum for communication and the exchange of information between lawyers acting predominantly or exclusively for insurance clients (except legal expenses insurers) within firms of solicitors, as barriste\nrs, or as in-house lawyers for insurers or self-insurers. FOIL is an active lobbying organisation on matters concerning insurance litigation. \n&#xa0;\nFOIL represents over 8\n000 members. It is the only organisation which represents solicitors who act for defendant\ns in civil proceedings.\n&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\nAn accreditation scheme for expert witnesses&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The cost of medical reports&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe judicial response to fraudulent claims&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFurther reforms&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is already recognised, by a ban on the practice by CMCs, that it is undesirable for potential claimants to be offered an\n immediate inducement to bring a claim. Inevitably some claimants will be encouraged to make a fraudulent claim by the promise of an immediate benefit, before they have had a chance to think through the consequences of such a step. FOIL believes that the b\nan should be extended to law firms to completely outlaw this practice. \n&#xa0;\nWhen asked during the course of giving oral evidence to the Committee, what compensation would be appropriate for a whiplash injury, James Dalton\n from the ABI replied that it was “\nwhatever society determines is the right amount which will then be built into insurance premiums\n”. FOIL would suggest that, bearing in mind the heavy burden claims place on motorists and the current concerns ove\nr the high cost of living, \nsociety may reasonably consider that the current level of compensation for whiplash claims is adequate. Without intervention the level of damages\n set out in the Judicial College\n Guidelines\n \nwill contin\nu\ne to rise. \nFOIL \nwould sugges\nt that steps should be taken to ensure that, \nfor a\n period, damages \nin low value RTA claims \nshould not rise further. \n This is a matter which ultimately will need to be considered by the judiciary but FOIL would welcome the Committee’s examination of the iss\nue. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;\n"
