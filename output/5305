[normal]Submission from Unlock Democracy[bold]* [bold](Merseyside &amp; West Cheshire) (FDC 35)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Unlock Democracy
[normal]* 
[normal](Merseyside &amp; West Cheshire) welcomes any movement towards more open and accountable strategic political leadership for the 
[normal]proposed[bold] Liverpool City Region (LCR). Our City Region is emerging as an economic, social and cultural entity, a political reality. But we contend that its governance structures have failed to keep pace. We agree that the current arrangements are weak and lack tran
[normal]sparency. Reform is to be welcomed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the DCLG consultation document on the proposed LCR
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/consultati
[normal]ons/proposal-to-establish-a-combined-authority-for-greater-merseyside
[normal]we contend that
[normal] 
[normal]the arrangements for scrutiny are too vague. In the Annex paragraph 24 (Scrutiny Arrangements) it states that the Combined Authority 
[normal]may [bold]establish joint overview and s
[normal]crutiny arrangements. Further in the Draft Statutory Instrument: 
[normal]Committees [bold]4- (1) The Combined Authority 
[normal]may appoint[bold] one or more committees as an overview and scrutiny committee
[normal]…
[normal] We propose that the wording be amended to 
[normal]shall appoint[bold]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 
[normal]the LCRCA docu
[normal]ment "
[normal]Outline of the potential role of a LCRCA", [bold]the 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]Scrutiny Arrangements paragraph 9
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]are at the top of page 15. Please see below in bold a link to the document
[normal] “Proposal for the [bold]organisation[bold] of Scrutiny".[bold] The DCLG received this document when the
[normal] six authorities in the LCRCA submitted their proposal
[normal].
[normal] We regard this to be a very good 
[normal]four page 
[normal]document, on the second page of which we draw your attention to paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 
[normal]“Structures and Processes of Scrutiny at the City Region Level”[bold]. 
[normal]Proposal fo[bold]r[bold] the [bold]organisatio[bold]n[bold] of Scrutiny[bold]The composition of the scrutiny panel, however, could be overwhelmingly dominated by one political party. W
[normal]e are ke
[normal]en, therefore, to see that the scrutiny structure for the proposed "City Region Cabinet" includes 
[normal]a specific guarantee of representation for opposition voices[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]This safeguard is especially important when, as is the case at the moment, the political leaders
[normal] of the six authorities (the LCR Cabinet members) might be drawn from the same political party. In this regard, 
[normal]on the third page of the document 
[normal]“Proposal for the [bold]organisation[bold] of Scrutiny"[bold], there is sub paragraph 3.2 (ii) 
[normal]"Cross Party[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Representation"[bold], whi
[normal]ch addresses this issue of 
[normal]representation for opposition voices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]O
[normal]ur vision is one of a more democratic Local Governance model, with the necessary provision of checks and balances, scrutiny and transparency. That is
[normal]:
[normal] a Liverpool City Regional Mayor, with
[normal] a system of representation similar to that implemented in London, i.e. the existing six Local Councils, a Liverpool City Regional Assembly 
[normal](
[normal]similar to that of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the Merseyside County Council, which was abolished in 1986
[normal])
[normal], all of these would preferably be el
[normal]ected with a proportional electoral system, as adopted in Scottish Local Government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The group would be pleased to respond to any questions and would welcome any opportunity to elaborate on these points.
