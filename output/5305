defaultUnlock Democracy
default* 
default(Merseyside &amp; West Cheshire) welcomes any movement towards more open and accountable strategic political leadership for the 
defaultproposeddefault Liverpool City Region (LCR). Our City Region is emerging as an economic, social and cultural entity, a political reality. But we contend that its governance structures have failed to keep pace. We agree that the current arrangements are weak and lack tran
defaultsparency. Reform is to be welcomed.

defaulthttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultati
defaultons/proposal-to-establish-a-combined-authority-for-greater-merseyside
defaultwe contend that
default 
defaultthe arrangements for scrutiny are too vague. In the Annex paragraph 24 (Scrutiny Arrangements) it states that the Combined Authority 
defaultmay defaultestablish joint overview and s
defaultcrutiny arrangements. Further in the Draft Statutory Instrument: 
defaultCommittees default4- (1) The Combined Authority 
defaultmay appointdefault one or more committees as an overview and scrutiny committee
default…
default We propose that the wording be amended to

default “Proposal for the defaultorganisationdefault of Scrutiny".default The DCLG received this document when the
default six authorities in the LCRCA submitted their proposal
default.
default We regard this to be a very good

default“Structures and Processes of Scrutiny at the City Region Level”default. 
defaultProposal fodefaultrdefault the defaultorganisatiodefaultndefault of ScrutinydefaultThe composition of the scrutiny panel, however, could be overwhelmingly dominated by one political party. W
defaulte are ke
defaulten, therefore, to see that the scrutiny structure for the proposed "City Region Cabinet" includes 
defaulta specific guarantee of representation for opposition voicesdefault.
default 
defaultThis safeguard is especially important when, as is the case at the moment, the political leaders
default of the six authorities (the LCR Cabinet members) might be drawn from the same political party. In this regard, 
defaulton the third page of the document 
default“Proposal for the defaultorganisationdefault of Scrutiny"default, there is sub paragraph 3.2 (ii) 
default"Cross Partydefault&#xa0;defaultRepresentation"default, whi
defaultch addresses this issue of 
defaultrepresentation for opposition voices.
default&#xa0;
defaultO
defaultur vision is one of a more democratic Local Governance model, with the necessary provision of checks and balances, scrutiny and transparency. That is
default:
default a Liverpool City Regional Mayor, with
default a system of representation similar to that implemented in London, i.e. the existing six Local Councils, a Liverpool City Regional Assembly 
default(
defaultsimilar to that of
default&#xa0;
defaultthe Merseyside County Council, which was abolished in 1986
default)
default, all of these would preferably be el
defaultected with a proportional electoral system, as adopted in Scottish Local Government.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe group would be pleased to respond to any questions and would welcome any opportunity to elaborate on these points.
