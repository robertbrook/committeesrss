"BRC17\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI am submitting this evidence from a personal viewpoint of the owner of a small electrical company de\naling primarily on a day to day business with domestic electrical installation.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpecifically I would like to deal with the points of concern the Committee have expressed an interest in.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“The extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations.”&#xa0;The public\n have\n some awareness of The Competent Persons Scheme, but as very little enforcement takes place, I have found that most members of the public see it as a paperwork exercise rather than a legal requirement. In summary, they simply do not take it a\ns a\n serious pi\nece of legislation, and are unlikely to until the scheme is enforced and publicised more widely.\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“The extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills.”&#xa0;“The extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations.”&#xa0;“The adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons.”&#xa0;If requirements for membership to Competent Perso\nns Scheme beco\nme too onerous, complicated and above all expensive, s\nmall local companies like my own\n will simply be driven out of business. I had to prove competence upon original registration and am checked yearly\n on quality management, knowledge and competence. This i\ns way above the requirements of\n other construction trades\n and demonstrates the high le\nvel of competence required\n.  A\ndding further costs \nand administration \nnot only \ndisproportionately \nburdens small businesses, but \nthe cost will ultimately be passed onto customers.\n I\n see no real evidence\n to change the current scheme\n, as the membership require\nment is already set at a high level compared to other trades.\n Indeed, the “communities” aspect of DCLG simply becomes meaningless if local communities lose \nsmall local companies due to excessive and burdensome regulation issued by DCLG.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“The effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work.”&#xa0;Compe\nti\ntion between accreditation bodies is no bad thing as it allows electricians to make a choice between \nbodies\n,\n and choose the one they feel provides them with the best value and support for their particular aspect of the \nelectrical \ntrade.\nThere should be no ambiguity between standards of review if all bodies meet UKAS requirements.\nWhat is wrong\n with \nthe \ncu\nrrent situation is the existence of two registers which is only going to confuse the public. There should be one register for all \nmembers of \ncompetent \npersons schemes. If certain accreditation bodies do not want to “join in” with the establishment of a sin\ngle register then they should be removed from accreditation scheme.\n This is a simple fix to a currently confusing situation for members of the general public.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“The adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes.”I can see no problems \nwith the supervision of the accreditation schemes. The current problem is the lack of enforcement of the current rules by Local Authority Building Control departments\n (LABC’s)\n.\n Whilst these departments have a clear overview of \nnew build projects, they have\n little\n oversight of what work is being carried out within existing dwellings; and this is where the majority of “under the radar / cash in hand / non Part P compliant work” is being carried out.\n LABC departments should be carrying out spot checks on refur\nbishments of existing dwellings to ensure compliance with the current rules \nis\n being adhered to, and taking action against those found to be avoiding compliance.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
