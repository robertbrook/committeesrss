[[[(CRJ 11)]]]The present inquiry seeks ‘to explore how the role of the judiciary would change were the UK to move towards a codified constitution, and the challenges that this changed role would present’.&#xa0; This paper contains some brief answers to the broad questions posed by the Committee, and it does not attempt to explore all the implications of those questions.                The primary role of the judiciary is to uphold the principle of civil and criminal justice and the rule of law by deciding the cases that come before courts and tribunals, resolving disputes over issues of law and (subject to the role of the jury in criminal cases) issues of fact, and sentencing those convicted of criminal offences.  This role is exercised subject to the supreme power of the Westminster Parliament to legislate for the UK.  As well as interpreting legislation by Parliament, the courts apply and as necessary develop rules that derive from the common law.  The role of the judiciary includes power to review the legality of acts of ministers, civil servants, the armed forces and other public bodies: the procedure of judicial review is a primary means by which the courts ensure that government is conducted according to law.  The independence of the judiciary has been a vital constitutional element since at least 1700.                 Because of British involvement in Europe, decisions by UK courts are now subject to review or oversight by the Court of Justice at Luxembourg and the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. The continued existence of an independent judiciary is a pre-requisite in these areas of European law.              The creation of devolved legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has added ‘devolution issues’ to the jurisdiction of the courts.              The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) altered the traditional role of the courts by requiring them ‘where possible’ to interpret legislation in a manner that is compatible with rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.  Where this is not possible, the higher courts may declare that a statutory provision is incompatible with a Convention right.  Even if the courts make a ‘declaration of incompatibility’, the statute remains in force; but the HRA provides special machinery for enabling the incompatibility to be removed by the government, acting with the approval of Parliament.

[[[move towards]]]

[[[ a written constitution?]]]The answer must depend on the extent of movement towards a written constitution and on the nature of the constitution to be adopted. A.               The existing role of the courts need not change merely because a written or codified constitution is adopted.   The most limited form of such a constitution would simply aim to reproduce the existing pattern of relationships between government, Parliament and the courts; Parliament would retain unlimited power to legislate for the UK, the courts would not have power to review the validity of legislation, and no special process would be required should Parliament wish to make constitutional changes.   The codified constitution would thus lack any special status to distinguish it from other Acts of Parliament.              An obvious comment on this limited goal is to ask whether it would be worth achieving.   Moreover, if the written text were to include areas of government that are now subject to unwritten constitutional conventions, existence of the text might well give rise to new questions for the courts.  At present, a court may reject a claim based on a convention by saying that the convention is not law.  If the constitution were to write down all or some of the conventions (e g as to the conduct of ministers), it would be more difficult for the court to refuse to intervene if there were grounds for saying that the rule in the constitution had been breached.    It would be possible, but not wholly satisfactory, for the constitutional text to guard against this by providing that certain parts of the constitution were not to be interpreted or enforced by the courts.B.              At the other extreme, the written constitution might be granted the legal status that it has in countries where the constitution is ‘fundamental’ (or supreme) law and the powers of all state institutions are said to derive from it.   See the US Constitution, Article VI (2):               “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in               pursuance therefore … shall be the supreme law of the land.” A recent example is in the South African Constitution of 1996, section 2:               “This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct               inconsistent with it is invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be               fulfilled”.   In Marbury v Madison (1803), the US Supreme Court decided that laws made by Congress must conform with the Constitution, and could be quashed if they were contrary to it.  The supremacy clause in South Africa provides explicitly that laws inconsistent with the Constitution are invalid.                Where a constitution contains a supremacy clause, it is now to be expected that the courts (or possibly a Constitutional Court) would acquire the role of enforcing the constitution, since anything contrary to the constitution would be unlawful.   So the courts, as ‘guardians of the constitution’, would have power to review the constitutionality of acts of the legislature and the executive.                 To what matters would the power to review apply?  This would depend on whether the constitution included features such as protection for fundamental rights and liberties, a formal separation of powers, a federal structure, the incorporation of international and European law etc.  All such provisions would limit the legislative authority of Parliament.  (The constitution would also be likely to include provisions requiring Parliament to make laws on stated topics – for instance, the conduct of elections.) It would necessarily follow that Parliament would be unable to amend the constitution by ordinary legislation: the amendment process would be set out in the constitution, and might require, for instance, special majorities in Parliament, endorsement by a referendum etc.              One issue to be addressed is whether decisions of the Supreme Court (or Constitutional Court) interpreting the constitution should be final, subject only to constitutional amendment, or whether a way might be found of enabling the wishes of Parliament to prevail over the Supreme Court’s decision.  On certain matters, for instance, the Canadian constitution provides for there to be ‘express legislative over-ride’. It is arguable that weaker forms of judicial review, especially as regards social and economic rights, are more acceptable on democratic grounds than the strong form of judicial review, in which a constitutional amendment is required to overcome a Supreme Court decision.  (See: M Tushnet, Weak Courts, Strong Rights: Judicial Review and Social Welfare Rights in Comparative Constitutional Law (2008) and S Gardbaum, The New Commonwealth Model of Constitutionalism: Theory and Practice (2013)).  For the latter author, the HRA technique of a ‘declaration of incompatibility’ provides a weaker form of judicial review but one that may be defended.               We may conclude that (except in the unlikely case of a ‘no change’ constitution) the role of the judiciary would be extended on the adoption of a written constitution: the nature and extent of that change would depend on the contents of the constitution.              The main responsibility for all legislation is a matter for the government and Parliament.  I do not consider that the judiciary should be consulted on whether there should be a written constitution, nor on what it should contain.  The political neutrality of the judiciary means that, for instance, judges in Scotland should stay out of the current independence debate. My advice would be different when the general structure of a new constitution had been settled through the political process, and a subsidiary question arose of fitting the existing judiciary within that structure.  Plainly the judges would protest if, for instance, a new constitution were to erode their independence or to diminish their existing role, for instance by taking away the power of courts to interpret legislation or the sentencing of criminals.  But for purposes of the present discussion, enactment of a codified constitution would add new jurisdiction to the courts, and would not take away existing jurisdiction.                Since a codified constitution may take many forms, no simple answer is possible.  However, if the courts are to have power to hold an Act of Parliament unconstitutional, then, on the basis that the constitution is fundamental law, it would follow that they should have power to quash the offending provision by making a declaration of invalidity with immediate effect.  A much lesser power, and one that would need to be spelled out in the constitution, would be power to issue a declaration of incompatibility on the lines of that under the HRA, s 4.

[[[  ]]]              Beyond this, it might be desirable for the constitution to include provision on such matters as - which court or courts (all, or only some?) would have the new power; whether prescribed procedure would need to be followed before the power was exercised (for instance, by requiring the Law Officers to be informed); whether there would be rules about who would have standing to apply for an Act to be reviewed, whether any time limits would apply; whether provision should be made for issues of urgency; and whether a court should have power to postpone the quashing of an unconstitutional statute to enable Parliament to make acceptable legislation in its place.

[[[What would be the implications of these powers on existing constitutional doctrines, including parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ ]]]              To confer these powers on the courts would be to supersede the legislative sovereignty of Parliament with a different doctrine; the extent of the new doctrine would depend on the various limits that the constitution imposed on the legislature.  Judicial review as it now exists (in administrative law and under the HRA) would not necessarily be affected.  Ministerial responsibility to Parliament would not directly be affected, but the government would have to take constitutional limitations into account in proposing new legislation.

[[[In the context of question 3, what can we learn from the interaction between the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[ courts and the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights?]]]              The conferment of power to hold an Act of Parliament to be unconstitutional might mean that cases that now go to the two European courts could be decided by the UK courts.  This would depend to an extent on the provision made in the constitution for EU law and the ECHR. At present, UK courts are required by EU law to give direct effect to rights under EU law, even in the face of a UK statute.  The position is different as regards the ECHR, application of which depends on the Convention itself and the Human Rights Act   The courts in the UK are already conversant with EU law and with decisions of the Strasbourg court.              Apart from the position under the devolution Acts, UK courts and legislators have no experience of prior review of proposed legislation.  One disadvantage is that political opponents of a Bill may turn their opposition into a legal attack on the Bill, by seeking political support from the courts.  Prospective review of this kind is necessarily abstract, and the common law tradition has had little experience of it.  In some contexts, for example if the constitution were to establish a formal system of federalism, it might be appropriate for a question as to the power of a legislature to deal with a particular subject to be resolved before a Bill is enacted.  But a key question is whether prior review would bar review taking place in a concrete case when the legislation has been implemented.  It would not be acceptable for cases involving fundamental rights to be conclusively decided while a Bill was before Parliament, as this could mean that an individual would be unable to challenge action taken in a way or for purposes that had not been foreseen at the earlier stage of abstract review.              In many countries, including Germany and South Africa, a separate Constitutional Court exists.  This court is likely to be the exclusive arbiter of disputes about the constitution, so that other courts may not deal with such questions, and must refer them to the Constitutional Court. The creation of such a  court would be justified only if, for whatever reasons, judges sitting in the ordinary courts were thought to be unsuitable for, or incapable of, deciding constitutional questions.  One reason in many European countries for creating a Constitutional Court is the desire to include in a ‘mixed’ court those with experience of politics and government, and this is unlikely to suit a legal system based on the common law. If senior politicians, retired civil servants, respected professors, high ranking army officers and diplomats etc are to serve on such a court, in addition to professional judges, a separate appointment procedure would be needed, and the political parties would have to agree on means for securing a balanced court. This is indeed a wide question.  I have drawn attention in answering question 1 to various forms of judicial review of legislation.  There is a huge literature about the wisdom within a democracy of subjecting questions that are essentially political in character to a framework in which the decisions are made by judges.  The model of the US Constitution (one of ‘strong judicial review’) is not the only one on offer in comparative terms.  25 November 2013&#xa0;               Emeritus Professor of Constitutional Law, University of Edinburgh; research fellow, Institute of European and Comparative Law, University of Oxford; formerly in practice as a barrister, specialising in public law; legal adviser to the House of Lords Committee on the Constitution (2002-5); a vice-president of the International Association of Constitutional Law, 2004-7; author (with K D Ewing) of Constitutional and Administrative Law (15th edn, 2010) and editor (with M Janis and R Kay) of European Human Rights Law: text and materials (3rd edn, 2008).
